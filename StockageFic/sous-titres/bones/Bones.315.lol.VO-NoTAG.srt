1
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:07,917
Booth, you're going to be fine.

2
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:09,921
Really. Come on.

3
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:11,548
Come on, Booth.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,850
It's gonna be fine. Come on Booth.

5
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,327
Come on, Booth. No...

6
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:18,439
Oh, come on...

7
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,558
The carbon isotopic
composition of the collagen

8
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,835
shows a value of minus 16%.

9
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:28,153
Supporting the theory that the deceased
was born in Provence, France.

10
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:29,356
In the 16th century.

11
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:30,866
It's time, Dr. Brennan.

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,196
The metacarpophalangeal joints
are smooth, showing dexterity.

13
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:37,699
- Perhaps a musician.
- That's enough. We're going now.

14
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,827
I have remains to identify.
He could have a family.

15
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:42,930
He's 500 years old.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,413
- They've probably adjusted by now.
- I'm not going.

17
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:47,170
I've already made that clear.

18
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:51,597
It's Agent Booth's funeral, Dr. Brennan.
Losing a loved one is...

19
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,643
A partner, Sweets. I lost a partner.

20
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,509
Someone close to you.

21
00:00:57,507 --> 00:01:00,430
The funeral allows you to grieve,
so you can come to terms with his death.

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,058
The Arunta Aboriginal tribe in Australia

23
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:06,186
grieves by burning down their village
and moving to a new one.

24
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,048
That seems no crazier to me than
gathering around a hole in the ground.

25
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,149
- Being hostile won't...
- Brennan, a word.

26
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,824
Excuse me. Professional psychologist.

27
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,632
Look.

28
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:19,866
I know how you see things,
and I respect that.

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,190
But,

30
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,286
I need to ask you a favor.

31
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:27,926
I have to go to the funeral.

32
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,336
I'm not going to be able to
get through this alone.

33
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,655
I've been crying for, like, days.

34
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:36,776
I really need your shoulder here.

35
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:41,387
I need my best friend.

36
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:48,591
I knew Seeley Booth.

37
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:52,851
He was a good man who earned
my respect and affection.

38
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:54,720
And I don't like many people.

39
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,914
Booth had a selfless
commitment to his work,

40
00:01:58,214 --> 00:02:01,322
first in the military and then the FBI.

41
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:05,245
Two weeks ago,
he made the ultimate sacrifice,

42
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,831
giving his life to save his partner.

43
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,541
And, in that brave act,

44
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:14,217
he showed us
what greatness we are all capable of.

45
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:17,251
That woman was aiming at me.
I would have happily taken that bullet.

46
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,460
I know.

47
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:20,684
May God's mercy

48
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,551
and love shine on Seeley Booth

49
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,307
as he takes his place beside the Lord.

50
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:29,182
If there were a merciful God,
why wouldn't He have saved Booth?

51
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,444
Stand by. Port

52
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,050
arms!

53
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,110
At ease!

54
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:46,434
Port!

55
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:48,455
Aim!

56
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,419
Excuse me.

57
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:55,481
Hey!

58
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,448
What the hell is going on?!

59
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,719
They appear to be fighting.

60
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,403
Bones. Nice shot.

61
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:22,565
What?

62
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:40,184
After I got shot, the Bureau faked my
death so I could finally get that guy.

63
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,721
- I don't care.
- Look, I drove him underground.

64
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:45,829
He said that the only way we would ever
see him again is at my funeral, so...

65
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,378
- I don't care.
- Who is he?

66
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,572
What part of national security
don't you understand, Hodgins?

67
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:51,741
National security.

68
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,062
Catchall phrase for,
"We can do anything we want."

69
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,140
I knew I shouldn't have
gone to that funeral.

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,965
It was a waste of time,
just like I said.

71
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:00,301
Wait. You thought that
my funeral was a waste of time?

72
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:01,820
It was a lovely service, Booth.

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,299
Thank you. You know, I expected
to see more people though.

74
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,866
I always imagined
a lot of ex-girlfriends crying.

75
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:09,418
- Yeah. Me, too.
- You guys are pathetic.

76
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,579
Just know I won't be
attending your next funeral.

77
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,343
I'm telling you, you were supposed
to know that I wasn't really dead.

78
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,440
I swear! That's why
I thought you weren't crying.

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,710
Informed by who?

80
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,089
I gave a list of people to the Bureau
to inform that I was not really dead.

81
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,091
If they didn't tell you,
it's not my fault.

82
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,156
Dr. Brennan is actually upset because
she had to face strong emotions

83
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,588
that she'd rather deny.

84
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,531
Striking Agent Booth indicated
the depth of your feelings for him.

85
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:31,891
It was a passionate act.

86
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,757
- Thank you. Did you hear that? Passion.
- Yes. Passion, because

87
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:35,941
anger is a passion.

88
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:37,600
Anger at being manipulated.

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,232
- Dr. Brennan.
- Forget it.

90
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,067
Someone left a package for you.

91
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,996
It's a mandible.

92
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,536
Look at that, huh?

93
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,376
Two silver screws.

94
00:04:58,636 --> 00:04:59,961
Silver screws as in...

95
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,421
Silver Skeleton?

96
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:02,463
As in...

97
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,299
- Gormogon?
- That's speculation.

98
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:09,387
- Tooth marks.
- Someone's been snacking on that.

99
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,181
Snacking as in cannibalism?

100
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,507
Evidence of cannibalism
does not necessarily mean...

101
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:15,226
Bones, it's Gormogon. Has to be.

102
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,936
Oh, God.

103
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,314
Who has he eaten this time?

108
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,222
This is the fifth known victim
in the Gormogon murders,

109
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,871
all of which have been subjected
to ritualized cannibalism.

110
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,192
- He has apprentices?
- Yes.

111
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:07,829
One at all times,
to help perform the murders,

112
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,031
dispose of the bodies,
eradicate evidence.

113
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:14,160
His mission, it seems,
is to construct a complete

114
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,788
skeleton out of the bones
of his victims.

115
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,353
I've seen enough.

116
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:19,916
Bones, I'm thinking here.

117
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,923
Thinking about what exactly?

118
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:23,269
Well, it's a pickle.

119
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,798
Platform is a crime scene, but we need
to access it to investigate the crime.

120
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,974
A cake-and-eat-it-too situation.

121
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,935
Is it a cake or a pickle?

122
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,304
- It's Schrodinger's cat.
- That I understand.

123
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,598
Cakes and pickles meant nothing to me.

124
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:39,073
Are you paralyzed by the paradox, Booth?

125
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:41,414
I'll make this easy.
What do you need first?

126
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,162
- Identity.
- Let's go, people.

127
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:46,126
Whoa! Hey, easy.
All right... Whoa! Whoa!

128
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,202
All right, you can't...
All right. There you go.

129
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,340
Okay, the tooth sockets may contain
enough tissue to check DNA.

130
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,247
Zack, there are markings on this bone
that need to be checked out.

131
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:56,894
It appears to have been boiled.

132
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,980
I'll see if I can pull
any mineral traces that can

133
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,665
help us determine the water he used.

134
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:04,556
Okay, I give you all permission to do

135
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,414
whatever it is that you squints do.

136
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:09,634
I'll... just...

137
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,177
Call me.

138
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:14,804
Let's go.

139
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,860
I need to talk to you!
What the hell, Bones?

140
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,060
I'm in my house,
in my bathroom, in my bathtub.

141
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,658
How the hell did you get in here anyway?

142
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,374
That fake rock by your front door
wouldn't fool anybody.

143
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:39,477
Why are you wearing
a hat that dispenses beer?

144
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,224
Hot tub plus cold beer equals warm beer.

145
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:44,208
Hat equals solution.

146
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:46,140
- So why are you...?
- And that cigar?

147
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:47,481
Very unhealthy.

148
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,963
What the hell do you want now?

149
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,825
'Cause I'm not really
feeling too relaxed.

150
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:52,600
You should've told me
you weren't dead.

151
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,356
I already explained this to you.

152
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,813
The Bureau has to vet everyone
when there is a security issue.

153
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,730
- I was following protocol.
- Protocol?

154
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,859
- Yes!
- We've been partners for three years,

155
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,771
and you've broken protocol before,
sometimes putting my life in danger.

156
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,930
Which makes sense because you clearly
don't have any real concern for me.

157
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,068
- I took a bullet for you!
- Once!

158
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:11,823
That only goes so far.

159
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:19,952
Would you like a towel?

160
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:26,542
Fine.

161
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,882
What is it that I should have done?
What did you want me to do?

162
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,298
You could have called me.

163
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,634
Did you really think I need
to be vetted by your boss?

164
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,636
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course I do.

165
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:39,379
Then why wasn't I told? It must
have been something that you said.

166
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:42,321
No. I don't know why you weren't told.
But you said that I should be.

167
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:44,361
I mean, aren't you curious why I wasn't?

168
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,063
Yes. Do you want me to find out
why you weren't told?

169
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,816
If it's important to you.

170
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:51,889
Fine. I will.

171
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:55,154
The next time I die,
I promise that I will tell you.

172
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,573
- I'll look forward to that.
- Me, too.

173
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,893
What are you reading?

174
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,669
It's a novel.

175
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:04,705
It's a graphic novel.

176
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:09,127
Just so you know, I find your lack
of puritan modesty very refreshing.

177
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,132
The marks on the mandible
definitely indicate

178
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,760
that the bones have been gnawed on.

179
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,097
But not with teeth.

180
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,545
The markings were made
by someone wearing dentures.

181
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:30,546
A toothless cannibal just can't cut it

182
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,550
in today's competive
serial killer climate.

183
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,356
- How do you know he wore dentures?
- Zack found traces of

184
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:39,491
polymethylmethacrylate, monomer, and
tetra silicic fluromica on the mandible.

185
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:42,535
I'm going to go out on a limb here and
assume that's what dentures are made of.

186
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,329
But not normal commercial
dentures you get from the dentist.

187
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,665
The main ingredient
is polymethyl methacrylic.

188
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,918
- These dentures were homemade.
- I got our victim's DNA results back.

189
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:53,880
- Is it the lobbyist?
- Yep. Gormogon's last victim.

190
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,463
I was wondering when
some part of him would show up.

191
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:58,968
- What's that sucking sound?
- You know what?

192
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,680
This is my house. Okay?

193
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,689
You come into my house, there's
no telling what you're going to hear.

194
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:07,059
Dr. Saroyan, regarding
the denture medium,

195
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,334
if we recreate the process...

196
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:12,106
It could tell us a lot about
Gormogon's resources.

197
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,734
If you want to do one
of your experiments, just say it.

198
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,694
We want to do one of our experiments.

199
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,642
Go!

200
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,698
Make plastic cannibal dentures.

201
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,244
You should place
the jawbone in this skeleton.

202
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:26,256
Why?

203
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,086
Because it keeps alive an interactive
relationship with the killer.

204
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,001
That's why he provided the screws.

205
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:34,016
You know, we give him
something, he reciprocates.

206
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,632
Did you see me on TV?
No one has mentioned that I was on TV.

207
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:40,259
Look, how would he know if we added
the jawbone to his skeleton?

208
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,665
It's his obsession.
He has some way of finding out.

209
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,233
Which is another reason to do it.

210
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,011
Okay, both of you are purposely not
mentioning my appearance.

211
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,693
For all we know, Gormogon is dead,

212
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:51,258
and we're not on the list of people
who get to find that out.

213
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,684
There's a cry for attention.

214
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:55,047
- Bones broke into my house last night,
- There was a key!

215
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,505
all angry, because no one
told her that I was dead.

216
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,964
- And I was just following protocol.
- Broke into your house?

217
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,027
- There was a key.
- And barged into my bathroom.

218
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:03,994
- What were you doing?
- He was drinking beer

219
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:05,210
and reading a comic.

220
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,418
I was taking a bath.

221
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,657
You read comics and drink beer naked?

222
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:11,545
Wait a second.
Bones burst into my bathroom, all right?

223
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,135
And I'm weird for being naked?

224
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:18,374
This thermoplastic has a melting point
of approximately 1,800 degrees °F.

225
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,933
This would work better if
we created a paste from the monomer

226
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,866
and polymethylmethacrylate powder.

227
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,097
That would entail the use
of complicated cosolvents

228
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,247
to allow copolymerization without
substantial phase separation.

229
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:33,286
The monomer's melting point is far
below the polymethylmethacrylate.

230
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,050
So you didn't tell her to leave?
You just sat there naked?

231
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,110
It was my own bathroom, okay?
What do you wear in the tub, floaties?

232
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:45,093
Ready for the monomer?

233
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:46,826
Yes, I believe so.

234
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:49,260
The mold is over there
on the side table.

235
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,680
Why don't you get the mold,
and I'll mix in the monomer.

236
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,856
No, I'll mix it in.

237
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:55,042
Please hand me the monomer,
then the mold.

238
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,924
Since when did I become the assistant?

239
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,510
Since I became the uncontested
king of the lab.

240
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,611
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm okay.

241
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,560
Oh, my God!

242
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:31,996
Zack?

243
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,970
OK, a medical team's on it's way.

244
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,333
I'll get the burn kit.

245
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:36,626
Is he okay?

246
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:39,295
He's in shock, Bones.
Look at his hands.

247
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:44,630
Zack?

248
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:57,676
- Is Hodgins okay?
- He's fine.

249
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,023
Just a few minor cuts.

250
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,734
Don't worry, they're gonna
fix you up. You're gonna be good.

251
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:04,528
That would be impossible, Agent Booth.
The damage is...

252
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,591
We'll make sure
we get you the best doctors.

253
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,074
The cartilage is destroyed.

254
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:11,118
In addition, the trapezoid
and hamate on my left hand...

255
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,204
How about a little optimism here?

256
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:15,456
I know that I can still be quite useful.

257
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:17,541
Mentally, I'm still exceptional, and

258
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,710
with prostheses...

259
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:23,378
How are you, Zack?

260
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,397
Quite severely injured.

261
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:27,903
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay, man.

262
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,905
Anything you need, Zack, just ask.

263
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,183
Do you know how this happened?

264
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:36,268
I just added the three grams of monomer.

265
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:37,924
That doesn't make sense.

266
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:41,848
There were no dipoles like amide or
carbonyl in the monomer, were there?

267
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,360
- No, just simple phenylethene.
- That's what I thought.

268
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,113
- And the PMMA was...
- Hodgins, he has third-degree burns.

269
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,032
The doctor said you should rest, Zack.

270
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,575
She's right. Hey...

271
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:53,344
we're gonna figure this out, okay?

272
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:56,414
And you won't be alone, Zack.
One of us will be here all the time.

273
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:57,832
That's not necessary.

274
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,156
Yes, it is,

275
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,620
because we...

276
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:01,908
love you.

277
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,698
I'll take the first shift.

278
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,988
And I'll write us a schedule.

279
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:12,407
I'll get you whatever
you need to keep your job.

280
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,057
We'll get through this.

281
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,809
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

282
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,301
A simple monomer wouldn't explode.

283
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,245
It just wouldn't happen.

284
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:34,034
Isn't the FBI handling the analysis
of the explosive residue?

285
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:37,123
Excuse me if my faith
in the Bureau isn't absolute.

286
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,692
So you don't trust Agent Madison?

287
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,096
I'm just getting
my own results to double check.

288
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,144
I'm sure he's

289
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,588
fine, but I'm independent.

290
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,633
You suspect that there could be
a conspiracy within the Bureau?

291
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:51,962
Do I hear a little 'tude, young man?

292
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:53,168
No. No, no.

293
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,431
But why would there be
a conspiracy in this case?

294
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,388
Totally 'tudeless question.

295
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,177
Prominent public figures
being murdered and eaten.

296
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:04,435
Evidence that secret
societies are being targeted.

297
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:08,562
Societies that have great influence
in the halls of power like the Bureau.

298
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,197
You don't think that's a bit extreme?

299
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,462
You went on Larry King
to talk about this case,

300
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,245
and TMZ, because you know how big it is.

301
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,229
And to get your piece of it.

302
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,210
I'm a doctor.

303
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,126
I'm merely studying the case like you.

304
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,272
Right.

305
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,787
Oh, man, I should have known.

306
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:29,769
What?

307
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,343
You expect me to tell you
the answer, Agent Madison?

308
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:35,221
It's tricyclic acetone peroxide.

309
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:37,556
That's not bad.

310
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:41,603
It reacted with the molten
thermoplastic, and...

311
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,139
boom.

312
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,009
The containers must have been switched.

313
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,873
Zack thought he was adding a monomer
he had made himself, but

314
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,511
it was actually a volatile explosive.

315
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:55,407
Yes, I'm busy.

316
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,313
Cancel all my patients.
You don't have to tell them anything.

317
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,861
- What are you doing?
- A word.

318
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,497
- I'm on the phone.
- Hang up.

319
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,861
I'll talk to you later.
Tight grip you got there.

320
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,860
It's gonna get tighter.
So go ahead, tell her.

321
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,426
- Tell her what?
- Tell me what?

322
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:08,478
- Now.
- What?

323
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:10,674
Fine, I'll tell her, OK?
I sent my list to the Bureau,

324
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,341
they sent it to Sweets.

325
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:16,074
You were the one who decided not to tell
Dr. Brennan that I was still alive.

326
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:18,222
He's the one that you
should have slugged, so do it.

327
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,599
- Go ahead and do it now.
- What? You chose not to tell me?

328
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,852
- Yes, it's true, technically.
- Technically!

329
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:26,637
Okay, I reviewed the list and I decided,
knowing Dr. Brennan as I do,

330
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,490
that she was,
able to handle your death.

331
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,400
Slug him.

332
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,249
It was a national security issue.
The fewer people that knew Booth

333
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,101
was alive, the safer you would be.

334
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,335
I think that was a good choice.

335
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:37,957
- Awesome.
- You do?

336
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:39,235
Yes.

337
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:41,165
You knew that Booth's
death was something

338
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:43,189
I could deal with `cause
I can compartmentalize.

339
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,082
Wait a minute.
Why are you mad at me then?

340
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,236
`Cause you should have
told me personally.

341
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:50,045
Oh, I should have just ignored
national security concerns,

342
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:52,214
broken the law and told you?

343
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,508
Yes. You know I'm very trust worthy.

344
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,606
- Yeah, but Sweets...
- Sweets made a professional decision.

345
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,771
He knew that I could process
your death and move on

346
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,680
which is precisely what I did.

347
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,601
There's got to be other stuff
going on here?

348
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:06,551
- What?
- Transference, paranoia.

349
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,523
Come on. When I offer her a piece
of pie, you say it has deeper meaning.

350
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,443
- I don't like pie, Booth.
- Apple pie.

351
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,843
- She doesn't like baked pie.
- I don't like my fruit cooked.

352
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:16,405
Changing the subject
is a way to avoid your feelings.

353
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:18,781
My feelings? Okay,
now you're attacking my feelings?

354
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,242
There's something in the Gormogon
vault I think you should see.

355
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,575
Slug him.

356
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,597
You know, I think it's interesting
psychologically how Agent Booth's

357
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:29,627
constant efforts to persuade
you to enjoy fruit pie

358
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,795
could be interpreted
as a kind of seduction.

359
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:34,331
Whatever you two
are talking about, just stop it.

360
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,006
Zip it. Let's go.

361
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,389
You think I don't recognize
an experiment when I see one?

362
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,376
You experimented on us.

363
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,524
- Beg your pardon?
- Not telling me Booth was alive,

364
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:51,108
you wanted to quantify our reactions
for your own research.

365
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:53,838
You took advantage of us. Booth and I
agreed to let you observe us.

366
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,092
We did not agree
to be used as lab rats, so

367
00:17:56,212 --> 00:17:57,468
you better cut it out.

368
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,073
Why are you talking so fast?

369
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,326
Because if Booth hears why
you did what you did, he'd beat you up.

370
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,995
Don't you think that'd be
an overly aggressive act?

371
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:07,469
Not at all.
So you better not do it again.

372
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:09,986
Let's go, Bones. Where are you?

373
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:11,019
On our way.

374
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,256
Security had the entrance
to this wing locked

375
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,086
and the vault itself was secured.

376
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:21,121
The skeleton...

377
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,771
- Where'd it go?
- We don't know.

378
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,339
I came to see if the screws
matched the silver in the skeleton,

379
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,512
and he was gone.

380
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:29,193
There's security cameras and sensors
covering every inch of this place.

381
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,601
- They all failed.
- All of 'em?

382
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:34,038
When Zack's explosion
set off all the alarms,

383
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,069
every security camera
in the building failed.

384
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:37,935
The door to the loading
dock was unlocked.

385
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:39,582
Someone stole the skeleton.

386
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,415
Ten minutes before the explosion?

387
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,158
Everything is working perfectly.

388
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:46,078
Fast forward, Hodgins
passes Zack the container

389
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:47,820
of tricyclic acetone peroxide.

390
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,411
I thought it was the monomer.

391
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:52,042
The explosion occurred
at 12:03 and 22 seconds.

392
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:54,211
At 12:03 and 22 seconds...

393
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,007
- Aren't there any backup systems?
- All dead, too.

394
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,468
- Where were the guards?
- There was as chemical accident.

395
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,803
That takes precedence
over any other security issue.

396
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:04,430
All personnel went to secure

397
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,349
the lab or to secure any point
that went to the museum proper,

398
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,863
there'd be no loss of life.

399
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:12,070
During that time, the vault and
the skeleton would be unsecured.

400
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,978
Yes, until the security system
was brought back up

401
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,614
at 12:18 and 41 seconds.

402
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,698
The explosion was a diversion
set up by Gormogon.

403
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,416
He's here in the lab.

404
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,161
It's an inside job.
Gormogon works at the Jeffersonian.

405
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:34,001
Either Gormogon or his new apprentice.

406
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,961
That is a totally freaky thought.

407
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:37,804
It's Booth. I need a full forensic team

408
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:39,151
sent to the Jeffersonian

409
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,884
mobile labs, computers,
analysis, the works.

410
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:44,266
No, their equipment
could be compromised.

411
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:51,049
Hair, prints, anything?

412
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,335
Not since you asked
five minutes ago, no.

413
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:56,199
Dr. Saroyan,
please don't bother the techs.

414
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:58,317
You have a problem, you see me.

415
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,610
It's my people you suspect here. I want
to make sure you're doing your job.

416
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,940
After all, you're a prosecutor,
not a forensic.

417
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,493
You have been breathing down
our necks for two hours, cherie.

418
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,448
Why don't you go
get a latte or something?

419
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,386
You shouldn't be here anyway.

420
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:12,621
This is my department.

421
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:13,790
I know,

422
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:16,057
and you have full security clearance

423
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,627
and complete access
to the lab and the vault.

424
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,506
Are you saying I'm a suspect now?

425
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,881
I'm saying someone's gonna put
your name on the list.

426
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,719
You were a cop. Wouldn't you?

427
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,468
You've got over 30 agents here.
Find something.

428
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:36,916
The Medico-Legal lab
has over 100 employees.

429
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,764
Yeah, all their records are being
looked at, including yours and mine.

430
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:41,742
You're just having coffee?
Don't you want pie?

431
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:43,598
- I'm fine.
- You always have pie.

432
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,073
- Can we stop talking about pie?
- Because of what Sweets said?

433
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,699
I'm just going pie-less, okay?

434
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,308
Can we talk for a minute?

435
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:54,325
I have a profile of someone
I feel could be Gormogon.

436
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,182
No pie? You always eat pie.

437
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,052
Stop with the pie.
Will you just sit down?

438
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:58,995
All right.

439
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:00,975
You've been spying on us?

440
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,105
- More experiments?
- What experiments?

441
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,435
I'm just being thorough.

442
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,100
The dynamics of our work environment

443
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:08,060
play a role in how
I treat you and Booth.

444
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,117
Can we just get on with it? Who is it?

445
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,840
I believe it's Dr. Hodgins.

446
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,246
- What is Dr. Hodgins?
- Gormogon.

447
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,040
He thinks Hodgins is Gormogon.

448
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,002
Hodgins exhibits clinical paranoia

449
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,173
as well as a rationalized
feeling of superiority.

450
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:23,110
Paranoia.

451
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,773
Yeah. He's consumed by
numerous conspiracy theories.

452
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:29,428
My observations today,
he's even suspect of the FBI,

453
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:30,923
with whom he works closely.

454
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,179
It's all supposition.
There's no concrete evidence.

455
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,746
- No. Go on.
- Booth!

456
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:37,199
What? Hodgins knew all about
the secret societies.

457
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,252
He figured out the patterns Gormogon
used that led us to the vault.

458
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,754
- Yes, he was doing his job.
- Or justifying himself.

459
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,089
He had access to all the
chemicals Zack was using.

460
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:47,634
- He could have changed the labels.
- He and Zack are friends.

461
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:49,719
I also had access to the
chemicals Zack made.

462
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,013
Why am I not a suspect?

463
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:54,308
Well, you have a reverence for life
that belies the cold calculations

464
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,895
of a killer, and the emotional
connection you share with Agent Booth.

465
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:00,478
No, I don't have time for this. No.

466
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:04,523
Don't you know by now
you can't rush her?

467
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,405
We're trying to catch a killer.
I thought it best not to waste time.

468
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:13,660
Look, he's just trying to help, Bones.

469
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,893
Well, his opinions
won't get you a conviction.

470
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:18,260
- He doesn't have any evidence.
- Yeah, but he's a profiler

471
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,632
with a great track record.

472
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,597
- Who?
- Sweets.

473
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,837
Sweets says that Hodgins is the killer.

474
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:25,047
That makes sense.

475
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,257
- What?
- Well, it throws suspicion off him.

476
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:28,550
- Who?
- Sweets.

477
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,261
You think that Sweets is the killer?

478
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:33,920
He shows up right after you find
the Gormogon vault,

479
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,058
when Gormogon's at his most vulnerable,

480
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:38,777
and in therapy he plays you two
like a cheap piano until you ask

481
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:40,559
- for his help with the case.
- Wait.

482
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,285
Nobody plays me like a cheap piano.

483
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:44,494
We all trusted the
"brilliant, young profiler."

484
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,167
I got him security clearance because
he was going to help us.

485
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:48,260
He was here.

486
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:51,330
He had the opportunity
to switch Zack's chemicals.

487
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,075
Except he's not a chemist.

488
00:22:53,335 --> 00:22:55,702
He's the only one we can't account
for after the explosion.

489
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,956
Great, now we sound like Sweets.
We have no evidence.

490
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:02,214
I was a cop for ten years, Dr. Brennan.
I can smell it on him.

491
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:05,420
I'm sorry,
but we need more than your gut feeling.

492
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,729
Well, then find it.

493
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:09,049
'Cause trust me, Sweets is your boy.

494
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,609
Dr. Hodgins,
knocking would be appreciated.

495
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:29,684
Right. Sorry.

496
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,540
So, rumor is, one of us is a suspect.

497
00:23:34,187 --> 00:23:35,164
Who is it?

498
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,600
- I can't say. You know that.
- Of course not.

499
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,348
And since it's a rumor,
it might not even be true,

500
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:42,802
right?

501
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:45,377
Do you have a legitimat
reason to see me, or...

502
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,665
are you just here
to squeeze me for information?

503
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:49,087
I've found something.

504
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,095
Zack said he thought
the mandible had been boiled.

505
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:56,323
To remove tissue.

506
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:58,517
I pulled trace elements from
the mandible and ran them

507
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,416
through the mass spectrometer to see
what the bone was boiled in.

508
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,603
It was tap water. But,

509
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:05,076
see this spike here?

510
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:06,565
- Lead?
- Yes.

511
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:08,924
I thought the city had
to replace all their lead pipes.

512
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:11,119
They did,
but individual homeowners didn't.

513
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,412
I focused on neighborhoods
with the highest lead levels.

514
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:15,312
Older homes are the worst offenders.

515
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:18,661
This neighborhood matches the level
of lead found on the victim's bone.

516
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,385
Isn't that your house?

517
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:26,136
Yes, it is.

518
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:29,050
But there are other people that live

519
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,176
Yeah, of course.

520
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:34,750
I'll pass this along
to the investigators.

521
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,723
Good.

522
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,603
Is there anything else?

523
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:42,557
I could have fudged the facts.

524
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:44,728
I could've left my neighborhood out.

525
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:47,339
Yes, but that would have
raised suspicion if someone

526
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:48,899
had double-checked your results.

527
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,119
If you need me, I'll be at my station...

528
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:55,513
helping.

529
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,589
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.

530
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:14,724
Hey, Sweets, where were
you after the explosion?

531
00:25:15,162 --> 00:25:16,101
I was with you.

532
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,311
No, you were with us
when the explosion occurred.

533
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,791
I mean after.

534
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:23,984
Let's see, I ran to call 9-1-1.

535
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:24,943
Where?

536
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,470
In your office. Why?

537
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,496
Then what?

538
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:30,365
Then I went to the door to show
the EMTs where to go.

539
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:31,950
You didn't come in with them.

540
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,919
No, I find it's best to stay
out of the way

541
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,829
of the professionals in
those situations.

542
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:37,793
Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,541
- I forgot one thing.
- What's that?

544
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:43,169
I went down to the vault and
I stole the Silver Skeleton

545
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,421
because I'm...

546
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,506
I'm Gormogon's apprentice.

547
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:47,841
That's a confession.

548
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:49,759
You know, I can lock him up
for 72 hours.

549
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,261
You'd lock me up for sarcasm?

550
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:52,696
I think you should.

551
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:55,307
Wait, you guys actually think that
I'm Gormogon's apprentice?

552
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,058
Somebody is.
That way, I lock you up

553
00:25:57,218 --> 00:26:00,148
check out your story and not worry
about you running off to Bolivia.

554
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,856
- This is fierce wretched.
- Better safe than sorry.

555
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:04,649
- Yeah.
- No, you're projecting.

556
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:08,643
You have a reasonable hostility
toward Gormogon.

557
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:11,198
But you have no outlet for
those feelings, so you're using me...

558
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,575
Am I gonna have to break out my cuffs?

559
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,161
You know what?
You are gonna need your cuffs.

560
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,330
'Cause I'm not about to make
this easy for you.

561
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:32,569
Hi...

562
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,385
How's Zack?

563
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:39,551
Well, he's in a lot of pain,

564
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:42,374
but he won't let me push
the painkiller button.

565
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,035
He's scared of polka dots, but

566
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:47,521
screaming agony is just
an interesting phenomenon.

567
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:49,747
Drugs give me bad dreams.

568
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:52,530
Oh, hey there, Zack.

569
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:56,868
I'm walking somewhere, and
suddenly someone takes me by the hand.

570
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:59,306
And I look and it's a skeleton.

571
00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:01,331
And the skeleton's on fire,

572
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:03,333
and my hands hurt.

573
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,710
Take the painkillers, sweetie.

574
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:08,463
I've been thinking about
the explosion, Hodgins.

575
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,730
No one could have switched
the chemicals.

576
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,260
I locked up the container
when I left the room.

577
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,074
I had the only...

578
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,120
key...

579
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:19,518
You...

580
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,309
would know, but...

581
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,690
you...

582
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:28,733
I'm afraid the painkillers, while
pleasant, dull my intellect.

583
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:31,489
Sometimes your friends gotta step in...

584
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,155
Dumb it up for you.

585
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,819
Don't you think it's time to go home?

586
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:48,587
Sorry, Cam, I...

587
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:50,171
seem to be a bit anxious.

588
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:52,012
Don't worry about it.
It's going around.

589
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:55,632
Hodgins came to talk to me, and
I almost jumped out of my skin.

590
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,507
What's keeping you so late?

591
00:27:57,728 --> 00:28:00,570
Looking at the tissue we used
for the DNA tests...

592
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,964
the victims' DNA alleles in the roots

593
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:05,270
were destroyed.

594
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,447
And the marrow alleles were altered.

595
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,815
I rembered when I first
looked at the jawbone,

596
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:11,901
it seemed lighter in color
than I expected.

597
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,863
- It was treated with ultraviolet light?
- I think so.

598
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:17,198
- Who would do that?
- We would.

599
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:20,869
Standard procedure for skeletal remains
when we put them away for storage.

600
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:23,997
We have over 10,000 sets of
remains waiting to be identified.

601
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:25,853
What better place to hide a skeleton?

602
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:29,210
How do we sift through
10,000 sets of remains?

603
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:39,087
I'd like to welcome all of Dr. Brennan's
grad students to Limbo.

604
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:42,525
It's Modular Skeletal Storage.
I don't like the moniker "Limbo."

605
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,936
Over 10,000 lost souls
remain here, Sweetie,

606
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:47,724
unidentified, waiting.

607
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:50,399
It's a good name.
Let's just go with it.

608
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,274
Each of these boxes contains
the skeletal remains of one person.

609
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:56,696
In this case, a skull, two femurs,

610
00:28:56,856 --> 00:29:00,075
five vertebrae, miscellaneous
phalanges and three molars.

611
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:02,469
What we want you to do
is conduct an inventory,

612
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,098
making sure that what's in the box

613
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:06,081
corresponds not only
to the card in the box

614
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:09,250
- but also to the computer record.
- Does it count toward our final grade?

615
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,205
Listen, Brennan's grad students,

616
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:14,255
what we're trying to do here
is catch a serial killer,

617
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,424
not get a gold star from "teach."

618
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:18,625
We think that he's hidden the remains

619
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:20,778
of one or more of his victims here.

620
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:23,715
Bones tucked into boxes
where they don't belong.

621
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:26,788
And I think it's fair to say that if you
help us catch a serial killer, that

622
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:29,896
- you'll pass your precious course.
- That's not necessarily true.

623
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,189
If anyone else

624
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,234
shows up down here indicating an
interest in what you're doing, either

625
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:36,784
tell Ms. Montenegro
or shout for Security.

626
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:37,654
Why?

627
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:41,616
Because serial killers get mean when
you get close to catching them.

628
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:51,215
This is just creepy.

629
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,335
Well, it's the natural order of things.

630
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:54,654
We all end up this way.

631
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:57,298
Thank you, cherie, now you've made it
creepy and depressing.

632
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:00,175
I found an extra femur
in one of the boxes

633
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:02,220
- and an extra fibula in another.
- You sure?

634
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,806
The remains in the box
were of a four-year-old child.

635
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:07,278
The femur was from a man
in his mid-40s to early 50s.

636
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,477
- And the fibula?
- Also from a middle-aged man.

637
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:11,468
It had recently been boiled.

638
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:13,648
Three other people found
extra bones, as well.

639
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,249
I found an extra manubrium, a male ulna

640
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,486
and a humerus in a box
of female remains.

641
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,072
Okay, lay out all of the
extra bones anatomically.

642
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:23,151
It's already done.
Over here.

643
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,338
Nice job.

644
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,374
I'm third in my class.

645
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:34,586
I'd like the names of
the two students in front of you.

646
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:36,671
45 to 50 years old.

647
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,259
Fibula and femur show a height
of approximately 180 centimeters.

648
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:45,513
- How tall is that in English?
- Approximately 5'8".

649
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,974
Have Dr. Saroyan take

650
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:51,186
DNA samples and compare them
to all of Gormogon's known victims.

651
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,671
- You suspect something, don't you?
- I have no facts yet.

652
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,190
My opinions are not relevant.

653
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,234
Let me make the call, cherie.
Give me some of that big brain of yours.

654
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:01,165
Someone removed the mandible
from the skull.

655
00:31:01,285 --> 00:31:04,025
- It's the one that was sent to you.
- I can't say that with certainty.

656
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,493
Dr. Saroyan should see
if the DNA matches.

657
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,245
Didn't you hear her?
Get this up to Dr. Saroyan.

658
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,633
Now.

659
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:14,227
Dr. Brennan, I think you should
take a look at this.

660
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:22,884
All of the canines have been removed
from these skulls.

661
00:31:23,044 --> 00:31:24,177
Just the canines.

662
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:28,056
I want the security tapes from
this room for the last six months.

663
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:29,541
The room isn't covered.

664
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,392
- Why not?
- It's Limbo.

665
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:36,064
I need to reexamine the mandible Zack
was working on before the explosion.

666
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:37,765
Of course you do.

667
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:42,890
It's the lobbyist that disappeared.

668
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,921
DNA's a match and so are the dentals.

669
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,091
Dr. Brennan's gonna want to take
a look at the markings on these.

670
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:53,665
What's that? More cannibal teeth
marks on the bone?

671
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:57,365
Gormogon went after this like
Henry VIII after a chicken leg.

672
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,632
These appear to have been
gnawed on, too.

673
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,529
They'll probably match the denture
marking Zack found.

674
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:06,636
They won't.

675
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,346
You haven't looked at them yet.

676
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,552
Zack said these markings on
the mandible were made by

677
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:15,019
artificial dentures made from polymethyl
methacrylate and other polymers.

678
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:16,229
And...?

679
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:18,736
They were not made
by artificial dentures.

680
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,650
Zack should've known that.

681
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:22,443
He made a mistake.
It happens.

682
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:23,570
Not often.

683
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,828
I heard Zack was wrong
about the dentures

684
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,236
- No.
- What do you mean?

685
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:35,492
- Cam and Caroline...
- He knew they weren't artificial.

686
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:39,030
Any first-year student would know that.
The dentures were made from real teeth.

687
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,378
All canines.

688
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:44,125
Canines are a symbol of the wolf

689
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:46,634
which appears on the Gormogon
tapestry in the vault.

690
00:32:46,794 --> 00:32:50,388
Certain ancient sects revered the wolf
as a symbol of freedom...

691
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:54,168
as a representative of the forces
that will deliver us from persecution.

692
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:55,685
Okay, enough about the wolf.

693
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:57,030
What's going on?

694
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,188
Zack lied.

695
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,463
Why?

696
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:03,625
He... he took...

697
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,311
the teeth from bone storage

698
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:09,262
and he made Gormogon's dentures.

699
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,498
Zack has complete access to the lab.

700
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,581
He arranged for the explosion himself.

701
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:17,832
It's Zack.

702
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:20,335
He's the killer, Booth.

703
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,530
It's Zack.

704
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:28,018
"The theory of conditional expressions

705
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:32,077
"is a non-profound generalization
of propositional calculus."

706
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:34,223
What's it say after Boolean forms?

707
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:38,726
There's a little thing that
looks like a Japanese stool,

708
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:41,689
then a B with a tail, then a fat fish.

709
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:43,302
This makes sense to you?

710
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:44,510
It doesn't to you?

711
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:46,995
Cam?

712
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:49,059
We need the room.

713
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:05,641
I'm sorry, but I have to ask...
are you absolutely certain?

714
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:06,688
Because...

715
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,802
I did not see that coming.

716
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:17,350
You looked at the mandible.

717
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,227
You had to know I'd see it eventually.

718
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:21,656
I didn't foresee the extent
of my injuries.

719
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:24,266
I was going to sneak out of here, but...

720
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:25,888
Your friends never left your side.

721
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:29,821
And you intended to steal the jawbone
and add it to the silver skeleton.

722
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,531
But you designed the explosion.

723
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:34,117
You must have known exactly
how big it would be.

724
00:34:34,277 --> 00:34:35,767
Hodgins argued with me.

725
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:37,263
He stood too close.

726
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:40,581
The delay allowed the thermoplastic
to reach the boiling point.

727
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:44,377
And as a result, the explosion was three
times more powerful than I calculated.

728
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:46,477
You must have known how badly
you'd be injured.

729
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:47,536
Yes.

730
00:34:52,897 --> 00:34:55,202
- Who's Gormogon, Zack?
- That's not what he's called.

731
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,140
Then what is he called?

732
00:34:57,449 --> 00:34:58,452
The Master.

733
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,701
- And you're his apprentice?
- I need a name.

734
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:01,811
I can't tell you.

735
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,875
The apprentice is expendable.

736
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:05,398
I'm expendable.

737
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:06,644
Who is he?

738
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:08,594
Zack responds to logic, Booth.

739
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:10,416
Really? 'Cause I'd love
to hear the logic

740
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:12,540
of killing and eating people
to change the world.

741
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,157
The Master's logic is irrefutable.

742
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,263
Irrefutable?

743
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:17,827
I saw him choking a child
at the bottom of a pool.

744
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:20,038
If you knew what I know,
you'd understand.

745
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,370
You'd be proud of me.

746
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,202
I've always been proud of you, Zack.

747
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:29,618
I've never met anyone more
rational or intelligent.

748
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:31,758
But there's a fault in your logic.

749
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:36,012
With all due respect, you aren't
cognizant of his logic.

750
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,085
Assumption number one:

751
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:39,640
secret societies exist.

752
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,578
Accepted.

753
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:42,852
Hodgins has been explaining
this to me for years.

754
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:44,335
Assumption number two:

755
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:48,065
the human experience is adversely
affected by secret societies.

756
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:49,078
Accepted.

757
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:50,693
Assumption number three:

758
00:35:50,853 --> 00:35:52,989
attacking and killing members
of secret societies

759
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,572
will have an ameliorating effect

760
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,090
on the human experience.

761
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,074
Accepted.

762
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,360
All of your assumptions

763
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:02,288
are built upon
a first principle, Zack.

764
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,373
To wit: the historical

765
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:09,128
human experience as a whole is more
important than a single person's life.

766
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:10,739
Yes.

767
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:16,648
Yet you risked it all
so you wouldn't hurt Hodgins.

768
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:35,648
There's...

769
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:37,914
You are correct,

770
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,242
there's an inconsistency
in my reasoning.

771
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,266
Bones, I need a name.

772
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:44,832
We know.

773
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:48,981
He first approached me three months ago

774
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:52,164
at a symposium on burning
plasma diagnostics.

775
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,712
I need to know who this guy is.

776
00:36:55,832 --> 00:36:57,468
I need to go get him. Now.

777
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:58,957
I don't know his name.

778
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:00,807
I've never known his name.

779
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,686
But I've been to his house.

780
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:06,227
I was blindfolded when
he first took me there,

781
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:10,522
but I remember every turn he took
and I was able to estimate his speed

782
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:14,445
so when he brought me home,
I found it on a map.

783
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,468
It's in Benning Ridge,

784
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:20,283
on a street called Savoy Crescent.

785
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:21,838
It's a big place.

786
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,096
Almost as big as Hodgins'
house, but run down.

787
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:28,965
There's a flight of stairs
at the back, outside.

788
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:32,263
There's a blue door.

789
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,303
It will be locked, but there's...

790
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:39,567
a key hidden in a crevice to the left
of the door just above eye-level.

791
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:43,931
You will see a hallway.

792
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:46,655
If he's found someone,

793
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:51,180
you will smell meat cooking and that's
how you'll know you're getting close.

794
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,049
One last door and
you'll have to be fast.

795
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:58,557
He'll be at the bottom
of an incline in the floor.

796
00:38:04,504 --> 00:38:05,736
He'll have a knife.

797
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,667
He's very fast and he's very strong.

798
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:57,505
- Did you get him?
- Got him.

799
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,713
- Who was he, Booth?
- Nobody.

800
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,266
Am I right?

801
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:02,831
He was nobody.

802
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:05,588
An invisible man angry
at history for not seeing him.

803
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,808
For a nobody,
he sure wrecked a lot of lives.

804
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:17,482
Zack confessed to killing the lobbyist.

805
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:20,024
- Stabbed him in the heart.
- He never ate anybody?

806
00:39:20,144 --> 00:39:20,898
No.

807
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:22,985
- So how did this happen?
- Logic.

808
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:24,821
No. I'm sorry, cherie,

809
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:26,951
that might cut
it with you eggheads,

810
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:29,446
but this happened the way
this always happens.

811
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:33,395
A strong personality finds
a weak personality and takes advantage.

812
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:35,034
I hope we fry the guy.

813
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:36,961
That's not gonna be necessary.

814
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,061
Good riddance, I say.

815
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:42,769
What'll happen to Zack?

816
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,095
I cut a deal.

817
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,268
He pleads guilty, cooperates,

818
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:48,347
and we find him non compos mentis.

819
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,433
That way, Zack is moved to a secure

820
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:52,768
psychiatric facility instead
of going to prison.

821
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:54,061
No, it won't stand up.

822
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,169
Zack isn't actually insane.

823
00:39:56,856 --> 00:40:00,482
Sweets, you're going to give
this one to Bones, you understand?

824
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,595
I understand.

825
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:03,547
Good.

826
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,403
I probably could have spent
more time with Zack.

827
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:32,959
You know, get him to see
the world a bit more.

828
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:37,165
All those things I say about
secret societies, and conspiracies...

829
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:38,689
I never knew he was listening.

830
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,718
- I should have gotten him a girlfriend.
- You know what?

831
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:44,278
The hell with Zack. He's an adult.
He made his choices.

832
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:45,801
People are who they are.

833
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,018
There's nothing any of us could
have done for the guy.

834
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:49,116
We love Zack.

835
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:50,750
Well, he killed someone.

836
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,537
And he deserves to be locked up
for the rest of his life.

837
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,122
I feel I must point out that

838
00:40:55,282 --> 00:40:58,667
what Dr. Saroyan just said is obviously
her way of handling grief.

839
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:01,711
She doesn't mean it.
Quite the opposite, in fact.

840
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,622
I knew the day I met Zack,
he'd cause me pain.

841
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:16,352
So what do you got there, Hodgins?

842
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,728
This is, uh...

843
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,266
Zack's favorite stuff.

844
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,220
What are we going to do with it?

845
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,109
Where he's going, they may
actually let him have it.

846
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:28,037
Oh... I got him that.

847
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:29,541
Yeah, thanks.

848
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,034
He waved that in my face every day.

849
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:34,940
The pocket Kama Sutra.

850
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:38,999
I gave him this, so he'd stop
asking Booth sex questions.

851
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:43,135
I got Zack this before he went to Iraq.

852
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:45,752
Hey...

853
00:41:46,408 --> 00:41:47,848
I drew this for him.

854
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:52,115
It's interesting that all
of his favorite things

855
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:54,098
are objects you people gave to him.

856
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,308
I never gave him anything.

857
00:41:56,671 --> 00:41:58,295
Brennan, he totally loved you.

858
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,228
I mean,

859
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:01,522
as much as he was capable.

860
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,463
But I never gave him anything.

861
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:06,721
Angela.

862
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:32,757
"Dear Mr. Addy..."

863
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:37,771
"It is my pleasure to offer you the post
of my intern in forensic anthropology."

864
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,021
"I chose you from hundreds of applicants
because of your knowledge,

865
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:46,200
your desire to learn, and because
I feel you will find a home here."

866
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:54,033
I think you gave him
something great, Bones.
