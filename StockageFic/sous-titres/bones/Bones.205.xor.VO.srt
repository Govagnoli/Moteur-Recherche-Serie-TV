00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,900
Wow.

3
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,234
That was, uh...

4
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:26,234
Yeah, that was...

5
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:28,234
Amazing.

6
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:32,267
And a huge mistake.

7
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,534
Huge.

8
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,567
Why do we keep
doing this?

9
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:40,067
Well...
you know...

10
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:42,560
We don't, I mean,
what's it been?

11
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:44,330
Twice in the past ar?

12
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:46,539
Three- four,
if you count

13
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:47,802
that stakeout.
Yeah, well, you know what,

14
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:50,230
that wasn't sex.
Maybe not for you,

15
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:51,902
but this is it.

16
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,730
Yeah, you're right.

17
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:55,932
But, I mean, it's not like
we're doing anything wrong.

18
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,630
I mean, you and Drew are...

19
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:58,760
We needed to
take a break

20
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:01,363
to gain perspective, but, um...

21
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:02,832
this isn't helping.

22
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:05,362
And that's why it's over.

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,960
Done.

24
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:08,530
Phone, yeah, phone.

25
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:13,761
Shh. Booth.

26
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:15,461
Yeah. Address?

27
00:01:18,935 --> 00:01:20,163
You know, I, uh...

28
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:21,333
Oh, no, no, no.
Me, too. Me, too.

29
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,061
I have to pick up
Parker from school.

30
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:25,601
Oh, you know what, make sure
that you bring him the comic

31
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:27,232
that I got him 'cause
he loves that.

32
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:28,463
Yeah, sure.

33
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:32,863
Oh, uh...

34
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:34,261
Agent Booth's phone.

35
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,902
Oh, hi.

36
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,401
It's Dr. Brennan.

37
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,133
Is Agent Booth... available?

38
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:43,200
Available? Yeah, Dr. Brennan.

39
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:46,662
Yeah, Bones. What's up?

40
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:49,333
Nothing, just seeing
if you got the call

41
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:50,902
and if you're swinging
by to pick me up, or...

42
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,662
Oh, yeah, um...

43
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,503
you know, I'm just gonna have
to meet you there, okay?

44
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,331
Okay, bye.

45
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,363
You don't, uh...
think she thought...

46
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,230
No. No, we have

47
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:05,832
a child together, I mean,
it's perfectly normal

48
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,201
for us to be together.
Right.

49
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:10,100
It's not like, uh, this is
ever going to happen again.

50
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:11,860
No, exactly.

51
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:14,202
Okay, um, are you done
with the bathroom?

52
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,902
Yeah.
'Kay, thanks.

53
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:26,960
Sorry if I interrupted
anything.

54
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,661
What?

55
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:31,161
Oh. No.
No, you didn't.

56
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,731
Good.
Okay.

57
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,301
But if you must know,

58
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:36,000
you know, Rebecca, my ex-

59
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,862
she stopped by my place

60
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,260
to pick up a comic
that I got Parker. Okay.

61
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:42,301
She just so happened
to pick up the phone.

62
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,633
That's it, you know.

63
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,000
Nothing more,
nothing less...

64
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,662
I'm sorry, did I say
I must know?

65
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,131
BOOTH:
Oh, very nice.

66
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,863
Age and sex,

67
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,830
undetermined,
victim is

68
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:06,402
immersed in a pool of...

69
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:07,901
what smells like a composite

70
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,603
of domestic
corrosives.

71
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,761
Smells more like, uh...

72
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:11,833
Common drain
declogger,

73
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,660
acid wash, bleach.

74
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,903
Submerged two to three days.

75
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,032
All right, are you
saying that, uh,

76
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:18,903
he's been here all
weekend just dissolving?

77
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,002
Allowing the killer

78
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,561
enough time for the corrosives

79
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,162
to do their thing.

80
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,733
Excuse me, can I get
in here, please?

81
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,503
Yeah, I'm Pete Valero,

82
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,662
the development contractor.
Okay.

83
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:32,262
I came as soon as I...

84
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:34,703
There could be
evidence in there.

85
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,033
I'd say most of it's
right in there.

86
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:39,231
I'll need Zack to help me
extract the remains

87
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:40,602
and whatever else
is beneath the surface.

88
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,361
Wouldn't it be a lot easier
if we just took the whole tub?

89
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,603
No, no, no. No, wait.

90
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:46,302
That tub is an Godiva 3000.

91
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:47,432
These things
aren't cheap.

92
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:48,563
Oh, do you think anyone
is actually gonna

93
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,901
want this Godiva 3000
after this?

94
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,403
Well, would they have to know?

95
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,932
Look, I'm just saying,

96
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,201
that with subsidized housing,

97
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,660
the government wants
every nickel accounted for.

98
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,002
I'll get your receipts

99
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,230
if you could tell me why
the boss at the job is just

100
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,161
showing  up
right now.

101
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:01,300
Iwas at the dentist.

102
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,461
I got a call
in the middle of a root canal.

103
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:05,461
Who knew I'd be
better off there?

104
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,701
Do you know who this is?

105
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,231
How would I know?

106
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:10,161
I got over 200 workers
on this site alone,

107
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,731
not to mention all the kids
and the-the vandals

108
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:15,201
coming through here
on the weekend.

109
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:18,432
Oh, my God!
Oh, God, Bones!

110
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:19,463
Wait  out there.

111
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,500
It's only skin.

112
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,333
Okay, I'll need that window,

113
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:24,332
a forklift
and a flatbed.

114
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,460
Why?

115
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:26,560
You called it.

116
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:27,662
We want answers.

117
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:30,661
The tub is coming with us.

118
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,131
Down. Lower, lower, lower.

119
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,302
Keep going,
keep going.

120
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:17,361
And... good.

121
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:20,132
Whoa, this is going to be fun.

122
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:22,032
I should get
my video camera.

123
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:23,560
I may need a Compazine.

124
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:24,833
There'll be none of that.

125
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,061
No fun, no video, no vomit.

126
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:28,663
Whoa, then again.

127
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:29,932
We have to hurry.

128
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,403
Those chemicals are
eating away at our victim.

129
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,403
Is there any chance

130
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,931
that he was put
in there alive?

131
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:37,131
If we find any rope
or duct tape on the body,

132
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:38,331
I'd say there's
a good chance.

133
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:40,532
Okay, people,
let's start with the "who"

134
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:41,763
We'll worry about the "why"
and the "how" later.

135
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,503
But if we find the why
and the how first,

136
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:44,563
we'll gladly take it.

137
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:46,332
Though "who"
is clearly the priority.

138
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:48,462
The "who's" not going to change,

139
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:51,432
but the clues might
if we don't hurry.

140
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:52,531
What's our starting weight,
Zack?

141
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:55,761
Starting weight is 542.13.

142
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:58,631
The tub itself weighs
about 200 pounds,

143
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,501
capacity is 34 gallons.

144
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:04,100
Which at about 8.3 pounds
a gallon comes to...

145
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,039
270-275.

146
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:07,632
And two-thirds full
makes it about 180,

147
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:10,461
putting this guy somewhere
in the 160-pound weight class.

148
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,002
The cream always rises.

149
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,861
Or in this case,
melted body fat.

150
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:18,031
I'll measure its volume
to determine body type.

151
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:20,700
I'll start separating all
things chemical from organic.

152
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:21,902
And I know
you requested

153
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,500
a strainer of some sort,
Dr. Brennan,

154
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:25,630
but I thought
this could be of use.

155
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,261
For the big pieces maybe.

156
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,200
After that, Old McZachy,
get on the horn

157
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:31,232
with the Coroner's office
and tell them

158
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:32,362
I want two field unit

159
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,001
water sifters sent here ASAP.

160
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,630
They get mad
when I drop your name.

161
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:36,961
Then  drop it twice.

162
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,602
Talk about the proof
in the pudding.

163
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,960
Even for me this is disgusting.

164
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,562
Was this too much
even for Booth?

165
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,463
He's still questioning
the workers at the site.

166
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:51,333
Hopefully,
there's enough skull here

167
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:52,703
for a partial reconstruction.

168
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:55,262
Hmm, I've worked with less.

169
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:58,032
Right femur is pitted

170
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:59,501
and brittle.

171
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,961
Marrow's practically
gelatinized.

172
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,161
Our victim's elderly.

173
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:04,432
That's a bit of a leap.

174
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:05,733
Not really.

175
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,362
Zack, hold still.

176
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:13,262
It's a hip replacement.

177
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:16,403
Don't these things usually come
engraved with serial numbers?

178
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:17,630
Not this one.

179
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,362
It looks like the chemicals
burned those off, too.

180
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,730
Hey, so where's Mr. Tub of Lard?

181
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:34,160
I figured
they'd bring him here.

182
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,101
Lard I've got plenty of.

183
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,531
The rest of him's in the ookey
room where he belongs.

184
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:41,432
Oh, wow, so that nasty yellow
goop is...?

185
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:42,533
Fat.

186
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,432
9.3 liters so far.

187
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:45,531
Oh, good, Booth.

188
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm sure you'll want
to see this, too.

189
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:49,561
What is it?

190
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,101
Guess.

191
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,433
Maybe not, Zack.

192
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,901
It's our victim's wallet.
Can you believe it?

193
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,232
Leather, cash, cards,

194
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,133
every shred of identification
completely emulsified.

195
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,533
Mm, wow.
You know what, Zack?

196
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,731
I'd like to go back
to the old arrangement

197
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,233
where you don't
talk to me directly.

198
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,333
Okay?

199
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:07,703
Have my water sifters
arrived yet?

200
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:09,161
Yes, that's how I
found the wallet.

201
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:10,801
Okay, so the point
of this is...?

202
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,303
Doing what that wallet can't.

203
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,162
Right now, I'd say
our victim's an ectomorph.

204
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:17,630
Thin, linear,
narrow features,

205
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,662
and I hear you're back
with your ex.

206
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,262
I'm sorry?

207
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,702
Rebecca, right?

208
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,433
Reliving old times?

209
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,662
I'll just keep sifting.

210
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,231
Yeah.

211
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,230
Dr. Brennan told you.

212
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,062
Oh, relax.
She did, didn't she?

213
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:37,302
We all have our weak moments.

214
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,863
No, uh-uh, we don't, okay?

215
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:42,161
I don't.

216
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:44,102
Please, Seeley, like we haven't
shared enough of them

217
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,162
for me to know better.

218
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:49,831
I was not gossiping.

219
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,233
Oh, really?

220
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,762
So then what would
you call it?

221
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,302
Merely sharing a
point of interest.

222
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,660
Great. So now
what am I, huh,

223
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,001
the world's largest
ball of string?

224
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,501
Not you,
your behavior.

225
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,501
It was a textbook
example of just how helpless

226
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,901
we higher primates can be
to our biological urges.

227
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:04,661
I'm not helpless.

228
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,532
He's not elderly.

229
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,163
I can control
my, uh... Who?

230
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:11,301
Our victim.

231
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,330
You see these marrow cells?

232
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:14,833
The lack of
collagen indicates

233
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,602
osteogenesis imperfecta;

234
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:19,133
Brittle Bone disease.

235
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,803
And that's supposed
to tell me that he's not old?

236
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,860
Not necessarily.

237
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,861
And if you're
not helpless,

238
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:24,962
then why did you
sleep with her?

239
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,032
Oh,  I really don't recall
saying that I did.

240
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:29,063
Well, you didn't have to... I
could hear it in your voice.

241
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,130
I may as well have walked
in on you having sex.

242
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,800
You didn't, and we weren't.

243
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,500
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
Booth.

244
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:36,700
Humans act upon
a hierarchy of needs

245
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,202
and sex is very highly ranked.

246
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,233
It's an anthropological
inevitability.

247
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:40,363
Thank you, Bones.

248
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,502
I really appreciate
you boiling me down

249
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,331
to your anthropological
inevitabilities.

250
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:45,161
Sure.

251
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,260
Any time.

252
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,461
You know, if our victim
had Brittle Bone,

253
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,330
there could be a Web site
of some kind.

254
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,700
He might have been listed.

255
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:52,730
Afraid not, honey.

256
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:55,330
There's no official
database,

257
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,463
but I did track down
eight cases of Brittle Bone

258
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:58,463
in the area.

259
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:00,463
How may of them
are adult males?

260
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:01,562
Give me a second.

261
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:07,063
What's wrong?

262
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:09,203
With what?

263
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,231
This is usually where I type
and you talk.

264
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,032
You two are never not talking.

265
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:14,962
Well, we're not not talking.

266
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:18,100
Or maybe we're not not not.

267
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,701
Okeydoke.

268
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,032
Number  of adult males
with Brittle Bone

269
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,261
in the metropolitan area is...

270
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:25,961
zero.

271
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:27,933
Same with adult females.

272
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,261
These are all kids.

273
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,001
Why is that,
high mortality rate?

274
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,462
No, when O.I. is fatal,
it's mainly to infants,

275
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,331
and only in severe cases.

276
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,961
So our guy
has a mild case.

277
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,363
Type One; near
normal stature,

278
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:42,232
fragile bones and joints,
off-white sclera.

279
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,501
Is this disease hereditary?

280
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,261
Mild cases can be.

281
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:48,403
The more severe forms,
Types Two and Three

282
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,630
are often the result
of a genetic mutation.

283
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,130
But if our guy is Type One

284
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:54,163
and these kids got it passed on
from a parent...

285
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,963
All we have to do is contact
these kids' families

286
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,401
and find out which one
is missing a dad.

287
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:00,903
Let me print you the list.

288
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,662
Print two. We'll split up.

289
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:16,802
Mrs. Seaver?
Yes.

290
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:19,732
I'm Dr. Brennan with
the Jeffersonian Institute,

291
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,760
working in collaboration
with the FBI.

292
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:23,131
The FBI?

293
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:24,762
Is this to do with Larry?

294
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,531
That would be your husband
Lawrence Seaver?

295
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:28,932
Raymond's father?

296
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,401
He hasn't answered his
cell phone in days.

297
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,961
I've left so many messages.

298
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,603
Please, come in.

299
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,933
The Northern caribou migrate...
Ray, honey,

300
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,403
we have company.

301
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:41,733
Who's she?

302
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:42,903
Did they find Daddy?

303
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,033
My name is Temperance, Ray,

304
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:47,502
and I'm just here
to ask a few questions.

305
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:51,060
Your husband's been
missing since...?

306
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,400
Thursday.

307
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:53,931
Well, we didn't think
of him as missing.

308
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:56,430
He just left on his business
trip like he does every week.

309
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:58,901
But he never fails to
at least call us back.

310
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,400
That must
have hurt.

311
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,763
Not so much.

312
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:02,930
I'm used to it.

313
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,003
Ray has Brittle Bone.

314
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,332
It's just a mild
form, though,

315
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,460
like Larry's.

316
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,133
You think I could
sign your cast?

317
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,961
Sure.
I'll get a pen.

318
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,503
Mrs. Seaver, I need
to borrow this photo.

319
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:18,703
Okay.

320
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,502
Why?

321
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,803
Well... we found a body.

322
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:26,731
Oh, God.

323
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,102
Sorry I couldn't
do more.

324
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:34,131
The skullcap was falling apart faster
than I could put a face on it.

325
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,132
I'm not sure we'd have
a match either way

326
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,760
with so little
to work with.

327
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,433
Okay, here we go.
Got our guy.

328
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:40,533
What?

329
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,363
Mother and her daughter
up in Maryland,

330
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,031
Dad missing
since Thursday.

331
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,263
Who's that?

332
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:50,161
Mother  and son
down in Virginia.

333
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,563
Father missing
since Thursday.

334
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,902
Mine's a Lawrence Turner,
35, commercial electrician.

335
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:57,900
Oh...

336
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,931
And I've got
Lawrence Seaver, 35...

337
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:00,902
...my...

338
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,530
...commercial electrician.

339
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,401
...God.

340
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:05,900
I think good old Larry's
got two wives.

341
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,833
More like two lives.

342
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:15,962
And just sure
Jenny takes her meds.

343
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:20,300
And tell her Mommy
will see her in the morning.

344
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:22,433
Thanks, Betty.

345
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:25,900
How old's
your daughter?

346
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,762
Six and a half.

347
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:29,630
She and Larry--

348
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,903
they have a special bond.

349
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:31,900
Brittle Bone?

350
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:34,332
You know about that?

351
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:36,101
She's Type One
like your husband?

352
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,632
He's always felt so guilty
about that.

353
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,930
He really dotes on her,
on both of us.

354
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,533
Mrs. Turner, you husband
ever talk about

355
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,903
any conflicts at work?

356
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,402
Never.

357
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:49,263
Everyone loves Larry.

358
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:51,163
He's fun, smart,

359
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:52,432
hard working.

360
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,501
That's what keeps him
out of town so much.

361
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:55,732
Yeah, about that...

362
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:57,933
I didn't realize electricians
were called upon

363
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,463
to be away from home

364
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:00,601
so much.

365
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,161
There's just so much
underbidding.

366
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:04,503
And it's not like we can
get by on what I make.

367
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:05,531
As...?

368
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:08,101
I teach. Eighth grade science.

369
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:09,360
Got it.

370
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:11,331
So he has
to travel.

371
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,501
Go where
the money is.

372
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:13,762
Not that he
ever complains...

373
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,001
He says it makes

374
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,560
coming home to
us all the more

375
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,662
sweeter he says.

376
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,863
Oh, God.
What are we going to do?

377
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:26,263
Excuse me for one moment.

378
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm so sorry.

379
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,232
These women have to know
the truth about their husband.

380
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,501
- They could be in cahoots.
- Cahoots?

381
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,661
If they somehow found out
that Larry was two-timing,

382
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,362
they could both
want him dead.

383
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:42,800
Okayso what now?

384
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,430
We ask them...?
No, no, no.

385
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,232
It's all taken
care of.

386
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,202
Mrs. Turner, could
you please come with me?

387
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,262
Right this way.

388
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:53,963
Just wait here in
the visitor's lounge.

389
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,360
We won't be long.

390
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,030
Help yourself
to a cup of coffee.

391
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,162
Thank you.

392
00:14:58,237 --> 00:14:59,733
Yeah.

393
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:01,330
That's the
interrogation room.

394
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:02,532
Not tonight.

395
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:11,902
Hmm... nice touch
with the kitty posters.

396
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:12,932
Who are you
talking to?

397
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:13,963
That couple
in there...

398
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,161
Agents Curry
and Moran.

399
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:16,400
They set up
the room.

400
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,802
I'll never drink FBI coffee
again.

401
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:22,030
Whenever you're
ready, Charlie.

402
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:27,561
You know, I almost
married her, you know?

403
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:30,361
Agent Curry?

404
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:33,332
Rebecca... my ex.

405
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:35,761
You can talk about her now.

406
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,203
She got pregnant.

407
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,763
I wanted to do the right thing,
but, you know, she said no.

408
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,630
You've told me this before.

409
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,063
Not that you've ever said why.

410
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:46,003
Well, issues with my job,

411
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:47,903
she wanted to start her
own career,

412
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,763
she wanted to finish
graduate school.

413
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,503
Alone with a baby?

414
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:52,803
Logic, right?

415
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,601
You're applying logic?

416
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:55,702
Do you still love her?

417
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,630
Not... like I did.

418
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,630
Not like that.

419
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:00,261
Then why can't it just be sex?

420
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:03,131
There's nothing "just"
about sex, Bones.

421
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,163
But all mammals need it.

422
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,732
That release
of serotonin,

423
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:08,700
the rush of endorphins.

424
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,661
Naturally, you seek it
with someone

425
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,701
with whom you share
a sexual rapport.

426
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,762
Rapport... right,
that's the word.

427
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:17,133
I know when I'm in need
of a release,

428
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:20,700
there's a former partner or two
I'm sure I could call.

429
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:22,160
Okay, Bones, thanks so much.

430
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:24,333
I feel so much better now.

431
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,561
Here we go.

432
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,502
Help yourself to coffee,
Mrs. Seaver.

433
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,030
Oh, okay.

434
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,502
Very smart.

435
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,230
It's my jobs, Bones.

436
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,303
It's, you know,
what I do for a living.

437
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,831
They don't
seem like...

438
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,861
Wait.

439
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:55,701
They may as well be
in separate rooms.

440
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,133
Making them either
great actresses

441
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:00,700
or in cahoots.

442
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:02,503
Or...

443
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,630
they have no idea
what's going on.

444
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,101
How could these
women not know?

445
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,332
Brennan was pretty
sure that they didn't.

446
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:16,563
And still don't apparently.

447
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,201
Booth wants to wait
to tell them.

448
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:19,360
Wait for what?

449
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,330
To summon the nerve?

450
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,901
Maybe.

451
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,200
I just wouldn't want these women
finding out at the funeral.

452
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,532
I'll take a front row seat
for that.

453
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,000
Sorry.

454
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,331
Did I say that out loud?

455
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:31,830
Have you found anything

456
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,232
resembling a weapon
in the tub yet?

457
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:34,231
Not yet. Why?

458
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:35,233
These skull fragments

459
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,101
may feel like wet cardboard,

460
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:40,230
but I'm pretty sure we're
looking at blunt-force trauma.

461
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll second that.
Roughly V-shaped.

462
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,730
Corner of a 2x4, maybe?

463
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,701
Specks of blood
at the point of impact.

464
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,602
Could have been the lethal blow.

465
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,931
Making him dead before
he was doused with lye.

466
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,463
Oh, happy day.

467
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:54,763
I've isolated our corrosive culprits:
sodium hypochlorite,

468
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:57,903
calcium hypochlorite
and hydrochloric acid.

469
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,260
Each available
at your local market.

470
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:01,263
Lucky the whole tub
didn't explode.

471
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:02,263
It practically did.

472
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,231
Along with teeth,
I keep finding

473
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:05,232
tiny shards
of copper

474
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,733
from the fixtures.

475
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,160
Is that what this is?

476
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,301
No, that would be
a wedding band.

477
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,231
Braided gold and platinum.

478
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,601
Preserved by true love,
no doubt.

479
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:19,303
One metal for each
desperate housewife.

480
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:21,163
People, can we at least fake
some sense of decorum?

481
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,161
I can't help it.

482
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,833
It's so Jerry Springer.

483
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:27,133
First of all, how does anyone juggle
two spouses?

484
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,460
I can think of ways.

485
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,733
Of course, by juggle,
I mean quite literally...

486
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,501
I have a scalpel.

487
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,603
Maybe he dissolved himself

488
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,561
so there'd be more
of him to go around.

489
00:18:35,637 --> 00:18:37,861
I'm going to Hell,
aren't I?

490
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:39,963
I'll save you a seat.

491
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,103
Oh, no, not sweet Mr. Seaver.

492
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,263
It can't be him.

493
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,301
Yeah, well, um...

494
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,500
Is that your
boss in there?

495
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:52,200
I mean, who would do
something like that?

496
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:53,200
Everybody loves the man.

497
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,103
Well, you know, not everyone.

498
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,130
Hey, what's going on?

499
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,163
Mr. Valero, you
won't believe it.

500
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,502
Agent Booth.

501
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:00,233
- We met yesterday.
- It was Mr. Seaver.

502
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,761
That's who was in the bathtub.

503
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,202
Wait. Larry? The electrician?

504
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:05,602
Yeah, Larry the electrician.

505
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,300
Son of a bitch.

506
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:09,662
Now I'm never going
to see my money.

507
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:15,860
You know, I must say, Pete,
you're the first

508
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:18,162
person I've come across
who's ever had a bad word

509
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,231
to say
about Larry.

510
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,030
Yeah, well,
the guy does have a way

511
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,432
with people...
or he did.

512
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,531
I mean, I liked him, too,
before he got all slippery.

513
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:25,931
Slippery?

514
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,700
I fronted the guy 85 grand
to cover electrical supplies.

515
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,131
Last week, I got the inspector
walking around,

516
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:33,101
and she cites me
for cheap materials.

517
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,661
Substandard circuit breakers,

518
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:35,662
insufficient
GFIs...

519
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:37,633
Where'd the 85 grand go?

520
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,201
That's exactly
what I asked Larry.

521
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,231
"Show me receipts," I said.

522
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,231
What do I get?

523
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:43,831
Sob stories--

524
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:47,001
bad bookkeeping, his son's
health, problems with the wife.

525
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:47,803
His wife?

526
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,931
Like I don't got a wife

527
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:50,963
of my own, right?

528
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,403
You know,
you realize,

529
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,260
Pete, that everything that
you're telling me

530
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,661
sounds a lot like motive.

531
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,260
Great.

532
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,763
Do I need a lawyer?

533
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,961
I don't know, you tell me.

534
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:08,732
All right, look, I can't say
that I wasn't angry enough

535
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,360
to want the guy dead,
but like always

536
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:12,430
I fell back
on the old builder's code.

537
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:15,103
- Can't squeeze money from a dead man?
- You know it.

538
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:18,202
Well, you know, as codes go,
it's hardly limited to builders.

539
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,903
No, no, no, it's our code.

540
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,331
You can look it up.

541
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:22,563
No, maybe later.

542
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,003
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have

543
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,300
any of Larry's old
paperwork on file--

544
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,300
accounts, receipts...

545
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,063
Yeah, yeah, sure.

546
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:42,930
I think I've stumbled upon
an anomaly, Dr. Saroyan.

547
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,332
Looks like a splintered
ulna bone.

548
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:46,903
But it's not. It's ivory.

549
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,303
From the tusk
of a small elephant?

550
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,561
I was hoping you'd know.

551
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:50,830
If you notice

552
00:20:50,908 --> 00:20:52,800
these indentations here.

553
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:55,162
Like teeth marks on a pencil.

554
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:57,261
See what Angela
can make of it.

555
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:58,833
And, Zack, after that,
I'll need you

556
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:01,261
to go back to the crime scene
with the photos I'm taking.

557
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:02,961
See what you can find
with the approximate shape

558
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,262
and dimension of this
blunt-force wound.

559
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:06,501
Like a murder weapon?

560
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,230
It needn't look like one.

561
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,161
Anything that replicates
this pattern.

562
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,031
I'm going on
police business.

563
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,201
I'm so proud.

564
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,630
Does he mean, out? In the world?

565
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,233
We'll pin our phone number
on his shirt.

566
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:19,203
What's that you've got there?

567
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:21,662
Well, having finally hit
the very bottom of the tub,

568
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,902
I found it plugged with
a ceramic stopper

569
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:26,402
which I lifted, and voila.

570
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:27,830
What do you make of this?

571
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:32,261
Bones, are you
ready for this?

572
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,601
Did you tell
the wives yet?

573
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,261
No, not yet, but
I did some checking

574
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,300
into two-time Larry's
nances.

575
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:38,532
Under the last name Seaver,

576
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,531
he's got a half million dollar
life insurance policy.

577
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:42,402
Assigning motive
to Gayle Seaver.

578
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,100
However, under
the last name Turner,

579
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,801
he's got a living will leaving everything
to Lila and their daughter.

580
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,302
Giving both
women motive.

581
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:51,063
Right. Which is just a matter of which
one needed the money more

582
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:52,103
than she
needed Larry.

583
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,333
I might be able to help.

584
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:54,563
With what?

585
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,661
A very small used condom?

586
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,833
It's the finger
from a rubber glove.

587
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:01,663
Hodgins just found it wedged
under the tub's drain stopper.

588
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,232
It was spared the corrosive
effects of the lye.

589
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:06,032
Meaning we may be able
to pull a fingerprint

590
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:07,562
from the inside.

591
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:08,760
No maybes about it.

592
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:10,202
If there's a print,
I'll pull it.

593
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:11,262
And when I pull it...

594
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:13,161
We have a killer...

595
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:17,132
It's just standard
procedure, Lila.

596
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:20,861
Just press four fingers
firmly and hold.

597
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:23,103
Our investigation turned up
a print at the crime scene,

598
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,533
and we just need
yours, Gayle,

599
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,900
to avoid any
possible confusion.

600
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,532
This isn't gonna
take long, is it?

601
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,163
Our tech has
the print you pulled.

602
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:34,531
Ring finger, left hand.

603
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:35,562
No, shouldn't take long at all.

604
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:36,660
Just wait here.

605
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,000
Are you sure this is the
best time to tell them?

606
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:39,501
After two days
of nagging me,

607
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,403
just now you're
getting cold feet?

608
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:42,463
What? I do not nag.

609
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,930
Well, you know,
it's an anthropological

610
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:47,360
inevitability for women
to gossip and nag.

611
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:49,533
Can I get anyone a soda?

612
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,101
No, thank you.

613
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,002
Are you on my
husband's case, too?

614
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,001
No, I don't work here.

615
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:57,402
You're the, um,

616
00:22:57,465 --> 00:22:58,903
the lady from the waiting room.

617
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,200
You gave me a tissue.

618
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,532
Oh, yeah.

619
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,500
That was you?
Yeah.

620
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,400
Sorry, I'm a little out of it.

621
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,933
Yeah, I know how that feels.

622
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,932
Actually, ladies, let me
make some introductions.

623
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:11,862
Gayle Seaver.
Lila Turner.

624
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:13,100
Lila, Gayle.
Hi.

625
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:15,360
Lila, that was
very sweet of you.

626
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:17,701
- I'd just lost my husband.
- You did?

627
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:20,101
So did I.

628
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,130
Actually, that's...

629
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,230
why you're both
here really,

630
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:25,362
um, for the same reason...

631
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,232
for the same husband.

632
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,602
I'm sorry?
Yeah.

633
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,732
Me, too.
What Agent Booth's

634
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:35,130
trying to say is that
your husbands, Larry...

635
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,860
are the same Larry.

636
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,302
This will help.

637
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,633
A little show and tell.

638
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,130
Well, this is wrong.

639
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:50,433
It's a joke.

640
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:51,562
A sick joke.

641
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,003
Actually, it's not...
It's a sick joke.

642
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:54,103
My Larry would never...

643
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,101
Your Larry?
Yes, my Larry.

644
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,501
He's my husband.
What are you talking about?

645
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,061
I've been married to him
for 11 years.

646
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,730
Okay, let's sit.

647
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,263
Everyone, just sit down.

648
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,402
This is ridiculous.

649
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:06,963
Fine.

650
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:08,232
I can't believe it.

651
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,330
Booth. Yeah.

652
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:19,233
I'm sorry.
I can't imagine...

653
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:20,803
Who's kid is this?

654
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:21,832
Who's little girl is that?

655
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:22,932
Are you sure?

656
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:24,533
Thanks.

657
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,502
the print we found
on the rubber glove

658
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:32,100
at the crime scene,
it doesn't match either wife.

659
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,763
So it's back
to square one.

660
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:37,260
You sure I can't get
anyone a soda?

661
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:43,100
Hey, Dr. Brennan, right?

662
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,602
Rebecca, hi.

663
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:45,663
Is he in there?

664
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:49,033
He is, but it's
not a good time.

665
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:51,561
Not that my powers
of discernment

666
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:53,803
have ever been particularly
sharp, vis-a-vis

667
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,860
good times from bad,
but in this instance,

668
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:57,460
it's bad.

669
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:00,631
And I thought Seeley
was exaggerating about you.

670
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:01,901
With regard to...?

671
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:03,101
Just tell him
to give me a call.

672
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,500
Hey.

673
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:11,333
Can I ask you something?

674
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:12,900
Why did you say no?

675
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:14,433
Excuse me?

676
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:16,162
When he asked you
to marry him.

677
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:18,360
I mean, he seems
an ideal candidate--

678
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:21,103
strong, alpha male,
good protective instincts.

679
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,163
And I should discuss
this with you, why?

680
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:26,961
It's just...
I'm not sure he knows.

681
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:29,432
And... I think
it bothers him.

682
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,133
I've always taken
care of myself.

683
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,633
To a fault sometimes.

684
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:42,901
And when we got pregnant,
Seeley proposed.

685
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,163
But I didn't want to
be one of those women

686
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,903
who gets married
out of need.

687
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,800
So I said no.

688
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,162
I can see that.

689
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:53,260
By the time that I realized
I'd made a mistake,

690
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:56,203
that I'd still be
the same person...

691
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:59,860
I think there's a moment
for two people,

692
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:02,962
a single moment where
they can either catch fire

693
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:05,700
or...

694
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,000
Seeley and I?

695
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,601
We missed our moment.

696
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,062
Do you understand?

697
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,660
I'm trying, but...

698
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,201
the single moment thesis
doesn't explain...

699
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:17,261
Why we still get together.

700
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:19,832
Fall together really.

701
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:26,100
Because I think that we just
feel what used to be there.

702
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,862
And we miss it.

703
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:30,862
I think Booth inks
you didn't marry him

704
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:32,531
because he wouldn't
make a good father.

705
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:33,731
What?

706
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,661
He worries
about it himself--

707
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:39,360
what he does for a living,
his past as a sniper.

708
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:41,701
Oh, God.

709
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,660
Uh, do me a favor.

710
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:48,162
Don't tell him that
I came by, okay?

711
00:26:48,238 --> 00:26:49,401
Please?

712
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:02,433
Man, what I would've given
to have been a fly on the wall

713
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:03,600
when you told
those wives.

714
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:05,602
You would've been swatted,
trust me.

715
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:07,701
No match on the prints

716
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,533
from our nationwide
database either.

717
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:11,061
Well, at least
we can assume our killer

718
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,031
was a first-time offender.

719
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:13,101
Great.
Thanks, Bones.

720
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,260
That narrows it down.

721
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:15,333
So I hear you're back
with your ex.

722
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,730
Don't look at me.

723
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:19,063
Your son must
be thrilled.

724
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,863
I mean, I know
I may thumb my nose

725
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,031
at the hypocrisy of marriage

726
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,160
as a sacred institution,

727
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:24,631
but I think a boy
truly benefits...

728
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:27,161
I am not back with my ex.

729
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:29,333
Let me finish.
A boy truly benefits

730
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,533
from knowing where his parents
stan... together or not.

731
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,930
Like, I once had this
dancer down in Miami

732
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:35,700
and her stage name
was Abbey Road.

733
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:36,930
Anyway, she had a kid,
too, right?

734
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,400
That'll do, Ringo.

735
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:40,003
I think I scored,
Dr. Brennan.

736
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:41,801
Somebody just kill me
right now.

737
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,861
Dr. Saroyan sent me back
to the crime scene.

738
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:47,063
That's a junction box with
a single brown hair embedded.

739
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:48,200
This at floor level?

740
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,231
Across from where
the bathtub had been.

741
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:53,362
You'll find its contours
match our trauma wound.

742
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,531
Then let's see if this hair's
a match for Larry.

743
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:57,832
Before you go...

744
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:59,931
are we sure these copper
bits are from the tub?

745
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,400
I assumed they'd
come off the fixtures.

746
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,600
Yeah, but the drain, the faucet
and the spigots,

747
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,402
they're all pristine
outside a scratch or two.

748
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:07,000
Let me see that.

749
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,761
That's birdshot.
Or it was.

750
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,730
Compressed copper that's
frangible, so it breaks apart

751
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:14,061
on impact.
Could they kill a man?

752
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:15,263
Well, I think our vice president

753
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:16,901
disproved that possibility.

754
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,630
Look, any ammo at close range

755
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,633
will do the job.
At the very least,

756
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:23,261
a gunshot would've sent Larry
flying causing his head

757
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,531
to hit this
junction box.

758
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:25,631
Which given his condition...

759
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,760
Would be fatal.

760
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:33,733
Okay.

761
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,961
What you thought were
teeth marks, Dr. Saroyan,

762
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:39,031
turned out to be
Chinese characters

763
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,063
engraved along
the side.

764
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,660
What do they say?

765
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:44,863
They say "What make foolish
man think I speak Chinese?"

766
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:47,061
I thought you were
half Chinese.

767
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:48,601
And I think you're
half Swedish.

768
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,801
Let's hear some Swedish.

769
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:51,501
What is it,
Angela, please?

770
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:53,430
It's a chopstick.

771
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,263
Only it's not the
kind you eat with.

772
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:56,601
There's another kind?

773
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,660
Well, you wouldn't comb
your hair with a fork,

774
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,130
would you?
My hair?

775
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,201
All right, look,
the one character

776
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:04,231
that I was able to
translate off the Internet

777
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:05,601
is the word "beauty"

778
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:08,460
And I realized
it's meant for hair.

779
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:10,202
Where you twist it in a bun
and stick this through

780
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,261
to hold it in place.

781
00:29:11,338 --> 00:29:12,831
But if that's what this is,

782
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:15,331
we can be pretty sure
it wasn't Larry's.

783
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:18,161
Thanks.

784
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:20,133
Roommate says she went
to go meet some friends

785
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,330
at the Beltway Burger.

786
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:23,660
And you think it's this
Chloe girl because...?

787
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:24,730
The chopsticks.

788
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,731
As soon as Cam
said it, I knew it.

789
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,103
'Cause when I went
to go see Pete,

790
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:29,831
she had chopsticks in
the back of her hair.

791
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,331
And how did Hodgins find out?

792
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:32,433
I'm sorry?

793
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:34,032
Yeah, "I hear you're
back with your ex"

794
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,231
I don't know.

795
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,501
I assume it was Cam.

796
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,462
I was only trying to engage her
in social intercourse.

797
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:39,531
Excuse me?

798
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:40,861
Just trying to be normal.

799
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,560
Congenial exchange
with a coworker.

800
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:45,800
If that's what gossip is,
I don't like it at all.

801
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah, you think you don't like
it, I can't st...

802
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:49,262
There it is.

803
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:51,061
Beltway Burger.

804
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:10,231
Hey, Chloe.

805
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,200
Meeting some friends?
Oh, hi.

806
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:14,032
You're that FBI guy.

807
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:18,502
Yes, I'm the FBI guy.

808
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,260
So you worship at the temple
of Beltway Burger, too, huh?

809
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:22,760
Yeah, on occasion.

810
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:25,560
I may be 90% vegetarian,
but the burgers?

811
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:27,062
Can't get enough
of them lately.

812
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,460
How many weeks are you?

813
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,563
Excuse me?

814
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:31,602
Pregnant.

815
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,431
I could tell by your gait.

816
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,131
Your ilia, they've
already started shifting

817
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,431
to widen the birth canal.

818
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,300
You can tell that?

819
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:39,830
So you are pregnant?

820
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,803
14 weeks.

821
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:43,932
Booth...

822
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,333
Chloe's friends.

823
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:46,561
Chloe's friends.

824
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:47,731
Taking the kids out

825
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,302
for a little late
night snack, ladies.

826
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:52,402
Don't tell me...

827
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:53,930
Larry is father...

828
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:04,600
???

829
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,902
designed for kids
with special needs--

830
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,531
rubber surfacing,
high-backed swings...

831
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:13,031
I took Ray there last week,
and Lila was there with Jenny.

832
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:15,460
The kids started playing,
we started talking,

833
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:17,502
and one topic led to another.

834
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,432
Small world.

835
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,101
Yeah. Too small.

836
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,232
What about Chloe?

837
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,100
Well, after we got over
the initial shock--

838
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:27,002
like yesterday, but real--

839
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,833
we decided to followed Larry

840
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:30,402
to work the
next morning.

841
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,260
Straight to a motel,
where Chloe was waiting.

842
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:33,662
And, if that
wasn't enough

843
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:35,060
to make our heads explode,

844
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:38,361
we then had to find out
about Chloe's... condition.

845
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:41,231
At which point you knew
it was time to confront Larry.

846
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:43,531
I had no idea that
Larry was married.

847
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:44,833
Let alone twice.

848
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:46,732
But, since your
prints match the one

849
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:48,060
left in the rubber glove,

850
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:49,931
we assume it wasn't long
before you found out.

851
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:52,331
We checked your phone records,
Gayle, and, uh...

852
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:54,331
you didn't leave
Larry any messages

853
00:31:54,406 --> 00:31:55,861
after Friday night.

854
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:57,060
The night you, Lila

855
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:59,560
and Chloe told him
you were going to see him...

856
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:01,201
together... to get answers.

857
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:04,533
So you found Larry at his job,
you shot him point blank,

858
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,133
and you dragged his sorry
ass back to the bathtub.

859
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:08,303
Where you doused him

860
00:32:08,368 --> 00:32:11,030
in sodium hypochlorite,
calcium hypochlorite...

861
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:12,833
Or, as you and I like
to call them:

862
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:15,231
bleach and Quick-E-Plumber.

863
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,363
Which,
as an eighth grade teacher,

864
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:17,530
you knew would do the trick.

865
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,203
Simple Earth Science.

866
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:21,261
Look, all that's true,
but we didn't kill him.

867
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:22,563
Really? Then who did?

868
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:23,860
He killed himself.

869
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:24,730
He killed himself.

870
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:25,862
He killed himself.

871
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,760
Larry was dead
when you got there?

872
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:30,902
On the bathroom floor.

873
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:32,001
The gun was still in his mouth.

874
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:33,130
The coward must freaked

875
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:34,761
at the thought
of facing us together.

876
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:37,560
If we had surprised him,
maybe he would still be alive.

877
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:39,762
Back up. Are you saying that
the gun was still in his mouth?

878
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:43,333
His finger was on the trigger.
It was awful.

879
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:44,801
And where is the gun now?

880
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:48,660
I buried it in my backyard.

881
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,833
That's a good place for it.

882
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,260
Unbelievable.

883
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:56,433
Yeah. You got
that right.

884
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,561
You know what?
They're lying.

885
00:32:57,637 --> 00:32:58,833
How do you know?

886
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,163
Come on. They've been
lying since day one.

887
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:02,130
Between all of them, they should
have a dozen Oscars by now.

888
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:03,430
I know what those are.

889
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:04,802
Come on.
Suicide? Uh-uh.

890
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:07,131
Birdshot or not, okay,
every self-inflicted I've seen,

891
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,461
the guy shoots himself
and he drops the gun. Right?

892
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:11,601
It's an automatic reaction.
Bang, drop.

893
00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:13,500
There's no way the gun
ends up in his mouth.

894
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:15,532
Then we'd better go
dig up that gun.

895
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:17,000
Seeley?

896
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:19,033
I'll get the
ball rolling.

897
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,132
Was that Dr. Brennan?

898
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:25,632
Uh-huh.
Why are you here?

899
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,060
I need to know
if you're going

900
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:28,660
to coach Parker's
T-ball team this year.

901
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,830
You know I always
coach Parker's T-ball team.

902
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:32,130
I didn't want
to assume...

903
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:35,231
What is going on here, Rebecca,
okay? Because, listen.

904
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,261
I thought we agreed here,
we cannot end up

905
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:38,763
groping each other
in the FBI closet.

906
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,301
We can't do that.

907
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:43,262
We're done.
I know.

908
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:45,531
Really?

909
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,700
Seeley, all the
excuses I gave you

910
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:49,762
for not wanting
to get married...

911
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:52,462
- my independence, your work...
- I know.

912
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:54,703
No, you don't.

913
00:33:56,538 --> 00:34:00,302
You are
a wonderful father.

914
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:04,802
And Parker
is a lucky kid.

915
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:08,803
Such a lucky kid.

916
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:10,461
And, obviously,

917
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:13,300
we still have feelings
for each other.

918
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:19,131
Do you still
want to marry me?

919
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:23,931
Rebecca...

920
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,632
No. I don't.

921
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,633
I don't want to
marry you either.

922
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,663
Here are the
forms for T-ball.

923
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:42,132
I'll miss you.

924
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:45,531
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going
to miss you, too.

925
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,531
You know what I'm
going to miss most?

926
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:52,561
Yeah, but let's not go there.

927
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,731
Okay. DNA on the barrel confirms

928
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:12,562
it was in Larry's mouth
at some point.

929
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:14,632
Yeah, well, I still don't
buy it, you know?

930
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:16,931
The kickback alone
would have forced it out.

931
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,403
Unless he was dead
before the shot.

932
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:23,201
Well, yeah, that's true,
but, uh... Wait. What?

933
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,930
The inside of Larry's skull

934
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:26,861
is pitted, which I had
always attributed

935
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:28,461
to the effects of the lye.

936
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:32,201
But each tiny hole matches
perfectly with the birdshot,

937
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,101
right down to these
specks of copper.

938
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,901
You're saying
it was suicide?

939
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:39,560
I would, except these holes
are void of blood,

940
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,963
which would suggest
they were inflicted

941
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:42,632
after blood stopped pumping

942
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,132
through Larry's head.

943
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,801
No. Keep talking.
I'll... I'll catch up.

944
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:49,762
Unlike this blunt force trauma,
no shortage of blood here,

945
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,732
proving he was dead

946
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:53,332
before he was shot.

947
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:56,503
So now we're talking
about a faked homicide

948
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,331
to cover up a faked suicide?

949
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:01,001
A faked suicide meant
to cover up an actual,

950
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:02,702
original murder.

951
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:05,102
Oh, just when you think things
couldn't get any more twisted...

952
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,932
How's this for a curveball?

953
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,432
...in walks Cam.

954
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:11,703
After retrieving and reassembling every
tooth from that tub,

955
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,600
I now discover I have one extra.

956
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,462
This is not a tooth.
It's a crown.

957
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,730
Exactly. Any of your women

958
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:19,631
- happen to be missing one?
- Not that I could see.

959
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:22,103
Well, it wouldn't
be theirs anyway.

960
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:23,361
It's sized for a man.

961
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:24,662
I knew that.

962
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:26,400
A man's tooth,
and it's not Larry's?

963
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,962
It's not a tooth.

964
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:31,333
It's a crown, whereby a dentist
files down an existing tooth...

965
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,162
I know what a crown is, Bones.

966
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:38,662
Except Pete called it
a root canal.

967
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:41,000
Pete.

968
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:48,401
Well, look who's here.

969
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:49,802
Returning
to the scene of the crime.

970
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:51,531
Funny. You know, I was going
to say that to you.

971
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,632
Okay, boys, that's
lunch. Let's go.

972
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:56,000
Why? No, no. I'm...
I'm talking about that.

973
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,700
Look at my wall there.
Who's going to pay for that?

974
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,930
Let's find out.
Smile for me, Pete.

975
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:02,662
Whoa! Back off!
What's this about?

976
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,330
Temporary crown,
maxillary central incisor.

977
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:05,763
Turn around, Pete.

978
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,602
Like I have the slightest idea
how Larry got in that tub?

979
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,933
Actually, on that detail,
we're quite sure you don't.

980
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:11,101
Making that look on your face

981
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,800
when you saw it
all the more priceless.

982
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:15,532
It's because I didn't know
what I was...

983
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,863
Well, let me tell you
what I know, Pete, okay?

984
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:19,103
I know Larry
owed you 85 grand.

985
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,660
So, Friday night,
you come here to have a little talk

986
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:23,231
to him about it and,
about the same time,

987
00:37:23,305 --> 00:37:26,433
he gets a phone call
from his very unhappy wives.

988
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,830
Wives?
Yeah. Which puts Larry

989
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:29,731
in a really bad place.

990
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:30,761
So, when you ask him,

991
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:32,302
"Hey, you know,
where's my money?",

992
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:34,032
he pretty much blows you off.

993
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:36,831
Like he has more important
things to worry about.

994
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,530
Bad enough
that Larry rips you off,

995
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,203
but he disrespects you
on top of it?

996
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:41,931
That's not going
to happen in this lifetime.

997
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:43,003
So it got physical.

998
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,762
Larry knocked your crown loose,

999
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:46,903
and you shoved him down here,

1000
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:50,863
where he hit his head
on the socket casing.

1001
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,460
I... I... I swear,
he didn't land hard.

1002
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,401
With his O.I. condition,
didn't matter.

1003
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:57,601
Wouldn't take much.

1004
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,261
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

1005
00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:02,502
So sorry you had to cover it up?

1006
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:04,732
Stick a cheap shotgun in
his mouth, pull the trigger.

1007
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:06,262
Make manslaughter
look like suicide.

1008
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,601
The guy had ripped

1009
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,263
me off for enough.
I couldn't let him ruin me, too.

1010
00:38:10,337 --> 00:38:11,301
And you can live with that?

1011
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:13,300
A person can live with anything

1012
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:15,932
if they don't think too hard.

1013
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:18,263
Let's try this again, Pete.
Turn around.

1014
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,233
How did he get
in the tub?

1015
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:22,501
It's been
driving me nuts.

1016
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,931
Know what?
Try not to think about it.

1017
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:29,963
The irony that I cannot think
of a single woman

1018
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:32,633
who would want three husbands.

1019
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,160
Good thing.
A guy would never

1020
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:35,800
be stupid enough
to let it happen.

1021
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:37,500
Excuse me.

1022
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,133
These women were not stupid.

1023
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:40,530
And that is completely gross.

1024
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:42,433
But comfy.

1025
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,030
Welcome back, by the way.

1026
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:47,100
What?
After two days

1027
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:49,833
of inappropriate comments,
you're back to judging me

1028
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:51,131
for gross behavior.

1029
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:52,503
When am I ever
appropriate?

1030
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:55,663
Good point. Maybe it was just
the judging me I missed.

1031
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:58,803
Ah! The woman I know and love.

1032
00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:03,900
In a purely nonromantic,
happy-to-be-judged way.

1033
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:07,330
Well...

1034
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:08,931
Anyway...
These women.

1035
00:39:09,006 --> 00:39:10,033
Right. Not stupid.

1036
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:12,233
And, frankly,

1037
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,530
that they allowed themselves
to be duped

1038
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,330
is a sad statement on how lean
the market is out there.

1039
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,301
I resent that. I'm out there.

1040
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,130
You certainly are.

1041
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,433
How "not stupid"
could these women have been

1042
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,802
to think that they could
get away with faking a murder?

1043
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:27,800
Or how compassionate
were they to recognize

1044
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,601
that they were all
in the same boat,

1045
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,001
so why let Larry take
his insurance money with him?

1046
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,031
Yeah. A lot of good
it will do them in jail.

1047
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:40,333
So you never said how
it ended up with Rebecca.

1048
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:42,631
Well, yeah, it ended.

1049
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,502
Only time we'll ever
spend together is with Parker.

1050
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,001
You sure that's what you want?

1051
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,633
You know what, Bones? It might
be all anthropology to you,

1052
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:51,331
but there are certain people
that you can't just sleep with.

1053
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:54,633
I mean, you can pretend
that it's just sex.

1054
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:55,633
You can lie to yourself,

1055
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:57,333
and you can say
that it's all good,

1056
00:39:57,405 --> 00:40:00,063
but there are just
too many strings,

1057
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:02,500
and too much at stake,

1058
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,261
you know?

1059
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,032
Too much to lose.

1060
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:11,202
Yeah. I can see that.

1061
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:15,233
It's over, you know?

1062
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:19,431
I'd appreciate, you know,
you supporting that.

1063
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:22,360
I will. And, if you should slip,

1064
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:26,333
I will keep my mouth shut
about it.

1065
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:28,000
Thank you.

1066
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:29,930
But, I mean,
it's not like I'm going...

1067
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,700
No, I mean with anybody.

1068
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:34,261
I'm sure Rebecca's
not your only option

1069
00:40:34,336 --> 00:40:38,263
for satisfying biological urges.

1070
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:44,201
Please tell me

1071
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:45,802
these women are
not going to jail.

1072
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,303
After trying to bilk
the insurance system,

1073
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:48,860
I imagine they'll get nothing less
than a firing squad.

1074
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:51,003
Not if they never filed a claim.

1075
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:53,231
Because our friends
here caught them.

1076
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:55,200
You're both
kind of right.

1077
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,762
Given their kids,
and the circumstances,

1078
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,032
the DA is going
to offer probation

1079
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:01,060
provided that
all three women

1080
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:03,961
show remorse
and attend mandatory counseling.

1081
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:05,431
In exchange for
movie rights, I hope.

1082
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,131
You know they're
going to get calls.

1083
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:10,101
I hope so.

1084
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,201
Hey, nice going, by the way.

1085
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:13,760
Cam tells me
you're back with your ex.

1086
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:16,030
Cam?
Mmm.

1087
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:19,032
Cam in her office?

1088
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:23,600
I said something wrong.

1089
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,131
Would it be gossip
if I told you?

1090
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,662
I hope so.

1091
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:52,300
That was, uh...

1092
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:54,500
That was...

1093
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:57,263
Wicked.
Yeah.

1094
00:41:57,335 --> 00:41:58,761
And a huge mistake.

1095
00:41:58,838 --> 00:42:01,033
Not if we don't do it again.

1096
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:02,600
Deal.

1097
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:03,631
Deal.

1098
00:42:03,706 --> 00:42:05,730
After tonight, I mean.

1099
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,661
Never again.

1100
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,160
No.
