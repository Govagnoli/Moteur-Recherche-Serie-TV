1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,367
I'm Stacey Goodyear,
and joining me on <i>Wake Up, DC!</i>

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,134
is Dr. Temperance Brennan.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,767
She's the author of the
best-selling mystery novel

4
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,967
 <i>Bred in the Bone.</i>

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,434
And she's also-- now, tell
me if I get this wrong--

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,901
an anthropologist who works
with the FBI to solve crimes?

7
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,801
Yes, that's correct.

8
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:26,701
I use the bones of people
who have been murdered

9
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:29,467
or burned, or blown up,

10
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:34,967
or eaten by animals or insects,
or just decomposed...

11
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,967
Well, that's exciting.

12
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:40,101
Uh, Dr. Brennan,
your book

13
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:43,500
has sold over
300,000 copies.

14
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,333
How do you juggle twin careers
as a best-selling author

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,534
and crime-fighting scientist?

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,667
Well, I do one then the other.

17
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,333
And is the work enjoyable?

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,767
I mean, the part involving
rotten bodies?

19
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,534
Enjoyable?

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,534
Satisfying, yes,

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,101
like cracking a code,
but in general,

22
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,901
when you're looking
at someone

23
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,967
who has been brutally murdered,
it's complicated.

24
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:16,101
( <i>laughing</i> ):
'Cause I just thought,
you know, ugh.

25
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:20,801
Doesn't leave you much time

26
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,367
for a personal
life, does it?

27
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:29,068
It's true I'm more focused
on my career right now.

28
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,367
Most of our viewers

29
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:32,300
are parents,

30
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,434
home with their
pre-school age children.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,200
What will you
tell your kids

32
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:40,967
about the horrors
that you see every day?

33
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,034
I'm not going to have
any children.

34
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,001
Really?

35
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:47,667
Yes, really.

36
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:58,534
Do you have any advice
for budding authors out there?

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,068
Well, the first thing
they should have is an idea,

38
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,701
and then...

39
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,701
Well, first you need something
to write with.

40
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,367
They-they know that.

41
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:11,834
Well, obviously, you need
a writing instrument

42
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:15,068
and you need an idea.

43
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,867
I'm just not sure

44
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,034
which should come first.

45
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:24,200
The book is <i>Bred in the Bone,</i>
by Dr. Temperance Brennan.

46
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:28,267
Next up after the break,
wicker, the new leather.

47
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,534
But is it safe
for your children?

48
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,534
How was I?

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,467
We'll talk about
it on the way.

50
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,034
On the way where?

51
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,367
State troopers called
in the fire department

52
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,134
to put out a burning car,
and they found a body

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,634
in the driver's seat.

54
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,667
License plate and
the VIN are missing.

55
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,767
Why is the FBI involved?

56
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,600
BOOTH:
Well, one burned backpack,
child-sized sneaker,

57
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,701
plus the right side
rear seat belt went missing.

58
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,333
Sliced away.

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,934
You think it was a kidnapping?

60
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,767
I have to act that way.

61
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,567
The first 48 hours after
a child abduction are crucial.

62
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:11,034
That's why you're here.

63
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,168
You ID that victim,
maybe that tells me

64
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,333
what kid I'm looking for.

65
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:29,767
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-lanmao

66
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,667
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-lanmao
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-</font>

67
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,600
ADDY:
Shoe size four.

68
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,734
It's a school bag,
but the contents are burned

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,934
beyond recognition.

70
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,167
What about the human remains?

71
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,600
Victim was female.

72
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,600
Her skull shows
combined Caucasoid

73
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,301
and Mongoloid
features.

74
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,934
Also, preauricular
sulcus to the pelvis

75
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,867
shows the victim gave birth
five to eight years ago.

76
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:11,434
The kidnapping victim
could be her child.

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,600
Maxillary molars
have been pulled

78
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,234
and replaced with
removable dentures,

79
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:16,867
lots of gold.

80
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:18,468
In parts of the Caucasus,

81
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,368
when girls from wealthy families
turn 16,

82
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:24,434
they are given gold teeth
as a display of affluence.

83
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,034
I'll dissolve a bicuspid
in nitric acid

84
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,734
and do a
chemical work-up.

85
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
There's something lodged
in the larynx.

86
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,633
Part of her tongue?

87
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,368
Not fleshy enough for tongue--
this is cartilage.

88
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,800
GOODMAN:
Dr. Brennan, Mr. Addy,

89
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,967
this is Ms. Pickering.

90
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,001
She's performing
a security review for
the State Department.

91
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,834
One man's security review
is another man's witch hunt.

92
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,134
That would be Dr. Jack Hodgins.

93
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,700
It would be, yes.
You know us all, don't
you, Ms. Pickering?

94
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:55,800
Or is it Agent Pickering from
the National Security Agency?

95
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,368
I don't yet know you
as well as I will, Dr. Hodgins.

96
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,167
Is something burning?

97
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,600
ADDY:
Not anymore.

98
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,867
She's pretty much
extinguished by now.

99
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,834
Ms. Pickering will
require a few minutes
of everyone's time

100
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,834
to perform a routine
security review.

101
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,167
I expect everyone
to be cooperative.

102
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,101
I'm not swearing
any damn loyalty oath.

103
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,567
And civil.

104
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,101
BRENNAN:
Send this to Dr. Chen
in Pathology.

105
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,468
Ask him to identify it
as soon as possible.

106
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,500
Dr. Brennan?

107
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,401
Yes, security check, civil.

108
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,067
Zack will grind a segment
of the femur,

109
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:24,301
so you can perform

110
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:25,434
trace element
analysis.

111
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,468
Didn't I see you on television

112
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,301
this morning, Dr. Brennan?

113
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:30,967
How could I possibly know
what you watched on television?

114
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,401
Booth, I have to talk to you.

115
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:35,734
Yeah, it was definitely her.

116
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,500
Maybe work your way up
to Dr. Brennan.

117
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:38,334
BOOTH:
How close are you

118
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,401
to IDing the burn victim?

119
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:40,700
I may be
jumping the gun, but...

120
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,167
That's music to my ears.

121
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,967
Well, considering
this 48-hour thing,

122
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,301
we should be looking
at Eastern European immigrants

123
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:46,834
going back, say, ten years.

124
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,600
I can get that
information for you.

125
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,267
Angela doing a facial
reconstruction?
Yes.

126
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,734
You know, if this works,
I'm gonna buy you a puppy.

127
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,934
That would be inadvisable.
You never told me how I was

128
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,900
this morning. I asked you,
"How did I do?" and you said,

129
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,900
"We'll talk about it
in the car," but we didn't.

130
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:00,334
This was your
first TV interview?

131
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,834
Yes.

132
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,067
It was fine, you know...
for your first interview.

133
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:06,667
Well, that was
a qualified response.

134
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,034
What? No.

135
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,767
It was lively, yeah.

136
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,800
Lively?
What kind of word is that?

137
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,967
It's an adjective,
though, ironically,

138
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:16,267
most words that end
in "ly" are adverbs.

139
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,900
Like "ironically."

140
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:21,434
Okay, what did I do wrong?

141
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,368
Maybe next time,
tell a funny story.

142
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:25,567
Oh, and never say you
don't like children.

143
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,101
I didn't say
I don't <i>like</i> children.

144
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,334
I just said
I don't want any.

145
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,468
On TV, it's
the same thing.

146
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,167
The victim's skull
was in good shape,

147
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:39,401
no real shrinkage from the fire.

148
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,301
Okay, I'm running a comparison

149
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,301
between the facial
reconstruction and the photos

150
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:45,867
in the immigration database.

151
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,633
I hear we're all
going to get grilled

152
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,267
by some mysterious
government chick.

153
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:54,001
I've been through this before.

154
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,301
It's so we can work
on classified cases.

155
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:57,234
CIA, military...

156
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,834
You have something to hide?

157
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,334
Better believe it, bucko.

158
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:01,667
What kind of something?

159
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:02,700
The best kind.

160
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,334
There, that one.

161
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,301
Okay.

162
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,434
It's a good match.

163
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,700
Polina Rozalina Semov,
born 1970,

164
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,201
Cherdyn, Perm district
of the Urals.

165
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,667
She immigrated
to the U.S.

166
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:27,800
in '94 with her
sister Maria,

167
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,500
married Carl Decker.

168
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,967
They live in Cleveland Park.

169
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,234
Children?

170
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:37,700
Donovan Dimitri Decker,
born 1997.

171
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,301
He's eight years old.

172
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,767
BRENNAN:
 <i>Polina and Carl separated</i>

173
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,434
 <i>three months ago.</i>

174
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,301
 <i>Separate addresses</i>
 <i>for Mom and Dad.</i>

175
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,734
Well, we know that Mom
is in a drawer in your lab.

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,234
Let's go find Dad.

177
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,867
You arrest someone
really small lately?

178
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,967
Car seat in the back.

179
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,533
Oh. I had Parker
for the weekend.

180
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,167
Don't know how you do that.

181
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:57,633
Install a car seat
in an FBI vehicle?

182
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,734
Bring a kid into this world,
knowing what you know.

183
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,867
Oh, but Parker

184
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,800
was an accident,
right?

185
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,533
Because his mother wouldn't
marry you?

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,401
( <i>chuckles</i> )
What?

187
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,334
It never occurred to you that
that might be a sensitive topic?

188
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,301
Well, you could have gone
with the very small felon story.

189
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,301
I'm better for Parker
being in the world.

190
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,101
Someday, you
will see that.

191
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,900
No, I won't.
You'll change your mind.

192
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,867
I don't do that.
You will.

193
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,667
Yeah, maybe after I see how Carl
Decker reacts

194
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:21,368
when you tell him his wife
is dead

195
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,767
and his child
has been kidnapped.

196
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,301
Well, statistically speaking,

197
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,034
we're going to find Donovan
with his dad.

198
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,734
What? Why?

199
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,468
Why? Because most kidnappings
happen by estranged spouses.

200
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,567
Ah, you're certainly making
the whole domestic scene

201
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,101
more and more attractive.

202
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:37,067
This is it?

203
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,034
Yep, this is
the correct address.

204
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,867
You just hang back and let
me do all the talking, okay?

205
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,134
Mr. Decker.

206
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,301
Bones, what
are you doing?

207
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,401
What?

208
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh, it's tidy, Spartan even.

209
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,834
Is that odd
for a recently separated man?

210
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,334
Guy's supposed to be

211
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,600
some super-rational
tight-ass geek.

212
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,834
No offense.

213
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
There's no TV,

214
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,734
no magazines, no art,

215
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,034
no stereo.

216
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:13,734
There's dust on everything.

217
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,167
I don't think he's been here
in a while.

218
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,201
Where are you going?

219
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,001
Booth?

220
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,434
Where are you going?

221
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,468
FBI!

222
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,267
U.S. Marshals!

223
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,301
U.S. Marshals?

224
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,401
Forensic anthropologist!

225
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,267
That's why no gun.

226
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:46,888
 Well, at least nobody
 got shot. Probably 'cause
 <i>she</i> didn't have a gun.

227
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,520
Sir, why is
Carl Decker's home

228
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:51,654
being watched by U.S. Marshals?

229
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,154
Carl Decker is a federal witness
under Witness Protection.

230
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,921
He's scheduled to appear
before a grand jury in two days.

231
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,454
Is it a mob thing?

232
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,587
Decker designs
body armor for KBC Systems.

233
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,220
He says they knowingly
sent defective armor to Iraq.

234
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,420
The Justice Department
believes him,

235
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,554
so they moved him
to a safe house.

236
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,154
Does the Justice Department
think that Decker's in danger

237
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,353
from the company?

238
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,021
He thinks he is.

239
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,620
They want him to testify,
they play along.

240
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,487
BOOTH:
Well, does Decker know

241
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:19,320
that his wife has been killed,
and his child's been kidnapped?

242
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:21,287
No, and they don't want him
to know.

243
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:23,021
Why?
Because it might prevent him
from testifying.

244
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:24,587
CULLEN:
Their point of view:
there's nothing

245
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:26,121
to be gained from him knowing.

246
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:27,987
BRENNAN:
Except, maybe Decker chooses

247
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,420
not to testify,
and they don't kill his son.

248
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:30,887
Shouldn't that be his decision?

249
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:32,353
CULLEN:
Justice estimates

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,021
that KBC Systems
is directly responsible

251
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:36,154
for 30 deaths and hundreds
of injuries.

252
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,854
They're taking the larger view.

253
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,287
It's complicated.
His wife is dead,

254
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:40,620
and his child is missing.

255
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,487
That's not so complicated.

256
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,121
No one's stopping you
from investigating those crimes.

257
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:47,054
He's a material witness,
I need access to him.

258
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:48,287
CULLEN:
Well, we know

259
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,754
Decker didn't kill his wife.

260
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:51,220
He was in custody
of U.S. Marshals.

261
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,454
So start looking someplace else.

262
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,054
Harsh reality, Booth.

263
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,520
Deal with it.

264
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:00,154
What, does he not like me?

265
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,353
I don't know.

266
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,454
BRENNAN:
 <i>I'll stay on</i>

267
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,687
 <i>Polina Decker's remains,</i>

268
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:05,721
 <i>see if that leads somewhere.</i>

269
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:07,387
BOOTH:
 <i>Yeah, I'll talk</i>
 <i>to the victims' families.</i>

270
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:08,921
At least the ones who aren't
under federal protection.

271
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,154
You think a corporation
would actually kill a woman

272
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,821
and kidnap her child?

273
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,787
Billions in dollars,
plus civil suits

274
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,554
if they're found guilty?

275
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,220
I've seen people killed
for 50 bucks.

276
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,021
You believe
the boy is already dead?

277
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,253
I have to assume
that he isn't.

278
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,987
Why make that assumption?

279
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:24,687
Because it gives me something
to look forward to

280
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:25,854
instead of dread.

281
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,754
Given the choice, I avoid dread.

282
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,253
Okay, that's logical.

283
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,554
Is it?

284
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,520
Why dread something
that hasn't happened yet?

285
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:35,188
Yeah.

286
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,520
ADDY:
 <i>That piece of cartilage</i>

287
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:37,954
we found
in Polina's mouth?

288
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,454
Antihelix and meatus remnants.

289
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,854
It's an ear?

290
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,721
Chen says it was bitten off.

291
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,620
The victim bit off one
of her attacker's ears.

292
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:47,088
I heard someone found
a fingertip in their chili once.

293
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,921
Dr. Chen also found vestiges
of earwax.

294
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:53,821
Okay, get that
wax to Hodgins, see
what he can find.

295
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,687
BOY:
 <i>Why do I have to learn</i>

296
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,021
to ride a bike?

297
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:58,954
Are you really asking?

298
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,487
Or are you
just stalling?

299
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,954
Mm, stalling.

300
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,987
Yeah, I thought so.

301
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,420
Why'd you stop?

302
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,721
What are we hoping to learn
from this tape?

303
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:12,487
We know Carl Decker
didn't kidnap his own child.

304
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:15,253
The mother is dead,
and the boy...

305
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,054
And the boy might be dead, too.

306
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,654
Well, I'm just wondering,

307
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:20,620
what is the benefit
of watching this tape?

308
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:22,987
You put faces to names,
you get a sense of human beings.

309
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,054
Oh, come
on, Bones.

310
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:25,088
You're the anthropologist.

311
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,054
What does this tape tell you?

312
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,387
Learning to ride a bicycle

313
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,353
is a kind of rite of passage.

314
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,353
It has anthropological
significance.

315
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,220
Really?

316
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,554
It carries meaning
beyond the simple mechanics

317
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,487
of learning to ride a bike.

318
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:39,587
Are you being psychological?

319
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:40,821
Definitely not.

320
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,821
Psychology is about
the individual.

321
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,088
I'm speaking to a set
of cultural praxis and mores.

322
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,253
What the hell
are you talking about?

323
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:51,754
The father is tight--
he's holding his arms,

324
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:52,954
touching his mouth.

325
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,854
So he's nervous. So what?

326
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,487
Look at the boy.
He's relaxed.

327
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,420
He's-He's not afraid.

328
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,088
Well, so, then
why was the boy stalling, huh?

329
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,220
He's not.

330
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,154
The father is.

331
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,287
The son understands that
on some level.

332
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:07,387
And he's enabling his father
to reach some level of comfort.

333
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,088
It's a symbiotic relationship.

334
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,387
Relationship. Ha!

335
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,954
That's psychology.

336
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,587
The boy trusts his father
absolutely.

337
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:15,787
He's confident.

338
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:16,887
The father wishes

339
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,121
he didn't have to do this, but

340
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:23,487
he's accepted that he must
in his role as the father.

341
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,654
What?

342
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,054
Probably the same way
Decker felt

343
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,587
about being a whistle-blower.

344
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,420
That's psychology,
and it's of no use to us

345
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:32,154
in this current investigation.

346
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,887
Just push play, okay?

347
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,787
All right, ready?

348
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:38,487
Okay.

349
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:40,054
WOMAN:
Be careful, Donnie.

350
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,554
Don't make him
nervous, Polina.

351
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,921
Push me, Dad.

352
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,454
Let go. Let go!

353
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,787
Not yet.

354
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:48,454
Let me go, Dad!
Let me go!

355
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,021
POLINA:
Not yet! Run along
with him, Carl.

356
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,088
DONOVAN:
I can do it!

357
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,021
( <i>laughing</i> ):
He's doing it.

358
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,253
He's doing it.

359
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:00,353
Be careful. Be careful!

360
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,921
How will we get him back, Carl?

361
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:07,987
That's the real question now,
isn't it, Bones, huh?

362
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,854
How do we get the boy back?

363
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,921
WOMAN:
 <i>They left this morning,</i>
 <i>very early, about 5:00 a.m.</i>

364
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:18,088
Donovan is on the swim team.

365
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,554
Oh, my God...

366
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,154
You and your sister were close?

367
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,654
Yes.

368
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,821
When Polina and Carl separated,

369
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:28,387
she and Donovan came
to stay with me.

370
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:30,821
This is terrible.

371
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:33,154
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt your sister?

372
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,454
It must be Carl.

373
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,620
Maybe he was afraid she would
take Donovan away from him.

374
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:41,954
Would she have done that?

375
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,687
No. Never.

376
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,987
You don't like
your brother-in-law?

377
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,887
He's supposed
to be brilliant, I know.

378
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,921
But he is also cold, angry.

379
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:53,054
Everything
has to be just so.

380
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,487
Why did Carl
and your sister separate?

381
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:58,253
Polina said
he was having affair.

382
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,387
I thought, "Who'd want him?"

383
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,754
But she found
credit card receipts

384
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,987
from a motel he went to once,
sometimes twice a week.

385
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:09,887
When she confronted Carl,
he was furious,

386
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:11,654
wouldn't talk about it.

387
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,454
So, she left him.

388
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:18,520
( <i>crying</i> ):
Please find Donovan.

389
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,021
Find my sister's boy.

390
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,620
I found cracks in the victim's
upper incisors.

391
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,721
There are also
bilateral fractures

392
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,787
in the femoral necks.

393
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,721
There are similar
fractures

394
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,454
in the proximal
humeral heads.

395
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,821
The result of the body going
into spasm as it burned?

396
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:38,454
Well, if she was
burned alive.

397
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,754
I'll have Angela run
some scenarios.

398
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,687
Angela's in her security review.

399
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:44,487
PICKERING:
 <i>25 addresses</i>

400
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,687
in six countries in eight years.

401
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,287
That's weird, right?

402
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:49,620
What were you doing
in all those places?

403
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,088
Different things.

404
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,854
Mostly looking.

405
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:55,821
I'm an artist.

406
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,687
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

407
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,188
My husband?

408
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:00,487
Yes.

409
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:01,721
Oh!

410
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,353
You mean that actually took?

411
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,088
Really, it didn't seem legal.

412
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,754
We were in Fiji.
You know, there was

413
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,121
a fire dance.

414
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,487
You know how those things
can be, right?

415
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,654
I really don't, Ms. Montenegro.

416
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:19,887
Right.

417
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:21,654
Do you like working here?

418
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,687
Sometimes, yeah.

419
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:25,287
Not always.

420
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,320
But there's also a sense
of accomplishment,

421
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,188
and Brennan needs me here,

422
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,121
so I feel
a-a personal connection there,

423
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,253
but, you know,
the world's a big place.

424
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,520
Frankly, I'm-I'm emotionally
ambivalent on the subject.

425
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:42,687
Was that the wrong answer?

426
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:44,754
I should be more, "Oh, this is
the best job in the world,

427
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,188
and I'm proud
to serve my country," right?

428
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:50,587
Right? Am I going
too fast here? I mean,

429
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:52,287
am I treating you too much
like a therapist?

430
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:53,353
Do you want to stop?

431
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,188
Actually, 'cause

432
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,721
we could pick this up later
if you're...

433
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,420
Yeah.

434
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:05,787
Carl Decker is not only
a disgruntled employee,

435
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,620
he's, uh, uh...

436
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,487
What-What's the term?

437
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:12,253
As a lawyer, the, uh,
legal term is,

438
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,921
nuts and a pain
in the ass.

439
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:18,454
Oppositional Defiance Disorder
and paranoia is what I read.

440
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,287
Like I said, nuts and
a pain in the ass.

441
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,921
Read where? Paranoia?

442
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:25,887
You read that where?

443
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,754
You had Carl Decker
investigated?

444
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:31,387
He's making extremely
damaging allegations

445
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,987
against the company.

446
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,854
False allegations.
Can you think of anyone

447
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,921
who'd want to kill his wife
and kidnap his son?

448
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:37,987
It wasn't us.

449
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,088
I didn't say it was.

450
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:40,520
Oh, please.

451
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:42,353
We have to top your list
of suspects.

452
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,921
Look, we-we have an
in-house system

453
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,054
for dealing
with whistle-blowers.

454
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,487
We encourage it.

455
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:49,353
I served in Vietnam,
Agent Booth.

456
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,121
I saw what soldiers see.

457
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:55,620
If I read you correctly,
you know what I mean.

458
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:58,154
Army. 75th Regiment.

459
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,854
Rangers lead the way.

460
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,687
I would never risk the lives
of soldiers

461
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:08,320
by knowingly providing them
with defective armor,

462
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,620
and I welcome Carl
Decker's appearance

463
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,387
at the grand jury,
because he is wrong.

464
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,454
Carl Decker did brilliant work
for us,

465
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,454
but he alienated everyone
he worked with.

466
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,220
You should look
for your murderer

467
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,954
and kidnapper elsewhere.

468
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,487
Where have you been?

469
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm a field agent.
I was out in the field.

470
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,021
What did you find out?

471
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,854
There was a piece of an
ear in the victim's mouth.

472
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,387
It looks like
she bit it off.

473
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,188
The ear could
tell us something.

474
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:36,054
Have you found anything?

475
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,287
A lot. No reason
for the attitude.
Well, I beg your pardon?

476
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:40,687
Well, it's not like
you've been doing all the work,

477
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,620
and I've just been kicking back.
Okay, what have
you found out?

478
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,420
The victim and her husband
were having

479
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,054
marital problems.
She found motel receipts.

480
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,987
I got the security tapes
from the motel parking lot.

481
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,887
I thought Angela could use her
fat recognition program on them.

482
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,721
 <i>Mass</i> recognition program.

483
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,754
Whatever, maybe we'll
be able to find out

484
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,821
who Decker was seeing
behind his wife's back.

485
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,287
Is Angela in her office?

486
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,088
ADDY:
 <i>According to the FBI</i>
 <i>pathologist, there was no</i>

487
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:01,554
smoke in the
victim's lungs.

488
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,188
BRENNAN:
Meaning?

489
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:05,121
The victim was already
dead when she was burned.

490
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:06,887
There was clotting
in the lungs, as well.

491
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,054
That's troublesome.

492
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:10,188
If the fire was hot enough...

493
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:12,154
No, for clotting to occur,
superheated air would have

494
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,121
to be drawn into the lungs.

495
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,654
Which wouldn't happen
if she was already dead.

496
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,387
Something else caused
the clotting.

497
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:20,987
Angela's ready with the tapes.

498
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:22,721
The broken teeth
could have resulted

499
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,554
from particularly
violent seizures.

500
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,987
Epilepsy?

501
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:26,587
There are several
alternate causes

502
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:28,620
of acute tonic
muscular contractions.

503
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,088
Poisoning, a precipitous drop
in blood sugar...

504
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:32,821
Would this be a good time
to speak with Mr. Addy?

505
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,188
BRENNAN:
Considering you had

506
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:35,420
to interrupt him to
ask, probably not.

507
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,854
Take Hodgins.

508
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,721
I demand a lawyer.

509
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,654
I don't need
Dr. Hodgins.
I need Mr. Addy.

510
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,287
If I demand a lawyer,
will I get out of it, too?

511
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,088
In that case,
we all demand lawyers.

512
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:45,320
I'll wait for Mr. Addy.

513
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:46,654
Why aren't you interviewing me?

514
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,520
It won't be necessary.

515
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,821
I knew it.

516
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,520
They think my dossier
is complete.

517
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,154
They think they know
everything about me.

518
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,554
Well, they're wrong.

519
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,021
Be happy
they're leaving you alone.

520
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,154
Yeah, I'm happy.
Don't worry, I'm happy.

521
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,954
The ear you found--

522
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,654
there's-there's no way
it's her-her own ear, right?

523
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,921
How could it be her ear?

524
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:04,921
That's what I'm saying.

525
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:05,887
What?

526
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,487
It's definitely not her ear.

527
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,320
How could she bite off
her own ear?

528
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:11,420
Chromosome tests make it
a male ear.

529
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,088
Seizures?

530
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,454
ADDY:
Seizures could be due to

531
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,821
low blood sugar, electrocution,

532
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,921
infection, head injury,

533
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:21,121
uh, brain tumor,
a sudden lack of oxygen

534
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,253
in the brain...

535
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
Electrocution.

536
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:24,454
What?

537
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,454
BRENNAN:
The broken

538
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,021
teeth, the fractures,

539
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:28,387
the clots in
her lungs.

540
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,088
She was electrocuted.

541
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,520
That much damage to the teeth
could only result

542
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:33,787
from multiple violent spasms.

543
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,253
Dozens.

544
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,787
She was tortured.

545
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:39,487
For what?

546
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:41,797
???

547
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:45,753
You should at least pretend
to interview me.

548
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,521
Dr. Hodgins, your
file is complete.

549
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,287
How is that possible?
No one from

550
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:51,521
the State Department has
interviewed me in two years.

551
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:53,720
No one from the State
Department has <i>ever</i>
interviewed you.

552
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:55,454
Right, yeah,
let's play it your way.

553
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,321
Six months ago, your
cousin was appointed

554
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,020
to a very high posting
in the government.

555
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:00,787
My cousin with the bad rug?

556
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,521
It doesn't affect his
security clearance.

557
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,087
It should. It demonstrates
a complete denial of reality.

558
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:06,387
Appointed to what
very high posting?

559
00:21:06,454 --> 00:21:08,187
That's classified.

560
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:11,020
In what part of the government,
or is that classified, as well?

561
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,154
As a potential embarrassment,
you were thoroughly checked out.

562
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,787
What kind of embarrassment?

563
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,387
You are a conspiracy buff,
Dr. Hodgins.

564
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:18,954
You're paranoid.

565
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,054
Okay, okay, so,
you're telling me

566
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,920
that my toe-chewing,
moron cousin was appointed to a

567
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:26,753
secret post in a secret part
of the government

568
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,454
you can't tell me about,

569
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,588
so you compiled
a secret dossier on me,

570
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,654
but I'm the one
who's paranoid?

571
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
We don't use the word "dossier."

572
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:37,521
What was the finding?

573
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,987
I still work here, so...

574
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:39,787
Harmless.

575
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:41,287
Harmless?

576
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm harmless?

577
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:46,120
Yes. You do not pose
a viable threat.

578
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:48,688
Well, that's just... insulting.

579
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,954
If you want me to interview you,
I will.

580
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,454
But I'll only discover
what we already know.

581
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:00,454
You are benign.

582
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,554
I am not benign, lady.

583
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,254
I'm not harmless.

584
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:05,387
I'm malignant.

585
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,020
I'm a loaded cannon.

586
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,221
I know things
that would curdle your blood,

587
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,588
including a formula
that literally curdles blood.

588
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:19,853
She's wrong. I'm dangerous.

589
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,621
Carl Decker is 1.7 meters tall
and weighs 58.2 kilograms.

590
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:26,853
An ultra-marathoner.

591
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,554
Be glad he's so lean.

592
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,621
It should make him
easier to find.

593
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:33,020
Not him.
I talked to Pickering.

594
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,154
Was it awful?

595
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,920
Actually, I found it cathartic.

596
00:22:39,654 --> 00:22:41,720
BOOTH:
Well, his head's down.

597
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:43,020
What do you think?

598
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:44,787
No. He doesn't move
like a runner.

599
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,454
She knows a lot about us.

600
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:47,820
It's creepy.

601
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,421
It's confidential.

602
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:50,688
Couldn't you get the file?

603
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:51,920
Probably.

604
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:53,254
Then it's not
confidential.

605
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,688
That's him.

606
00:22:56,753 --> 00:22:58,287
That's Carl Decker.

607
00:22:58,354 --> 00:22:59,720
Fast forward.

608
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:01,521
See if he shows up
with anyone else.

609
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,421
Back up.

610
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,720
Freeze on that guy.

611
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:13,120
Can you zoom in?

612
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:16,820
MONTENEGRO:
Hmm. A secret life

613
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,087
can cause marital strife.

614
00:23:19,154 --> 00:23:21,187
He was having an affair
with a man?

615
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,421
All right, simmer down. For all
we know, he's meeting a hit man.

616
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,187
Doesn't look like a hit man.
Just print the picture. I'll put

617
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,688
the word out, see if he's in
any of the Bureau databases.

618
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:30,387
And when we find him?

619
00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:32,287
Haul him in, check to see
if he's got both ears.

620
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:33,120
Let you know what happens.

621
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,020
Could we start, please?

622
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:39,020
Anytime.

623
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,020
I can do two things at once.

624
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,621
Mr. Addy, I require
your full attention.

625
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,020
No, you don't.

626
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:46,887
But I'll give it to you.

627
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:48,454
What I have to do here

628
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,087
is establish that you are
not a threat

629
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,987
to the security of this country.

630
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:53,887
I'm getting a degree
in forensic anthropology.

631
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,221
I'm halfway through
another in engineering.

632
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:56,753
What are you afraid I'll do?

633
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,887
Build a race of criminal robots
who'll destroy the Earth?

634
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,487
Do you have
that kind of fantasy often?

635
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,020
Very often.

636
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,120
Does it concern you
that such adolescent thoughts

637
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:05,853
are a sign
of emotional retardation?

638
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,054
I've been told.

639
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,621
I'm working on it.

640
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:10,820
Can you understand
why that concerns us?

641
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:12,421
Not really.

642
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:15,720
Hypothetically: you have
a piece of information...

643
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,187
Secret and meaningful
information?

644
00:24:17,254 --> 00:24:18,487
Yes.

645
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,354
And the security
of the country's at stake.

646
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,654
Could I bribe you
to give it to me?

647
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,688
No.

648
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,521
Threaten you?
No.

649
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,820
What if I made a reasonable,

650
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:28,654
rational argument,
very persuasive?

651
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,954
Merely persuasive?

652
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,054
Irrefutable.

653
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,954
I make
an irrefutable argument

654
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,154
as to why you should give me
this piece of information.

655
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:36,887
Would you do so?

656
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:39,054
Not without checking with
Dr. Brennan or Angela first,

657
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,887
see what they said,

658
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,554
maybe Agent Booth,
if he'd talk to me.

659
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:43,820
He probably wouldn't.

660
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,654
I'd check with Dr. Hodgins,

661
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,621
but he'd say it was
all part of some conspiracy,

662
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:51,321
so I mostly only take
his advice on women.

663
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:53,887
480 volts, 350 amps.

664
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:55,087
I beg your pardon.

665
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:57,087
It's sort of secret information

666
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:59,321
I probably shouldn't tell you.

667
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:00,487
Any other questions?

668
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,987
BOOTH:
Good work, sir.

669
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,588
I only posted his face

670
00:25:14,654 --> 00:25:16,621
on the hot sheet
20 minutes ago.

671
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:18,954
My boss is the United States
Attorney General.

672
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,654
You're not doing
my career any good

673
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,087
putting me on the hot list.

674
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,588
Special Agent Seeley Booth,

675
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,954
meet Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ken Weeks.

676
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,221
I was hoping you'd turn out
to be gay or have only one ear.

677
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:35,120
Yeah, I get the gay thing a lot
because I'm so cute,

678
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,154
but the one-ear thing,
that's unique to you.

679
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,154
You're Carl Decker's
Justice Department handler?

680
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:42,654
Carl Decker was my prime witness
against KBC Systems.

681
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,221
BOOTH:
Was?

682
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:45,621
You get fired
'cause we caught you

683
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:46,454
on some motel surveillance cam?

684
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:47,954
They lost him.

685
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,387
A material witness

686
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:51,421
for a specially-convened
grand jury,

687
00:25:51,487 --> 00:25:52,654
and you lost him?

688
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,254
The guy's pretty smart.

689
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,254
Genius level.

690
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,054
Do you have any idea
what it's like

691
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,321
to interact
with those types of people?

692
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:00,588
Yeah, a little.

693
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:02,753
So what made him run?

694
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,554
Decker insisted
upon talking to
his son every day.

695
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:07,720
This morning, we couldn't put
him in touch with Donovan.

696
00:26:07,787 --> 00:26:09,187
He panicked and ran.

697
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:10,920
The marshals will find him.

698
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,621
BOOTH:
Doesn't matter,
he won't testify,

699
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,987
not after he finds out
about his wife and his child.

700
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:16,421
You might as well
pack up that grand jury

701
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,120
and send everybody home.

702
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,087
Look, I get the chance,
I'll give him

703
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:22,054
the "don't let
your wife die
in vain" speech.

704
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,621
Who knows, it might work.

705
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:25,554
BOOTH:
Weeks, you think this company

706
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:27,421
is capable of putting
a hit out on Decker?

707
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:30,421
Kill his wife, kidnap his kid?

708
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:33,020
KBC Systems sent our boys into
battle with faulty body armor.

709
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:37,487
In my book, you can do that,
you can do anything.

710
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:44,820
If Decker's as smart as they
say, how will they catch him?

711
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,753
Forget Decker.
Our job is to find his son.

712
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,354
If Decker doesn't
show up to testify...

713
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,321
We can't assume
they'd let the boy live.

714
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:52,020
Surely KBC isn't going...

715
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:54,087
Bones, we don't know
who hired these guys--

716
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,521
KBC, military,
disgruntled shareholders,

717
00:26:56,588 --> 00:27:00,054
or it could be someone
we haven't even thought of yet.

718
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,487
What?

719
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,287
You just told me not to
jump to a conclusion.

720
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:04,254
No offense intended.

721
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,588
No, you were right.

722
00:27:05,654 --> 00:27:07,354
It's just I usually
get to tell you.

723
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,287
BOOTH:
Our relationship has taken
a whole new turn.

724
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:10,287
480 volts, 350 amps.

725
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:11,920
Polina Decker?

726
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:13,920
That's the voltage it would take

727
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:16,154
to cause muscle spasms so strong
they would fracture bone.

728
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,954
That's not household current.

729
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,387
They used a generator.

730
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:22,054
Zack, you are smart.

731
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,354
Hey, Zack, Zack! This guy,
Decker, he's like you.

732
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:28,421
He's in the whole stratosphere,
IQ-wise.

733
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:29,487
What's his IQ?

734
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,853
It's 163.

735
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,554
Oh, he's not where Zack is.

736
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:35,487
If he's in the stratosphere,
I'm in the ionosphere.

737
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,354
Look, the point is that Decker
escapes the U.S. Marshals,

738
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:40,654
tries to contact his
wife and he finds out
she's been killed.

739
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,120
What does he do next?

740
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,554
His IQ is not a variable.

741
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,421
Intelligence doesn't determine
what you do so much as

742
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,254
how effectively you do it.

743
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,154
What he'll do depends on
what kind of person he is.

744
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:53,421
Well, you know,
he's a loving father,

745
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:56,753
okay, estranged from the mother
of his child.

746
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,688
Sound like anyone you know?

747
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:00,853
You want to just back out of
my personal space there, buddy?

748
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,454
Zack's right.

749
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,688
If you were in Decker's
position, what would you do?

750
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:14,688
Bucar-4 with accessory
proceeding to 4413 L Street,

751
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:17,120
KBC Systems, requesting
local cowboys for backup,

752
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,421
possible 10-31.

753
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:20,087
MAN:
Roger that, Bucar-4.

754
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,454
Did you just refer to me
as an accessory?

755
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:23,421
You asked me what I would do
if I were Decker.

756
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:25,487
They kill my wife,
they take my little boy.

757
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,487
I'd go to the source
of the problem and take him out.

758
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,387
Take him out like...

759
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:34,054
Oh.

760
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:37,321
FBI. Seward in his office?

761
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:39,588
Secure the building,
nobody in or out.

762
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:41,454
Usually, I enjoy your company,
Bones, but, you know,

763
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:43,254
it's times like this
that you give me

764
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,787
just a little something extra
to worry about.

765
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:45,588
You enjoy my company?

766
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,120
FBI, Mr. Decker.

767
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:05,554
Drop your weapon.

768
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:06,954
Now!

769
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,920
Nothing's changed.

770
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:10,853
Make the call

771
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,588
or I'll blow your head off.

772
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:14,554
He wants me to call
his son's kidnappers.

773
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:16,820
Tell them to release
my boy or you die.

774
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,853
It's that simple.

775
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,354
You can shoot me
after that.

776
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,720
I don't care.
I don't know...

777
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:23,421
Mr. Decker, Agent Booth

778
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:24,920
is an excellent shot.

779
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,187
I'm not afraid to die.

780
00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:27,521
Shoot him!

781
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:28,820
For God's sakes,
shoot him!

782
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,454
Mr. Seward, please shut up!

783
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,020
What you're trying to do--
save your son--

784
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,554
that's not going to happen
if you die here tonight.

785
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,987
Be rational,
Mr. Decker.

786
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:37,254
What you were planning
has failed.

787
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,588
You have to adapt.

788
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,387
Adapt how?

789
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:54,887
All I want is for my son
to live.

790
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,024
????

791
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:07,491
 <i>Do you know a woman</i>
 <i>named Lily Marsden?</i>

792
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:09,133
Yes, I do.

793
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,766
You had sexual relations
with her?

794
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,433
This falls
under your purview?

795
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:15,300
Lily Marsden
is an environmental extremist.

796
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:17,266
She's in Earth Now.

797
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,733
You give money
to Earth Now,

798
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,367
don't you?

799
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:22,467
Yeah, and the Sierra Club
and Habitat for Humanity,

800
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:24,266
the opera and Public Radio.

801
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:28,233
Lily Marsden has been arrested
for breaking into animal labs,

802
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,699
torching SUVs, trespassing
on military reserves,

803
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,566
dousing citizens wearing fur
with red paint...

804
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,233
Dr. Goodman,

805
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,266
if you have had or are having

806
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,599
sexual relations
with Lily Marsden,

807
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:42,433
we have a problem.
Why?

808
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:45,000
Because an elicit
sexual relationship

809
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,467
gives her leverage over you.

810
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,300
This makes you
a security risk.

811
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,233
I'm a married man,
Ms. Pickering.

812
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,100
I'm faithful to my wife.

813
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,632
Could you please define your
relationship with Lily Marsden?

814
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:00,866
I enjoy talking to her.

815
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:02,666
We argue.

816
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,699
She's a nut,
but she's a smart nut.

817
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,266
She's... always interesting.

818
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,632
She's never dull.

819
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:09,733
So you...

820
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,799
Talk to her.

821
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,467
I think it's a very bad sign

822
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:15,733
when discourse becomes suspect.

823
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,066
You talk to her.

824
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,599
Sometimes we yell.

825
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,233
You want to give me
one good reason

826
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,966
why I shouldn't charge you with
attempted murder, Mr. Decker.

827
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,899
You think I went
after Seward out
of vengeance?

828
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,766
Looks like vengeance.

829
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:33,033
KBC Systems hired people to kill
my wife and kidnap my child.

830
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,300
Think rationally for a moment.

831
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,100
BRENNAN:
That makes sense.

832
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,467
If KBC Systems
is behind the
kidnapping,

833
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,300
then Seward would be
the person to call it off.

834
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,000
Rational human being...

835
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,499
how'd you find yourself
amongst these people?

836
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:45,166
Sir, we are trying to help.

837
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,066
Excellent.
Hold your gun

838
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:49,632
to Trent Seward's head and
force him to let my son go.

839
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,367
CULLEN:
There's no compelling
evidence

840
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,233
that Trent Seward was the man

841
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,733
who ordered the kidnapping
of your son.

842
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,766
I personally calculated
the penetration tolerances

843
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,166
for the combat flak jackets.

844
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,799
The company
found my calculations

845
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:05,100
to be "excessively
conservative."

846
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,833
30 soldiers died.

847
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,433
Trent Seward
will do anything

848
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,300
to prevent me
from testifying.

849
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,799
He or someone

850
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:17,433
working for him kidnapped
my child and killed my wife.

851
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:19,300
If you want to get Trent Seward,

852
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:20,766
go into that grand jury
and tell them what you know.

853
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,233
And the kidnappers
will kill my boy.

854
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,766
All due respect for
what you're going
through emotionally,

855
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,499
sir, uh, Mr. Weeks is not wrong.

856
00:32:28,566 --> 00:32:30,599
This is my son.

857
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:31,866
I love him.

858
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,933
And if there's even
a slight chance

859
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,433
that I can save his life
by shutting up,

860
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:37,966
then that's what I'll do--
shut the hell up.

861
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,899
And what about the soldiers?

862
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,899
DECKER:
Analytically,
I understand

863
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:46,532
that many lives
outweigh the one.

864
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,266
But I cannot trade
my son's life.

865
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,532
Have you considered
that by not testifying,

866
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,000
your wife will have died
in vain?

867
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,532
CULLEN:
Shut it up, Weeks.

868
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,467
If you people
had protected Mr. Decker

869
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:58,400
and his family properly,
we wouldn't even be here.

870
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,766
Let's go.

871
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,367
The only way
that I will testify...

872
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,066
...is if I see you with my son.

873
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:18,066
Mr. Decker, you and Donovan...

874
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,933
do you have
a code word?

875
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
Something to let him know
that you sent me?

876
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:27,266
"Paladin."

877
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,066
Tell Donovan, "Paladin."

878
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:39,400
Paladin... defender
of the faith, a protector.

879
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:41,367
Suits you, Booth.

880
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,033
You know what?

881
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,933
You tough guys are all
very sentimental.

882
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,467
Got results on the earwax.

883
00:33:55,532 --> 00:33:59,200
I ran the particulates
through the gas chromatograph

884
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,066
and found the pollen
of <i>Eragrostis curvula,</i>

885
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,433
more commonly known
as Weeping Love grass.

886
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,499
And where does one
find Weeping Love?

887
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:07,233
Weeping love is
found worldwide,

888
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,433
but Weeping Love grass,
that's in South Africa.

889
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,799
Anything else?

890
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:15,899
Yeah, traces
of automotive-grade asbestos.

891
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,799
The guy didn't have very good
aural hygiene.

892
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:20,100
Dr. Brennan.

893
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,766
What, now?

894
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,100
You've got
to be kidding.

895
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,133
Take me,
I'll waive the lawyer.

896
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,066
I have a few surprises
in me!

897
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,200
Tell that to your superiors
at the N.S.A.

898
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:32,033
Booth, we're looking
for a one-eared South African.

899
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,033
South African?

900
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,400
Does that mean something?

901
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,033
Yeah, I mean, there's a number

902
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,766
of South African
security consultants

903
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,699
that companies use to do their
dirty work in the Third World.

904
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,833
They're really mercenaries.

905
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:44,799
Well, he might be a mechanic
of some kind.
You can tell that?

906
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:47,666
He had traces of what is
probably brake pad in his ear.

907
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:49,433
How'd that get in there?

908
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:51,933
Well, any number of ways--
most likely his hand

909
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,599
comes in contact
with the asbestos,

910
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,799
and then he scratches his ear.

911
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,233
Hello? Are you still there?

912
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,766
Yeah. I'm on my way over.

913
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,333
What's the matter?

914
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,033
An eight-year-old boy--
yes, that's consistent

915
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,666
with what I'm looking at.

916
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,133
You should really send this
to an FBI pathologist.

917
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,432
They'd give me
fingerprints and DNA.

918
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,267
We already know
who the finger belongs to.

919
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,933
I-I need more.

920
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,833
Like what?

921
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,532
You gave me
a South African mechanic

922
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,100
from a chunk of burnt ear--
do it again.

923
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,432
Do it better,
do it fast.

924
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:30,766
What? Start.

925
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,566
Come on, do what you do.

926
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,233
You're kind of worked up.

927
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,900
What you see is a bunch
of facts, but what I see

928
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,966
is a terrified little boy
with his finger cut off.

929
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,333
Now, is he even still alive?

930
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:43,866
Blood saturation levels
in the surrounding tissues

931
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,766
are high-- his heart
was still beating

932
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,133
when they removed his finger.

933
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,666
Okay... he's alive.

934
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,000
That's something.

935
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,532
Who does this?

936
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,799
Cuts a finger
off an eight-year-old boy?

937
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,666
Mercenaries, professionals.

938
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:58,133
They don't feel a thing.

939
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,599
I feel things, Booth.

940
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:01,166
Never said you didn't, Bones.

941
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:03,233
I'm a professional, too.

942
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,000
I do better work if I only see
the finger and not the child.

943
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,766
That doesn't mean I'm like them.

944
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,833
I know that, Bones,
but what I also know

945
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,566
is that they made a big mistake
sending us that finger.

946
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,599
Why, because it made you mad?

947
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,466
No, because you're going
to use it to catch them.

948
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:19,699
So you gather up
your squint squad.

949
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:22,866
Let's get to work.

950
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,699
BOOTH:
Did you kick the ball?

951
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,066
How far did it go?

952
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,566
Backwards?

953
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:30,166
( <i>chuckles</i> )
Yeah, I can kick a ball.

954
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:33,300
I'm going to... Daddy's going
to show you on Saturday.

955
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:36,766
I'm going to see you Saturday,
okay, Parker?

956
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,532
Okay, I got to go, bub.

957
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,200
I love you--
I'll see you Saturday, bye.

958
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,900
What do you got?

959
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,866
The finger was severed using
a hatchet on a wooden surface.

960
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:45,466
Cutting board?

961
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:47,367
No, older, unsealed, pine.

962
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:49,966
I'm thinking like a workbench
in a mechanic shop.

963
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,900
Why?
Well, there's traces of lead
and methyl tertiary-butyl ether

964
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:53,766
on the bone.

965
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,733
The nail was bitten
to the quick, by the way.

966
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,166
Kid was nervous.

967
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:58,699
You would be, too.

968
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,566
MTBEs have been added
to gasoline since the '70s.

969
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,466
But there's lead
here, as well.

970
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,599
ADDY:
Leaded gasoline was phased out
between 1975

971
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,100
and 1986.

972
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,300
Asbestos from brake pads,
leaded gasoline,

973
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,267
a mechanic bench,
you know,

974
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,599
plus the mother was electrocuted
by current

975
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,066
from a generator.

976
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,799
We're looking
for an abandoned gas station

977
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,233
or a mechanic shop
off the grid.

978
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,432
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
You guys are geniuses.

979
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,499
How do we find that?

980
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:21,432
I work for the FBI, you idiot.

981
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,799
Way to go, Zack--
we went from geniuses to idiots

982
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,267
in three seconds.

983
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,933
Can you tell me
what you were doing in Cuba?

984
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,466
Only if you tell me first.

985
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:31,900
I beg your pardon?

986
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,933
I don't know
your security clearance.

987
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,166
Well, what is
 <i>your</i> security clearance?

988
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:37,599
You should check
with the State Department.

989
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,233
I'm from the State Department.

990
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,000
Then that should make
it easy for you.

991
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,499
When you were in Cuba,

992
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:48,033
did you meet with a man
named Juan Guzman?

993
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:05,267
Hello. It's Dr. Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

994
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,866
You told me to call you
if anyone asked about...

995
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:12,799
you know... him.

996
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,833
Someone from
the State Department named...

997
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,599
Samantha Pickering.

998
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,300
Pickering.

999
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:28,033
Yes, sir.

1000
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,499
Yes, I'll wait...
I'll wait here.

1001
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,833
Any more questions?

1002
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,399
No.

1003
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:41,333
Uh, no. In fact,
the entire review is suspended.

1004
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:48,799
I'm to wait here until someone
comes to destroy my notes.

1005
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:50,766
We might have the kid.

1006
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,499
BOOTH:
 <i>Polina didn't make any calls</i>
 <i>from her cell phone</i>

1007
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:00,799
 <i>after she was kidnapped,</i>
 <i>but nobody turned it off.</i>

1008
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:03,566
When she left her coverage area,
the cell phone was automatically

1009
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,399
assigned a new routing tower.

1010
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:07,200
You could triangulate
her position?

1011
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:09,233
Yeah, to within
75 square miles.

1012
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,200
There were six abandoned
gas stations in that area.

1013
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,666
There were five
urban, one rural.

1014
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:16,333
SWAT's gonna check them
all out, but I think it's
the rural one we want.

1015
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,666
Why?

1016
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,033
'Cause I used to do
this kind of work.

1017
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,699
What, rescuing people?

1018
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:23,532
Or being... the person
they needed to be rescued from.

1019
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,733
Oh.
If I had a choice,

1020
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,133
I picked an isolated
rural area.

1021
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,766
This place is perfect.

1022
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,133
It's an abandoned
truck repair depot.

1023
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,766
The SWAT team will
meet us there.

1024
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,599
Why don't we ever
take my car?

1025
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,833
Do you have bulletproof vests
in the trunk?

1026
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,532
No.
That's why.

1027
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,633
FLIR imagery gives us three
adults within the structure.

1028
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,699
The boy?
No reading.

1029
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:55,933
Probably because he's small...
or hypothermic.

1030
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,866
Entirely possible, sir.
What's the play?

1031
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,799
I go in first,
straight for the kid.

1032
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:01,599
You guys do what you do.
All right.

1033
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,300
What about me?

1034
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,733
Wait outside.

1035
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,900
But I don't want
to miss anything.

1036
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:08,900
Bones, these guys aren't
like anyone else you've
come up against.

1037
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,733
Please. Just be someone you
aren't for the next ten minutes,

1038
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,200
and you hang back.

1039
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,666
Please.

1040
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,200

anymore.

1045
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,599
Okay? It's okay.
Don't look at him anymore.
No! Get away!

1046

He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

Get away!
Okay...

1048
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,233
Donovan, Paladin. Okay?

1049
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,666
Paladin.

1050
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,566
Paladin.

1051
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:22,100
Okay? Paladin.
Come on.

All right, hey, come on.
You're all right.

1054
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,200
Is my dad crying?

1055
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,766
I think your dad's crying
because he's happy.

1056
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,866
He's happy he got you back.

1057
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:26,367
Well done.
Yeah, I hope
you're really good

1058
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,599
at your job, Mr. Weeks.
Why is that?

1059
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:31,000
'Cause otherwise, you got
nothing going for you.

1060
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,733
He's a father himself.

1061
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, thank God I always
had the sense not to let
that happen to me.

1062
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,633
You think KBC hired
the mercenaries?

1063
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:54,200
( <i>sighs</i> ):
We'll let the grand jury
figure that out.

1064
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:55,666
We did our job.

1065
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:58,033
It's not often I
get to help save

1066
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,766
someone <i>before</i> they die.
Hell, Bones, every time
you catch a murderer

1067
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,733
you save his next victim.
This is different.

1068
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,900
Yeah. Still glad
you don't have any kids?

1069
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:08,300
Yeah. Why?
You were looking
at that boy and his dad--

1070
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,399
I just thought
you'd change your mind.

1071
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:12,432
No. Still glad
you <i>do</i> have a kid?

1072
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:14,432
Gladder today than yesterday.

1073
00:43:14,499 --> 00:43:17,499
Doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, it's complicated.

1074
