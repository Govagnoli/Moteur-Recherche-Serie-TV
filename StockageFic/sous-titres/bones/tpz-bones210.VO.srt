1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,462
[Brennan]
It's getting thicker and thicker in here.

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:10,202
That's why the forensic team got lost.
I've sent somebody back to find 'em.

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,369
You sure you know
where you're goin'?

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,709
I still have trouble,
and I've been here for three years.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,908
<i>That's why we advise hikers</i>
<i>to stay away.</i>

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,883
I know I'm pining for concrete.

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,854
You just, uh...
You stay close, all right, Bones?

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,565
I don't want you to get caught
out here when it gets dark, okay?

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,668
<i>Bones? Bones?</i>

10
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,008
Where the hell are you?
Bones?

11
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,067
I'm right here, Booth.

12
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,409
- Don't do that, all right?
- <i>What?</i>

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,472
- Take off like that, okay? You heard the guy.
- I saw this.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,486
<i>It's some sort of talisman.</i>
<i>These are bones from a bird.</i>

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,921
<i>And the coloring on the ornament</i>
<i>looks like dried blood.</i>

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,324
<i>There are more of'em too.</i>

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,453
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>These, they look like eyes.</i>

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,229
- Okay, this is weird. You see a lot of these?
- Not me.

19
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,361
But I've heard some other folks have come
across some pretty strange stuff in here.

20
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,771
- Word is it's Maggie Cinders.
- There's a woman who lives out here?

21
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,969
Did.
Died in 1780.

22
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,013
<i>Folks around here thought</i>
<i>she was a witch and beheaded her.</i>

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,845
<i>Legend is she still haunts the woods</i>
<i>looking for her severed head.</i>

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,283
<i>And you believe this, Ranger Edison?</i>

25
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,185
<i>Look, I'm just telling you</i>
<i>what I heard.</i>

26
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,782
Yeah, I'd prefer we keep moving, okay?

27
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,054
<i>[Edison]</i>
<i>This is one of the only clearings around here.</i>

28
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,062
<i>The pit was covered</i>
<i>with sticks and leaves.</i>

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,158
<i>One of the hikers fell in on the body,</i>
<i>freaked, and ran.</i>

30
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:46,695
Maggie Cinders did say she'd kill
anybody who dared to look for her.

31
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:51,039
So you talked to Miss Cinders? That must've
been difficult since she doesn't have a head.

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,011
<i>Bag the eyes.</i>
<i>Give me a hand.</i>

33
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,411
<i>You want me to</i>
<i>go down there with you?</i>

34
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,974
- No. I don't want the remains compromised.
- You all right?

35
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,077
- Yeah.
- <i>[Insects Buzzing]</i>

36
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,486
So, uh, how'd she kill 'em,
you know, in the legend?

37
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,686
Like she was killed.
She cuts off their heads.

38
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,555
Iliac crest and pubis show it's male.

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:19,571
Epiphyseal fusion puts him
between 18 and 25 years old.

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,040
He's on a... a video camera.

41
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,202
Cause of death?

42
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,508
Well, since I can't find his skull...

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,743
I'd say... his head got cut off.

44
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,053
Since we don't have a head,
do we have enough for an identification?

45
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,291
We'll look for older injuries
that might be found in medical records.

46
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,731
More wood splinters.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,291
Could've been the handle
of whatever lopped off his head.

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,702
<i>If a ghost isn't comprised</i>
<i>of matter but is merely ectoplasm...</i>

49
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,798
which is actually the clear outer layer
of cytoplasm on amoeboid cells...

50
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,901
<i>how can the victim have suffered</i>
<i>bruising and multiple fractures?</i>

51
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,276
Because there are
no such things as ghosts.

52
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,145
I thought you never
jump to conclusions?

53
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,380
Well, it's safe to dismiss
fantasy and deluded perceptions.

54
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,650
My mother came to me
the day after she died.

55
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,223
I wasn't some kid.
I was 23. She came to me...

56
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,829
She came to me and told me
to look in her dresser...

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,164
third drawer,
behind her pink blouse.

58
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:27,434
There was something there for me.

59
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,408
<i>[Hodgins] The European hornet queen</i>
<i>I found on the remains...</i>

60
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,138
puts the time of death
at November of last year.

61
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,943
- We have more splinters.
- Wood.

62
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,676
It's from a <i>Betula uber...</i>

63
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,016
<i>a subspecies of round-leafbirch tree</i>
<i>that's been extinct since 1800.</i>

64
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,649
<i>The legend says that</i>
<i>Maggie Cinders kills her victims...</i>

65
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:50,424
with the same old ax
used to decapitate her in 1783.

66
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,094
Anyone else feeling tingly,
or is it just me?

67
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,729
<i>I checked missing persons. A film student from</i>
<i>U. V.A. went missing in the woods last year.</i>

68
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,638
He was making a documentary
on the Maggie Cinders legend.

69
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,838
<i>Graham Hastings, 21,</i>
<i>5'10", 176 pounds.</i>

70
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,938
- That explains the video camera.
- <i>[Angela] I,</i> um...

71
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,711
I got something from the videotape.

72
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,480
I cleaned a section of the tape
with an isopropyl alcohol solution...

73
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,788
<i>and fed whatever digital information</i>
<i>I could salvage into a restoration program.</i>

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,385
- I didn't get much.
- <i>[Woman Screams]</i>

75
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,795
Maybe I got too much.

76
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,460
- Brian? Brian!
- [Chopping Sounds]

77
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,368
<i>[Man] Lori, wait!</i>
<i>Where are you going? Lori, stop!</i>

78
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,635
- Stop, Lori!
- <i>[Lori] Brian! Brian!</i>

79
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:43,079
<i>[Lori Screams]</i>
<i>No! It's blood!</i>

80
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,346
[Panting]
Oh, God. The noises are getting closer.

81
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,719
- I've lost Lori, and Brian's disappeared.
- [Chopping Sounds Continue]

82
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,157
<i>[Sobbing]</i>
<i>Oh, God. It's her. I can hear her.</i>

83
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,196
She's here. She's here!
Oh, God, she's here!

84
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:01,927
Lori, where the hell are you?
Lori!

85
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,561
Oh, my God.
Help!

86
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,400
<i>Help me!</i>
<i>Oh, God!</i>

87
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,202
Oh, God!
Somebody help me!

88
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,008
Somebody help me, please!

89
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,540
<i>[Screaming]</i>

90
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,409
<i>[Zack]</i>
<i>I just keep hearing the screams.</i>

91
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,649
- I've never heard screams like that, Dr. Brennan.
- Neither have I.

92
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:01,717
Narrow focus trauma
on the left humerus, posterior side.

93
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,763
- Indicates an attempt by the victim
to shield his head.
- From the ax attack.

94
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,994
<i>What?</i>
<i>It's always an ax, isn't it?</i>

95
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,628
- Remember <i>The Shining?</i>
- My palms perspired profusely during that film.

96
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,332
Until we complete a series
of blade comparison tests...

97
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,501
there's no way to know
what type of weapon was used.

98
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,808
- Forensic team found this near the pit.
- Looks organic.

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,348
Definitely decomposing.

100
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,579
Victim's preliminary tox screen
came back negative. No drugs.

101
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,950
- That's too bad.
- Why?

102
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,683
Because drugs would explain the writings
I found inside Graham's backpack.

103
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,751
I'm cleaning them and taking mud samples,
but I think Booth should show 'em to a profiler.

104
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,787
<i>They're handwritten, scrawled.</i>
<i>And so far, all I can make out is...</i>

105
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,334
"Maggie came to me again, calling me."

106
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,666
And last but not least...

107
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,833
<i>"They will scream for air,</i>
<i>but their lungs will fill with blood. "

108
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,638
<i>I'll redo the tox screen.</i>

109
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,943
I may be alone in this,
but I think one of us...

110
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:00,714
<i>should remain a rational human being</i>
<i>during this investigation.</i>

111
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:06,020
Got it. Comminuted fracture
to the ulna. Professionally set.

112
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,493
<i>From the degree of callous formation,</i>
<i>that's a childhood injury.</i>

113
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,692
One that could give us the I.D. we want.
I'll call Booth, tell him to contact next of kin.

114
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,030
<i>Zack, place some garlic</i>
<i>around the remains...</i>

115
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,037
and chant the Hmong ritual
for preservation of souls.

116
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,130
Really?

117
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,040
[Chuckles]
This is going to be a long case.

118
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,082
<i>[Man] Graham broke his arm</i>
<i>sliding into second base.</i>

119
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,413
Um, he was eight.

120
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,888
It's a match.
I'm very sorry.

121
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,947
Thanks.

122
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,291
Look.
I can't say that I'm surprised.

123
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:47,765
He, uh... He was missing for a year.
But still, when you hear...

124
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,702
It was just us, you know?
My parents died in a car accident.

125
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,968
I was 18 and he was 13, and, uh...

126
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,669
When something like that happens,
when you lose your parents at that age...

127
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,803
it's just people don't understand
how close you become.

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,544
I lost mine when I was 15.
It was just me and my brother too.

129
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,552
And he was 19.

130
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,451
Sorry.

131
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,253
<i>Did Graham live with relatives,</i>
<i>or did he go into foster care?</i>

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,817
<i>God, no. I would never</i>
<i>let him go into the system.</i>

133
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:20,696
I, uh...
I dropped out of college.

134
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,395
I joined the fire department
to support him.

135
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,938
Your brother didn't...

136
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,776
It was a difficult situation for him.

137
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,108
I understand.

138
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,742
I mean, you know, it seems like
you turned out okay though.

139
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,817
Do you know who Graham was with
the night he disappeared?

140
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,828
Yeah.
A couple of film students from school.

141
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,330
There was a guy and a girl.
I tried to get the guy...

142
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,332
Brian, his name was...
to help with the search.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,767
But he was too freaked to go back into
the woods. I've never seen someone so scared.

144
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,000
So you were involved
with the search?

145
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,907
I've led a lot of search-and-rescue operations
as a firefighter. Um...

146
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,775
I should've found him.

147
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,409
- It's not your fault.
- I should've locked him in his damn room.

148
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,785
I mean, everyone knows
weird things happen in those woods.

149
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,494
The chatter marks mean the vertebrae
weren't split in one blow.

150
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,431
Makes sense.
Hacking off someone's head's...

151
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,832
more like cutting down a small tree
than splitting a log.

152
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,200
I find your imagery
both colorful and accurate.

153
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,765
Thank you. Let me know when you've
narrowed down the weapon category.

154
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,970
Dr. Saroyan? When you say
your mother visited you...

155
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,174
She appeared... in my room.

156
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,183
It was early evening.

157
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:51,019
- And you were frightened?
- No. I felt... loved.

158
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,025
- Dr. Brennan says that's impossible.
- What do you think?

159
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,653
I think it would be wonderful
if it were possible.

160
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,727
I found rust flakes on the neck
that were from hand-forged iron.

161
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,736
- 18th century.
- You got it.

162
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:09,707
- [Grunts]
- My God! A little warning, Zack.

163
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,869
I don't usually announce
each phase of my experiments.

164
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,880
- Yeah, maybe you should start.
- Nice follow-through, dude.

165
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,075
<i>It doesn't look like</i>
<i>it was a machete.</i>

166
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:23,419
Dibs on the next weapon.

167
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,356
- Looks like you have this under control.
- <i>[Hodgins Grunts Loudly]</i>

168
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,655
<i>Graham had a fellowship</i>
<i>at the school.</i>

169
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,026
It was a free ride
worth about 30 grand a year.

170
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,193
Brian, the other kid from the woods,
he applied for it and lost out to Graham.

171
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,668
After Graham disappeared,
the fellowship went to Brian.

172
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,831
Hmm?
Did you hear me?

173
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,205
Yeah.
Doesn't look good for Brian Andrews.

174
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,107
You okay?

175
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:51,115
I... I wonder what my life
would've been like if Russ had raised me.

176
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,117
Well, you know,
since he was a petty thief...

177
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,915
you know,
in and out of jail all the time, I...

178
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,616
I imagine it wouldn't
have been very good.

179
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,024
If he'd accepted responsibility
for raising me...

180
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,962
[Exhales Deeply]
I'm romanticizing. It's foolish.

181
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,592
Everyone does it, Bones, okay?
It's normal.

182
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,162
It's a useless fantasy, no different than
the childish legend about the headless woman.

183
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,675
I mean, look at Will.
He sacrificed everything for his brother...

184
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,710
and still couldn't save him.

185
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,112
<i>By walking out,</i>
<i>maybe Russ gave me my life.</i>

186
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,242
Well, you know, what Will said,
he was right. You turned out okay.

187
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,715
- I'm going to have coffee with him.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

188
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,230
- That was quick.
- He understands something
no one else I know does.

189
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,755
<i>I mean, people need connection,</i>
<i>Booth, even me.</i>

190
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,962
Obviously, you have one with Cam.

191
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,164
- <i>So...</i>
- What?

192
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,434
I thought you'd mention it.

193
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,942
<i>I mean, isn't that what partners do?</i>

194
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,912
- Tell each other about their lives?
- <i>Wait a second.</i>

195
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,915
- Look, Bones, I...
- <i>Sorry.</i>

196
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm sorry. I forgot how self-conscious
you are talking about sex.

197
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,117
I am not...
I'm...

198
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,029
Graham was kind of the star at school,
so we all wanted to work with him.

199
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,031
And he thought the legend was true?

200
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,932
Said that Maggie Cinders
was talking to him in his dreams.

201
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,266
She told him where
her head was buried.

202
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,865
And you believed him too?

203
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,933
Not at first.

204
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,209
When we were out there
in the woods...

205
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,217
Stuff like that doesn't happen.

206
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,651
What kind of stuff?

207
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,282
Chopping sounds.

208
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,792
There... There was eyes
hanging on all the trees.

209
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,729
<i>Something was moving out there</i>
<i>that wasn't us.</i>

210
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,028
Look, I know what you're thinking.

211
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,365
But you weren't out there.
Okay, Lori, she freaked.

212
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,031
She took off into nowhere.

213
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,371
And... that's when
we all got separated.

214
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,377
Okay, look. The police report said...

215
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,039
that you brought Lori out of the woods.

216
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,914
When I found Lori, she was just
curled up on the ground shaking.

217
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,318
So you took her out of the woods,
but you left Graham?

218
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,915
I thought he had left us, okay?

219
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,392
You don't get it
what it was like out there.

220
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:20,228
His brother asked you to go on
the search with him, but you didn't go.

221
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,233
<i>Why didn't you go?</i>

222
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,292
I'm not proud of myself, okay?

223
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,696
But I just couldn't go back out there.

224
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,709
I couldn't.

225
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:36,441
Uh, Lori seemed to have
disappeared from school.

226
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,745
You wouldn't happen to know
where we can find her?

227
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,718
I haven't seen her since that night.

228
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:46,247
The last I heard,
she checked back into the psych ward.

229
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,863
I checked back in because I couldn't sleep.
I haven't slept for days.

230
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,129
Thanks for meeting with me, Lori.

231
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,933
Sure.

232
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,371
There's not much else to do in here.

233
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:07,310
Hey, do you mind if I ask you
what happened that night in the woods?

234
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,313
I've told the police everything.

235
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,373
But Graham is the only one
that can make things right.

236
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,950
He just got a little lost in there.

237
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,048
But when he gets back,
he's gonna make sure that I'm safe again.

238
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,593
Graham...
He promised to take care of you?

239
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,425
Well, sure.
He's my boyfriend.

240
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,488
He doesn't want anything
to happen to me.

241
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,126
Your boyfriend?

242
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,938
We keep it a secret.
Other girls get jealous.

243
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,943
Everyone loves Graham.

244
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,240
Did... Did you go into the woods?

245
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,012
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.

246
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,577
You found Graham?

247
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,488
He said he was gonna talk to Maggie.
Is that where you found him?

248
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,459
He wasn't with Maggie.

249
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,297
No.

250
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,232
N-N-No, no, no, no, no, no.

251
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,601
- Lori? Lori, just calm down.
- She killed him.

252
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,663
I'm sorry, Lori,
but we need to know what happened.

253
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,006
- That's what happened!
- We need to know what happened to him.

254
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,671
Did she take his head?

255
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,014
Oh, God!
No!

256
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,052
The blood!

257
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,486
- I called for help, but Brian wasn't there!
- Relax.

258
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,547
<i>Relax... Relax, Lori.</i>
<i>You're safe here.</i>

259
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,458
There was so much blood!

260
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,325
<i>[Sobbing Hysterically]</i>

261
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,493
I tried to run! Graham!
Graham, she's coming! Run!

262
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,469
<i>Graham! Graham!</i>

263
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,677
She freaked, Bones. It was like she was
out there in the woods with that witch.

264
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,512
Don't let anyone else hear you
talking like that, Booth.

265
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,348
I'm just saying, you know,
I've seen a lot of weird things.

266
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,322
It was like, you know,
<i>Exorcist</i> weird or <i>Elm Street</i> weird.

267
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,551
- What are you talking about now?
- They're movies. Okay, Bones?

268
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,653
- Movies so scary that
you end up peeing your pants.
- Good to know.

269
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,164
I noticed some damage
to the subdeltoid bursa.

270
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,826
Looks like the subscapularis
was torn away.

271
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,837
<i>They're fracture lines.</i>
<i>This was a postmortem trauma.</i>

272
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,566
Meaning what?

273
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,575
The victim's shoulder was
dislocated just after his death.

274
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,737
<i>The injury doesn't fit into</i>
<i>our established scenario of the struggle.</i>

275
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,906
<i>These marks near</i>
<i>the vertebrocostal junction...</i>

276
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,418
there's massive hinge fracturing.

277
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,249
Zack, lie down on the ground.

278
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,380
- Faceup or facedown?
- Faceup.

279
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,484
- This should be good.
- And give me your right arm.

280
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:41,090
Okay. If Graham Hastings was dragged
to the pit by this arm in this direction...

281
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,034
the trauma to the back of his ribs
would result in hinging.

282
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,696
<i>And the exposed wound</i>
<i>where the head was severed...</i>

283
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,297
would've been collecting
particulates along the way.

284
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,970
Tell Hodgins we might have enough for him
to determine where the victim was beheaded.

285
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,979
Oh, yeah!
Double yeah.

286
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,483
I'm waiting to hear from the psych ward
to see if we can talk to Lori again.

287
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,484
Well, I'll ask Will
what type of relationship...

288
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,715
Graham and Lori really had
when I have coffee with him.

289
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,984
Wait a second. You know,
we're investigating his brother's death.

290
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,992
Don't you think that
can get a little messy?

291
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,621
I can compartmentalize... same as you.

292
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,324
Mm-hmm.

293
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:18,268
<i>The blood on those talisman things</i>
<i>hanging from the trees...not human.</i>

294
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,636
I'll be back soon.

295
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,641
I just wanna thank you
for everything you're doing...

296
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,643
to find out
what happened to Graham.

297
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,805
Is that why you called...
to thank me for doing my job?

298
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,112
That and, uh...

299
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,018
I didn't think you'd come,
so I guess I'm a little nervous.

300
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,114
Caffeine affects the adenosine
receptors in the brain.

301
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,093
- <i>It causes increased heart rate, so...</i>
- There are other causes.

302
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:49,627
<i>My partner warned me</i>
<i>to stay focused on the case, so...</i>

303
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,829
- If you got questions, that's cool.
- Okay, um...

304
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,965
What kind of music do you like?

305
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,202
That's a good question.

306
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,441
Um... Snow Patrol.

307
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,675
And Leonard Cohen.
I like Leonard Cohen.

308
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,151
Gravel voice,
but somehow it's soothing.

309
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,848
Yeah.
I wonder why that is.

310
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,892
There's actually no empirical way
of assessing something like that.

311
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:18,225
- But you didn't mean that literally, did you?
- Uh-uh.

312
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,323
[Sighs]
I'm sorry. My...

313
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,234
My social skills are very limited.

314
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,738
<i>Trust me, they're fine.</i>

315
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,070
<i>You know,</i> it...

316
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:35,876
it took a long time for me to understand
how my brother could leave.

317
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,908
And now, it's just as odd
to meet someone who stayed.

318
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,977
I thought about leaving all the time.

319
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,216
<i>I mean, I was a kid.</i>

320
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,021
I didn't know how to be a parent.

321
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,029
<i>I mean, I guess it was my fault</i>
<i>that his head got so big.</i>

322
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,930
He was bossing people around
like he was already Steven Spielberg.

323
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,934
Well, Graham couldn't have been all bad.

324
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:01,871
- I mean, my partner says
that Lori seemed to love him.
- Poor kid.

325
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,875
I liked her.
She deserved better.

326
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,605
- Graham didn't treat her well?
- <i>No.</i>

327
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,011
He juggled a lot of girls.
I don't know how he did it...

328
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,710
- <i>but no one ever found out about each other.</i>
- So he cheated on her?

329
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,446
Doesn't run in the family,
by the way.

330
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,382
I have to get back to work.

331
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,291
- Did I say something?
- Maybe.

332
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,626
If I offended you in any way,
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,289
Do you like Massive Attack?

334
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,460
[Chuckles]
I don't know Massive Attack.

335
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,905
Very impressive integration
of radical politics into their music.

336
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,032
<i>I'll play 'em for you next time.</i>

337

[Screams]

339
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,489
I know where
Graham Hastings was murdered.

340
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,928
- <i># [Clicks Off]</i>
- Are you trying to kill me?

341
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,056
What's with the music?

342
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,001
It helps muffle the screams
so I don't pass out every few seconds.

343
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,766
Smart. We have to go through
all the video again.

344
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,775
Hastings was killed in a patch
of eastern hemlocks like this.

345
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,243
<i>They grow in clusters</i>
<i>throughout the forest.</i>

346
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,406
We have to spot the cluster
Graham and the others were near.

347
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,416
Wait, wait.
We have to go through all the video again?

348
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,419
Don't worry.
I'm right here for you.

349
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,614
<i>[Graham]</i>
<i>There is no way that this is natural.</i>

350
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,421
I mean, it's like... it's like
she left this here to guide us or something.

351
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,951
<i>Make it stop!</i>
<i>Make</i> it... <i>Make it stop!</i>

352
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,965
<i>[Brian] Graham, there's something</i>
<i>seriously wrong with Lori, okay?</i>

353
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,092
- We should go back.
- No! This is...

354
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,161
[Screaming]

355
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,265
- <i>No! No!</i>
- <i>[Brian] What is it? Graham!</i>

356
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,243
- <i>[Lori] Make it go away!</i>
- [Voices Overlapping]

357
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,372
- Come on! Let's go!
- [Lori Sobbing] Graham, get back here!

358
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,282
- <i>No, Graham!</i>
- <i>What are you doing? Let's get out ofhere!</i>

359
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,616
<i>[Lori Screams]</i>

360
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,359
Lori was not Graham's only girlfriend.
He had lots of girlfriends.

361
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,658
But he somehow managed
to keep them secret from each other.

362
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,861
- So what would happen if
a very jealous Lori found out?
- I don't know.

363
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,130
- That's... That's more your territory.
- What?

364
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,069
What, about cheating?

365
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,336
I just meant that
you use psychology.

366
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,468
<i>You're very touchy.</i>

367
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,809
- Perhaps because of all your skulking around?
- <i>I am discreet.</i>

368
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:27,181
Okay? It's different.
A gentleman is discreet. Okay?

369
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,914
- <i>[Zack] What are we talking about?</i>
- Nothing that concerns you.

370
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,218
- Booth.
- But I'm quite literally in
the middle of the conversation.

371
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,225
And it seems very interesting.

372
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,921
However, your glaring indicates that
I shouldn't press for further information.

373
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,930
Mm-hmm. Good genius.
Yeah.

374
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,764
<i>So, Lori loves Graham.</i>
<i>Thinks he loves her...</i>

375
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,769
but finds out that he doesn't.

376
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,830
So she goes all O.J. on him. It's a perfect cover,
right? "Headless witch did it, not me."

377
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,274
The whole insanity thing
might be an act.

378
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,108
<i>But the victim sustained</i>
<i>extensive defensive wounds.</i>

379
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,580
This was a very powerful attacker.

380
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,210
When a woman finds out that a man has been
cheating on her, she can get pretty mad.

381
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,090
That's what I heard. Okay, look,
we got motive and opportunity. It fits.

382
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:11,357
No, it doesn't fit.
Graham Hastings was 5'10" and 176 pounds.

383
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,424
<i>Lori is 120 tops. The injuries aren't</i>
<i>consistent with a woman Lori Mueller's size.</i>

384
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,028
<i>Of course, people on P.C.P. have been</i>
<i>known to exhibit extraordinary strength.</i>

385
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,596
P.C. P?
Who was on P.C. P?

386
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,041
Hodgins' report on the organic matter
from the baggie found at the scene...

387
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,274
showed that it contained psilocybin
mushrooms injected with phencyclidine.

388
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,578
Whoa.
What a trip.

389
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,313
Well, if Lori ingested those, it's possible
she could've caused Graham's injuries.

390
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,619
Not to mention combining dissociative
anesthetics with hallucinogenic compounds.

391
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,319
It can have a devastating affect
on people with fragile brain chemistry.

392
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,658
So her mental condition
is probably genuine.

393
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,891
I'm gonna go talk to my buddy Brian
and see if he knows anything...

394
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,765
about the magical mystery tour
that Lori might've been on that night.

395
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,736
- If I could clear the forest...
- Then what?

396
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,743
[Booth]
Hey, Brian.

397
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,907
<i>Hey, Agent Booth.</i>
<i>This is Nate Gibbons, my film teacher.</i>

398
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,973
This is Agent Booth.
I told you about him.

399
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,144
Hello.

400
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,744
Hi.

401
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,652
- You're here about Graham Hastings?
- Yeah.

402
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,816
Was he one of your students?

403
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,454
Yes. He was, uh,
an incredibly gifted kid.

404
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,364
<i>What happened out there</i>
<i>was horrible.</i>

405
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,959
- Mmm.
- What are you doing here again?

406
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:28,597
- You wanna find out what
happened to Graham, don't you?
- Of course.

407
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,665
Yeah.
So what were we watching?

408
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,677
- That's pretty cool.
- Nothing, really.

409
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,805
It's this film I'm doing
for, uh, my degree.

410
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,442
<i>Brian's being modest.</i>
<i>He wrote and directed...</i>

411
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,817
an amazing modern take
on the Gilgamesh story.

412
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,948
Nate produced it.
I got it accepted into Sundance.

413
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,686
Oh. Congratulations.

414
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,194
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to Brian alone.

415
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:56,224
Sure.
We'll finish up later.

416
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,235
All right.

417
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,964
- Call me if you need anything.
- Mm-hmm.

418
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:17,552
Brian, listen, we have evidence suggesting that
Lori was taking drugs that night in the woods.

419
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,523
No.
Those woods are too thick.

420
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,822
We knew that we had
to keep our heads on straight.

421
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:27,228
<i>So as far as you know, Lori Mueller wasn't</i>
<i>under the influence of any hallucinogens?</i>

422
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,699
- No.
- When she was with Graham, was she violent?

423
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,396
- No way.
- Did you know that Graham was cheating on her?

424
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,998
Man, that was none of my business.

425
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,338
Sure, Graham was a hound,
and everyone knew it.

426
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,868
Maybe Lori found out,
got angry with Graham.

427
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,575
No, okay? There's no way.
It wasn't her, okay?

428
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,617
Whacked out or not, it wasn't her.

429
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,788
There was something else
out there that night.

430
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,695
<i>[Lori]</i>
<i>Where are we going? I can't see.</i>

431
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,323
[Brian]
Don't worry. Just stay close.

432
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,908
What is that?

433
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,002
<i>We're supposed to be looking</i>
<i>for eastern hemlock.</i>

434
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,013
It's much more effective
with your eyes open.

435
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,015
I just know what's gonna
happen here, okay?

436
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,916
This is where they freak out
because they hear the witch.

437
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,321
[Lori Screams]

438
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:28,655
Wait. There.
Did you see that?

439
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,592
Yeah. But where are they?
Go... Go forward.

440
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:37,057
<i>Stop. Dense crown, fine branches,</i>
<i>scaly bark and wide ridges.</i>

441
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,968
Those are eastern hemlocks.
Love your eyes.

442
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,268
Now we need a landmark.

443
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,140
You have to be quiet, okay?
There's something out there.

444
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,338
No! No!

445
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,472
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

446
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,676
[Speaking Backwards]

447
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,018
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>2:37 a.m.</i>

448
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,057
- So?
- We have a date plus an exact time.

449
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,027
<i>I can estimate the position of the moon</i>
<i>from shadowing patterns on the forest floor.</i>

450
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,723
We should be able to get
the approximate latitude and longitude.

451
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,460
- Yes.
- <i>[Brian] Graham, leave the camera!</i>

452
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,162
- [Graham] What about Lori?
- [Lori Screams]

453
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,434
Let's just work out
the coordinates.

454
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,600
- Yeah.
- <i>[Lori Screams] Graham?</i>

455
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,611
Graham?

456
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,675
<i>The ax was found</i>
<i>buried over there.</i>

457
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,776
Dried blood on the trunk.

458
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,378
Whoa.

459
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,391
<i>Make that a lot</i>
<i>of dried blood on the trunk.</i>

460
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,359
Someone should do a scraping here.

461
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,953
Where did you find the skull?

462
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,895
Buried just beyond those bushes.

463
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,558
But there's something else.

464
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,637
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>A second skull.</i>

465
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:58,911
- <i>[Edison] I'm afraid so.</i>
- Are there any other
outstanding cases in the area?

466
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,976
No, there aren't.

467
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,231
Well, based on bony architecture...

468
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,563
this skull's consistent
with that of Graham Hastings.

469
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,603
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>I'll confirm with the blood from the ax.</i>

470
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,400
- And the other skull?
- Female. Mid-30s at the time of death.

471
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,738
Which was between
the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries.

472
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,404
You know, this ax handle is birch.
<i>Betula uber.</i>

473
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,176
Same extinct species as
the wood fragments we found in the bone.

474
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,114
I'm almost done with her face.

475
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,517
<i>Why are you spending time on that?</i>
<i>It won't help the case.</i>

476
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,556
Come on.
Let the kids have some fun, Mom.

477
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:42,787
Both skulls have depressed fractures
on the parietal bones.

478
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,386
They could've been killed with a blow
to the head before they were decapitated.

479
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,522
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>In Graham's case, yes.</i>

480
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,935
But on the female skull,
there's evidence of new growth.

481
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,268
What looks like...

482
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,399
This person underwent trepanation.

483
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,875
An antiquated form of brain surgery.

484
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:04,313
<i>Practiced in the 1700s</i>
<i>on those suspected of witchcraft.</i>

485
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,215
- Do you think that skull is your Maggie Cinders?
- <i>[Hodgins] Of course not.</i>

486
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,880
I mean, there's no way to know, right?
I'm just saying...

487
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,450
it's interesting.

488
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,496
Hey, Bones, you know those papers that
Hodgins found in Graham Hastings's backpack?

489
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,593
- His hallucinogenic ramblings?
- Mm-hmm. You got it.

490
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,663
They were written on the back
of pages from his screenplay.

491
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,505
I don't see the significance.

492
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,137
Graham was a film student.
Of course he wrote screenplays.

493
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,274
Yeah, but this was a modern day take
on the Gilgamesh story.

494
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,185
The same story that Brian Andrews
is using for his film.

495
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,656
He stole Graham's screenplay.

496
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,321
Yeah.
Look familiar?

497
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,796
What...
Where'd you find these?

498
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,834
Graham Hastings's backpack
near his murdered body.

499
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,995
Care to explain why a movie
that's about to make it to Sundance...

500
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,539
sounds a lot like the screenplay
that your dead buddy wrote?

501
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,666
- Look, I know what you're thinking.
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

502
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:09,339
- <i>Because what I think is that you killed him.</i>
- No.

503
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,780
I think you're the one who drugged Lori
so she wouldn't know...

504
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,683
- <i>what the hell was going on that night.</i>
- No, I didn't.

505
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,551
<i>Look, I know that this may look similar,</i>
<i>but this is mine.</i>

506
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,388
Really? Because, you know, we found
an e-mail on Graham's computer...

507
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,895
sending you a complete
first version draft to you.

508
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,956
- He wanted you to read it, get your thoughts.
- So, what'd you think?

509
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,366
I thought...

510
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,905
I thought that it was better
than anything I could ever write.

511
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,033
So yeah, you know,
after Graham was missing a few months...

512
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,373
Nate thought it would be safe
to pass off as our own.

513
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,379
But I didn't kill Graham.

514
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,314
Anything else you forget
to mention, Brian?

515
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,582
<i>Oh, come on, Brian.</i>
<i>You love the movies, right?</i>

516
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,181
So this is the time where
the innocent guy comes clean...

517
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,749
or the guilty guy
asks for a lawyer.

518
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,397
<i>Okay, so which movie is this gonna be?</i>

519
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,326
That night...

520
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:12,842
Lori... When... When I found her,
she was covered in blood.

521
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,277
It wasn't hers.
I was afraid.

522
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,281
- You think she killed Graham?
- It wasn't her fault though.

523
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,410
She was nuts, okay? She said that
the blood just rained down on her.

524
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,183
I wanted to protect her.

525
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,918
So you got rid of the bloody clothing?

526
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:34,130
I hid them in the woods.
They're still out there.

527
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,225
- Okay, great. You can take us there.
- No!

528
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,236
Look, I'll tell you what I remember...

529
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,272
but I'm never going out there again.

530
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,637
You can lock me up
for the rest of my life.

531
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,802
I'm never going back out there.

532
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:53,310
The kid said he hid her clothes
in a hollow log near a stream.

533
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:57,184
Thanks. Angela looked at the video again.
Tell the forensic team...

534
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,747
to fan out across the area
south-southwest of the cabin ruins.

535
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,090
Did you hear that, Lou?
Yeah, south-southwest.

536
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,722
Yeah, I know it gets cold
when the sun goes down, Lou.

537
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,859
Well, you should've brought your blankie.
Just call me when you find her clothes.

538
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,903
Man!

539
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,735
[Sighs]
What?

540
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,139
- He was being a baby.
- I didn't say anything.

541
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,645
But you're looking at me
like I'm in trouble and you're a teacher.

542
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,477
- You're very touchy lately, Booth.
- Look, Bones.

543
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,450
I don't know why
I didn't tell you about Cam.

544
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,180
- Did I mention Cam?
- I just didn't want it to get weird, I guess.

545
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,723
Weird?

546
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,988
We're partners, you know?
Together all the time, right?

547
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,757
You're a woman, and I'm a man.

548
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:43,164
And I never had a relationship
like this where we were...

549
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:48,638
like two guys, except you're not,
you know, a guy.

550
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,301
- Yeah.
- No. No, I'm not.

551
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:57,440
Should I feel odd about
wanting to hang out with Will?

552
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,449
No, of course not.
You know?

553
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:04,318
Because essentially, I mean,
you're a guy like me, but not really.

554
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:09,725
That would mean that to me,
you are essentially a woman.

555
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,830
- Yeah, I can see that.
- No, no, no, no.

556
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,196
I'd prefer not to be a woman
if you don't mind.

557
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,167
- I'm merely trying to follow your reasoning.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

558
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,727
Okay, fine. What do you say we just,
you know... We'll drop it for now.

559
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,569
<i>Yeah, it's Booth.</i>
<i>They found the clothes.</i>

560
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,632
- That was fast.
- Well, good work, Lou.

561
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,545
All right, now you can come home
before all the monsters get you...

562
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,675
Hmm. Hung up on me.
I thought it was funny.

563
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,889
The blood from the ax
was from Graham Hastings.

564
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,394
Okay, was the blood
on Lori Mueller's clothes a match?

565
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,725
- Nope.
- Then there's another victim out there?

566
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,890
Yes, and she's probably named Bessie.

567
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,730
- Bessie?
- It's cows' blood.

568
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,930
The hormones and antibiotics affirm
that it's from a butcher shop.

569
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:58,237
Dr. Brennan, the witch's skull
was cut with a Stryker saw.

570
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,335
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>Don't you use those in your autopsies?</i>

571
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,346
<i>They're also used</i>
<i>in teaching institutions.</i>

572
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,942
I found a faded serial number behind the
occipital condyle. It's from the university.

573
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,455
So the skull was stolen
from the medical school.

574
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:16,050
Someone set up one hell of a horror show
to kill Graham Hastings.

575
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,859
- Have a seat.
- I'll help in any way I can...

576
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,995
but I do have a class
starting in 45 minutes.

577
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,734
Yeah, well, you know, it's film class.
Have 'em watch <i>Wedding Crashers.</i>

578
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:35,074
I can assure you, Agent Booth, that
film class is a lot more than watching movies.

579
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,205
Were you aware that
the medical school at the university...

580
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,079
has an anatomical
specimen collection?

581
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:44,611
I don't even know what that means.
This is about Graham, right?

582
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,422
<i>The research collection can only be accessed</i>
<i>by a faculty member with a key card.</i>

583
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,123
Yours was recorded entering
the building last November 7 th...

584
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,496
three days before
Graham Hastings disappeared.

585
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,298
You often go into a medical school
at 2:43 in the morning?

586
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,999
I reported my card missing last November.
You'll find a record of that.

587
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,440
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's convenient.</i>

588
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,139
- Very convenient.
- Are you accusing me of something?

589
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,740
<i>Someone stole a skull,</i>
<i>planted it in the woods...</i>

590
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:16,116
<i>along with animal bones,</i>
<i>blood, weird amulets.</i>

591
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,623
Tricking people into believing that
Graham was murdered by a ghost.

592
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,684
Okay, but why? Why would I possibly
want to do something like that?

593
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,858
- Ride his coattails, you know?
Escape the faculty ghetto.
- He shut you out.

594
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:34,098
And maybe you were feeling just
a little bitter about that, huh, teach?

595
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,477
I'm entitled to an attorney,
aren't I?

596
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:46,246
<i>Okay, maybe it was Graham</i>
<i>who stole the skull himself.</i>

597
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:50,344
Are you suggesting that it was
some convoluted suicide scheme?

598
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,412
- He chopped off his own head?
- No.

599
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,981
Look, I'm just saying things,
they got out of hand, right?

600
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,323
He wanted to make it look
like a documentary, right?

601
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,922
As scary as possible.
So he sets everything up, right?

602
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,193
He gets Nate to
help him out that night.

603
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,668
But Nate sees an opportunity.
No one knows he's out there.

604
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,729
And before you know, it's chop-chop,
and "I'm going to Hollywood."

605
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,867
I found someone else in the woods.

606
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,037
<i>I think it's a person.</i>

607
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,843
Have you finished with
the particulates from the ax handle?

608
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:20,611
I've determined that the assailant
was wearing rough-hewn leather gloves.

609
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,210
- But I still have to check.
- Then why are you in here?

610
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,779
Because I want him here.
Okay, look.

611
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,349
<i>I ran it through</i>
<i>a mass-recognition program.</i>

612
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,488
That's Graham,
and that is our mystery guest.

613
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,398
- It's not Brian?
- No. Different height and weight.

614
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,561
<i>This person is about 6'1 ".</i>

615
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,367
As you can see,
that includes a head.

616
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,074
<i>So it's definitely not Maggie.</i>

617
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,840
<i>Nate Gibbons is about 6'1 ".</i>

618
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,576
<i>I'll ask Will ifhe can tell us</i>
<i>anything about Graham and his teacher.</i>

619
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,641
<i>Maybe he threatened Graham.</i>

620
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,052
[Lori Screaming]

621
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,021
His professor?

622
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,755
Did Graham tell you anything
about his relationship with him?

623
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,890
He said the guy wanted to help produce his film.
Graham said he wanted to do it on his own.

624
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,594
His professor is producing his film.

625
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,035
Brian stole Graham's screenplay.

626
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,198
He and the professor are making it.

627
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,242
The teacher killed Graham
for a script?

628
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,278
It would make his career.
Brian's too.

629
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,575
I've seen people murdered
for a lot less.

630
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,809
It's not certain yet.

631
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:30,877
We're just looking for evidence that
links one or two of them to the remains.

632
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,817
With all this going on,
when I'm with you...

633
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,129
I feel like
everything's gonna be okay.

634
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,931
I'd like to see the world
the way you do.

635
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:52,407
Then you would be looking...

636
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,240
at a very beautiful woman.

637
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,034
<i>[Saroyan] Preliminary tests show</i>
<i>only one type of D.N.A. on the ax.</i>

638
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,766
But now the follow-up tests
are showing two.

639
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,606
- Something wrong with
our electrophoresis machine?
- No, I double-checked it.

640
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,612
So this means you got
the killer's D.N.A.

641
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,478
Right. The attacker must've been cut
by Graham during the struggle.

642
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,212
<i>I'm trying to separate out</i>
<i>the two types of D.N.A., but it's hard.</i>

643
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:39,017
It's easy. I'll just get a warrant
for a blood sample for Nate Gibbons.

644
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,992
<i>The glove fragments on the handle</i>
<i>were coated with diammonium phosphate...</i>

645
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,654
and a guar gum-derivative thickener.

646
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,062
- Do you speak English?
- It's a flame retardant.

647
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:52,899
<i>Exactly. Isn't that only used</i>
<i>by professional firefighters?</i>

648
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,064
Wait.
Graham's brother is a firefighter.

649
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,167
<i>He's also about 6'1 ", right?</i>
<i>And he has a head.</i>

650
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,146
That explains why it looks like
there was only one blood source.

651
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,683
Siblings share so many
of the same chromosomes.

652
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,050
Will Hastings killed his brother.

653
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,386
- That certainly explains my results.
- Brennan.

654
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,425
Wait.
She's with him now.

655
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:21,031
[Siren Wailing]

656
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,605
- Good and funny.
- That's your opinion.

657
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,665
I don't think you're the one
that should be telling me what...

658
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:36,008
<i>Booth.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

659
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,605
I'm sorry.

660
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,219
- You're under arrest for
the murder of your brother.
- Wait. What?

661
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,585
- You have the right to remain silent.
- What is this, Booth?

662
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,591
He did it.
Cam found his blood on the ax...

663
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,392
<i>and Hodgins found chemicals that</i>
<i>only a firefighter would have access to.</i>

664
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,898
I didn't kill Graham.

665
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,094
We fought. That's all.

666
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,764
You were out there
in the woods that night?

667
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,570
Please don't look at me like that.
Please? I was just helping my brother.

668
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,474
He said the film
was gonna make him famous.

669
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,878
<i>So you got the animal bones,</i>
<i>the blood...</i>

670
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,813
<i>and you made the chopping sound</i>
<i>with the ax.</i>

671
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:16,182
He wanted me to stay out of sight.

672
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,778
But the girl... Lori...
he slipped her drugs.

673
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,724
And she was screaming,
and I said I wasn't gonna help anymore.

674
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,887
And I said I wouldn't throw
the blood on her, so he did it.

675
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,932
And she went crazy, and you saw her.
Graham did that to her.

676
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,332
- Will...
- I had to stop him, okay?

677
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,463
<i>I can't be responsible for</i>
<i>raising a monster like that.</i>

678
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:41,000
- So you hit him with the ax.
- He was just lying there and
I was waiting for him to move.

679
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,742
And I've never... I've never even hit him before,
no matter how difficult he got.

680
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,751
Then you chopped off his head and you buried
him to make it look like some witch did it.

681
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,754
No.
She did it.

682
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:56,316
She did it. Maggie Cinders
was out there that night...

683
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,385
and she made me do it.

684
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,928
She told me never to tell anybody.

685
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,300
Maggie Cinders made me
cut off his head.

686
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,033
That's the only way it could happen.

687
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,271
You know me.
He was my brother.

688
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,212
I could never kill my own brother.

689
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,306
It was her!

690
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,353
What are you waiting for, Booth?

691
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,056
- You have the right to remain silent.
- No!

692
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,963
You understand me?

693
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,127
- <i>Anything you say...</i>
- No, please.

694
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,832
- Wait, please.
- will be used against you in a court of law.

695
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,637
You have the right to speak
to an attorney.

696
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:54,248
<i>Yeah. The F.B.I. needs me to finish</i>
<i>cataloguing the restored footage.</i>

697
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,913
It's cool.
I don't have anywhere else to go.

698
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,786
You've been great today, Hodgins.

699
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:04,419
I know.
I haven't seen that piece.

700
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,488
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Yeah, I was working on it before.</i>

701
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,693
It just finished rendering.

702
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,671
<i>Uh... Uh, it could...</i>
<i>could be a reflection.</i>

703
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,948
- <i>[Hodgins] Had to be. Or some moonlight.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

704
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,250
Uh, moonlight sounds right.

705
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,792
<i>Can I stay at your place tonight?</i>

706
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,763
Sure. No problem.

708
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,975
[Sighs]

709
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,542
I sure know how to pick 'em, don't I?

710
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,351
Well, you know.

711
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,980
Our perceptions are always colored
by what we hope...

712
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,217
and what we fear, what we love.

713
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,960
We do the best we can.

714
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,956
I'm afraid my best isn't good enough.

715
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,628
I can read bones, not people.

716
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,606
Well...

717
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,973
You know, you had no trouble
seeing through me.

718
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,519
- It's a good thing I like being alone.
- You know what? You're not alone.

719
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,615
Okay? Come on.

720
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,028
- Booth.
- Hey.

721
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,259
You're my partner.
Okay?

722
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,267
It's a guy hug.

723
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,868
Take it.

724
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,141
All right?
