00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,307
- You like this song?
- Nobody likes this song.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,110
Well, you're dancing to it.

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,151
Maybe swaying a little.
# [Hums]

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,918
- And humming.
- Bones, it's just something
that you do in the elevator.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,959
Buddhists say that
if we can lose ourselves in the moment...

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,327
without distraction or desire,
we experience truth.

8
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:35,095
Why can't you just hum
like a normal, happy person?

<i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,767
Not really in the mood.

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,569
Okay. Here we go.

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,840
<i>Special Agent Booth.</i>

13
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,852
And I'm gonna assume
this is Dr. Brennan?

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,854
Bones, Alex Radziwill.

15
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,083
He's, uh, from State Department.

16
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,820
- <i>Why'd you say it like that?</i>
- Booth believes the State Department...

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,886
was put on Earth
to protect bad guys from the F.B.I.

18
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,126
- I count three dead?
- <i>[Radziwill] Four. There's one behind the bar.</i>

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,792
Already I.D.'d as the bartender.

20
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,098
This was a cocktail party
after a conference...

21
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,105
on drug trafficking
in South America.

22
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,040
The keynote speaker was
Colombian judicial attaché Dolores Ramos.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,341
- Did she survive?
- Minor burns, smoke inhalation. She'll be fine.

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,938
- Luck of the draw.
- You seem uncomfortable.

25
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,348
- Does his size make you self-conscious?
- <i>[Booth] Bones.</i>

26
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:30,185
It's a condition... skeletal dysplasia.
Pseudoachondroplasia or S.E.D. congenita?

27
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,985
- Bones!
- What?

28
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,117
Dr. Brennan, I can see
that you're a straightforward person.

29
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,128
And as much as I appreciate
that quality...

30
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,859
what you're asking me
is neither your business nor relevant.

31
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,867
It's my business because
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

32
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,233
But you're right.
It's not relevant.

33
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,204
<i>So what happened here? Bomb?</i>

34
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,038
The blast came from the room next door.
Your people are working on the cause right now.

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,544
I'm betting Colombian drug types.

36
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,637
They just love blowing people up.

37
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,706
Before she was attached to the embassy,
Dolores Ramos was a prosecutor in Bogotá.

38
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,810
<i>She had plenty of enemies</i>
<i>in the cartels.</i>

39
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,355
- You I.D. anyone else besides the bartender?
- Hector Madure.

40
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,357
<i>Chief of police from Quito, Ecuador.</i>

41
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,655
I brought you in
to confirm the identity of his wife.

42
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,855
<i>She's the extra-crispy one.</i>

43
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,660
<i>[Radziwill]</i>
<i>Father Gabriel Ruiz...</i>

44
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,497
he ran a drug program
for kids in Bogotá.

45
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,799
Well, you know, it's a big score
for the drug cartels.

46
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,534
Any one of these people,
you know, make a good target.

47
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,542
I'm gonna check on
the condition of the survivors.

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,771
- You need anything, just holler.
- Will do.

49
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,248
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>What do you got, Bones?</i>

50
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,716
Female, mid-40s.

51
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:37,916
Bone structure fits this picture
of Constanza Madure pretty closely.

52
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,858
Dental work will confirm.

53
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:45,762
The debris embedded in the remains
suggests an explosion.

54
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,130
So does that giant hole
in the wall there.

55
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,729
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Part of the navicular. Top of the left foot.</i>

56
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,568
Not hers.

57
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,439
<i>There are other bone shards</i>
<i>scattered here.</i>

58
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,070
- Ooh. You mean, like, extra bits?
- Yes.

59
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,239
These are fragmented from the blast.

60
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,817
Ah, there's bone fragments
here in the wall.

61
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,316
I think someone
was standing in this room...

62
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,657
<i>very close to the bomb</i>
<i>when it went off.</i>

63
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,219
It had to be the bomber, right?
Talk about instant karma.

64
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,392
<i>The question is,</i>
<i>where are the rest ofhis remains?</i>

65
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,298
<i>Vaporized maybe.</i>

66
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,030
Unlikely.

67
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,664
- Oh. Huh.
- What do you got?

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,403
An external occipital protuberance.

69
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,605
<i>Fissures indicate thermal detachment.</i>
<i>It's the back of a human skull.</i>

70
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,844
Cam, any of your bodies
missing a protuberance?

71
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,579
No. All of these remains
are fully intact.

72
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,814
- <i>[Booth] Fully intact.</i>
- <i>[Saroyan] Uh-huh.</i>

73
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,494
- Not all of them.
- <i>[Booth] Oh.</i>

74
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,889
[Booth]
Arson investigators say that the explosion...

75
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,027
definitely originated in the room
next to the cocktail party.

76
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,972
- [Saroyan] Who was checked in there?
- Nobody. It was being renovated.

77
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,636
Paint, combustibles... they would've
added to the force of the fire and explosion.

78
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,078
So maybe the bomber
got caught by his own explosion.

79
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,981
- <i>Her</i> own explosion.
- Wait. The bomber was a female?

80
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,350
- Sciatic notch doesn't lie.
- Neither does the vagina.

81
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,355
Whoa. Uh, wait a minute.

82
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,357
Whoa. Wait a minute.

83
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,223
You're saying this skull
was so hot that it explodes...

84
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,559
but the girlie parts
are still intact?

85
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,895
She was thrown into that chandelier
above the fire. The deep tissue remained intact.

86
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,333
Thank you for that. I'll...

87
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,098
Particulates embedded in
the remains are a combination...

88
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,436
of glass, wood splinters,
plaster and drywall.

89
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,707
The bomber is Caucasian, 5 feet 4,
late teens/ early 20s. Still no I.D.

90
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,714
The hair sample makes her
a bleach-bottle blonde.

91
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,081
<i>Ankylosis in the right trochlea</i>
<i>and capitulum and scaphoid.</i>

92
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,677
Occupational markers
from carrying a tray.

93
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,780
<i>Mad bomber-teenage assassin-waitress?</i>

94
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,849
- She might not have had a choice.
- I don't understand.

95
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,861
The cartels force people
to do what they want.

96
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,397
Your waitress refuses,
the cartel wipes out her family.

97
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm running chemiluminescence tests now
to get a chemical fingerprint...

98
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:39,370
and then chromatography
to see what triggered the blast.

99
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,806
I scanned the skull
and reconstructed a face.

100
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,208
<i>Send it over to Booth.</i>
<i>If drugs are involved, maybe she has a record.</i>

101
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,947
- Yeah. I already did that.
- Listen, people, please.

102
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,148
Don't be sending stuff
without informing me first.

103
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,157
You wanted her to send it.
I heard you.

104
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,716
But not without first...

105
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,763
Just run everything
by me first, okay?

106
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,665
Every circus needs a ringmaster.
In this circus, it's me.

107
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,803
Yeah.

108
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,805
All we ask
at the State Department...

109
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,536
is that you treat this woman with the respect
she is due as a friend of this country.

110
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,544
I know how to question the witness.

111
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,080
I am here at the request
of the Colombian ambassador...

112
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,241
Judge Ramos
and the State Department.

113
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,251
Well, that's disingenuous.

114
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,549
What are the chances
that all three would ask you separately?

115
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,851
Why are you being
so confrontational?

116
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,585
You're used to people deferring
to you because of your size.

117
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,787
It's a normal response
that you take advantage of. I don't like it.

118
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,797
- Here we go.
- See?

119
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,265
Even you don't want
to say anything to hurt his tiny feelings.

120
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,700
I don't mean
that your feelings are tiny.

121
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,102
I mean that you have feelings
about being tiny.

122
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,436
The ramifications and repercussions
of impeded access...

123
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,375
will comprise accommodative
responses detrimental...

124
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,813
to your unabated participation
in our shared endeavors.

125
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,716
That's State Department-speak.
We don't do it his way, we'll get fired.

126
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,687
See? If a regular-sized person
tried to intimidate you...

127
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,689
you'd threaten to kick him
through the window.

128
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,658
But because in his case it's
an actual physical possibility...

129
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,558
Let's just question the judge.

130
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,689
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

131
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,495
That was a nice moment...
me translating for you.

132
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,267
[Woman] I was speaking
with Father Ruiz when the bomb went off.

133
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,331
I believe his body
protected me from the blast.

134
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,402
I was barely touched.
Father Ruiz was a very close friend of ours.

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,414
Did you see this woman...

136
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,508
at the hospitality suite
at the time of the explosion?

137
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,382
- No.
- <i>[Brennan] You're sure?</i>

138
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,888
She wasn't serving drinks,
anything like that?

139
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,016
The service staff were all from the embassy.
Who is she?

140
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,720
- She may have been the bomber.
- Mr. Radziwill.

141
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,390
The State Department recognizes Judge Ramos
as a great friend to this country...

142
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,867
and has charged me
with keeping her apprised of this investigation.

143
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,373
Did you or anyone receive any threats
at the embassy before the conference?

144
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,376
We are always receiving threats.
It's a fact of life for us.

145
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,743
<i>The government provides</i>
<i>my wife and our family with bodyguards.</i>

146
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,715
We have lost loved ones in the past.

147
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,775
A daughter.
Eight years ago.

148
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,684
Our condolences.

149
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,848
<i>[Mr. Ramos] Do you believe this woman</i>
<i>to be connected to the cartels?</i>

150
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,518
- We haven't identified her yet.
- Perhaps, Judge Ramos...

151
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,619
your friends in Colombian law enforcement
could be of help.

152
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,028
Yes, of course.

153
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,089
Anything to aid the investigation.

154
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,035
Thank you, Judge Ramos.
That's all for now.

155
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,671
Hey, can you upload
the pictures from this camera?

156
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,766
- Am I going to regret it?
- What kind of guy do you think I am?

157
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,937
It's just that men sometimes
think things are funny...

158
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,743
that women merely find gross.

159
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,843
They're pictures of the hotel room.
I went there to collect some samples.

160
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,218
- <i>[Computer Beeping]</i>
- Yeah. See?

161
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,725
The heat blast deposited the first layer
of residue on the walls... hydrocarbons.

162
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,760
- The first layer?
- Yep. Layer two...

163
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,820
I had to use an electron capture detector
to <i>identify.</i>

164
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:56,096
It was toluene and benzene... oxidized paint...
which just exploded from the cans.

165
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,070
- The explosion was a two-parter?
- More accurately a fire, then an explosion.

166
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,073
But get this.

167
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,837
I found a patch of wall
with <i>only</i> oxidized paint on it.

168
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,845
<i>Basically a shadow.</i>

169
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:11,350
<i>Something was between the wall and the fire,</i>
<i>then was gone when the explosion occurred.</i>

170
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,409
- Think you can figure out what it was?
- I can try.

171
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,355
- Cool.
- [Exhales]

172
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,655
I also found these blobs
of melted something.

173
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,695
Yeah, not my department.

174
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,527
You're just trying
to prolong this conversation.

175
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,742
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

176
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,212
The explosion shifted the placement
of the teeth in the maxilla and mandible.

177
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,341
I've repositioned them so that
we can match the dentals.

178
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,114
The computer is looking now.

179
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,519
Why do you suddenly
want to know everything?

180
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,889
I think there's a tendency here
for each of us to work too independently.

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,863
My closest acquaintance outside work
is a woman I know who's a performance artist.

182
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,992
<i>Last month, she enclosed herself</i>
<i>in a plastic box with six rabbits.</i>

183
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,470
It went over quite well.
Perhaps you've heard of her?

184
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,997
Zack, when I said everything,
I meant just the case.

185
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,742
- Lisa Winokur.
- Yep. Never heard of her.

186
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,145
- Me neither.
- Isn't she the rabbit woman?

187
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,412
No. Lisa Winokur's
the woman in the chandelier.

188
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:23,717
Oh, good.
I'll let Booth know you I.D.'d the victim.

189
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,247
- If you'd like to know anything else...
- I think I'm up to speed for now.

190
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,556
But thanks.

191
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,826
I saw about the explosion on the news.

192
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:37,392
But Lisa wasn't supposed to be working
at the hotel last night.

193
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,099
So I never thought
she'd be one of the casualties.

194
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,607
How long had your daughter
been working there?

195
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,509
Off and on, a couple of years.

196
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,173
Waitressing when she needed money.

197
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,546
<i>Tomorrow's her birthday.</i>

198
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,518
I ordered the cake.

199
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,578
<i>[Sobs]</i>

200
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,648
I thought that she was
spending the night out with friends.

201
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,886
That's why she didn't come home.

202
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,862
She spend many nights
away from home?

203
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,026
<i>My daughter was a very attractive young woman</i>
<i>living with her mother.</i>

204
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,697
She had boyfriends,
and, yeah, sometimes she didn't come home.

205
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:18,472
Did she have, uh...
um, anyone special in her life lately?

206
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,605
Yeah, but I...
I never met him. I don't know his name.

207
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,650
Is there anything
you can tell me about him?

208
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,448
Oh. He was foreign.

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,955
<i>Puerto Rican maybe?</i>

210
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,321
She called him "Senor Hot Stuff."

211
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,123
<i>Maybe that was a joke.</i>

212
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,221
She said he was rich.

213
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,661
Lisa was a really sweet girl.

214
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,729
[Cries]

215
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,073
The fire started approximately here.

216
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,247
Which means that whatever cast
your reverse shadow was positioned here.

217
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,621
- What cast the shadow?
- Well, I manipulated the images you gave...

218
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,183
in order to figure out
the shape of the silhouette.

219
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:13,425
The dark areas are where
there was both blowback residue from the fire...

220
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,868
and the deposits of oxidized paint
left by the explosion.

221
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,804
By going in as far
as individual pixels...

222
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,809
<i>I was able to find the area</i>
<i>where there was only paint residue.</i>

223
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,176
- That's a person.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,545
Given the angles
and the distance from the wall...

225
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,881
I'd say it's somebody
about six feet tall.

226
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,116
And Lisa Winokur was only 5 foot 4.

227
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,148
Which means whoever this was
got out before the actual explosion occurred.

228
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,718
Oh, I could kiss you.

229
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,323
That would require permission,
which I deny.

230
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,459
I'll tell Booth that the bomber
is alive and is six feet tall.

231
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,470
You'll tell who what?

232
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,632
There's a loop, people,
and I'm in it.

233
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,700
Not only am I in it,
I'm the big curvy part.

234
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,872
<i># [R& B]</i>

235
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,915
Lisa wasn't scheduled to work last night.

236
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,646
She just came in on her own as a customer.
Picked up a guy.

237
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,052
- You know anything about him?
- Looked Hispanic.

238
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,489
- That's not P.C. to say, but you want details, right?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,357
And it looked like he had money too.

240
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,919
- How tall was he?
- I don't know.

241
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,796
He was sitting when I saw him.

242
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:27,430
Look, Lisa was a good kid.
But she used to scope the place for rich guys.

243
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,565
- So she was a prostitute.
- <i>What?</i>

244
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,577
No. No.
She was just like any of us.

245
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,011
- Looking for a husband, right?
- [Chuckles]

246
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,485
This guy last night...
she zoned in on him real hard.

247
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,716
Took him upstairs,
you know, for privacy.

248
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,280
- Upstairs where?
- The room that was being renovated.

249
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,189
The... The one that caught on fire.

250
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,253
I mean, it's against the rules,
but we've all done it.

251
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,026
Right.
[Chuckles]

252
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,694
<i>I mean, why else work</i>
<i>in a high-class place like this, right?</i>

253
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,933
- Yeah.
- Someone's trying to flag you down.

254
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,940
- Oh.
- Denise. Denise!

255
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,976
Excuse me.

256
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,512
Looks like it's possible that
Lisa went upstairs for a little...

257
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,414
[Clicks Tongue]
quickie and, uh, wandered into a nightmare.

258
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,577
She was trying to get you to go upstairs for a little...
[Whistles]

259
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,554
Hey, that's the guy
that Lisa was with.

260
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,853
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Yeah. He looks like he can be six feet tall.</i>

<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>What do you say we go pay him a little visit?</i>

262
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,489
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

263
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,431
Oh, well, lose your friend,
and maybe.

264
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,962
It's about Lisa Winokur.

265
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,139
[Clicks]

266
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,307
Okay. It's cool, man.
It's all good.

267
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:54,085
<i>My name is Antonio Ramos! Call the</i>
<i>Colombian embassy. I have diplomatic immunity.</i>

<i>[Man On Radio]</i>
<i>Security, Sector 4 clear.</i>

269
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,306
[Saroyan]
Musculature of the neck preserved the trachea.

270
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,604
A swab shows no trace of carbon.

271
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,167
So Lisa Winokur was not
breathing when the fire started.

272
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,146
- I found semen.
- Where?

273
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:20,618
- The usual place.
- No. I mean, no condom?

274
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,711
Well, the sex may not
have been consensual.

275
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:27,054
If she was already dead when the fire started,
what killed her?

276
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,323
<i>Too much tissue damage for me.</i>
<i>Now it's time for the boneyard.</i>

277
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,121
You, Zack. Do your thing.

278
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,694
I'll have to ascertain if these fractures
were the result of heat, explosion or trauma.

279
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,570
Which means I need to know
the exact nature of the explosion.

280
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,836
How do you do that?

281
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,970
The usual way.

282
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,753
My embassy has been informed
of my whereabouts. I have nothing more to say.

283
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,520
- Antonio Ramos.
- Any relationship to, uh, Judge Dolores Ramos?

284
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,858
- She's my mother.
- This seriously calls genetics into question.

285
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,559
You know,
your mother is a great woman.

286
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,070
Have some water.
Why'd you run, Antonio?

287
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,106
In my experience,
there are two reasons why people run.

288
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,199
One, danger.

289
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,006
- What's wrong with your arm?
- What?

290
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,546
Your arm.
How did you hurt it?

291
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,071
<i>The second reason people run</i>
<i>is they got something to hide. So...</i>

292
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,277
<i>you got something to hide, Tony?</i>

293
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,789
<i>Compound fracture.</i>
<i>Three or five pins in there.</i>

294
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,051
Say, uh, six months old?

295
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,922
Did you have sex
with her last night?

296
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,452
[Chuckling] Is she what this is about?
Because it was her idea, not mine.

297
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,933
- How well do you know her?
- Very well, and not so well,
if you know what I mean.

298
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,061
- [Chuckles]
- I don't know what he means.

299
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,765
It means he had sex with her
and forgot to learn her name.

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,808
Well, you say that, not me.

301
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,503
Well, it's not like you, uh,
exactly have a record...

302
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,671
because you have, you know,
diplomatic immunity.

303
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,908
More like a list of complaints.

304
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,314
Let's see here.
Okay. Speeding...

305
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,912
D.U.I., riding a motorcycle
on the mall...

306
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,821
- <i>urinating on a national monument.</i>
- Good one.

307
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,825
Substance abuse charges,
every one of them.

308
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,124
My guess is you, uh,
got drunk and fell off a bicycle.

309
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,460
It was a motorcycle.

310
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,092
Agent Booth, you know Antonio Ramos
has diplomatic immunity...

311
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,102
yet you insist on questioning him.

312
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,263
Uh, diplomatic immunity doesn't
mean I can't question him.

313
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,273
It means I can't throw him in jail.

314
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,707
- Are you all right, Antonio?
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,474
<i>Mr. Ramos, you're free to leave.</i>
<i>The F.B.I. will not bother you anymore.</i>

316
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,448
- Can he promise that?
- No. Do you have any other higher aspirations...

317
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,486
rather than just, you know,
babysitting drunken playboys?

318
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,350
She's dead.

319
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,257
- Who?
- Lisa.

320
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,124
Lisa Winokur.

321
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,688
- <i>That was her name.</i>
- How did she die?

322
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,496
In the same explosion
that nearly killed your mother.

323
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,595
- <i>[Booth] Did Lisa ever mention your parents?</i>
- Agent Booth.

324
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,971
- She knew who they were.
- Antonio, answer no more questions.

325
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,408
That's enough.

326
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,346
[Exhales]

327
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,311
You have something
to say to me, Dr. Brennan?

328
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,219
Little people have a long history
of being close to power.

329
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,781
As clowns and court jesters.
I see you've been to the art museum.

330
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,351
Yes. But as clowns
and court jesters...

331
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,331
they were the only ones allowed to mock the king,
to give him perspective.

332
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,698
You don't do that, Mr. Radziwill.

333
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,169
You just do what the king says...

334
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,706
without putting anything
into perspective.

335
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,039
Good thing I'm neither
a clown nor a court jester.

336
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,045
Whoa... Don't do that.

337
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,378
It's D.N.A. evidence.

338
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,916
<i>The F.B.I. couldn't find any</i>
<i>evidence of an explosive charge.</i>

339
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,682
- Then what blew up?
- <i>[Zack] There was liquor in the room.</i>

340
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,349
Paint, turpentine.

341
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,485
Paint, turpentine
and liquor blew down a wall...

342
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,086
<i>torched four people</i>
<i>and deposited a corpse...</i>

343
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,189
in a chandelier
12 feet off the ground.

344
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,200
There was also
petroleum distillate...

345
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,964
and six H.V.L.P. canisters
hidden under tarps.

346
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,005
High volume, low pressure.

347
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,200
So you can see where this is going.

348
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,505
[Together]
No, we can't.

349
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,511
A fire was set.

350
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,606
The question is, given these ingredients,
would there be a secondary explosion?

351
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,617
<i>I did the math very carefully.</i>

352
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,619
This experiment
should generate an explosion...

353
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,088
approximately 1/1000th
the magnitude of the explosion at the hotel.

354
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,558
- Excuse me?
- 1/1000th.

355
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,095
I think she meant
the explosion part, Zack.

356
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,154
Relax. A little pop.

357
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,098
This blast wall Zack built...
it's merely a precaution.

358
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,898
We can watch through this porthole.

359
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,098
Hey, I'm gonna wait outside.

360
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,165
I hear that.

361
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,475
Did they not hear me say
I did the math quite carefully?

362
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,213
All right, I'll ignite the alcohol.

363
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,484
The math says there will be
a 10-to-12-second gap...

364
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,287
before the H.V.L.P. container explodes.

365
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,951
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Fine. Ready?</i>

366
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,997
Igniting the alcohol.

367
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,325
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

368
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,965
- [Loud Explosion]
- <i>[Zack, Hodgins Shouting]</i>

369
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,975
- Man!
- Whoa! [Coughing]

370
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,773
<i>[Electronic Beeping]</i>

371
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,779
Are you all right?
Can you breathe?

372
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,145
Hey, how many fingers
am I holding up?

373
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,685
I'm okay.
I'm all right. Come on.

374
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,153
- I don't understand what happened.
- You know what that proves?

375
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,088
That you guys are idiots?

376
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,252
That a blast that strong
wasn't necessarily a bomb.

377
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,523
Most likely,
somebody killed Lisa Winokur...

378
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,588
then started a fire
to cover up their crime.

379
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,156
Without knowing
there would be a huge explosion.

380
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,137
That's good, guys. Nice job.

381
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:44,471
<i>Your theory of the crime is that Antonio Ramos</i>
<i>started a fire to cover up a rape and murder.</i>

382
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,376
- D.N.A. matches the sperm found in Lisa Winokur.
- What do you want from me?

383
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,007
Have the kid declared persona non grata
because of his previous offenses.

384
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,313
- That gets rid of diplomatic immunity.
- And you can arrest him?

385
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,319
- Exactly.
- Never gonna happen.

386
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,117
Right. BecauseJudge Ramos
is such a good, good friend of this country.

387
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,920
I don't think you can calculate
just how many American lives...

388
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,019
she's saved by taking a hard line
on the cartels in Colombia.

389
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,031
Obviously you have orders from the State
Department to have this whole diplomatic mess...

390
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,397
booted out of the United States
and back into Colombia.

391
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:14,064
Don't say anything.
Just, you know, if I'm right, just keep breathing.

392
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,367
Bogotá, 1998.

393
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,138
The Ramos family is leaving the city
for their country home.

394
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,648
Their convoy is attacked.
End to a long, ugly story...

395
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:27,481
<i>13-year-old Antonio is running away</i>
<i>from the fighting carrying his little sister.</i>

396
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:31,579
Only trouble is, he has to keep going back
to pick up pieces of her brain.

397
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,888
That's a sad story.
But it doesn't mean the guy can get drunk...

398
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,928
and kill five people...

399
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,930
including an American citizen.

400
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,327
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Yeah?

401
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,398
Booth, it's Cam.
We know how Lisa Winokur died.

402
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,409
- She was strangled?
- The hyoid is cracked at the tips but not burned.

403
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,006
Something was around her neck
when the fire got to her.

404
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,382
Hodgins found burned fibers.
He's analyzing them now.

405
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,944
<i>I also noticed</i> a broken finger.

406
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:07,753
- I'm using those words especially for you, Booth.
- Thanks.

407
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,795
<i>Also, disjunct</i>
<i>of acromion and coracoid...</i>

408
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,353
with damage to the glenoid.

409
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,593
- Dislocated shoulder.
- <i>[Saroyan] A typical injury...</i>

410
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,535
of a victim on the ground straining
against someone strangling her from behind.

411
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:24,234
[Brennan] There was a split in the cartilage
between the T3 and T4 vertebrae.

412
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,300
Excuse me.
[Mutters]

413
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,710
I thought that might be
from the fire or explosion.

414
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,941
But why only those two vertebrae?

415
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,474
You make a good point.
I'll take another look.

416
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,949
Cam? Cam.

417
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,925
Has anyone said anything
to you about, um...

418
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,927
you know?

419
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:47,453
- Us sleeping together?
- You gotta be way more careful
about blurting that out.

420
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,659
Okay, voices, they carry,
building like this.

421
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,669
There's no one around,
and you brought it up.

422
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:55,298
Well, I mean, Angela is practically psychic
about this kind of stuff, right?

423
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,865
So you can't be thinking about me
when, you know, she's around.

424
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,877
- Especially not naked.
- I'll do my best.

425
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,846
Onyx, peridot and Peruvian opal.

426
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,975
Probably jewelry.
It's an unusual combination. Very expensive.

427
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,485
Yeah, well, Lisa Winokur...
I mean, she was a waitress.

428
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,151
You know, I highly doubt that her tips
would be able to cover expensive jewelry.

429
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,957
<i>Well, a waitress that's having sex</i>
<i>with a Colombian princeling...</i>

430
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,554
I mean, you don't buy expensive jewelry
for a one-night stand.

431
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,032
And maybe Antonio was lying
about not knowing Lisa.

432
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,035
- Well, exactly.
- Yeah.

433
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,633
Angela found a jeweler named Lawrence Melvoy
who works in this stuff.

434
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,233
- Okay.
- I'll start...

435
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,834
- All right, great.
- Yeah.

436
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,577
- Take that?
- Yeah, yeah.

437
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,354
Oh, my God.
What happened?

438
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,224
- <i>[Booth] Is this jewelry yours?</i>
- Definitely.

439
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,629
- Are these pieces expensive?
- This piece was worth 8,000.

440
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,930
- Dollars?
- My work is all original.

441
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,699
This one went to a young woman.

442
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,502
Cheap shoes,
expensive watch, you know?

443
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,543
No. I'm sorry.
I don't know.

444
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,706
<i>That combination means that someone else</i>
<i>purchased this piece for the young woman.</i>

445
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,875
Could, uh, this be the woman?

446
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,885
- <i>That's her.</i>
- Yeah.

447
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,887
I need to know who made
the actual purchase.

448
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,220
- I don't know the buyer.
- You know how it was paid?

449
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,351
I have a bank routing number.

450
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,486
Oh. That'll do.

451
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,038
Hey, I've had a realization.

452
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,404
Oh, I've never seen you
on the computer before.

453
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,809
I'm, uh, just trying
to find out who bought...

454
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,905
Lisa Winokur expensive jewelry.

455
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,246
What? Me being on the computer...
is that what, your realization?

456
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,618
No. Antonio Ramos could not have been
Lisa Winokur's attacker.

457
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,453
Why couldn't our prime suspect
have committed the murder?

458
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,585
- Antonio's arm has pins in it.
- Pins?

459
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,925
Yeah. So he's maybe 30%
of his normal strength.

460
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,727
No way that's enough to
dislocate our victim's shoulder.

461
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,098
- <i>So how?</i>
- How what?

462
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,195
Well, how can you find
the jewelry thing on the computer?

463
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,206
I have a bank routing number
that dead-ends...

464
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,175
at an offshore corporate account
belonging to a shell corporation...

465
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,610
in the Netherlands Antilles.

466
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,806
- Isn't that impossible to trace?
- <i>Well, no.</i>

467
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,784
Since 9/11, all foreign wires
have to register an individual's name...

468
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,786
with the State Department.

469
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,789
So I simply...

470
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,690
access the State Department database.

471
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,093
- <i>Aw, hell.</i>
- <i>[Brennan] What?</i>

472
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,262
That little bastard
is protecting someone.

473
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,972
<i>[Radziwill] If the computer</i>
<i>says confidential, then it's confidential.</i>

474
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,346
I find it best not to argue
with computers.

475
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,476
Were you the one
who authorized the block...

476
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,545
or did it come from
higher up on the food chain?

477
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,954
Go through channels.
Make a request.

478
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,153
- Go to hell, Alex.
- Why are you being so mean?

479
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,856
'Cause "go through channels"
is diplomatic double-talk for "get lost."

480
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,263
- Can I talk to him?
- Hello? Dr. Brennan?

481
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,359
<i>I'm just small, not invisible.</i>

482
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,927
Under what circumstances,
in general...

483
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,132
- <i>would the State Department</i>
<i>block a name like this?</i>
- [Sighs]

484
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,141
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Come on, Alex.</i>

485
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,473
Hey, don't be one of them.
Go on a limb, huh?

486
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:31,481
Fine. Might be an intelligence asset
or someone under investigation.

487
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,490
It could be a request
from Homeland Security.

488
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,492
They just do
whatever the hell they want.

489
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,391
<i>Could be a C.I.A. shell company...</i>

490
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,896
masquerading as a bad guy,
or a bad guy who's been compromised.

491
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,830
The I.R.S. could be working
offshore shelters.

492
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,390
- It could be someone...
- <i>[Booth] Ha!</i>

493
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,629
- Ha!
- He didn't say anything.

494
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:49,140
He was about to say
"diplomatic immunity."

495
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:53,007
Let's say the boy bought the girl some jewelry.
That doesn't mean he killed her.

496
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:57,708
It means he was lying when he said
he met her for the first time that night.

497
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,183
Come on, Alex. This isn't evidence for court.
I'm just collecting names.

498
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,415
- Please. Like that's gonna work on me.
- [Sniffs]

499
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,415
Whoever killed Lisa Winokur
is responsible...

500
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,485
for the deaths of four other people,
including a priest.

501
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,225
Doesn't the State Department
have to assure those families...

502
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,927
they're doing everything they can
to apprehend the responsible party?

503
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,266
- Are you threatening the State Department?
- No.

504
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,736
- Yes.
- What?

505
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,069
- <i>That's a great idea.</i>
- What's a great idea?

506
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,872
- The F.B.I. blackmailing the State Department.
- He has diplomatic immunity.

507
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,879
There's nothing you can do.

508
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,415
Come on, Alex.
Baby steps.

509
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,782
- No offense.
- <i>[Brennan Chuckles]</i>

511
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:43,419
<i>because you're so small.</i>

512
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,759
It's probably offensive.

513
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,027
Sorry. I can't help you.

514
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,034
Sorry.

515
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,808

516
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,937
Brought you some coffee.
It's late.

517
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,915
You said you found burned silk fibers
on Lisa Winokur's throat, right?

518
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,385
Yeah. The good stuff too.
Unwound filament. Probably Chinese.

519
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,981
None of this carded, combed or spun stuff.
And definitely not nubbly.

520
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,222
- What?
- You are a man of odd enthusiasms.

521
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,732
I'm checking for silk neckties
on the men at the party.

522
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,995
- <i>[Computer Beeping]</i>
- Look at this.

523
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,566
<i>That's Antonio</i>
<i>two hours before the explosion.</i>

524
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,574
All the evidence points towards him.

525
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:34,373
But Brennan says with his bad arm,
there's no way he could've killed Lisa Winokur.

526
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,849
I... I know something.

527
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,512
And when you know it,
you should know that I know.

528
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:47,183
But I don't feel we can discuss it until you,
you know, know it independently from me.

529
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,795
Are you sniffing my hair?

530
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,331
You called it, baby.
Man of odd enthusiasms.

531
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,962
Lisa Winokur's finger is broken.

532
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,702
<i>Zackaroni, almost every bone</i>
<i>in her body was broken.</i>

533
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,506
This break was professionally set.

534
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:12,039
It had started healing,
I'd say around two weeks ago.

535
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,917
And before I cleaned the bones,
I noticed this metallic sheen.

536
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,818
I thought it was a cheap ring,
but it's aluminum.

537
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,985
- I think it was a splint.
- Do you draw a conclusion from that?

538
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,155
I don't really do that,
which is why I called you.

539
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,831
<i>I don't see how</i>
<i>health insurance forms can help you.</i>

540
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,164
Yeah, I'm gonna have these
photocopied, okay?

541
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,204
Sure.

542
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,174
[Clears Throat]

543
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,052
Anthropologically speaking...

544
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,859
a man gives a woman a gift
as a way of laying claim.

545
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:04,698
As a way of marking her as his...

546
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,896
to the other males in the community.

547
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,372
All I know is,
he gave her nice things.

548
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,207
And when he started talking
about breaking it off, we were both surprised.

549
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,941
They were breaking up?

550
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,178
I told her not to give up that easy.

551
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,152
I told her that
when it comes down to it...

552
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:27,180
a man like this,
who's rich and sophisticated...

553
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,125
he'll do the right thing by you.

554
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,358
You advised your daughter
to get pregnant?

555
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,365
<i>It sounds bad.</i>

556
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,870
But there was no reason
for Lisa to live the life I led.

557
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:47,503
Please tell me my daughter wasn't murdered
because I told her to get pregnant.

558
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,013

559

<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

for a moment?

561
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,850
Uh...

562
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,983
Excuse me.

563
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,155
- What did you do to her?
- I don't know.

564
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,168
- Hospital admission forms.
- Yeah? What about 'em?

565
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,899
Look at the signature of the person
who dropped Lisa off at the emergency room.

566
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,101
"Juan Vasco Ramos."
That's Antonio's father.

567
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,509
Lisa was having an affair
with the judge's husband, not her son.

568
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,013
- And he was leaving her.
- How do you know that?

569
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,778
She advised her daughter
to get pregnant...

570
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,115
when it looked likeJuan Ramos
was about to dump her.

571
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,782
Yeah, Lisa sees the boy drunk,
decides to seduce him.

572
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:36,020
Has unprotected sex
in an effort to get pregnant.

573
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:40,190
Dad finds out, and suddenly
the troublesome girlfriend is worth killing.

574
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,534
She's worried that her advice
got her daughter killed.

575
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,535
Yeah, she's probably right.
I tell you what.

576
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,663
I'm gonna call Radziwill and have him
bring Dad in for questioning.

577
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,800
Oh, you know what?
I should leave you alone more often.

578
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,553
- Good morning.
- Where's Juan Ramos?

579
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,054
He declined your invitation.
He decided to go back home to Colombia.

580
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,183
- What airline?
- Why? You can't do anything anyway.

581
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,159
Well, he killed five people!

582
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,220
Yes, yes.
Let's not go through the mortality list again.

583
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,232
I need to know what airline.

584
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,396
Private jet out of
Kent Island Airport.

<i>Even if we get there on time,</i>
<i>how are we gonna stop them from taking off?</i>

All right, call Hodgins.

587
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,873
What can Hodgins do?
I mean, this isn't about evidence.

588
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,540

Better they don't find out.

607
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,508
The F.A.A. got a call

608
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,106

the National Liberation Army...

609
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,310
a terrorist organization

610
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,320
And you took it seriously?

611
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,618
Caller used
a highly classified code phrase...

612
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,124
- <i>which established the threat as authentic.</i>
- Really?

613
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:51,491
A highly classified code phrase

<i>inside the terrorist organization.</i>

615

If it weren't, I might suspect you had
something to do with it.

616
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,234
Booth, you seem to have trouble
accepting that there is...

617
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,172
absolutely nothing you can do
in these circumstances.

618
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,710
Well, Juan Ramos just,

619
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,270
This whole diplomatic immunity thing.
The whole thing just stinks.

620
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,146
You should think
it stinks too, Mr. Radziwill.

621
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,708
Put together your evidence package.
Submit it to State.

622
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,880
We'll present it to
the Colombian authorities.

623
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,515
Let them decide whether
or not to levy charges.

624

Wait, wait.
That's our only option?

625
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,260
Hope that a foreign government
will lay charges...

626
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,262
based on a forensics-heavy investigation...

627
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,662
done by American law enforcement
on another continent?

628
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,201
Unless you can persuade him
to give up diplomatic immunity...

629
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,362
yes, it's our only option.

- <i>About as long...</i>

631
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,832

00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,605
<i>Maybe 24 hours.</i>

<i>You're the one who said you have to</i>
<i>be kept up to date on everything.</i>

634
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,542
When I said everything, I might have been
a bit too... You tend to be very literal.

635
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,178
Thermal dislocation
can be extremely deceptive.

636
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,417
Typically heat causes
short bones to move at the ends.

637
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,721
These were split in the middle.

638
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,784
What?

639
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,827
- Brennan!
- Whoa. What'd I do?

640
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,026
T3 and T4 are behind the lungs.

641
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,036
This is why we have to
communicate more because...

642
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,572
I have a cell phone, Dr. Saroyan.

643
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,336
I found evidence of a perforation
in the membrane of her lungs.

644
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,846
That could be connected to
the T3 and T4 vertebrae damage.

645
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,576
Exactly what I thought. Could it have been
pierced by a rib during the attack?

646
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,016
The ribs were not broken pre-explosion.

647
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:26,386
The vertebrae were pushed apart
so they'd slide across the lung surface.

648
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,391
That would cause a tear.

649
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,393
No. This is definitely a puncture.

650
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,021
Whatever pierced the membrane
was forced through the vertebrae.

651
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,065
- A knife?
- Zack?

652
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,000
No cuts on the bone.
Something softer than a blade.

653
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,196
To reach the lung from the back...

654
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,207
means moving through the epidermis,
dermis, hypodermis, subcutaneous fat...

655
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,369
and three layers of thoracic muscle fiber
and connective tissue.

656
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,504
Not to mention
splitting those vertebrae.

657
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,844
That requires
a great deal of pressure...

658
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,680
suggesting the force
of a leg, not an arm.

659
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,348
It's as though Juan Ramos drove something
into Lisa Winokur's back with his foot.

660
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,857
Mmm. Like a golf tee?

661
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,689
<i>[Booth] A golf tee?</i>

662
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,286
- That makes no sense.
- I'm not sure what we're looking for.

663
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,298
A sharp implement.

664
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:12,302
- He has a pen in his pocket.
- <i>[Booth] Wait. How would he force a pen...</i>

665
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,100
through her back with his foot?

666
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,403
Judge Ramos is 5 foot 9?

667
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,375
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

668
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,537
- Why is she the same height as her husband?
- [Beeping]

669
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,047
<i>Three-inch stiletto heels.</i>

670
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:29,052
We assumed the killer
was six feet tall and a he.

671
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,318
But what if it was a 5-foot-9 woman
wearing three-inch heels?

672
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,554
I mean, could Judge Ramos
have driven her heel...

673
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,790
- [Bones Snap]
- <i>into Lisa Winokur's back as she strangled her?</i>

674
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,991
The judge finds out that
the waitress is having sex...

675
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,591
<i>with both her husband and her son,</i>
<i>trying to get pregnant.</i>

676
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,603
- That's motive for murder.
- Also...

677
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,767
before the fire,
she has a beautiful silk wrap on.

678
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,469
Afterwards, it's gone.

679
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,479
That's what she used
to strangle Lisa Winokur.

680
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,449
Great. It was Judge Ramos.
She did it. Very compelling evidence.

681
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,452
Excellent. But you know what?

682
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,421
- Too bad. It's useless.
- Unless...

683
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,118
<i>we can find a way to make</i>
<i>Judge Ramos waive her diplomatic immunity.</i>

684
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,127
How are we gonna do that?

685
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,165
Go grab a cup of coffee.

686
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,363
- I'll figure it out.
- Get some pie, Bones? Let's get some pie.

687
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,303
Pie? Why are we having pie?

688
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,831
Cherry pie.
Not too tart, not too sweet.

689
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,305
Oh, yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

690
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,542
Wow.

691
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:36,951
Hey, love is in
the purified and ionized lab air.

692
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,955
Why should we resist?

693
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,151
Go.

694
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,558
A woman likeJudge Ramos, who stood up
to drug cartels, who always did the right thing...

695
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:50,123
it's hard to imagine
her killing another human being.

696
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,829
Bones, she's a strong woman.
That's why she stood up to the cartels...

697
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,064
and lived on after
her daughter was killed.

698
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,164
Hey, look, her point of view...

699
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,175
Lisa Winokur was
threatening her family.

700
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,177
So she snapped.

701
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,213
Will she get away with it?

702
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,374
Yeah.

703
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,815
I think she will.

704
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,285
Okay. We all got together...

705
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,585
Well, Zack wouldn't help until I threatened him.
But the rest of us...

706
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,926
The blowback pattern shows...

707
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,394
that Lisa Winokur's killer
was six feet tall.

708
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,023
Antonio Ramos is six feet tall.

709
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,227
Lisa Winokur had sex
immediately before her demise.

710
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,000
D.N.A. tests show
it was with Antonio Ramos.

711
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,372
Lisa Winokur was strangled
with a silk ligature.

712
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,741
Antonio Ramos favors silk ties.

713
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,714
Why are you manipulating the facts
to make it sound like Antonio was the killer?

714
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,946
No, it's okay, Bones.
Let her... Let her continue.

715
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,352
<i>Because ofhis broken arm,</i>
<i>Antonio Ramos was forced...</i>

716
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,721
to place his foot
on Lisa Winokur's back...

717
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,022
damaging her vertebrae.

718
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,360
You are fabricating a scenario by misrepresenting
the evidence and omitting key facts.

719
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,525
It's a bluff.
Cops do it all the time.

720
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,534
So you think if we frame Antonio...

721
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:03,301
Judge Ramos will confess
to save her own son.

722
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,706
What mother wouldn't?

723
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,904
- Bones?
- No. No.

724
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,039
It's no different than lying
to a criminal to get a confession.

725
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,641
Or having Hodgins call the F.A.A.
with a fake terrorism tip.

726
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,712
- He did what?
- Oh, what? Now suddenly there's a line here?

727
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,916
- You can't allow this.
- I'm a hundred percent against it.

728
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,255
Seeley, you hate
diplomatic immunity.

729
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,352
I'm against it when it's interfering
with my murder investigation...

730
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,260
but the world's bigger than that.

731
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,094
What are you talking about?

732
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,101
We cheat diplomatic immunity here in D.C.,
we catch a murderer.

733
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,262
That's great.
They do it in "Upper Kamikazestan"...

734
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,069
and our boys end up
on a red-hot spit over a slow fire.

735
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,508
There's no such place
as "Kamikazestan."

736
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,739
Okay. Bottom line is,
we ignore diplomatic immunity...

737
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,010
and the rest of the world finds out,
it's open season on Americans.

738
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,746
So you know what?
Thanks for the effort and the fake file.

739
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,584
But let's just remember, all right?

740
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,786
We're the good guys.
Oh, I'm gonna need that real evidence file too.

741
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,795
Okay.

742
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,000
- Even if this were true...
- It's true.

743
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,507
- My family and I have diplomatic immunity.
- That's politics.

744
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,236
A woman like you...
a judge, a prosecutor...

745
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,370
who's given up
their whole life for justice...

746
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:20,884
You can't live
for what you did to Lisa Winokur.

747
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,814
- What next?
- The F.B.I. formally hands this evidence over to me.

748
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:33,353
<i>I present it to the ambassador.</i>
<i>He presents it to the attorney general of Colombia.</i>

749
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,992
And the State Department gets what it wants,
what you've been working for all along.

750
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,867
- This mess in another country.
- All parties played by the rules. That's diplomacy.

751
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,803
Still, speaking outside of my role
as a member of the State Department...

752
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,542
the attorney general of Colombia
is not a friend to you.

753
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,914
No, he is not.

754
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,078

<i>This evidence is political ammunition.</i>

I mean, there'll almost
certainly be a trial...

756
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,924
and he would certainly want you in jail,
which would mean...

757
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:05,553
The cartels have been
trying to kill me for years.

758
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,030

<i>Might I make a suggestion?</i>

00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,607
Waive your diplomatic immunity...

762
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,543
and be tried fairly
here in the United States.

763
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,621

<i>I turn this evidence over</i>
<i>to an American prosecutor...</i>

765
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,086

766
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,264

I waive diplomatic immunity.

Heh! Probably falsifying evidence.
