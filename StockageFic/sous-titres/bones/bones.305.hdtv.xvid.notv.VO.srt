1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,240
Come, my brave children, to
the hideous halloween maze.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,790
Avoid the creepies and the crawlies that
live in every dark corner of the maze.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,210
And the first one to reach
the center and emerge alive

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,580
will win the grand prize.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,840
Oh, here we go.

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,800
Where am I?

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,420
somebody help me!

8
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,920
Right this way, miss.

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,560
Now that is an excellent costume.

10
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:18,380
What are you wearing?

11
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:19,248
What? Now?

12
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:21,882
No, not now. To the
jeffersonian halloween ball.

13
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,541
What I always wear.
Are you going this year?

14
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,940
I'm the official unofficial
fbi liaison to the jeffersonian.

15
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,380
Of course I'm going.

16
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:29,842
We just passed the wolman.

17
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:33,291
Go straight towards the
guillotine and veer left.

18
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:34,493
It's a maze. What can I do?

19
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,110
Dr.Potoska, how were
the remains discovered?

20
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:38,961
A kid passed out.

21
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,202
What killed him?

22
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:41,790
The kid didn't die. He just fainted.

23
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:43,073
Then why am I here?

24
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,280
Well, when matty fainted, I
was here with my own kids.

25
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:48,083
I'm a pediatrician, but
I'm also the coroner.

26
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,003
Small town.

27
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,890
Yeah, well, matty revived easily enough.

28
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,262
Uh, he's what you call
a nervous type kid.

29
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:56,780
But then I saw what it was that
made him faint in the first place

30
00:01:56,796 --> 00:02:00,232
and I almost fainted, too, because it
was a mummy, which I told the sheriff, 

31
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,343
who called the fbi, who
called the jeffersonian.

32
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,700
And now here we are, lost in this
stupid maze looking for the mummy.

33
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:07,420
A mummy?

34
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,912
Yeah, I do not see a guillotine.

35
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:11,901
*******

36
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,203
a cowboy?

37
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,571
No, it's a scarecrow.

38
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:17,221
Look, just keep turning
to the right, all right?

39
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:19,232
Let me know when you reach the dragon.

40
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:20,881
Uh, dead end...

41
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:21,683
with teeth.

42
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,210
That's because you
turned left at the goblin.

43
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,561
You were supposed to turn right.

44
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,331
Look, when you say a mummy, you mean, uh...

45
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:29,781
Wrapped in bandages, curse of
king tut. You know, a mummy.

46
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:34,000
No offense, but I'm not certain
a pediatrician is qualified...

47
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,693
pediatrician and
coroner. See that?Yeah...

48
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:39,881
okay, we are at the electric chair.

49
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:41,853
There's an electric chair?

50
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:45,431
Look, just tell the guy to throw his
flashlight up in the air, will ya?

51
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:51,281
Uh, the fbi requests that you
toss your flashlight into the air.

52
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,173
Ten-four.

53
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,953
There it is.

54
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,653
Oh, let's see if we
can get there this way.

55
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:01,363
Guys.

56
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,551
After you.

57
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,252
What do you think, bones?

58
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:22,701
ocular contents dry, ****

59
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,561
leathery skin...

60
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:27,243
these are actual human remains.

61
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,662
A mummy.

62
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,860
How long will it take
to get out of this maze?

63
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,863
Not as long as you might think.

67
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:13,582
Takes a steady flow of dry
air over a long period of time

68
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:15,892
to achieve this kind of
desiccated mummification.

69
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,342
The incan ice woman of peru.

70
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,763
The tarim basin mummies of china.

71
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:22,821
The peat bog tollund man in denmark.

72
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,040
How old are we talking?

73
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,873
Buttons... zipper, rivets...

74
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:27,433
she's probably wearing jeans.

75
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:31,430
So, freakozoid murder-mummification
rather than fascinating history?

76
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,202
She?

77
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,673
Shape of the innominate
bone indicates female.

78
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:35,850
Now listen, boys.

79
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,532
The jeffersonian halloween
party-- it's compulsory.

80
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,641
Donors, patrons, angels, benefactors.

81
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,542
So we all show up in
costume and do our duty.

82
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,392
I don't want any argument o

83
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,271
i will be the back end of a cow.

84
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,522
So no costume.

85
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:51,412
Naomi from paleontology
has agreed to be my front.

86
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:54,162
Ah, so many jokes, so little time.

87
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:56,081
It's fine. We're all in.

88
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,201
I'll be edward john smith for halloween.

89
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:00,393
Ill-fated captain of the titanic.

90
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:02,130
What about angela and dr.Brennan?

91
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,770
Dr.Brennan always wears the
same costume to these things.

92
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:05,601
She loves it.

93
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:07,283
Help me remove these.

94
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,132
Ooh, what's with the smell?

95
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:10,922
Cedar oil?

96
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,863
Also used in mummification.

97
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:15,092
What about this clear
coating over the skin?

98
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:15,910
Lacquer.

99
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,851
She was painted to death?

100
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:20,282
The clothing came from a
church-run thrift store.

101
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,301
How could you possibly know that?

102
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:25,523
There is no bug or slime
specific to church thrift stores.

103
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:26,530
You don't know that.

104
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:28,123
I'm the bug and slime guy.

105
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,901
You're just the auxiliary bone guy who
dresses up like the back end of a cow.

106
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,513
Hodgins?

107
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:40,952
Free church of america thrift store, huh?

108
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:41,962
Tell booth.

109
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:43,511
I knew it wasn't bugs or slime.

110
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:47,181
No you didn't, and that's
what makes me king of the lab!

111
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:50,240
A loyal servant of the empress.

112
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:55,693
Clothes from this ministry
were found on a dead body?

113
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:58,322
Well, I'm afraid that
happens fairly often.

114
00:05:58,335 --> 00:05:59,413
Why?

115
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:01,690
Because we're a charitable congregation.

116
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,242
Homeless people know that we'll
provide them with what they need.

117
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:08,241
Do you, by any chance, remember
these specific pieces of clothing?

118
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:09,811
This is from your murder victim?

119
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,742
Pastor jonas?

120
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,630
Do you have anything like this in red?

121
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,682
You're looking for something
that screams satan, right?

122
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:15,390
Basically.

123
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,890
I think we have a pink cape in the back.

124
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:19,491
Maybe we can dye it.

125
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,631
What kind of church
dresses kids like satanists?

126
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:24,090
Let me show you.

127
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:27,351
At halloween we do a hell house.

128
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:31,433
Fornication, theft, murder, gambling, 

129
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,333
usury, sodomy, abortion.

130
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,222
It's kind of horrific, isn't it?

131
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:39,530
Well, abandoning the path of
righteousness is horrific, dr.Brennan.

132
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:43,281
This is our way of
remaking a pagan holiday--

133
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:47,542
halloween, into a positive
celebration of christian values.

134
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,772
Excellent prostitute, stephanie.

135
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,632
Anyone ever dress like a mummy?

136
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:53,752
We've never featured a false idol room, 

137
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:55,363
though, now that you mention
it, it's not a bad idea.

138
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:59,230
Ancient egyptian religious beliefs
endured for almost 4, 000 years.

139
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:00,620
Twice the length of christianity.

140
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,480
Look, any of your kids
suddenly disappear?

141
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:03,363
No.

142
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:08,573
What if the children that you save from
abortion grow up to be usurers and sodomites?

143
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,600
I don't respond to mocking
semantics, dr.Brennan.

144
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,208
Nor do I, but she's serious.

145
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:18,882
In that case, my serious answer would be
that in being given a chance to live a life, 

146
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:24,041
the aborted soul will have a multitude
of opportunities to repent for their sins

147
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:26,351
and live bathed in the holy spirit.

148
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:30,263
- Thank you.
- Thank you?

149
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:31,773
You're welcome.

150
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:33,303
My name is amber kippler.

151
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,382
I'm a senior investigator with
doyley private investigations.

152
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:42,122
Mr.Doyley assured me he'd be taking a personal
interest in the search for ms.Montenegro's husband.

153
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:42,993
Interest, yes.

154
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,221
But I'll be doing the actual footwork.

155
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,473
Mr.Doyley is taking a
very personal interest.

156
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,173
Only not from up close.

157
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:52,141
Do you have a lot of
experience at this kind of work?

158
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,951
Angela montenegro is
not your birth name.

159
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:59,573
You changed your name on your 18th
birthday becaus came to you in a dream.

160
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,720
you never told me that.

161
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:05,451
I never told anybody that.

162
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,753
If I can discover something
nobody knew about a client, 

163
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,293
I'm not being paid to investigate, imagine
what I can do for real.

164
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,203
Good point.

165
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,403
I never told anybody about that.

166
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,091
Yes, you did, actually.

167
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:20,141
A girl named roxie whose heart you
broke in second year art school.

168
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,362
Oh, roxie.

169
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,181
What do you know about me?

170
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:33,133
Wouldn't it be better if we got to
ms.Montenegro's husband, grayson birimbau barasa?

171
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,050
You found something?

172
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:36,393
I found the actual human man.

173
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,330
In florida. In the keys.

174
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:39,973
No name key. Very remote.

175
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,093
Did you talk to him?

176
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,493
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

177
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,351
My instructions were to locate.

178
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,460
That being achieved, we
can now discuss contact.

179
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:47,942
We want you to contact him.

180
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,691
Him to sign the divorce papers.

181
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:52,373
By get him do you mean...

182
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:56,751
- Force him to sign them?
- If necessary.

183
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:58,402
Do you have a gun?

184
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:02,880
Or just remind him of who
I am and ask him politely.

185
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,261
What are you? Canadian?

186
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,041
We'll do this one step at a time.

187
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,310
- Didn't that pastor guy make you mad?
- No.

188
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:13,361
He's a fundamentalist.

189
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,823
I appreciate consistency.

190
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,832
Oh, the consistency of trying
to scare kids into christianity?

191
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:20,042
How do we keep kids from smoking?

192
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,633
We tell them it gives them cancer.

193
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,103
It does give them cancer.

194
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:24,062
According to science.

195
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,541
You know, that's all you
care about is science.

196
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:28,843
In the end, even someone
who believes in empiricism

197
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:31,200
and science has to take a leap of faith.

198
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:31,860
What?

199
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,300
I believe in what i can
hear, taste, see, touch and measure.

200
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,010
You believe in what you feel.

201
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:41,081
Pastor jonas believes that god
speaks to him through a sacred book.

202
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:44,260
I feel like we're on the wrong
side of the argument here.

203
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,780
It's cam. What's up?

204
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,942
I really need you to come back.

205
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:49,643
What's going on?

206
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,012
I got a couple here, says they think
the mummy in the maze is their daughter.

207
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,100
Oh, that'd save us some
time on identification.

208
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:57,290
Their daughter only
disappeared last week.

209
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,792
The remains we found
were at least a year old.

210
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:02,633
Look, I'm great with corpses, but
when it comes to loved ones...

211
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:05,270
let's just say there's a reason
why I'm not a pediatrician.

212
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,510
So if you got a siren, turn it on.

213
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:09,212
Right.

214
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:12,252
Megan is 14.

215
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:13,403
She didn't run away.

216
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,801
Something terrible happened.

217
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:16,372
She's a very pretty girl.

218
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,923
What makes you think the remains
we found are your daughter?

219
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:23,941
The news said that you found the
body of a teenage girl in a fun house.

220
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,902
I suddenly knew it was megan.

221
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,903
Suddenly knew?

222
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,151
Mr.And mrs.Shaw, it wasn't a fun house.

223
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:29,982
It was a maze.

224
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,450
And the remains we found
are more than a year old.

225
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,111
- You're certain?
- Yes.

226
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:36,842
I see.

227
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:39,820
I'm sorruse me.

228
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:43,041
I don't understand why
you're disappointed.

229
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:44,762
Your daughter might still be alive.

230
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,760
Megan is not still alive.

231
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:48,421
*******

232
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,782
I just *** I can't explain it.

233
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,873
I'm her mother.

234
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:58,363
- I'm sorry.Does this face mean anything to you?
- No.

235
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,791
Does she have something
to do with megan?

236
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,253
This is the girl that
we found in the maze.

237
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,542
definitely not megan.

238
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:10,661
Yes?

239
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:14,442

265
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,573
What's wrong?

266
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:30,311
the phone rang.

267
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:32,321
It's cam on the phone. It's ringing.

268
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:33,721
Coulrophobia.

269
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,830
The fear of clowns. Coulrophobia.

270
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,812
It may explain why you
shot that clown last year.

271
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,821
Look, I have no problems with clowns.

272
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,251
I can stand right here. See?

273
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,012
And the phone. Booth.

274
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,832
We got an id on our maze
victim off of angela's sketch.

275
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,511
Great. Uh, details to follow?

276
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,190
I think you want to hear this now.

277
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:52,790
Name's stella higgins, 15 years old.

278
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:54,852
Disappeared a year ago today.

279
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:55,610
What's she saying?

280
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,170
Id and date of disappearance
of our maze victim.

281
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:01,891
Booth, stella was last seen
at shoreline amusement park.

282
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:03,782
What wow?

283
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,922
More coincidences. thanks.

284
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,502
The maze victim disappeared from here.

285
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:11,012
So we just go right past the clown.

286
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:13,201
I can walk right past
the clown, like she said.

287
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:14,681
Just right...

288
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:20,662
torture dungeon.

289
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:23,963
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:26,310
Clowns, scary. Not you.

291
00:13:26,978 --> 00:13:29,171
Oh, gee. You're kidding me, right?

292
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:35,873
oh, look at the eye, huh?
It's a ping-pong ball.

293
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,143
Not this one.

294
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,572
How do you know?

295
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,053
Human remains, booth.

296
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,501
It's sort of my specialty.

297
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:53,492
this is a dead person.

298
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:59,813
The first thing booth needs to
know is if this is megan shaw.

299
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,462
It is not megan shaw.

300
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:02,432
I agree.

301
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:06,021
It would be impossible to mummify a body
like this in just a little more than a week.

302
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,710
Dental records do not match.

303
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,363
Lacquer and cedar oil.

304
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:10,710
Looks like the same murderer.

305
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,283
That's leaping to a conclusion.

306
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,563
I said looks like, zack.

307
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,120
Looks like is not leaping.

308
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,731
Her phalanges--
fingers-- are damaged.

309
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:20,602
Metacarpals are... cracked.

310
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,820
You've seen something like this before?

311
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:25,421
In iraq, there were some remains...

312
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:26,691
they had been buried alive.

313
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,571
This person was buried alive?

314
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:29,812
I'm not comfortable...

315
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,872
it looks like this person
was buried alive. Correct?

316
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:37,833
Thtattoo on the second victim's shoulder
matches that of judith suzanne evans...

317
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,791
16 when she went missing.

318
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:41,930
How long ago?

319
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,532
- Two years, almost to the day.
- From?

320
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,491
Shoreline amusement park.

321
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:48,942
She was there with her big sister
and a couple of her friends.

322
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:53,520
Skin and hair removed from beneath stella's
fingernails turns out to be her own.

323
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:56,493
Also, the lacquer used on both
victims is completely generic.

324
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:57,631
It's widely available.

325
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,073
She pulled out her own hair?

326
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,221
What makes somebody do that?

327
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:05,013
There are small puncture marks, hundreds
of them, all over her body.

328
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,913
Like insect bites, but larger.

329
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:10,131
In both cases, the lacquer was
infused with a number of particulates

330
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,542
including a spore i'm
trying to identify.

331
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,621
Are you ready to admit that

332
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:16,971
it looks like both these girls were
killed and mummified by the same person?

333
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,443
I'm not prepared to...

334
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,901
Jump to that conclusion.

335
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:24,671
Come on. You expect me to know when
one body appeared in a pile of bodies?

336
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:25,672
That's not reasonable.

337
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,243
An actual, genuine corpse
appears, and you don't notice?

338
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:30,671
The place is called
dungeon of a 1, 000 corpses.

339
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:34,780
Which is exactly why an entire fbi
forensics team is sweeping this facility.

340
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:35,811
Facility?

341
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:38,391
This hole counts as a facility?

342
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:40,090
I know you.

343
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,122
- No.
- Yeah.

344
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,703
You were at the maze the
other night. Same costume.

345
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:44,302
Oh, yeah.

346
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:46,020
Yeah. You're just recalling that, huh?

347
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:48,231
- What's your name?
- Gregg.

348
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,131
Little hint.

349
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:52,530
Fbi asks for your name, you
give the whole name.

350
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:53,871
His name's gregg liscombe.

351
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,132
He's worked here three years.

352
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,400
You're not supposed to wear
the costume to other gigs, dude.

353
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,523
Dilutes the effect.

354
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:00,321
All the other bodies
are fakes, agent booth.

355
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,970
Okay. We'll just keep the entire
fun house as a crime scene.

356
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,082
Yes, sir.

357
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,693
In that case, can I send my people home?

358
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,693
Oh, no. All your people have
got to talk to my people.

359
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:09,283
And you're coming with me.

360
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:09,911
Why?

361
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,001
Two places with dead bodies, 

362
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:15,371
and you're standing in the
doorway dressed as the grim reaper.

363
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:16,403
It's my job, man.

364
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:18,343
It's not like I adopt the persona.

365
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,232
Don't say anything
without a lawyer, gregg.

366
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,332
Tell you what else, gregg's
got the keys to the place.

367
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:25,031
Shut up, dan! He's got keys, too.

368
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,161
And so does cleaning
crew. And park security.

369
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:28,862
How about you? You got keys?

370
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:30,871
I've got nothing else
to say withou******

371
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,133
okay, that's great, pincushion, 

372
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,932
'cause you were practically
invisible until now.

373
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:38,820
Now you're bucking
as number one suspect.

374
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:46,572
Judith evans, age 16, our victim
from the dungeon of 1, 000 corpses.

375
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:49,323
I've identified stress
fractures to both tibias, 

376
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:54,270
as well as tears to the medial collateral
and anterior cruciate ligaments in both knees.

377
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,411
Catcher's knee.

378
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:58,502
There's nothing in the bio about
judith evans being a baseball player.

379
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:03,851
Compressions to vertebrae c1 through c7
indicate that her neck was bent like this.

380
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,160
But forced.

381
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:08,562
I am not liking the picture
that's forming inside my head.

382
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,882
Phalanges cracked, and
her fingernails shredded, 

383
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,900
her head forced that way, her
knees jammed up against her chest.

384
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:18,001
Do we think judith
evans was buried alive?

385
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:22,830
I, uh, I have... another bad
image of how stella higgins died.

386
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:24,682
- Spiders.
- Spiders?

387
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,473
Tarantulas, to be specific.

388
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:27,370
Poisonous spiders?

389
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:29,112
That's a common misconception, 

390
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:32,320
though the lack of poison doesn't
make the bite any less painful.

391
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:36,243
This is an urticating hair
from the theraphosinae family.

392
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,562
It appears to be barbed.

393
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,121
Yeah. It's very irritating.

394
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,412
Hey, little-known fact:

395
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:43,481
Tarantula hair was the main ingredient
in itching powder for decades.

396
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,703
Is there any correlation between
these hairs and the fact that

397
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:47,791
stella higgins scratched
herself so badly, 

398
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,121
and pulled out her own hair?

399
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,182
She's bitten all over.

400
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,951
There had to be dozens
of tarantulas on her

401
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,982
so, yeah, there's a correlation.

402
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,762
I was operating under
the assumption that

403
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:59,010
the mysterious spore was transported
by the tarantula, but I was wrong.

404
00:17:59,025 --> 00:17:59,761
How do you know?

405
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,443
Because there's no tarantula
hairs on judith evans, 

406
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,340
but plenty of the
spores and particulates.

407
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:08,522
She has carcinogenic
dibenzopyrene isomers, 

408
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:13,570
asbestos, po manganese and barium.

409
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,032
And steel dust.

410
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,721
Which adds up to...

411
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:18,521
Internal combustion engines.

412
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,742
Traffic. Except for the steel dust.

413
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:23,701
I have no clue about the steel dust.

414
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:27,532
Well, stella's tox results
show chloroform, ephedrine, 

415
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:30,543
theophylline, clonydine
and methamphetamine.

416
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,052
Judith's remains show trace
evidences of the same compounds, 

417
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,460
but in different concentrations.

418
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,661
Ephedrine is synthetic adrenaline.

419
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:39,311
Most of those are heavy stimulants.

420
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,751
Their metabolisms would race.

421
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,701
Heart rates would
accelerate dangerously.

422
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:45,263
Spiders.

423
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:48,113
Live burial. Drug-induced panic...

424
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:52,143
is our murderer literally
scaring girls to death?

425
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,593
I always felt, somehow, that
judy was still alive, 

426
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,510
even after two years.

427
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,302
It's crazy, huh?

428
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:01,770
Probably guilt, right?

429
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:03,701
For letting my little
sister out of my sight?

430
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:06,010
Look, you can't blame yourself.

431
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:08,432
Did my sister suffer?

432
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:15,011
You know, we got the best people in the world
figuring out exactly what happened that night.

433
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,993
So...

434
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:21,572
you and your sister went to
the amusement park together?

435
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:24,332
Its kind of the thing
to do on halloween.

436
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:25,720
My mom made me take her.

437
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:26,743
I didn't want to.

438
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:28,553
I mean, I loved judy...

439
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,293
but she was your kid
sister-- pain in the ass.

440
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:34,623
She made me take judy, even
though I didn't want to, 

441
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:36,523
and mom never got over that.

442
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,542
How did you and judy get separated?

443
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:39,732
Judy got scared.

444
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,701
She didn't want to go in the fun house.

445
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:42,262
Why?

446
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:44,680
There was this huge
monster above the door.

447
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:45,723
Judy freaked.

448
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:48,041
She said go ahead, she'd wait outside.

449
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:49,593
Judy was claustrophobic.

450
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,292
How bad?

451
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:51,192
Pretty bad.

452
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,783
She wigged out when
we were driving down.

453
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,693
There were six of us jammed in a car.

454
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,740
We had to stop and let
her out a couple times.

455
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:02,222
Do you remember if there was a grim
reaper that night at the entrance?

456
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,261
Yeah, there was.

457
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,900
Could that be him?

458
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:05,810
Yeah.

459
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:09,670
When we came out looking for judy, he
told us she had taken off with some guy.

460
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:12,271
The police could never confirm that.

461
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:15,123
Registered sex offender.

462
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:19,240
He was present at two places where
the remains of young girls were found.

463
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:20,473
Coincidence.

464
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,153
Statistically improbable.

465
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,021
Scientifically improbable
but, in the real world, impossible.

466
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:29,111
Do you recognize these two girls?

467
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,553
Man, every girl that comes
in there talks to me.

468
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,712
I don't remember them.

469
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:35,122
Why does every girl talk to you?

470
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,712
'Cause I'm cute, scary.

471
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:40,160
Yeah, you do pretty well with the
teenage girls, don't you, gregory?

472
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:41,031
You get them all tingly?

473
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:43,650
All right, that sex offender
thing? It's a joke, man.

474
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,503
Look it up.

475
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,901
I got drunk, and I took a
leak in a public fountain.

476
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:47,772
Yeah. We did look it up.

477
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,461
There was a group of schoolgirls
on the other side of that fountain.

478
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:54,041
Four times, you've been caught with your
pants down, all around teenage girls.

479
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,052
Coincidence?

480
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:58,930
Two years ago, you told this girl's
sister that she took off with some guy.

481
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,583
Do you remember her?

482
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah, sure.

483
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:03,743
It's the girl that disappeared.

484
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:07,070
The thing about you guys-- you're all
the same. You sniff each other out.

485
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:09,071
Who was the guy?

486
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:13,862
Judith evans disappeared
october 24, two years ago.

487
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:18,051
Stella higgins, one year
ago, a week before halloween.

488
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:18,861
So?

489
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:22,650
So, megan shaw vanished
from the same place.

490
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,351
You can see the common
element here, can't you, gregg?

491
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,663
- You.
- Coincidence.

492
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:29,382
There are no coincidences
in a murder investigation.

493
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,672
Well, it's got nothing to do with me.

494
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:34,883
Geez, you can'T... did you see that?

495
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:38,010
Hey! Megan shaw was 14 years old.

496
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:40,432
Understand me? Who was the guy?

497
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,230
- Good shot, bones.
- Thanks.

498
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,322
There was no guy!

499
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,070
- It was lola.
- Lola?

500
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,783
- The girl with the piercings?
- Yeah.

501
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:51,200
What the hell were you doing with her?

502
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,223
It's not what you think.

503
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:58,181
The girls come with me, maybe we get
it on a little... lola likes that.

504
00:21:58,196 --> 00:22:00,713
Your girlfriend likes to
see you with little girls?

505
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:02,592
She likes to interrupt.

506
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,162
You know, maybe smack
them around a little.

507
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,252
- Smack around?
- Yeah.

508
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:09,503
It gets lola hot. For us.For later.

509
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,972
Sometimes, maybe she
goes a little too far.

510
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:25,911
How did you get to and from a
remote, nameless florida key so fast?

511
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:26,991
It does have a name.

512
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:28,152
Its name is no name key.

513
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:29,882
Your confusion is natural.

514
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:33,711
Uh, did you talk to my husband?

515
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:36,143
Mr.Barasa was very pleasant.

516
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,463
Very pleasant.

517
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,820
I mean, wow!

518
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:43,460
He smelled exactly like a fresh
wind just after a summer storm.

519
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:44,791
You smelled him?

520
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:47,550
Part of the private
investigator credo, dr.Hodgins:

521
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:50,191
Insure that the
client-- that's you--

522
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:50,970
and him.

523
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:51,773
I'm paying.

524
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:55,703
The credo says make sure the client is
committed to their objective at each step.

525
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:57,793
Ergo, fresh wind after
summer storm reminder.

526
00:22:57,805 --> 00:23:00,832
Despite the storm, I want a divorce.

527
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,063
In that case, the news is disappointing.

528
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:07,542
Mr.Barasa was nice, but
adamant-- no divorce.

529
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:11,201
Was it because he doesn't
remember getting married?

530
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:14,683
Mr.Barasa totally remembers everything.

531
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:18,540
He built this
for you-- a house.

532
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:20,741
A shack!

533
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:23,022
A whimsical cottage.

534
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:24,990
It's darling.

535
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:27,492
He built a house for me?

536
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,251
Okay, let's be honest.

537
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:30,330
It's a shanty.

538
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,702
Here's what mr.Barasa said
100% verbatim, word for word.

539
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,620
- Verbatim means word for word.
- What?

540
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:36,932
You sort of said it twice.

541
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:37,912
Hodgins.

542
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:41,181
I quote literally to the letter:

543
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:46,803
Ever has it been that love does not know
its own depth until the pain of separation?

544
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:50,380
The guy writes poetry.

545
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,580
Please.

546
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:55,523
He was talking about
you, ms.Montenegro, with tears in his eyes.

547
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:57,373
He should get a grip.

548
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,213
What would you like me to do next?

549
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:04,052
What are you gonna do here, ang?

550
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:07,813
This guy built you a
house, he cried a little bit.

551
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:10,183
He smelled like a fresh
wind after a summer storm, 

552
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:14,483
and you can practically see the lights
of havana from the porch of that cottage.

553
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,582
I want a divorce.

554
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:22,091
If I'm gonna shack up
with anybody, it's this guy.

555
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:27,983
We're gonna discuss this
between ourselves, miss kippler.

556
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,200
I'll let you know how
we want to proceed.

557
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:31,943
Okay.

558
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:39,343
Did I mention he's the most
beautiful man I've ever seen?

559
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:40,453
Don't blame me.

560
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:42,501
P.I.Code: Keep it real.

561
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,573
that girl lola gets
off on inflicting pain.

562
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:50,670
Were you gonna hit her, too?

563
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:52,770
No, not with a closed fist.

564
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,550
- Why?
- Why? That leaves a mark.

565
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:55,412
- Agent booth.
- Yeah?

566
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:56,501
Spoke with the shaws.

567
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,632
Asked if their daughter
had any specific phobias.

568
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,263
Yeah?

569
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,410
- Snakes.
- Snakes.

570
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,923
One crawled up out of the drain of
her bathtub when she was a child.

571
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:04,342
- So since then...
- okay, that's good.

572
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,852
Just call all the pet
shops, the reptile specialists--

573
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:08,172
I don't know, the
world of snakes--

574
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:10,333
and see who's been buying 'em all up.

575
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:13,211
Does lola strike you as a snake person?

576
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,393
Look, I'll deal with lola.

577
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:15,501
You go back to the lab.

578
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:16,541
Why?

579
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,103
I won't hit her unless you say so.

580
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:21,641
Look, I'll do my street thing, you
do your lab thing, all right?

581
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,712
Together, we catch bad guys.

582
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,442
That's good math.

583
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:30,500
The lacquer holds tarantula hairs, 

584
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:34,051
your mystery spores and particulates
which suggest heavy traffic.

585
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,610
I'm aware of the parameters.

586
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:37,022
I told you all that stuff.

587
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:37,883
I'm thinking aloud.

588
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:38,932
It's a technique.

589
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,493
Are you concentrating on the spores?

590
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,360
Yes, I'm looking at them now.

591
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:43,512
He's aware of the parameters.

592
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:46,201
And the unexplained
source of the steel dust?

593
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:48,790
What I'd like is to look up
from this microscope in about, 

594
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:54,213
mm, ten seconds and find myself
totally alone and able to concentrate.

595
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:58,680
Oh, not nearly far enough.

596
00:25:58,728 --> 00:26:01,031
Not even close.

597
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,802
Is that your costume?

598
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,393
Uh, yeah.

599
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,363
It's sexually alluring.

600
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:11,493
Thank you.

601
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm catwoman.

602
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,441
The superhero.

603
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,903
One of the most powerful
female superhero figures.

604
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:18,732
I don't think so.

605
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:19,993
Are you kidding catwoman?

606
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:20,563
Can you fly?

607
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:21,512
I have nine lives.

608
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:24,151
Super strength, super speed, force
people to tell the truth?

609
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:25,192
I think I'm pretty fast.

610
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:27,720
Pretty fast is not super speed.

611
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:29,421
Hawaii.

612
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:30,151
Hawaii?

613
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:33,303
The spore is atronecium
from the haleahi nebulae.

614
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,772
It's a hawaiian orchid hybrid.

615
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:36,850
The victims were mummified in hawaii?

616
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:40,621
How else would hawaiian pollen
get absorbed into the wet lacquer?

617
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:49,823
lola.

618
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:52,402
Remember me?

619
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:56,343
Not one word passes through these
lips without a lawyer's okay.

620
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:57,660
Right, and if you
can't afford one--

621
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,980
which is my guess--
one will be provided.

622
00:27:00,027 --> 00:27:02,973
Probably a crappy one who
studied law on the internet.

623
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,100
What do you want?

624
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:06,040
You attacked both of
those two dead girls.

625
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:07,493
Did gregg tell you that?

626
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:09,940
Yeah, and this one, too.

627
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:13,990
I didn't kill anyone.

628
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:14,600
That's right.

629
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,281
It was gregg who forced you to do that.

630
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:19,082
You know what, and if you don't tell
me what I need to know in two seconds, 

631
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,983
I'm gonna start removing your piercings

632
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,950
and I'm not gonna start
with the ones on your face.

633
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:25,191
Look, I roughed 'em up, all right?

634
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:25,912
that's it!

635
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,141
I was gone. I was out of there, man!

636
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:28,162
Why do you think i'm never charged?

637
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:29,251
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm gone, man!

638
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:31,943
just remember, maryland and virginia
both have the death penalties.

639
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:35,072
Keep that in mind before we
find megan's body. Let's go.

640
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:37,253
These are really tight, man!

641
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:45,261
Don't you have to put on your costume?

642
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,332
I already did.

643
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:48,522
I got a profile of
the killer from sweets.

644
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:49,633
You mean dr.Sweets.

645
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,891
Well, it's only theory, bones.

646
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,870
I mean, it's what he's best at.

647
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,882
I mean, he's only 12.

648
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,041
Sweets says the killer
is definitely a male.

649
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:58,440
Gregg is a male.

650
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:02,701
No, gregg and lola work their
sick little thing together.

651
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:06,323
Sweets says that the killer works alone

652
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:09,660
and has a respectable blue-collar job.

653
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:14,060
In his public life, he's into
saving people, he's unmarried.

654
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:16,121
Oh, he has a police or
military background.

655
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:19,483
You do realize that sweets
is describing you, right?

656
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,342
How do I look?

657
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:23,682
Good.

658
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:24,961
Wonder-ful.

659
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:26,252
- Get it?
- Yeah.

660
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,030
- 'Cause you're wonder woman.
- I know.

661
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:29,021
What are you supposed to be?

662
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:30,320
Oh, I'm a nerd squint.

663
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:33,533
You e, what is the rationale
behind that conclusion?

664
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:34,962
That's not what they look or sound like.

665
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:35,663
You mean we.

666
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:38,022
That's not what we look or sound like.

667
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:38,662
Okay.

668
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:39,801
You see what i did right there?

669
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:44,500
I corrected you, you know, in
character as a squint.

670
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,383
Angela and hodgins have a few things
to show us before we go to the party.

671
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:49,810
What?

672
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:53,153
What?

673
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:56,901
This marks the location of
shoreline amusement park.

674
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,750
These are the locations
of three pet shops

675
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:01,570
the fbi says sold out of
snakes in the last week.

676
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:03,321
How many snakes in total?

677
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,223
Over a hundred.

678
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:04,802
Let me guess.

679
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,982
- They all paid cash
- yep.

680
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:09,943
And the last place sold
out about an hour ago.

681
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:11,543
An hour ago?

682
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,380
Booth, megan shaw is still alive.

683
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:16,361
Wait a second. Both gregg
liscombe and lola are in custody.

684
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,301
Sweets was right.

685
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:17,932
They didn't do it.

686
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,890
Hodgins!

687
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,622
Hodgins has been isolating locations

688
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,230
where the dead girls could have been exposed to
the metal particulates he found in the lacquer.

689
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:24,892
Okay, how many?

690
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,873
126, not including hawaii.

691
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:28,491
126, that's not good enough.

692
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,003
Megan shaw's still alive.

693
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:30,742
What do you want me to do?

694
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:32,180
He wants us to guess.

695
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,110
Well, my guess is hawaii.

696
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:34,213
Not hawaii.

697
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:35,830
Well guess again, but better.

698
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,993
No, sorry.

699
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,191
Booth, they don't guess.

700
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:39,962
Who's they?

701
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:40,502
- Them.
- Them.

702
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:41,470
Well, that's just stupid.

703
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:43,080
We do not guess.

704
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:44,470
You know what? You're a horse's ass.

705
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:45,603
Cow. I'm a cow.

706
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:46,470
See my udder.

707
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,840
I need zack and hodgins.

708
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,183
The rest of you can go to the party.

709
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:52,670
How can we go to a party when a 14-year-old
girl's being tortured to death by snakes?

710
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:55,603
People like us can't work at
full capacity with people like you

711
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:57,831
constantly interrupting
with irrelevancies.

712
00:29:57,867 --> 00:29:58,943
It's true.

713
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,792
I love you, but it's true.

714
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:03,903
Okay, we're out of here.

715
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,712
This is E.

716
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:07,580
Let's go, cher.

717
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:12,172
Okay, we i'll just sit right over
here in this chair and I'llt.

718
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:14,181
Booth, no!

719
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:16,211
Fine.

720
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,242
I'll wait outside, okay?

721
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:18,940
With this chair.

722
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:21,263
I'll be outside with this chair.

723
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:31,773
I'm worried that naomi from paleontology will
feel strange being only the front half of a cow.

724
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:33,463
She got the good end of that deal.

725
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,840
Who's stronger, catwoman or wonder woman?

726
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:36,731
- Wonder woman.
- Wonder woman.

727
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:38,341
I concur vehemently.

728
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:40,573
All right, now, ignoring
the hawaiian pollen, 

729
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:43,151
these 126 sites represent loci

730
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,900
where the necessary concentrations
of particulates can be found:

731
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,581
Underground garages, tunnels, etc.

732
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:52,363
Dr.Sweets says we can assume that
the murderer works for a living.

733
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:54,523
You want us to go on psychology?

734
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:58,040
Let's assume the killer has to
get back and forth from his...

735
00:30:58,057 --> 00:31:00,230
in comic books, it's
always called a lair.

736
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:04,542
From his lair in time for his
job, sometimes during high-traffic hours.

737
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:07,052
Can you remove the sites
which make that improbable?

738
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:08,572
Assuming he needs to sleep.

739
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:09,680
Say, six hours a night.

740
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:10,730
12-hour shift.

741
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,823
Leaving six hours for
travel and torture.

742
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:14,800
At a maximum of two hours travel time.

743
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:17,653
So, what, remove everything
more than a hundred miles away?

744
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:18,471
Too simplistic.

745
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:20,532
If it's on a highway, it
could be up to 120 miles away.

746
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,783
Secondary roads, taking
traffic patterns i ***

747
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:25,790
depending on the time of
day and weather conditions.

748
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:28,002
It'll go faster if you do
the calculations in your head, 

749
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:29,663
zack, and don't explain it to us.

750
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:30,773
Thank you.

751
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:46,832
How many does that leave?

752
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,762
No. No way the police can hit all those.

753
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,343
Not spread thin on halloween.

754
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,730
We can narrow it down further.

755
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,242
Factor: Mummification.

756
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:58,363
Yes, particulates plus
mummification requires...

757
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,590
a steady, continuous supply of dry air.

758
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:02,513
A large oven with blowers.

759
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:06,041
I'd like to assume that the automotive
particulates arrived with the blowing air.

760
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,191
Heated underground parking lots.

761
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:08,553
How is that not guessing?

762
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,291
Einstein referred to such assumptions
as acceptable intuitive leaps.

763
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:15,212
I acknowledge einstein
as a scientific authority.

764
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,273
But he failed us this time.

765
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:25,342
The answer is in the anomalies.

766
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:27,510
The hawaiian spore.

767
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:29,231
And steel dust.

768
00:32:29,268 --> 00:32:30,241
What makes it?

769
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:32,482
Grinding, drilling, abrading.

770
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,330
Raping, milling.

771
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:36,582
Train wheels.

772
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:38,932
Okay, intuitive leap.

773
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:43,142
When a train turns, it grinds
the rails, creates steel dust.

774
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:44,513
Subways...

775
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,033
which also provide warm, dry air.

776
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,210
They're vented.

777
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:52,461
What we need now are florists
who carry hodgins' hawaiian flower

778
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:56,563
which are situated
directly over subway tracks.

779
00:32:57,947 --> 00:32:59,153
Hey, where you going?

780
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:00,042
To get booth.

781
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,221
Call me when you find the florist.

782
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:08,891
You're sure about this?

783
00:33:08,948 --> 00:33:09,522
Not at all.

784
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:10,580
Because you guessed.

785
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:11,650
But we do not guess.

786
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:12,460
I think you did.

787
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:14,830
I dare you to put that
lasso of truth around you.

788
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:16,350
Now you're being completely irrational.

789
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,991
This lasso doesn't actually work.

790
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:21,273
These bracelets aren't
actually made of amazonium.

791
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:22,410
They're stainless steel.

792
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:24,351
They can't stop a bullet.

793
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,550
okay.

794
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:27,601

Who?

823
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:13,632
Let's get out of here.

824
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:18,681
Eats up the girls, leaves them bleeding.

825
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:20,410
Who shows up to help?

826
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:21,401
Access to drugs.

827
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,190
The emt.

828
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,330
Smart.

829
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,313
You should wear a lab coat at all times.

830
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:26,432
Puts them in the back of his ambulance, 

831
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,482
he knocks them unconscious.

832
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,531
just stay there.

833
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:35,943
screams are coming from inside.

834
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,223
- Can I shoot it?
- No!

835
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:40,332
- Geez! You shot me!
- Sorry! Sorry, booth!

836
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,462
- Damn it! I said no! Don't shoot! No!
- Are you all right?

837
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,470
I think the bullet
bounced off my bracelet.

838
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:46,030
Just like amazonium.

839
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:47,753
Geez, bones.

840
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:53,351
what are you doing?

841
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:54,590
They're not poisonous.

842
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:55,561
I know.

843
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:56,380
I know.

844
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:57,320
Then why don't you come down?

845
00:35:57,328 --> 00:36:00,150
It seems I'm not completely
in control of my actions.

846
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:01,832
Just get on my back.

847
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,403
God. Bones.

848
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:07,270
megan?

849
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:08,010
It's okay.

850
00:36:08,038 --> 00:36:09,770
can you understand me?

851
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:16,500
My head.

852
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:18,282
Just stop shooting at things, bones.

853
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:19,612
- He had a gun.
- You stay here.

854
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,590
Anyone comes through that
door, you shoot their heads off.

855
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:22,290
Except me.

856
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,500
My gun is too big for me.

857
00:36:23,508 --> 00:36:24,591
I could've told you
that a hundred times.

858
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:25,803
Here, take mine.

859
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,050
Guard megan.

860
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:28,473
Come on, megan.

861
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,373
Come here.

862
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:41,853
it's okay.

863
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,321
Damn it.

864
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:04,583
How could a guy with military
training miss with a scattergun?

865
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:05,720
What were you, navy?

866
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:07,063
Infantry.

867
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:12,301
Which is how I know you're
carrying the 50-caliber 500.

868
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:13,920
Well, that's five shots.

869
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:15,610
And by my count...

870
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:19,423
you only got one shot left.

871
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:25,022
That's one dumbass gun
to bring to a shootout!

872
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:26,650
Where's your backup, booth?

873
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:27,990
Shouldn't they be here by now?

874
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,310
You need to be quiet.

875
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:31,050
Can you do that, megan?

876
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:41,430
bones, you all right?

877
00:37:41,446 --> 00:37:42,652
We're okay. We're okay.

878
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,300
He's using you to get to us.

879
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:45,580
Not for long, booth.

880
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:48,830
I'm just gonna stick my scattergun
in there and empty the barrels.

881
00:37:48,856 --> 00:37:52,713
Your girl is gonna look like hamburger.

882
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,861
One shot.

883
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:07,481
one hell of a ***

884
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:16,763
now can you see why I hate clowns?

885
00:38:28,476 --> 00:38:29,850
Ms.Kippler.

886
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:35,290
Ms.Montenegro, you look amazing.

887
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:36,782
Halloween, right?

888
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:41,060
Look, hodgins and i haven't really
decided what we're gonna do next.

889
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:42,553
I tried to seduce him, you know.

890
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,280
Hodgins?

891
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,950
No. Your husband.

892
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,623
I took off my top and everything.

893
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:48,281
Why?

894
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:52,620
I've been told i have alabaster skin
that's really impossible to resist touching.

895
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:55,241
Isn't that some kind
of conflict of interest?

896
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:56,480
The pi code?

897
00:38:56,488 --> 00:38:59,860
It totally for you, the client.

898
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:04,012
I was testing Your husband with my wiles
so that I could properly advise you.

899
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:06,313
You are a very dedicated investigator.

900
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:07,580
Which is why I have
to tell you something

901
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,870
i didn't want to say
in front of dr.Hodgkins.

902
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,230
Hodgins. There's no K.

903
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:15,031
Your husband is deeply, deeply
in love with you.

904
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:18,023
Also, he has incredible abs and forearms.

905
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:21,080
So what I'm suggesting is
that I take you down there, 

906
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:27,250
mediate a meeting, and see if any old
sparks don't flare back into life.

907
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:28,723
I'm in love with hodgins.

908
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:29,340
Now.

909
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,890
Forever, ms.Kippler.

910
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:34,363
Did I mention the little catch in
his throat when he said your name?

911
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:38,202
Look, all I want out of
him is a divorce, okay?

912
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:41,380
So if you want to see him again and you
want to rub your alabaster all over him

913
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:44,031
and shake his snow globe, be my guest.

914
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,342
All I want is the divorce.

915
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,541
I hear you.

916
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:48,381
I believe you.

917
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:50,753
I just wanted to make sure.

918
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:55,231
And please don't ever
say ew about hodgin

919
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,473
beards.I don'T...like beards.

920
00:39:57,486 --> 00:40:00,271
Especially in conjunction
with huge, blue eyes.

921
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:03,990
Makes me feel like i'm staring into
one of those russian religious icons.

922
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,840
Dr.Hodgkins.

923
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:11,670
Hodgins.

924
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,143
Were you just talking to angela?

925
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:13,851
Yes.

926
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:17,883
I was telling her that her husband
is extremely physically attractive.

927
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,042
Okay.

928
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:20,480
Enough with that now.

929
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:22,471
Quit trying to drive a wedge.

930
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:23,090
It's a fact.

931
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:26,553
On a scale of one to ten, he's
ten to the tenth power.

932
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:27,692
What am I?

933
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,890
You're a solid 7.5 Which
is quite respectable.

934
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:35,663
Your job is to help me
and angela to be together.

935
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:39,533
Dr.Hodgkins, domestic issues
make up the core of our business.

936
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:43,122
And I have to tell you, most
of the time they go back.

937
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:44,260
They go back?

938
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:47,311
They g husbands or their
wives most of the time.

939
00:40:47,326 --> 00:40:48,141
It's a fact.

940
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:51,671
And you think angela should
go back to her husband?

941
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:54,712
I don't have an opinion
about should or should not.

942
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,081
I'm more interested in will or won'T.

943
00:40:57,108 --> 00:41:00,591
But in this case, in my opinion...

944
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:04,763
I don't think she's
going back to her husband.

945
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,590
Even after you practically
threw him at her?

946
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,303
Exactly.

947
00:41:09,315 --> 00:41:10,430
Aren't you glad I did?

948
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:14,422
Now you can sleep like a baby
because of my thorough approach.

949
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:20,343
Thank you.

950
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,522
That's right, thank you.

951
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:32,990
Where is everybody?

952
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:35,992
At the party, I guess.

953
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,691
We could still go.

954
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,633
Ah, we look like hell.

955
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:41,152
It's a halloween party.

956
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:43,013
We could be wonder woman and, um...

957
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,470
what's superman's secret identity?

958
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:47,192
Clark kent.

959
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:47,883
Yes.

960
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:53,342
We could be wonder woman and clark
kent after a really, really bad date.

961
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:56,953
Yeah, bad date because you shot me.

962
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:57,823
It was only a flesh wound.

963
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:58,940
And you dropped me on my head.

964
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,471
After you shot me.

965
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:02,850
Okay, I think i got you on this one.

966
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,552
Okay, wonder woman?

967
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,992
I'm sorry you had to kill someone.

968
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:15,230
I know you hate that.

969
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:17,421
Yeah, he had it coming.

970
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,661
You hate it.

971
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:23,461
I'm sorry that happened to you.

972
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,430
We saved the girl.

973
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,342
That's a pretty good date.

974
00:42:27,356 --> 00:42:29,653
- Except not really a date.
- I know.

975
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:30,890
It was work.

976
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:31,920
Not a date.

977
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,172
Really, really hard one.

978
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:36,490
And we're not really
wonder woman and clark kent.

979
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:37,960
We're brennan and booth.

980
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:40,643
Look, you're the one who
brought up the date analogy.

981
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,023
- you hungry?
- yeah

982
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:49,711
Me, too.

983
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:53,041
Okay, let's go grab a bite to eat.

984
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,342
what the hell are you doing?

985
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,563
Nothing.
