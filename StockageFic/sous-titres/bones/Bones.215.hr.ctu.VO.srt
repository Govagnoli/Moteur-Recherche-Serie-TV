1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
No, no , don't answer.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh, it's probably...
Probably, this is for my book.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,300
Shhh. Let's pretend it's the ocean.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,300
See that.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,700
God, love sex.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Keep calling.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,300
- I thought you hated publicity.
- Oh, it's a part of my contract.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,400
The book is getting a lot of attention.
Just trying to do my job.

9
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,299
Hello.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,400
Hi, Helen.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,600
Of course she did look out on the view.
I think Rosy had a little thing for it.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
That seems like a lot...

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Well, it's two interviews,
and a book-signing in one day...

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,500
I don't know about tuesday.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
Just hum... send the schedule

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
to the *** okay.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,500
I'll see you, I'm leaving right now.

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,600
- Now this is something you don't *
look at the scene at the publishing house.
- Oh, dear Lord.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,100
You smell that ? Yeah.

20
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:22,999
Sorry I'm late.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,800
Oh, thank god. Think...

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
You know, dear, your book
is on the bestseller's list.

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,100
You don't have to work in
this place anymore.

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,500
This is my real love, Helen.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
I know a therapist who could 
really help you.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,300
OK.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,000
The reading and the book-signing
are this wednesday night.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,300
* is * for tranportation.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,500
He's... A car will pick you up
here at the lab, Dr Bennet.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,300
And then, there's the radio interview,
next tuesday.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,900
Now that's an early one, so just tell Hank
what would you like for breakfast.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
That's not necessary.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,600
No, honey, don't worry about that,
that's what Hank is for.

34
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,500
Right, Hank ?

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,300
Sure, um, I wanted to tell you
Dr. Bennett, I'm a huge...

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
fan, I thought this book is even better...

37
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,000
You know, as far as you have 
photo shoot is concerned...

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,400
OK, Bones. We gotta go.
They found a floater in the marina.

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,200
Oh, my partner, Seeley Booth,
this is the publicist for my book.

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,800
Helen Laskow, and her assistant, Hank.

41
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Hello.

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,200
Now I see what temper *
those dirty little

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
scenes in her book.

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
- That's not me. Not me. No.
- It's not hum.

45
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,300
Right, you must let me get you
that therapist number, dear.

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,900
No, seriously, she's got someone.

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,700
- Booth.
- No, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
I mean, he's kind of short.

49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,500
- Short.
- He's not short. Just because 
he's not * tall like you are...

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,000
Didn't you say that you had
remains for me to examine ?

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,300
Oh, right. Come on, let's go.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Well, thanks for the schedule, Ellen.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
So, is it just me, or is this,
you know, kind of weird ?

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,700
What ?

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, in your new book, they found
a body at a marina, right ?

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,300
- You read my book ?
- Of course.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,900
Anyhow, guy docking the boats

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
saw something floating in the water.

59
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Thought it was a dead fish,

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,600
and it ended up being
a decomposed hand.

61
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,600
The dive crew just located
the rest of the body.

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,500
I didn't think you'd have
time to read my book.

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
You've time to write it,
I have time to read it.

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,600
Besides, not like I can
avoid the damn thing.

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,800
Your book is everywhere.

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, bring it up.

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,700
Booth, look.

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Wait... body on the anchor ?

69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, tied to the chain.

70
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,400
Body's not tied with a rope.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,900
Divers said they used...

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,900
Red tape.

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
How'd you know ?

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Because that's how I wrote it.

75
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,900
Victim was male, mid-40s.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Estimated time of death
is five days ago.

77
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,400
Only five days ?

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,400
This is an extreme rate of decomp.

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,800
Blue crab season.
They'll feed on anything,

80
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
dead or alive.

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,800
Vegetation, fish, flesh...

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
Ugh, opportunistic little bastards.

83
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Elliptical wound on the frontal
bone with the reverse beveling.

84
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
He was shot.

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,300
Is there a bullet ?

86
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,200
No. Irregular exit wound
on the occipital.

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,500
Looks like a through and through.

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Dr. Brennan, exactly how similar
is this situation to your book ?

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,800
The victims in my book are bound

90
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,200
and gagged with red tape,

91
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,000
shot and then fed to various animals.

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,700
Cheery.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,100
I loved the symbolism of the red tape.

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Perfect way to dispose of bureaucrats.

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,800
Thank you.

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,400
The first body in the book
is tied to an anchor

97
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,200
and dropped in the water at a marina.

98
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,000
I'd prefer not to jump to conclusions.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,200
I don't think it requires a jump.

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,100
Just a little hop. A little teeny...

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,000
In this lab, we are concerned
with science, not fiction.

102
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,600
This is a sketch based on tissue
markers on the skull.

103
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
PCB's and lead we found in the collagen

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
mean the victim's from the north
end of the Chesapeake,

105
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,800
probably outside Annapolis.

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Did you have to whisper that in my ear ?

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,300
It seemed right.

108
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,600
Check the image against
DMV photos from Maryland.

109
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,200
Bones...

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,900
How are you holding up ?

111
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
What do you mean ? Fine.

112
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
You know, something like this,

113
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,400
it's understandable if you're upset.

114
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,200
It's probably a coincidence.

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,800
Hey, how's it going ?

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,900
What-what are you doing here ?

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Uh, yeah.

118
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,100
Well, I heard we have a copycat
killer using your book...

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,500
That hasn't been established.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,700
Yeah, I've got it covered here, Sully.

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,700
Two hands are better
than one, Booth.

122
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, last time I looked,
I have two hands, see ? Thanks.

123
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Testosterone spill on aisle four.

124
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,200
We don't know that
my book is the cause.

125
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,400
So far what we do know is...
Someone died

126
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
exactly the way described
in your book.

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,300
Do you keep any of
your old fan mail ?

128
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
No. I don't even read it.

129
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,700
The publicist deals with all that.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,300
Yeah, I mean,
why are you asking, Sully ?

131
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,700
I'm in charge of this investigation.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Well, Booth, I was a profiler
for two years.

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
I have a lot of experience
with these cases.

134
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,400
This could be someone showing
what a big fan he is,

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,100
or someone rying to get
close to her, too close.

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't need to be protected.

137
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,800
Yes, you do.

138
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,600
Look, you still call the shots.

139
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
I just think I'd be an
asset to the team.

140
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Okay, fine. We send all the fan
mail to Sully in his office.

141
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,800
Fine, I'll call Ellen.

142
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,600
We could be dealing with
a real sicko here.

143
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,800
Jim Lopata.

144
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,400
Not the sicko.

145
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
The sicko's victim.

146
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,400
43, married, no kids.

147
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
From Glen Burnie
outside of Annapolis.

148
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
So your husband never called you ?

149
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
I thought, uh...

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,600
he was supposed to be
on a business trip.

151
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,300
And you hadn't seen him
since last Tuesday ?

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,100
Oh, no, his trips...

153
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,900
he works shard.

154
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,500
Morning till night,
driving hundreds of miles.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Greg, did you and your
sister's husband get along ?

156
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,200
Well enough.

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Mm.

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,200
Any idea if... he had any enemies ?

159
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,100
Wouldn't come as a shock.

160
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Jim liked to drink.

161
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
He could turn into
a real jerk sometimes.

162
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,400
- We were working through it.
- Right.

163
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,100
Greg... I'm sorry.

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,600
But part of me thinks
you're better off, Connie.

165
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Are you better off, Mrs. Lopata ?

166
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,300
How can you say that ?

167
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,000
My husband's dead.

168
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,800
Of course.

169
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,600
It's just... one more thing.

171
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,600
I realize this is gonna
sound a little strange,

172
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,700
but do either of you two read,
uh... mystery novels ?

173
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,500
What the hell's this got
to do with anything ?

174
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Just answer him, Greg.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,100
Greg likes them. Why ?

176
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,700
It's just something I gotta ask.

177
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,800
The tape actually managed
to preserve particular matter

178
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,200
that was present on the
body before it was dumped.

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Any hair ? Other goodies
that can give us DNA ?

180
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,200
No, but I did find sand.

181
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,600
Victim was in the ocean,
Hodgins. A lot of sand there.

182
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,600
Yeah, but the sediment
distribution doesn't match.

183
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,100
The sand came from someplace else.

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,300
Okay, try to locate the source.

185
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,600
What about the tape itself ?

186
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,000
- Composition ? Brand ?
- Working on it.

187
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
Cool.

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,100
Do you really plan on
reading Dr. Brennan's book ?

189
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:53,999
What ?

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Of course. I only... I bought it.

191
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
You know, it's on a...

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,700
pile; I'm waiting... no, I don't.

193
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:02,499
Please don't tell her.

194
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
It's just, after dealing
with murder all day,

195
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,300
I can't bring myself to go home
and read about it for kicks.

196
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
So, for kicks you read... ?

197
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Feminist trash.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
You know, woman finds her power,

199
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,500
leaves her oppressive husband,

200
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,100
discovers freedom and
fulfillment with an artist

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,400
who knows how to cry and
make love like an animal.

202
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
So, sex books.

203
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Pretty much, yeah.

204
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,200
Hmm.

205
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Let me know if you find
any organics on that tape.

206
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,900
Yup.

207
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Is the FBI aware of the situation ?

208
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,000
What do you mean ?

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,400
Booth and Sully are
both working the case.

210
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,900
I meant the other
murders in your book.

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
The marina victim is
the first of three.

212
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,100
Please, concentrate
on the remains, Zack.

213
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,100
It's just, the later dump sites
are far less specific.

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,300
How could the FBI prevent...

215
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Because we're the good guys, Zack.

216
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,400
Don't you forget that, okay ?

217
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,600
Possible motive for Jim Lopata's murder...

218
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,500
Connie Lopata's medical records ?

219
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,500
Check out the ER visits.

220
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Broken rib,

221
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,100
concussion, severe bruising.

222
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,300
Someone was abusing her.

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Her husband.

224
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,700
So, the wife's brother
Greg knew about it

225
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,900
and killed the husband
to protect his sister.

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
Made it look like a copycat
to cover his tracks.

227
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,300
I got more info on the red tape.

228
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,800
It's a thermosetting silicon
adhesive with glass cloth backing.

229
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,200
Secures materials under
high temperatures.

230
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,600
Mostly used for electrical
and industrial applications.

231
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,100
Is this Greg person an electrician ?

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,900
Other works at Reagan National Airport.

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's a baggage handler.

234
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,700
But glass tape is used
on aircraft, too.

235
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,300
To secure cargo holds.

236
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,500
It didn't take a genius
to figure out he hit her.

237
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
You wanted to protect her.

238
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,200
She's my sister.

239
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Of course I did.

240
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,400
I tried to get her to leave
him, but she was so...

241
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
I don't know. It was messed up.

242
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,800
So you decided to handle
things your own way.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,300
What, meaning what, I killed him ?

244
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
No way.

245
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm not saying
I didn't want him dead,

246
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
but I never touched him.

247
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,600
Swear on my mother's grave.

248
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,500
Sorry, Greg, but that particular
oath is no longer recognized

249
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
in a court of law.

250
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Listen, if you're gonna charge me

251
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
with something, do it. If not...

252
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Where you were last Wednesday

253
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,300
when your brother-in-law was killed ?

254
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
In the mountains.

255
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,500
I went camping.

256
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm assuming you were alone.

257
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,800
If you can find the other people...

258
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,400
Just stay close, all right ?

259
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,200
Don't go anywhere anytime soon.

260
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
All right, Greg ?

261
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
- Booth.
- Yeah.

262
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Did you see his right hand ?

263
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Sure. Well, not really. Why ?

264
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
The third and fourth
phalanges, they're fused together.

265
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Greg has syndactyly.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,900
Syndactyly, yeah, of course.

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,800
Is that relevant ?

268
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,600
Well, it could indicate
the presence of other birth defects,

269
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
things that might affect
his range of motion.

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,600
We should look into that.

271
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,500
Would he be able to shlea gun ?

272
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,399
What ?

273
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
If his fingers, you know,
were fused like that,

274
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,100
would he still be able to,
you know, pull a trigger ?

275
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,800
don't see why not.

276
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,400
Okay. That good enough for me.

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
If it's no ihim, Booth...

278
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
There are two other
murders in the book.

279
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,200
I know.

280
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,100
Hank.

281
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,800
What are you doing here ?

282
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,099
Ellen sent me out.

283
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,900
Said you needed all
your old fan mail.

284
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,100
Plus, she needs a half-caf
soy latte every day at 10:00,

285
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,100
a half-caf soy latte with
a dollop of foam

286
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
and a sprinkle of chocolate shings

287
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
every day...

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Um...

289
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm looking for an Agent Sullivan.

290
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, yeah, he's down the hall,

291
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
in his office.

292
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Booth.

293
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,500
Yeah.

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's wrong ?

295
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Someone must have broken
in Saturday night.

296
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Store's closed Sundays and Mondays.

297
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,500
Clerk comes in this morning,
gets an eyeful of this.

298
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,300
Isn't this how you killed the
second victim in your book ?

299
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Yeah.

300
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Sadie Keller, 28, lived
in Chevy Chase.

301
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,000
Wow, that was fast.

302
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,900
Her face was chewed off.

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,300
Aside from bite marks on her
parietal and sphenoid bones,

304
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,800
skull was intact enough for Angela
to do a facial reconstruction.

305
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:29,799
Yeah.

306
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Sadie Keller... recently married
to Ashton Keller, 29.

307
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,500
No work history.

308
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
Went to some pretty fancy
schools, though.

309
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,800
- She was rich.
- Great. So we got

310
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,500
a dead traveling salesman
and a prep school socialite.

311
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,700
What the hell's the connection ?

312
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,000
Not Greg Braley.

313
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,400
His story checks out.

314
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
He was camping the night
Lopata was killed.

315
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,100
Two rangers recognized him.

316
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
Oh, great. So the ly
connection we have

317
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,100
is the tape he te fact that
they were both fed to anBOals.

318
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,500
So we're back to me.

319
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
No.

320
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,900
Your book.

321
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,300
I can only deal with
what's before me.

322
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,100
Two discrete cases.

323
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
Physical evidence.

324
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Look, Bones, I know it's
probably easier for you

325
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,500
to believe that the cases
aren't linked...

326
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
No, there's nothing that
would make the loss

327
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,300
of two lives easier for me, Booth.

328
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,800
- I'm sorry, but...
- I'm not burying

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
my head in the sand here.

330
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,700
I want to catch whoever did
this as much as you guys do.

331
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
But I have a method.

332
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,600
And the method doesn't change.

333
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,300
I'll be back in my lab.

334
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,900
She wasn't this emotional
before you came in the picture.

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,500
I thought you weren't interested.

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,700
Look, I don't need that, okay ?
Believe me, okay ?

337
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
I'm gonna go talk to Sadie
Keller's husband.

338
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Why don't you just go back
to your office there

339
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,500
and sort through
the fan mail, all right ?

340
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,300
Got some phaenicia sericata
stuck in the tape.

341
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,800
Means she's been dead
less than two days.

342
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,400
Rats sure made quick work of her.

343
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,400
So, all the victims in
Dr. Brennan's book got eaten ?

344
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, it was part of the metaphor.

345
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
The victims were all corrupt
politicians who'd been

346
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,900
feeding for years on the
goodwill of the people, so...

347
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,700
I got it.

348
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Lots of gore with a splash
of social commentary.

349
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
No wonder it's a bestseller.

350
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,400
Ooh, good.

351
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,600
Lots of tissue left over here.

352
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,100
There's no exit wound.

353
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
So we've got a bullet ?

354
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
I don't see it.

355
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,100
The tissue was too badly scavenged.

356
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,900
But if the bullet was still
inside Sadie Keller

357
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
when her body was dumped in the cage...

358
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
We need to X-ray us some rodents.

359
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,400
She was supposed
to be visiting a friend.

360
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
And when she didn't
return your phone call...

361
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,200
I just assumed...

362
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
She was very independent,

363
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,400
still kind of wild.

364
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,800
I mean, she was used to
getting whatever she wanted.

365
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,900
Like what ?

366
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,700
Let's just say she wasn't
the wifely type.

367
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,600
And since she had all the money,

368
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
she thought she could, uh...

369
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,400
you know.

370
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Do you know any of the men

371
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
she might have seeing ?

372
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,400
I didn't want to know.

373
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
I just wanted it to blow over.

374
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,400
I...

375
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
I loved her.

376
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
And I know that sounds pathetic

377
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,200
but I just loved her.

378
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,900
Forgive me, Mr. Keller,
but you stand to inherit

379
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
quite a lot of money

380
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,500
om your wife, don't you ?

381
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,100
Yes, I do.

382
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,700
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
that you suspect me.

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
But I was out of town the
night that Sadie disappeared,

384
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,800
at a golf tournament.

385
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,500
I'll need the details.

386
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
- Of course.
- Yeah.

387
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Sadie meant everything
to me, Agent Booth.

388
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
And I know she loved me.

389
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,900
Whatever happened...

390
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,900
she did.

391
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,900
I know that.

392
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,400
They're cute, for rodents.

393
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,500
Yeah, well, don't
grow too attached.

394
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,600
These little guys are
destined to be snake snacks.

395
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,300
But now that we've confiscated them,

396
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
shouldn't they be safe ?

397
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,700
I mean, they're material witnesses.

398
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,700
It's not like they know
sign language, Angela.

399
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,900
In grad school, I developed
a more efficient method

400
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
for killing rats raior to dissection.

401
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,600
It involved a warm dish of water

402
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,100
and the clever use of
a ball-peen hammer.

403
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Zack... Uh !

404
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Found something.

405
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,600
Wow.

406
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Now what ?

407
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Warm water soothes them
like a bubble bath.

408
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
Then...

409
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Can't we just wait until
nature takes its course ?

410
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,800
Do you have any idea how
tight a rat's rectum is ?

411
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,100
Please tell me you don't.

412
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,300
Locate the ammo thief ?

413
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,900
Yes, but we're debating the
method of bullet retrieval.

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, I fed them all a mixture
of extra-strength laxative

415
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,000
and soft tissue dilator
when they arrived, so...

416
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
shouldn't be long now.

417
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
She fed all of them laxatives ?

418
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,100
I need to go to my office.

419
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,300
Lunch time.

420
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,200
Ho !

421
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm not hungry.

422
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,300
Come on, it's meatball.

423
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,800
It's the perfect food.

424
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,000
Shouldn't you be working ?

425
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,500
I went through the fan mail

426
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,900
and gave the likely candidates
to Booth to check out.

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah, I'm busy, Sully.

428
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,900
I'm cataloguing injuries
the two victims suffered.

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,200
Hey, I am on your side, Tempe.

430
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,900
I know what you're going through.

431
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay, what ?

432
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,700
What, Sully ? What...

433
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
What am I going through ?

434
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,500
Okay.

435
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,900
You feel responsible.

436
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,500
You feel that somehow, if you
didn't write that book,

437
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,700
those two people would still be ave.

438
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,800
And you're terrified 'cause you know

439
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,500
that someone else dies in the book.

440
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't put much credence
in psychology.

441
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
Well, neither do I.

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm basing this on
knowing you... well.

443
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,100
Knowing how much you care
about your work.

444
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,700
And if trivializing it in the
book caused this, then...

445
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,900
It just, but it doesn't
work like that, Tempe.

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,100
Statistically, the murders
would have happened

447
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,100
whether the book
was written or not.

448
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,700
The method might be
different is all.

449
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,800
Right.

450
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,600
Now, if you only believed that.

451
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,600
You don't know me
as well as you think.

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,800
We're just having a fling,
so don't get carried away.

453
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
When you can't stop
thinking about someone

454
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,100
when they're not around,
that's not a fling.

455
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
When you remember their touch
just like they were still

456
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,100
right next to you,
that's not a fling.

457
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,300
If you need to be alone
with this, fine.

458
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
But we both know what we have.

459
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,300
We have the bullet.

460
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,100
The bullet was jacketed,
showing little deformity.

461
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,900
And you've compared it with
the wounds on both victims ?

462
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
Lack of shattering around the
exit wound on the first victim

463
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
suggests a jacketed projectile.

464
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,900
And Angela's rendering also matches

465
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
the bullet we recovered from the rat.

466
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Zack... Hey, Bones.

467
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I thought you and Sully were having lunch.

468
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,700
Not hungry.

469
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,700
Zack thinks both victims were
shot using the same gun.

470
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,000
You said that Ashton Keller was

471
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,400
going to get a large inheritance.

472
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,900
Right. But his alibi is airtight.

473
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,700
He was at Briarwood in Maine

474
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,200
at a charity golf tournament.

475
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
So much for that theory.

476
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Yeah, what about the red tape ?

477
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:27,298
I mean, did Hodgins...

478
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,100
It's the same.

479
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Same gun, same tape, no
relationship between the victims.

480
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm telling you, we're dealing
with a serial killer.

481
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
He's just picking random targets.

482
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,600
Nothing else makes sense here.

483
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,800
But serial killers have a
pattern, a method of killing.

484
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,900
The first victim has numerous defensive
wounds, including a fractured manubrium,

485
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,900
and trauma to the temporal bone.

486
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,900
There was quite a struggle
before he died.

487
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
What about the second victim ?

488
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,699
Nothing.

489
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,900
Only the gunshot.

490
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,500
Did you have something to show me ?

491
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,300
Oh, new suspect.

492
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,300
All right, Sully narrowed the
fan mail down to the people

493
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
most likely to act out in obsessive

494
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,500
or dangerous ways.

495
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,400
But...

496
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,700
look who I found, huh ?

497
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,600
Your number one fan.

498
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Oliver.

499
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Haven't seen him in a while.

500
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,400
Oliver Laurier.

501
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,600
The guy who stalked you

502
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,900
when we first started
working together.

503
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,700
He used to come
to all my readings,

504
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,900
follow me around afterwards.er

505
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,900
It says here your publicist
gives his picture

506
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to security guards
at every signing.

507
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,500
Must be why I haven't seen him.

508
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,200
I think it's time for to go see

509
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,800
what our buddy has been up to lately.

510
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Oliver ?

511
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You home ?

512
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,400
Who is it ?

513
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,200
It's an old friend.

514
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,300
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

515
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,500
You work with Dr. Brennan.

516
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Why are you here ?

517
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Well, you know, somebody loves
Dr. Brennan's new book

518
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,700
just a little too much.

519
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,500
And since you're such a big fan...

520
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,900
Oh ! Okay.

521
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,700
You know what ?
Not good idea, Oliver.

522
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Go away !

523
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,800
All right.

524
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,100
You know, this is probable cause.

525
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm gonna give you five seconds.

526
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,700
Oliver !

527
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,600
Five, four...

528
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,400
I didn't do anything.
Three-two-one !

529
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,000
My shrink is gonna be pissed.

530
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,600
I didn't do anything.

531
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,700
Of course you didn't.

532
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,300
Come on.

533
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,400
Yeah.

534
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:32,299
Ow.

535
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
If it was just a game,

536
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,500
... why'd you slam the
door in my face ?

537
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,399
I'm not stupid.

538
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,700
I heard about the murders.

539
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,100
And I knew you wouldn't
understand CRP.

540
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
- CRP ?
- Creative role playing.

541
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,800
Sometimes I like to pretend.

542
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,100
I act out scenes from
my favorite books.

543
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,600
Exactly, um, how far do
these "games" of yours go,

544
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,600
Ollie ?

545
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
You ever get tired of pleding
with your little dolls,

546
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,000
maybe try acting it out
on other people ?

547
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,400
Dr. Brennan's book
signing is tonight.

548
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,900
I wanted to see her again.

549
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,800
Let's stay on point here, Ollie.

550
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,800
I am on point.

551
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,200
I want to see Dr. Brennan.

552
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,500
This isn't like going to see Santa,

553
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,900
it's more like the principal's
office, you see.

554
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm in charge.

555
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
I call the shots.

556
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Did you read Dr. Brennan's
new book, Agent Booth ?

557
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Why do you care ?

558
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,100
Merely wondering if you know

559
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,300
how many victims are in it.

560
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
What's this about, Ollie ?

561
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
I want to see Dr. Brennan.

562
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Santa.

563
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,300
Sully asked Booth to double
security for my book reading.

564
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,500
Hot.

565
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,500
No, I don't need that kind of hot,

566
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
being treated like a
damsel in distress.

567
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,900
Sully cares about you, honey.

568
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:04,799
It's a good thing.

569
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,700
We've only been seeing
each other for a month.

570
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
You know, he doesn't know me.

571
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,500
Not really.

572
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,700
And if he does, he won't like you ?

573
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,700
I've already given up
too much to him.

574
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,400
It's... this one or this one ?

575
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,300
- This one.
- Okay.

576
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,700
Most relationships end badly.

577
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,000
I just think it's important
to... to be reasonable.

578
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,200
To stay in control.

579
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
Don't use your brain
so much, sweetie,

580
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,000
you have other organs that can
give you far more pleasure.

581
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,100
I'm just saying that the
odds are not in favor

582
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
of lasting relationships.

583
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,200
Look, it might end with Sully, sure.

584
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,300
But I don't think you want
to rush the process.

585
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
Look at Hodgins and I.

586
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,100
We're running on sex and laughing.

587
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,900
The only thought comes when
we order takeout in bed.

588
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,700
And you're happy ?

589
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,900
Hey, we did it in the storage
locker an hour ago.

590
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
I am thrilled.

591
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,100
Cam, I have a book signing tonight.

592
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,700
Oh, right.

593
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,200
You think that's safe ?

594
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Well, there haven't been
any threats on my life.

595
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,000
No threats on these victims either.

596
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
Is that the soft tissue sample

597
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,300
from the second victim ?

598
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Sadie Keller.

599
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,500
Found something irregular.

600
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Oxygen saturation levels in
the blood were extremely low.

601
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,500
I think she might have
been unconscious

602
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,700
before she was killed.

603
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,500
That would explain the lack of struggle.

604
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,400
But there was no skeletal
evidence of a head injury.

605
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,000
I know, my guess would be
drug induced.

606
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm about to run a tox screen.

607
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Thing is, why would the killer
render this victim unconscious ?

608
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,300
It doesn't follow.

609
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Serial killers are consistent.

610
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,700
Wow !

611
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,000
New dress code ?
'Cause I didn't get thmoge

612
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,900
Okay.

613
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,900
The sand I collected from
the first victim:

614
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,000
it's from feldspathic rock.

615
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,000
But that's widely occurring, right ?

616
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:08,899
Right.

617
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,300
Sixty percent of
the Earth's crust

618
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
is composed of feldspar.

619
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,500
So, this is no help to us.

620
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,400
Actually, it is.

621
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,400
These particles are way
too finely graduated

622
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,800
to have occurred naturally.

623
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,500
This is manufactured sand.

624
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Hi, Booth.

625
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,700
Can we trace the manufacturer ?

626
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
I've requested samples
from every quarry

627
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,900
that distributes to the D.C. area,

628
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
see if that narrows it down.

629
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay, ll be right there.

630
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,100
Hey, be careful tonight.

631
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
I'm not going to the signing yet.

632
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
Booth has a suspect.

633
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,500
Serial killers like to show off.

634
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
Boast about their crimes.

635
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You might be able to get
him to open up.

636
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,300
But you don't have to talk
to him if you don't want to.

637
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,700
- I'm not afraid of him.
- I'm not saying

638
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,200
that you are, I'm just
saying... I'll be back.

639
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,200
She'll be back.

640
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,900
That means...

641
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Everything with you two, uh...

642
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,800
Well, you know what ? Never mind.

643
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Wow.

644
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
It's like you dressed up
just to see me again.

645
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,900
I can assure you, Oliver,
that, that's not the case.

646
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
But that's what it feels like.

647
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,500
To me.

648
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,600
Did you kill those people, Oliver ?

649
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,000
I... can't answer that yet.

650
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,900
I want to talk a while first.

651
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,700
The dead bodies, is it true ?

652
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Did they really get eaten ?

653
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,200
Like in the book ?

654
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,300
Yes, they did.

655
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
I knew it.

656
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,400
Some of the Brennanites
were skeptical

657
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
that the deaths were realistic,

658
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
but I told them.

659
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Did he say "Brennanites" ?

660
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,800
Did you say "Brennanites" ?

661
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,700
Murder Mystery Chat Room members.

662
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,600
See, all chat room members
have to identify

663
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,600
themselves with their
favorite author.

664
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm a Brennanite,
of course,

665
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,900
but there are also, uh,

666
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Pattersonians and Graftonadas.

667
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,200
Okay, Oliver, I understand.
What did you tell them ?

668
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
That you couldn't make
those things up.

669
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,600
Everything you write is based
in fact, it could really happen.

670
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Oliver, I want to talk
about the murders.

671
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,700
You look so beautiful.

672
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,100
Maybe I could get
a picture of us together.

673
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,100
The murders, Oliver.

674
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,100
I know you just dismiss
me as another fan,

675
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,100
but once you get to know me,

676
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
you realize

677
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm an interesting man.

678
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,000
No touching, Oliver.

679
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
Okay, end of interview.

680
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
Seems like a good call.

681
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,900
Let's go.

682
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,900
No, we want to be alone.

683
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,300
You blew your chance
for that, okay.

684
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
You can sit in a cell

685
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,500
till you're ready to talk.

686
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,400
Wait, don't leave yet. Not yet.

687
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,000
O-kay.

688
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,400
- Ow, my nose.
- See,

689
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,200
I can take care of myself.

690
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,100
Yeah, you'd better watch it, dude.

691
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Oh, my...

692
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,500
There's so much...

693
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
The guy faints at the sight of blood.

694
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,100
- He has vasovagal syncope.
- Wait

695
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,400
there's no way he's the killer,
he just wanted your attention.

696
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,700
All right, so we're
back'r to square one.

697
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,600
All right the, uh, the book
is the only connection...

698
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
It sold 400,000 copies already.

699
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,100
That's a pretty big pool
of people to question.

700
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm going to be late for my reading.

701
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,600
Wait, there's still
potentially one more victim.

702
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,200
I think you should cancel.

703
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,000
What the, the killer's ter me, Sully.

704
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,700
If he is using the book,

705
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,000
that makes me the object
of these actions,

706
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,200
not the target.

707
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,200
I mean, you're the profiler, right ?

708
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm just trying to help.

709
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,000
Well, you're making this,
this personal.

710
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
You got yourself assigned to this case

711
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,700
just because of me. Absolutely !

712
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,300
What you'r gonna give me
more crap now

713
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
because I care about you ?

714
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,100
I'll be over here
making a few calls.

715
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
A little help, Booth.

716
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,700
Do you think she should go alone ?

717
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,900
No, no, not alone,

718
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,700
but there seems to be other
stuff going on here.

719
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:40,599
I don't want to get involved.

720
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,300
No, you agreed wagrem,
you are involved.

721
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,500
All right, so let Booth take you,

722
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,300
and that way, it won't be
personal between us.

723
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:46,199
- Fine.
- Fine.

724
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,000
- Fine !
- Fine.

725
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,900
Fine.

726
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,900
Oh, my...

727
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,100
Ellen is going to be so upset
you didn't take the car.

728
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,600
No, it's okay, I wanted
to go with Booth.

729
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,800
You're not gonna get in trouble.

730
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,300
Man, you're shaking.

731
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,000
- Are you okay ?
- Oh, yeah.

732
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,900
I'm fine, it's my own fault.

733
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm diabetic and I have
not had time to eat.

734
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,300
And Ellen's not here yet.

735
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
What, do you have any food, Candy ?

736
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,300
Yeah.

737
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,900
I got a half-eaten chocolate
bar, caramel center...

738
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,500
Wow. Here, eat.

739
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,300
You need the sugar.

740
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,300
Where, where's Ellen ?

741
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
I don't know.

742
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,900
She went home to hours ago
to change her clothes.

743
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,500
Left me to handle everything.

744
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
There was almost a riot over
the seating arrangements.

745
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,800
Well, did you call her ?

746
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,900
Who, Ellen ?

747
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,100
I can't. She left her
Blackberry as usual,

748
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,300
for me to answer, so I would
actually be calling...

749
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,600
myself.

750
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,900
This is, this is not like her.

751
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,100
She's never late.

752
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,100
All right, look, I'll send
a car by her place,

753
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
check things out, all right.

754
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,900
Thanks.

755
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
I'll go in and get them
ready for you.

756
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,100
You can use the back entrance
to avoid the nuts.

757
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Oh, um, the candy was a little linty,

758
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,500
but...

759
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,000
thank you.

760
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,000
Linty ?

761
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,700
Quite a line of people there.

762
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
A lot of fans, Bones.

763
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.

764
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,100
Hold it right there.

765
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:06,999
Whoa.

766
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,100
FBI, hands in the air.

767
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,500
I just wanted an autograph.

768
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Okay, just wait till the Doc
gets inside, okay, pal ?

769
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,500
I'm sorry, love your book.

770
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,700
Was that necessary ?

771
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,700
Just doing my job, okay Bones.

772
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,300
Are you gonna come at me
like you came at Sully ?

773
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,200
What is that supposed to mean ?

774
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,600
Far be it for me to stick
my nose into your bedroom,

775
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
but I've known Sully a long
time, and believe me,

776
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,100
he's one of the good guys.

777
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Well, I know Sully, Booth.

778
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Yeah, and I know you.

779
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
All right, somebody
gets too close,

780
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,100
you just want to push them away.

781
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,500
I think you're taking your
therapy a little too seriously.

782
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,500
Maybe, maybe not,
come on, let's go.

783
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
What ?

784
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,000
What the hell is that ?

785
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,900
Oh, no.

786
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,700
Booth, they're fire ants.

787
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,600
Just like the book.

788
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,700
The third body.

789
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,300
Oh, okay, there it is.

790
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh !

791
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Careful, Booth, don't let
them get on you.

792
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Oh...

793
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,400
It's Ellen.

794
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,900
We have to be careful
with fire ants.

795
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,800
ey're extremy dangerous.

796
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,700
I think the victim
would agree with you.

797
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,300
I asked them to pull the book,

798
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,900
but according to my contract,
I don't have that right.

799
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,500
I heard sales are increasing
because of the murders.

800
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
It's sick.

801
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,500
These are real people,

802
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
not characters.

803
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Just rember: at the
end your books,

804
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,300
Kathy Reichs always
gets the murderer.

805
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
How long will this take ?

806
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,400
Long as it takes to get
every last one of th.

807
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,300
Introducing fire ants
into the ecosystem

808
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
around here would be
extremely devastating.

809
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,200
What about the crime scene ?

810
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,500
It was covered.

811
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,500
Yeah, I had to fight
fire with fire,

812
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,600
or in this case,
fire ants with fire.

813
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,400
Meaning... Had to scorch it.

814
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,700
Used a flame thrower.

815
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Dude, it was like Ghostbusters,
the way they all went up.

816
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,300
We get the idea, thanks.

817
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,100
Bullet hole is visible now.

818
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
Around the C-2 vertebra.

819
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,400
Close range.

820
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,700
Each shot in a different
part of the body.

821
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,900
Very unusual for someone
who executes his victims.

822
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,400
Data retrieval went through
Ellen Laskow's Blackberry.

823
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
Found a text messaging address,

824
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
used only once about six months ago.

825
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,100
Former work number of Ashton Keller,
Sadie Keller's husband.

826
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh, wait, our-our third victim knew

827
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,700
our second victim's husband ?

828
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Asht Keller said his wife
was fooling around.

829
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,400
Maybe Ashton was fooling
around with Ellen.

830
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
He was a good-looking young guy.

831
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,100
She was a scary publicist.

832
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,500
No accounting for taste.

833
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:49,399
Well, I'll, uh...

834
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
... see what the publicist's
assistant knows.

835
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,000
They're always covering
for their bosses, right ?

836
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,400
Let's hope so.

837
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,900
I'll look for any
other connections

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,100
between Ashton Keller
and our first victim.

839
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,300
Okay.

840
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,400
Hey, uh, how's Brennan
holding up ?

841
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,200
Why don't you ask her yourself ?

842
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I'm... I'm not sure she's
exactly receptive right now.

843
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,100
Listen, don't let her bully
you into leaving, man.

844
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
- All right ?
- Yeah.

845
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,300
I... woke up this morning
and picked up her cleaning

846
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
like always.

847
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,900
Stupid, huh ?

848
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,800
I just... I can't get
used to the fact

849
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,500
that she's not here anymore.

850
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,200
You need candy bar or something ?

851
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,800
No, I'm okay.

852
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,300
Thanks.

853
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,400
So... is it the same person
who killed the other two ?

854
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,000
We don't know yet.

855
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,000
When she didn't show up,

856
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,500
I should have driven
back to get her.

857
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,000
Was she, uh, having an affair ?

858
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,100
She had... lovers.

859
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
Women.

860
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,100
I don't know why she was so
secretive in this day and age,

861
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,500
but I was the only person
in the office who knew.

862
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,100
Did she know Sadie Keller ?

863
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,000
The other victim ?

864
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,600
W-Were they... ?

865
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,500
If you can think of anything
that might connect them...

866
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,700
Of course; I'll go through my
old records and date books.

867
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,600
Great. Thanks.

868
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,900
The ridging along the edges
is almost identical.

869
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,700
I'd say the third bullet
was definitely shot

870
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
from the same barrel
as the first two.

871
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,700
Same glass cloth tape used
on body number three.

872
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,700
So why are all the attacks different ?

873
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,800
The first victim, Jim Lopata,

874
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,000
shows signs of a physical
attack before he was shot,

875
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,000
and look at the angle
of the gunshot.

876
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,600
Through the forehead,
execution style.

877
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,900
And the second victim, Sadie Keller,

878
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,300
shows absolutely no sign of
a struggle as if she were drugged.

879
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,300
But the toxicology screen
came back negative.

880
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,500
And the gunshot in this body

881
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
was straight through the heart.

882
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,499
The killer didn't want to see

883
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,800
his victim's face get blown off.

884
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,800
And Ellen was shot at close
range in the back of the neck.

885
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
I've never seen a pattern like that.

886
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,200
I don't think it is a pattern.

887
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
I think there were three
separate killers.

888
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,700
Any more leads off the third vic ?
Yeah, I'm working on it.

889
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,300
Brennan called,
the publicist took a shot

890
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,200
to the back of the neck.

891
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,900
She thinks we have three
separate killers.

892
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's a hell of a coincidence.

893
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,400
Or one hell of a conspiracy.

894
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,600
You know, she sounded
pretty certain,

895
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,500
and I trust her when she's all
calm and relaxed.

896
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,700
Uh, so the text message.

897
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,500
Uh, Ellen Laskow writes
Ashton Kelle

898
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,200
comes clean about her and
Sadie, Ashton is enraged...

899
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
No, it was Hank.

900
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,100
The assistant ?
What ? What about him ?

901
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,600
He said that he always carried
Ellen's Blackberry.

902
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,900
So maybe it wasn't
Ellen who knew Ashton

903
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,100
That's right.

904
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
It was Hank.

905
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,300
I found a quarry sample that matches
the sand found on the first body.

906
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,000
It was distributed by the Irving
Company of West Virginia,

907
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,600
used exclusively by country
clubs nationwide.

908
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,600
Only a few clubs in this area,
though, so I've got a list.

909
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,300
W-Why do country clubs need sand ?

910
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,300
- For golf courses.
- All right, Bones.

911
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,300
You're right; we're dealing with
three separate killers.

912
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Somehow they all know each other
and they're using your book

913
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,900
to make it look like one person.

914
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,800
What are we talking about ?

915
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,200
Motive, Bones, okay, motive.

916
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,200
Victim one was beating his wife,

917
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,200
second victim left her money
to her lazy-ass husband...

918
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,800
Victim three's Ellen, who...
seemed lonely, so...

919
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,200
Bones, don't try the
psychological stuff.

920
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,700
It's really not a pretty sight.

921
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
Ellen was hated by Hank,

922
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,300
who was also next
in line for her job.

923
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,500
Hey, good work, Hodgins.

924
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,399
Thanks.

925
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,900
So our suspects agreed
to kill for each other

926
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,500
so they'd each have and alibi ?

927
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,400
So all I need from you people
is some proof, okay ?

928
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,900
Oh, is that all ?

929
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Wait.

930
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,700
The sand.

931
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,100
Didn't you say that Ashton Keller
was a big golfer ?

932
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Yeah, he plays nine holes
at least every day

933
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,300
at the, uh, Rockville Country Club.

934
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,000
Yep. Rockville Country Club.

935
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,100
It is the only golf course
in Maryland

936
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
that gets their sand from Irving.

937
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,600
Okay, so if Ashton killed Jim,

938
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,200
that would mean Hank killed Sadie.

939
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,800
What do we know about Hank ?

940
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,400
Not much.

941
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,600
Hardworking, smart, diabetic...

942
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,700
Diabetic.

943
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
That's it.

944
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Cam !

945
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
The killer injected Sadie with
an excessive amount of insulin

946
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,100
to render her unconscious.

947
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,100
Being a diabetic, Hank would
have easy access to insulin.

948
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,000
Why didn't that show up
in the tox screen ?

949
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,600
Because insulin is a naturally
occurring substance in the body.

950
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,300
We were only looking
for analgesics and depressants.

951
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,300
Yeah, okay. What about
the third body, Ellen's ?

952
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,000
The tape and the ants did a great
deal of damage to the epidermis.

953
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,600
It's been difficult to get
a narrative of the injuries.

954
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay.

955
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:42,099
What's that ?

956
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,400
Cam is going to examine the body

957
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,800
with a reflective
ultraviolet lens,

958
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,200
see if that gives us anything.

959
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,300
I filtered the lens
so that it only allows

960
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
UV wave lengths of less
than 400 nanometers.

961
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,000
That way,

962
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
we can see bruises
and injury patterns

963
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,300
that are normally invisible.

964
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,700
Okay, have fun with that.

965
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:01,199
Booth.

966
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
Long bruise there,

967
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,900
as if the killer had his arm

968
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,800
around her neck.

969
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,600
And these marks on the arms...

970
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,300
they look like handprints.

971
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,600
Think her killer grabbed her
repeatedly all along her arms.

972
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,300
Hands...

973
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,700
May I ?

974
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,500
Well, Sully got confirmation

975
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
on the connection between the killers.

976
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:22,699
Which is ?

977
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,600
The Brennanite chat room
that Oliver mentioned,

978
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,200
the FBI tech squad traced
the screen names.

979
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,200
Greg Braley, Ashton Keller,
Hank Belden,

980
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,000
they're all members.

981
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,000
Look.

982
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,800
Syndactyly on the right hand.

983
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,300
We can link Greg Braley
to Ellen Laskow's death.

984
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,500
All three murders,

985
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,100
each one linked forensically
to one of the three suspects.

986
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Not bad.

987
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,700
What are you waiting for, Booth ?

988
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,900
Go get the bad guys.

989
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,200
That's a good idea.

990
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,900
Tell you something, all right ?

991
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,000
Sales of your book are gonna
skyrocket after this.

992
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,800
The only problem is our ending is

993
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,300
a lot better than the one
I wrote in the book.

994
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
What, are you kidding me, huh ?

995
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,300
Kathy Reichs and the FBI guy
in the back of the AMG...

996
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,300
The arrest.

997
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,100
Oh, yeah, that.

998
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,000
Sully.

999
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,700
Yeah, you know, you really
should apologize.

1000
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,900
I mean, you were really
ragging on the guy.

1001
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,400
He seems a little frail.

1002
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm a lot stronger than I look.

1003
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,400
Oh. You were...

1004
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,700
- Hey, Sul.
- Hey.

1005
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,700
So, congratulations.

1006
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,200
You guys make a great team.

1007
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,600
Mm-hmm. That's true.

1008
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,300
So true.

1009
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,700
Thanks for your help.

1010
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Sure.

1011
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
You know, I-I should run... Bones.

1012
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,100
You know, I got stuff.

1013
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,700
See you at work, Sul.

1014
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,900
Yeah, I'll see you, man.

1015
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
I...

1016
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I did feel responsible, Sully.

1017
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,000
Do.

1018
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,200
And you thought if I saw you vulnerable,

1019
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
needing me, I'd run ?

1020
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,400
I've been alone my whole life.

1021
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
It's all I know.

1022
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
Eh, don't worry.

1023
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,300
You'll learn fast.
