1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,596
All I ask is that you stop by and identify
the skull as Assyrian, Hittite or Egyptian.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,433
- I need my notes for court.
- There's a photocopy.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,911
Last time I read from photocopies, the
defence lawyer told the jury I was winging it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,878
- Ready. Chop-chop!
- I can't find my original notes.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,191
- Photocopy them.
- Last time the defence lawyer told the jury...

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,157
It was a ploy, it failed. Let's go.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,993
- I found glass and pollen. What do you want?
- Pollen.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,117
- Perhaps you could swing by Archaeology...
- No swinging.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,431
Her height makes no sense
and her spine length is wacky.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,354
Calculate the height off the femur
and assume the fire shrunk her spine.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,830
You shouldn't talk about other cases
on court day. You'll get confused.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,356
- One question. Assyrian, Hittite or Egyptian...
- What's up?

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,035
Buttercup. If you sign off the tissue markers,
Angela can finish the face.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,590
- Why did you say "buttercup"?
- It's amusing rhyming linguistically.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,875
This is the latest Jane Doe from limbo.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,474
I have a rhyming linguini -
see you later, alligator.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,915
Please don't refer to bone storage as limbo.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,391
There are thousands of remains waiting
to be identified. Limbo seems appropriate.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,472
- No sign of foul play.
- If you've time for this, you've time for me.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,235
Tissue depth of the cheek bones and jaw line
looks a little deep, otherwise...

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,914
Out of limbo, back on earth
and on our way to court.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,549
- Temperance.
- David. What are you doing here?

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,200
- She has to get to court.
- Booth, nice to see you,

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,555
especially when I'm not in custody.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,996
I read your manuscript.
I couldn't wait to tell you how great it is.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,753
- Thank you. Really?
- You read her manuscript?

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,035
Her second novel - <i>Bone Free</i>.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,749
- It's like <i>Born Free</i> except no lions.
- Yuck on the title. Am I in it?

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,478
- No.
- Definitely.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,156
- We have to get to court.
- Hope you have your original notes...

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,870
- Told you, Booth!
- No, Bones! We don't have time!

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,555
Three minutes! I'll wait for you in the car.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,151
- So, are you two...
- Yeah, sort of. Is that a problem?

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,713
Yeah. Bones is very literal,
so in future, no jokey advice on court day.

35
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,871
Is something wrong?

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,674
- What's this?
- Zack's Jane Doe.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,797
He said that you OK'd the tissue markers.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,510
No, that can't be right.
That can't possibly be right. You did it wrong.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,591
It's a mistake, Angela.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,275
All right, fine. Sweetie, I'll turn it off.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,560
The artefact bag from your Jane Doe,
do you have it?

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,590
Yes. I also have three bags of soil samples
from where the remains were buried.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,196
Any of you see Bones?
We're due in court, like, hello, now.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,278
What?

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,634
This.

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,910
Totally freaked her out.

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,749
<i>(Zack)</i> My theory - caffeine intolerance.

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,277
Yeah, you're gonna want to take Dr Brennan
off the witness list today.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,635
No, she can't make it into court.

50
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,073
Thanks.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,358
- What's going on?
- That... is Christine Brennan.

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,431
Good God.

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,548
You just found Bones' mother.

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,154
- I have to miss court.
- I know.

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,629
I remember this belt buckle.

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,558
I borrowed it without asking.

57
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,949
First day of high school.

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,109
My father had it specially made
for my mother because she loved dolphins.

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,237
Bones... I'm sorry.

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,916
I always knew that
for my parents to disappear like that,

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,878
they... they had to be dead.

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,750
I thought that when it was confirmed,
I'd feel relief.

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,230
- But...
- It's still bad news.

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,713
- You have the file, Zack?
- Jane Doe, number 129, 09/98.

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,597
- Where was she found?
- Bones.

66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,399
What does it say?

67
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,275
"In September of 1998,

68
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,558
a grave-digging crew at the Sunset Memories
cemetery in Salisbury, Pennsylvania,

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,519
uncovered human remains in a completely
advanced stage of decomposition."

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,830
- Is it from a grave?
- No, it appears somebody

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,310
dug a hole at the edge of the cemetery
and plopped the body in there.

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,391
- <i>(Booth)</i> Zack!
- Sorry.

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,072
"The local coroner found
no obvious evidence of foul play

74
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,153
and sent the remains, a few artefacts
and soil samples to the Jeffersonian,

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,879
hoping we could identify her."

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,315
Your mother's been here as long as you have.

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,356
- <i>(Booth)</i> Zack.
- Sorry.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,878
But they both got here in 1998.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,319
Dr Brennan. Miss Montenegro
has volunteered to drive you home.

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,274
Temperance.

81
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,351
Go home.

82
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,032
<i>(knock at door)</i>

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,918
- It's after midnight.
- I was driving by, I saw the lights.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,833
Thought you might like some Wong Foo's.

85
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,356
- You saw my lights from the road?
- That is correct.

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,591
All right.

87
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,076
After you gave me your parents' file,
I did some poking around.

88
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,878
You worked on it?

89
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,830
There wasrt much I could do.
There was no evidence, no clearjurisdiction.

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,911
Listen, Bones.

91
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,792
Finding your mother's remains
means I can open an official FBI case.

92
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,192
I mean, for the first time,
a real investigation can occur.

93
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,513
Three days after my parents disappeared,
they found our car

94
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,637
at a rest stop 1,000 miles
from where we lived in Chicago.

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,793
I found it in an impound lot in Jersey.
I'm having it trucked to the Jeffersonian.

96
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,030
They kept it all those years?

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,395
Well, nobody claimed it.

98
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,112
Your father was a high-school teacher.
He had no trouble with anyone at work.

99
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,877
- Your mother, that's a... different matter.
- She was a book-keeper.

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,479
She was a witness for the prosecution, twice,
on evasion charges. That gives motive.

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,071
Then there's your brother.

102
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,638
- Russ. The brother who deserted me.
- He's on parole.

103
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,429
He ran a chop shop,
processing stolen cars for parts.

104
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,638
Figures.

105
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,157
He says that you blame him
for your parents' disappearance.

106
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,549
- You talked to Russ?
- I called him.

107
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,997
Just asked him a few routine questions.
He didn't give me much.

108
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,312
We're gonna find out
what happened to your mom, OK?

109
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,078
Adipocere and decomp residues in the soil
indicate the body was buried for five years.

110
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,948
That's congruent with pH in the soil,
climate and degree of decomp.

111
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,237
No, seven years. It should be seven years.

112
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,631
I'm still going through the soil samples, but
something may allow me to be more specific.

113
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,154
She was buried near Christmas 1991.

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,595
- I need the room.
- The whole lab? For what?

115
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,353
It's a cop way of saying "Get lost".

116
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,234
- What?
- When you gave me the file on your parents,

117
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,519
I looked back into their lives
three to four years before they disappeared.

118
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,674
Jobs, friends. Then I looked back
a little further and I found out that...

119
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,469
Christine Brennan didn't exist before 1978.

120
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,189
What are you telling me?
That this woman isn't my mother?

121
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,308
I was born in 1976.
Obviously my mother existed.

122
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,349
Do you know the most common way
of creating an identity?

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,473
Getting the birth certificate
of someone deceased

124
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,475
who was born the same year you were
and... take over that identity.

125
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,633
I found one Matthew Brennan,
born and died 1948.

126
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,878
You understand?

127
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,872
I don't know what it means.
I don't know what any of it means.

128
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,351
It means that your parents werert...
who you thought they were.

129
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,318
It means that they were living under...

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,789
assumed identities.

131
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,274
<i>(man)</i> Every minute this is down,
I'm losing money.

132
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,151
You want faster work, grab yourself
a cup of coffee. Let me alone, man.

133
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,758
- Are you licensed for this job?
- You're a cop.

134
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,308
- You know who recognises cops?
- Other cops.

135
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,231
And crooks.

136
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,836
I talked to you a couple of months ago
on the phone. I'm Booth.

137
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,516
Are you going to ask me some more
questions about my childhood?

138
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,068
- You found my mother?
- Your sister did the ID.

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,752
- What about Dad?
- No.

140
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,958
- What do you want?
- You remember being anyone else besides...

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,439
- Russ Brennan?
- No.

142
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,433
- You wouldn't lie to me, would you?
- Cops always think I'm lying.

143
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,598
- I want you to come to DC and help with this.
- I got ajob, man.

144
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,674
An alternative is I just cite you for performing
unlicensed repairs on heavy equipment.

145
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,036
Get your parole revoked. Tell you what...

146
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,918
You give me a call when you get into town.

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,278
Oh, if you ask me, this...
this thing here is beyond hope.

148
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,271
Look at that. It works.

149
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,029
I'll see you soon.

150
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,471
- What is it?
- A clump of cellulose.

151
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,835
Came from the soil samples at the burial site,

152
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,356
- from the same depth as her bones.
- You said you had a giant problem.

153
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,750
- I used the laser scanning microscope.
- Which one is that?

154
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,515
Looks like an espresso machine.
It showed this is mass-produced cardboard.

155
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,034
Electron dispersion spectroscopy indicates

156
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,032
the cardboard is coated
with unsaturated monomers...

157
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,395
Hodgins. What's the giant problem?

158
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,077
It's a movie ticket. A little UV analysis,
some guesswork, I get <i>The Fugitive.</i>

159
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,232
So what? You don't like
Brennars mom's taste in movies?

160
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,518
<i>The Fugitive</i> was
the third top grossing film of 1993.

161
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,393
Brennars parents disappeared
in December of 1991.

162
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,119
Yet Mom's going to Harrison Ford movies
two years later.

163
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,316
Oh, God. This <i>is</i> giant.

164
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,198
What do I do? Pretend I never found this?

165
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,431
- <i>(Hodgins)</i> Dr Brennan.
- Yes. Did you find something in the soil?

166
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,834
Yeah, uh... This was in the soil samples
alongside your mother's remains.

167
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,833
- A movie ticket?
- Rialto Theater, 9pm show of <i>The Fugitive</i>.

168
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,959
- September 22nd, 1993.
- How did it get there?

169
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,955
Either your mother had it when she
was buried, or it was buried with her.

170
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,396
- Either way, it dates the burial.
- No, that's impossible.

171
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,675
My mother disappeared in 1991.

172
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,116
It's possible Mom was buried
somewhere else, then moved.

173
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,192
- No, that's not possible.
- Maybe it is.

174
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,518
We decided to tell you the truth.

175
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,233
And this is the truth.

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,753
- You all right?
- I'm pretty sure I found cause of death.

177
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,478
- Zack.
- Yes, Dr Brennan?

178
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,199
See the discolouration
on the inside of the skull?

179
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,115
Left side. Extending from the coronal suture.

180
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,558
Crossing the superior and inferior
temporal lines to the squamosal suture.

181
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,710
Subdural haematoma.

182
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,791
Whoo. A big one.

183
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,557
- Dr Brennan.
- Probably fatal.

184
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,634
There are no indications
of a blow to the outer skull.

185
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,150
Scan the outside of the skull, look for
histological changes, microscopic modelling.

186
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,038
- I don't want to talk to him.
- Bones.

187
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,240
Bones... All right, Zack, if this guy moves,
shoot him with a tranquilliser dart.

188
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,515
I don't actually have a tranquilliser gun.

189
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,160
Hey, Bones. Come on.

190
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,391
My mother died of a subdural haematoma.
Bleeding in the brain.

191
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,358
- You want to proceed rationally?
- Chances are...

192
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,955
the subdural haematoma
was caused by a blow to the head.

193
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,429
You got the how, now let's get the who.

194
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,317
You just told me
that your mother was murdered.

195
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,279
I mean, who better to help us
than your brother?

196
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,671
Mom loved dolphins.

197
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,074
This was mine.

198
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,358
My favourite marble.
What was she doing with that?

199
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,633
- Where did Booth find you?
- It's not hard for the FBI to find a parolee.

200
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,998
- I didn't ask how, I asked where.
- Morehead City, North Carolina.

201
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,073
I call every year on your birthday.
You never pick up.

202
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,196
Take a hint.

203
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,713
- Could I have this, please?
- It's evidence.

204
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,079
- Of what? It's a kid's marble.
- It's the rules. I can't let you have it.

205
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,153
Same old Tempe.
Never met a rule won'th breaking.

206
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,754
Same old Russ. On parole.

207
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,118
I might send Russ in
to describe some people to you.

208
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,838
OK. What people?

209
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,038
- People a seven-year-old might remember.
- That's a little vague there, Booth.

210
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,157
The drawing - that's important.
I trust your instincts.

211
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,631
- When it comes to men?
- Ha-ha. When it comes to suspects.

212
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,191
Why do you think that Bones
asked her boyfriend...

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,310
to read her book, and not me?

214
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,155
Maybe because there was
just too much of me in the story.

215
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,274
- She was embarrassed. You think? Maybe...
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

216
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,510
Booth. Yeah.

217
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,469
I'm on my way. Thanks.

218
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,915
The family carjust arrived.

219
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,351
- Are we looking for anything in particular?
- Treat it like a brand-new crime scene.

220
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,513
Tear through the whole car, treat it
and go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

221
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,033
That's our old car.

222
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,715
The name of my school is scraped off.
Woodside Elementary.

223
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,756
They said they didn't find anything.

224
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,991
There was a bloodstain,
front seat, passenger side.

225
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,595
Guys, everybody. I need space, now.

226
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,513
- What, now?
- Yeah, now.

227
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,319
Take five, everybody.

228
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,118
Twice in two days.

229
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,591
I had NCIC database check for
a married couple who disappeared in 1978.

230
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,750
Meet Max and Ruth Keenan.

231
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,149
- <i>(Russ)</i> That's Mom and Dad all right.
- The NCIC database? That's... criminals.

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,037
My parents were
on the list of federal offenders?

233
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,112
How do you like that?
Guess a criminal nature runs in the family.

234
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,150
You were seven years old, Russ. Old enough
to remember. What is your real name?

235
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,879
- What is my real name?
- Bones, it's here in the file.

236
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,758
No! No! I want him to tell me.

237
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,119
What is my real name, Russ?

238
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,951
My name was Kyle.

239
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,950
Your name was Joy.

240
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,156
You are not my brother.

241
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,796
- Bones.
- No! He lied about that.

242
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,557
What else are you lying about?
What else are you not telling us?

243
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,351
At first, I thought the worst thing
was that they were... missing.

244
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,829
Except dead means no more hope.

245
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,474
My mother was alive for almost two years
after they disappeared.

246
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,472
- She abandoned me.
- You don't know that.

247
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,795
You finally got to slap Russ.

248
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,270
You've been wanting to do that for years.

249
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,669
I worshipped him, you know?

250
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,394
God, he was so cool.

251
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,439
Everyone knew
I was Russ Brennars little sister.

252
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,310
I wasrt cool or pretty, so being his sister...

253
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,000
You know that game Marco Polo?

254
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,074
I'd be sitting in class
and I'd hear out the window, "Marco".

255
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,479
It'd be Russ, checking in on me and letting
everyone know that I was his little sister.

256
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,869
Did you "Polo"?

257
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,997
Yeah, sometimes it would be
the only word I said all day.

258
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,275
Polo.

259
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,592
Then Mom and Dad disappeared and...

260
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,551
Russ took off.

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,959
Suddenly, no one cared where I was.

262
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,750
I miss that.

263
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,877
Someone caring where I am all the time.

264
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,590
Bones! Bones, are you up there?
Come on, let's go. Chop-chop!

265
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,193
I found the agent that
was assigned to your parents' case.

266
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,834
I was the FBI liaison in a bank robbery task
force working out of Cincinnati in the '70s.

267
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,313
Secret service, state police, ATF, all of us
after a pretty bad bunch of armed robbers

268
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,551
working Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa...

269
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,676
You know, excuse me.

270
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,435
Am I to understand that I'm addressing
the family of one of these robbers?

271
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
Max and Ruth Keenars children.

272
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,835
Max and Ruth. Yeah.
They never really belonged in that crew.

273
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,559
- Why?
- They worked smart.

274
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,438
Specialised in safe deposit boxes, no guns.

275
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,152
They'd either con their way in or case out
the place, break back in on the weekend.

276
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,676
Took their time. We never got a handle
on the size of their scores.

277
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,754
- Why?
- People keep jewellery and cash in the boxes.

278
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,229
And stuff they don't want to report stolen.

279
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,790
None of us understood
why stand-up criminals like Max and Ruth

280
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,678
would join this Midwest strong-arm crew.

281
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,958
Links to white supremacists,
real dedication to firearms and violence.

282
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,956
Ajob went bad. Two innocent bystanders
were killed, one trooper, seven wounded.

283
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,713
- When was that?
- July 4th, 1978.

284
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,678
- Never caught 'em?
- Not us. No.

285
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,232
A few years later, one of 'em turned State's
evidence for an FBI agent out of Louisville.

286
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,108
Sent the rest to jail.
My understanding is they're all dead.

287
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,078
Our parents were bank robbers?

288
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,312
Who morphed into a high-school
science teacher and a book-keeper?

289
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,676
Their particular brand
of safety deposit break-ins stopped.

290
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,753
At the time, I figured the strong-arm crew
killed them for their cut.

291
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,311
- Agent Booth, we found blood in the car.
- We expected that.

292
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,032
Yeah, but here's the wrinkle.
We got blood from two separate individuals.

293
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,511
These two DNA charts are from the blood in
the car. These are from Dr Brennan and Russ.

294
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,513
These three match and this one does not.

295
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,479
- These three people are related?
- This is Mom, me and Russ.

296
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,917
But this chart - a male,
but it's definitely not your father.

297
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,189
OK, so we'll run it through CODIS and the
Convicted Offender Index, see what pops up.

298
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,751
So you describe someone to me
and I draw them. That's the drill.

299
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,637
- Who do I describe?
- I don't know yet.

300
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,077
Booth put us together so I could charm you
into telling me the truth.

301
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,390
Trust me. I got no more truth.

302
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,278
Your sister is my best friend. So when
she says you can't be trusted, I trust her.

303
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,794
This is you being charming?

304
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,475
- Does Tempe really hate me that much?
- Russ, she loves you.

305
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,078
It would be easier if she hated you.
Hate is a lot easier to deal with than love.

306
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,152
Especially disappointed love.

307
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,473
You know what's ironic? Tempe doesn't
trust me because I kept a promise.

308
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,869
What promise?

309
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,151
Seven years old, Dad and me in the back yard.
This was in Ohio.

310
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,358
My dad tells me, "You're not Kyle any more."

311
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,830
"Forget about Kyle. You're Russ."

312
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,153
He says, "If you ever tell anyone,
the police, anyone,

313
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,119
you'll be killing your mother and your sister."

314
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,239
"Swear," he says. "You swear
on your baby sister's life you won't tell."

315
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,835
He makes me say my new name 100 times.
"Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan."

316
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,199
He says it with me. "Russ Brennan,
Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan."

317
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,677
Around that time, when Kyle became Russ,

318
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,279
maybe you saw someone,
maybe you saw someone who scared you.

319
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,673
Someone who scared you
because you had instincts.

320
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,196
The instincts of a frightened kid.

321
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,953
Was there someone like that?

322
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,911
Yeah.

323
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,268
A man came to the house one day.

324
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,078
My dad said if I ever saw this guy again,
to grab my sister and hide.

325
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,039
Well, when you're ready,
you'll describe that man to me.

326
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,351
All right.

327
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,435
If you keep bringing Chinese food
in the middle of the night, we'll both get fat.

328
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,795
- I know what you've been thinking.
- I doubt it.

329
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,194
You've been thinking that your family
is made up of liars and criminals.

330
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,874
And that makes you feel Ionely.

331
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,792
- There's a story here we don't know yet.
- Like what?

332
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,633
Bones, "don't know" means it's a mystery.

333
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,553
What were your parents like?

334
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,312
My parents...

335
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,509
My dad, he, uh... he drove
Thuds and Phantoms in Vietnam.

336
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,116
Those are fighterjets.
After that, he was a barber in Philadelphia.

337
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,354
My mom, she wrote jingles
for a local advertising agency.

338
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,468
So they didn't go out at night
after you were asleep and rob banks?

339
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,074
Listen, Bones, you know...

340
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,391
Parents have secret lives.

341
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,310
If they didn't, they wouldn't be parents.

342
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,908
It is a little late for Chinese, isn't it?

343
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,197
Thanks for the meal. See you tomorrow.

344
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,511
- Dr Brennan, is it morning?
- No, I couldn't sleep. Why are you still here?

345
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,355
We're all here. No one's leaving until
we figure out what happened to your mother.

346
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,953
Thank you.

347
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,634
Don't thank me. I'm failing.

348
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,156
I've gone over the skull
and found no evidence of remodelling,

349
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,360
which makes no sense because any wound
that results in a subdural haematoma that big

350
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,431
should leave a mark on the living bone.

351
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,671
What if the subdural haematoma
started out much smaller?

352
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,514
- And grew over time?
- Over the course of, say, a year.

353
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,116
That might explain the gap between the time
she got an injury and the time she was buried.

354
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,158
Then the blow itself
might not have left a mark on the bone.

355
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,028
Show me the surface of the skull
directly above the centre of the haematoma.

356
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,680
100 times magnification.

357
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,751
Go to 500.

358
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,199
- See here?
- Microscopic fractures on the osteons.

359
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,717
And is that the result of bleeding
into the interstitial spaces?

360
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,268
I can map the fractured osteons.

361
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,715
That might lead us to the weapon.

362
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,433
- I'm awake.
- Yeah. I can see that.

363
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,639
- Got a break on the DNA in the car.
- You know who it is?

364
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,953
Not exactly. It's a closed file. Whoever it is is
in the Witness Protection. I'll make a request.

365
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,510
- What if he had a face?
- Who's that?

366
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,071
Someone your dad pointed out to Russ when
he was seven. Somebody he's still afraid of.

367
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,549
I'm gonna play hardball
with Witness Protection.

368
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,393
If they don't cooperate,
I'll put his face in the paper.

369
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,439
- Wouldrt you get in trouble for that?
- Well, we'll find out.

370
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,308
You know what?
Sometimes, he is just... whoo!

371
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,875
What?

372
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,713
This is the pattern of fractured osteons.

373
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,952
- A blow from the front that grazed the skull.
- A bullet?

374
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,635
There'd have been particulates
left by a bullet fired from short range.

375
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,431
I isolated the most fractured osteons
and this pattern emerges.

376
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,957
- It looks like the business end of a tyre iron.
- No, the size is wrong. It's too small.

377
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,476
The weapon was actually
chasing the skull when it landed.

378
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,874
I believe she was pulled away, so most of the
force was lost, leaving a slight impression.

379
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,636
Bones. I got what I need from
Witness Protection. Let's go for a drive.

380
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,830
Everybody.

381
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,275
Thank you.

382
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,351
I...

383
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,871
Thank you.

384
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,719
OK, Bones, just listen to me. This guy
McVicar, he might be a pig farmer now,

385
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,272
but he used to be a mechanic with ties in the
strong-arm crew your parents ran away from.

386
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,875
- A mechanic like Russ?
- Not like Russ. Russ fixes things.

387
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,872
This guy, he used to kill people.

388
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,839
- Can I help you, folks?
- Yeah. Put your hands up.

389
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,273
- Do it.
- <i>(Bones)</i> Booth!

390
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,396
Check him for a gun.

391
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,874
What's going on?

392
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,199
- He's got a.45.
- .45? Check his ankle.

393
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,436
- He's got a.38.
- .38. I'm always right.

394
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,433
- I'm FBI. I know who you are.
- Steve Beers, pig farmer.

395
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,637
Vince McVicar, the pig farmer, huh?

396
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,349
You wanna talk to Vince McVicar,
you do it through the federal marshals.

397
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,319
Then I'd have to tell 'em about a pig farmer
who carries two concealed weapons.

398
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,437
Three.
.22 in the small of his back.

399
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,795
- .22. I'm always right.
- No, you're not.

400
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,553
I am. Bones, will you put the gun down?

401
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,876
What do you want?

402
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,554
I'm Ruth Keenars daughter.

403
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,631
Joy?

404
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,755
You're Joy Keenan?

405
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,556
Yeah.

406
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,835
I can see that.

407
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,557
- We found your blood in the car.
- You hurt people. You bashed in their heads.

408
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,995
They never proved that, or I wouldn't be here.

409
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,071
We know how it works, Vince.

410
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,550
You rat out your crew, everybody
loses interest in a few old murders.

411
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,714
- My mother was hit on the head.
- Yeah, I know. I was there.

412
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,438
- 32 stitches.
- She fought back, huh?

413
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,114
Ruthie fought back, all right.

414
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,913
- But not against me.
- Then against whom?

415
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,951
Your father.

416
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,711
Why did he attack you?

417
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,629
- Think about it a second, all right?
- You and my... my mother?

418
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,915
Me and Ruthie ran off together.

419
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,710
Max caught us pulling into a motel
outside of Champaign, Illinois.

420
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,076
We were nuts about each other,
Ruthie and me.

421
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,039
- Crazy in love.
- Let's just skip that part, OK?

422
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,673
- He hit Ruthie first.
- With what?

423
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,830
Tyre iron.

424
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,799
Hit my arm,
caught me a roundhouse to the head.

425
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,438
Lights out, baby.

426
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,952
I came to, Ruthie and Max were gone.
Never saw neither of 'em again.

427
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,958
If you ask me, Max killed Ruthie,
buried her somewhere and vanished.

428
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,429
Our plan, once we set up,

429
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,633
most likely in Florida,

430
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,995
was to bring you down.

431
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,195
Your father is a hard man, Joy.

432
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,511
My name is Brennan. I'm Dr...

433
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,634
I'm Dr Temperance Brennan.

434
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,671
I work at the Jeffersonian Institution.
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

435
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,035
I specialise in identif...

436
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,631
in identifying...

437
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,713
in identifying people
who nobody knows who they are.

438
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,349
My father was a science teacher
and my mother was a book-keeper.

439
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,271
My brother...

440
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,351
I have a brother.

441
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,710
I'm Dr Temperance Brennan.

442
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,110
I know who you are. Hey, I know. It's OK.

443
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,709
Shh. It's gonna be all right.

444
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,631
- No way Dad hits Mom. No way.
- If he caught them together...

445
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,952
- No way Mom cheats on Dad. No way.
- McVicar lies the way you guys drink water.

446
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,679
He killed people
then he snitched to save his own ass.

447
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,069
- You don't believe him?
- No, I don't.

448
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,038
Give me one piece of evidence
that doesn't back up his story.

449
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,159
- Sticker on your parents' car was scraped off.
- What does that prove?

450
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,596
The only reason to do that
would be to keep you guys hidden and safe.

451
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,196
- From McVicar?
- He did hits for the crew that they ran out on.

452
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,748
- What else?
- There's a story that tracks for me,

453
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,355
but without evidence, it's just a story.

454
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,158
Tell us.

455
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,433
Your parents go out Christmas shopping,
they spot McVicar, the hit man.

456
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,829
They lead him away from your home.

457
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,356
Scrape off the name of the school
so he can't trace it to me and Russ.

458
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,398
- He takes out your dad.
- And Mom gets away with a head wound?

459
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,675
She leaves the car 1,000 miles away,

460
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,276
but she can never go back to see you guys
because the crew is still looking for her.

461
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,874
- It's just a story.
- Fits the evidence.

462
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,269
The weapons that McVicar had on him,

463
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,591
they're a violation of his agreement
with Witness Protection.

464
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,116
I'm gonna take him into custody,
get a warrant, search his farm.

465
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,998
- For what?
- McVicar liked to bash in people's heads.

466
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,753
Maybe we'll get lucky
and match the weapon he used.

467
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,753
- It's unlikely.
- In that case, we'll still ruin his day.

468
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,276
Tempe, that theory explains why Mom
never came back for you before she died.

469
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,835
- What's your excuse, Russ?
- You're the one that left me.

470
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,639
You... you needed someone to blame,
you chose me.

471
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,951
- I was 15 years old.
- I was 19!

472
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,716
My parents were gone, my sister hated me.
Everyone's telling me she should be in care.

473
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,588
- You didn't even ask me.
- I tried, Temperance. You wouldn't talk to me!

474
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,434
You wouldn't be talking if Mom's
bones hadrt shown up. And I kept trying.

475
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,557
Every year. Every year on your birthday.

476
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,949
You're the one that gave up!

477
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,034
You turned your back on me
and you made yourself a new family.

478
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,158
What's going on?

479
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,516
The FBI delivered these tools and weapons
from the pig farm guy.

480
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,831
We went through them to see if any
matched the mark on your mom's skull.

481
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,199
We got 20 hammers, a dozen hatchets.
Man loves his blunt instruments.

482
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,354
Seven tyre irons. None of them match
the wound, even allowing for shrinkage.

483
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,318
It was 15 years ago.
Even if McVicar killed my mother,

484
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,915
what are the chances
he hung on to the exact weapon?

485
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,639
It's always like this with McVicar.

486
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,190
Some mook is found with his forehead
bashed in and the FBI goes in,

487
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,114
collects about 40 hammers,
and nothing matches.

488
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,112
- Always the forehead?
- That's his signature kill. Yeah.

489
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,316
Not that anyone could ever prove it.

490
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,029
You said guys like McVicar
get comfortable with a way of killing.

491
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,315
- Yeah.
- Where did McVicar grow up?

492
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,630
He grew up a farm kid in Iowa. Why?

493
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,109
How do you slaughter a pig?

494
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,036
- Why's he here?
- He gets nervous. We're getting close.

495
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,111
Found this in the barn.

496
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,434
This is a spring-Ioaded captive bolt stunner.

497
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,275
The animal's restrained,
it's pressed to the forehead.

498
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,270
Who could use this on a human being?

499
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,635
Who could use this on a pig?

500
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,474
It's the perfect dodge.
Blood, flesh can all be explained.

501
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,199
- I think I just became a vegetarian.
- What do you think?

502
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,991
Yeah. Same shape as a tyre iron, but smaller.
This could be a match.

503
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,072
Before you decide anything, we should talk.

504
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,149
I'd call that nervous. Wouldrt you?

505
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,155
There's no way to prove that's the weapon
that killed your mother or anyone else.

506
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,629
You'd be surprised at what she can prove.

507
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,631
- I need to speak to you alone.
- Forget it.

508
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,713
- Booth, it's all right. It's all right.
- No. No.

509
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,829
You got two ways to look at this.
One is you score a private chat.

510
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,310
Second is you attack her
and I'll drill you through the forehead.

511
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,632
- How could I possibly attack her?
- I'll decide what is and isn't an attack,

512
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,551
like, say, a hiccup.

513
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,631
Booth. Come on.

514
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,471
- You killed my mother.
- It would be hard to convince ajury.

515
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,996
I'm pretty persuasive. I'll put you away.

516
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,389
Here's the thing, Joy.

517
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,474
Two people know what really happened
that night. Me and your father.

518
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,634
- You killed him before you attacked my mom.
- Then how did I get this scar on my head?

519
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,359
You got a choice, Joy.

520
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,989
Drop the bolt stunner down the well
and you'll know what happened.

521
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,791
You put me in front of ajury,
not only will you fail to convict, but...

522
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,713
you'll never know the truth.

523
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,628
You can't live with that, Joy.

524
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,713
You can't live not knowing.

525
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,478
I found out what happened to my mother.
I'll find out what happened to my father too.

526
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,076
- We're done.
- You'll never know what happened your dad!

527
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:05,470
- Why are you letting me drive?
- It's a reward for totally pissing off a hit man.

528
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,994
- Oh, can I read your book?
- After it's come out.

529
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,433
- Not before?
- No.

530
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,636
What? I let you drive.

531
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,154
- Just let it go.
- Where are we going?

532
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,516
I'd like to make up for a little lost time.

533
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,837
I'm gonna go get a funnel cake, OK?

534
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,715
I have something for you.

535
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,031
Thanks, Tempe.

536
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,991
Russ.

537
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,311
You were right.

538
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,798
You were only 19, but at the time...

539
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,752
I didn't understand what that meant.

540
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,436
Sometimes people need
to explain things to me, I guess.

541
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,029
Then... you have to let them talk to you.

542
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,278
If you could maybe come back
and stay a couple of days longer?

543
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,828
Please?

544
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,514
At my place, I mean.

545
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,391
Marco.

546
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,711
Polo.

547
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,832
- Anybody thirsty?
- Is it too early for a beer?

548
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,435
I gotta go.
I'm picking up Parker for the weekend.

549
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,515
I'll take one.

550
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,194
- You have a boy?
- Yeah.

551
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,959
The woman I'm seeing,
she's got two daughters.

552
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,031
Nice.

553
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,631
Girls are nice.

554
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,751
- To us.
- Whoever the hell we are.

555
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,637
To what we're becoming.

556
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,993
<i>New message recorded today. 3pm.</i>

557
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,959
<i>(man) Temperance, you have to stop looking.</i>

558
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,716
<i>You have to stop looking for me right now.</i>
<i>This is bigger and worse than you know.</i>

559
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,075
<i>Please. Stop now.</i>

560
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,196
Who's that?

561
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,874
That was my father.

562
