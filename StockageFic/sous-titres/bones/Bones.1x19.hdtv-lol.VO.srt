00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,534
<i>Even all these months</i>

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:05,733
<i>the city of New Orleans,</i>
<i>human remains</i>

00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,267

4

<i>neighborhoods around the city.</i>

5
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:13,067
<i>Cadaver dogs are being used</i>
<i>to search for 2,300 people</i>

6
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:14,700
<i>still unaccounted for.</i>

7
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,268
Makeshift morgues
still exist in warehouses,

8
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:20,167
schools and churches
throughout the area.

9
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:21,800
Officials are finally
beginning to admit

10
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:25,167
what many people have know
since the levees broke long ago:

11
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,834
many of these people
will never be found.

12
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:31,201
You look tired, Mike.
Late night?

13
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:31,201
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:32,500
Late and nasty.

15
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,134
Same kinky creature?

16
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,533
Doc, the girl carries
a serious perv swerve.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,368
Feeling wrong
feels so good.

18
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,601
Hey, sorry, Dr. Brennan.

19
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,867
No, it's fine.

20
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,534
Males often bond

21
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,034
by exaggerating
sexual conquests.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,833
Oh, Mike's not exaggerating.

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,800
This girl is seriously
turned on by coffins.

24
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,833
Mike'll take her
into the cooler in...

25
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,034
Doc.
ADDY:
Some libidos are enflamed

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,900
by a proximity to death.

27
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:00,067
Who's that?
My assistant, Zack.

28
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:02,000
Back in DC.

29
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:05,067
Congratulations
on your coffin sex.

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,367
I've got work to do.

31
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,000
Some of the information
you've sent for analysis

32
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,900
seems to have come from remains
that have already been embalmed.

33
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,434
The bodies were unearthed
by the flooding.

34
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,601
They have to be ID'd
and reburied.

35
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,668
Could fly down there to help,
Dr. Brennan.

36
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,634
A: tomorrow's my last day,

37
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:29,401
and B: the sex on the coffin
thing is not guaranteed.

38
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,534
You know, there are
reasons they call this

39
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:36,134
The Big Easy-- even after
Hurricane Katrina.

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,601
Dr. Brennan.

41
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,434
Meet John Doe 361.

42
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,434
We found this one
in the Ninth Ward,

43
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,301
sticking out of the mud.

44
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,167
Good afternoon,
Detective Harding.

45
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,933
Male, 40s.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Badly decomposed.
Looks pretty banged up.

47
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,134
Yep. Be nice to know
if it was hurricane,

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,034
flood or foul play
that killed him.

49
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,434
Detective Harding, have you
been into the cooler lately?

50
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,367
Apparently, some libidos

51
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,100
are enflamed by
the proximity to death.

52
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,833
God, Graham.

53
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,800
Thinking about sex in this place
should be illegal,

54
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,768
if it ain't already.

55
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, Sam, I'm going to need
X-rays on this one.

56
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,634
Uh, looks like there's
something lodged
behind his teeth.

57
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:21,768
You been working
48 hours straight.

58
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,067
You need
an evening off.

59
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:25,768
I only have one
vacation day left.

60
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you,
doing penance for FEMA?

61
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,701
Why don't you let me
cook you dinner tonight?

62
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,701
I don't know.
Come on.

63
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:33,134
I'm a Southern
gentleman, ma'am.

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,701
Your honor will be
respected.

65
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:36,334
Yeah.

66
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:37,900
Tell you what, Graham.

67
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,734
We'll see what the X-rays
tell us about this one

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,833
and then, maybe...
we'll get a bite to eat.

69
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:46,067
Dr. Brennan, your airport
shuttle is here.

70
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,768
What?

71
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,067
No, um...

72
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:54,701
My flight isn't until Thursday.

73
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,034
Today <i>is</i> Thursday, Dr. Brennan.

74
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:02,867
What happened to Wednesday?

75
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,167
Dr. Brennan? Hello?

76
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:09,034
Are you there, Dr. Brennan?

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,401
Cync by xxy

78
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,200
Cync by xxy
www.1000fr.com

79
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:40,467
Looks like someone
stole your earring.

80
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,367
Ripped it right out
of the lobe.

81
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,100
I don't know
what happened to me.

82
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,734
It's a tough town.

83
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,067
We don't have that many
cops anymore, and, uh,

84
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,200
they were never that good
to begin with.

85
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,334
Shouldn't insult the ones
that stuck around.

86
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,634
Detective Harding,
I didn't...

87
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,834
know who else to call.

88
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,067
I need blood samples
on this clothing.

89
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,434
Maybe we'll get lucky

90
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,200
and they won't all
come from you.

91
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,100
Still hazy on the details?

92
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:08,167
Not "hazy" on the details, I...
I don't remember anything.

93
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:08,967
Nothing?

94
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,434
Dr. Legiere knocking over

95
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,967
a tray of instruments
at the morgue.

96
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:16,300
Then... nothing.

97
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,768
That was the day
before yesterday.

98
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,933
I requested a rape kit.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,033
No sign of sexual activity,
forced or otherwise.

100
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,567
Bones, you okay?

101
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,501
Booth, I told you
not to come.

102
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,267
Who's this?

103
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,401
He's FBI.

104
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,100
We're sort of
partners.

105
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,300
Guy flies down from DC?
You're more than sort of.

106
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,534
Yeah, that's great.

107
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,401
You remember
anything?

108
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,200
A tray falling over.

109
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,868
Why can't she remember anything?

110
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,768
Well, it could be
the head injury.

111
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,834
Hairline stress fracture
on my right distal radius.

112
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,334
Concussion, slight fever,
torn earlobe.

113
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,367
I lost one
of my favorite earrings.

114
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:50,300
You're worried
about an earring?

115
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,667
You should really be worried
about losing a whole day.

116
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,134
I know, it's stupid,

117
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,100
but these earrings
were my mother's.

118
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,834
Amnesia caused by any
traumatic event, injury or drug

119
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,933
can erase memories before
the event, not just after.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,434
Great, we'll just wait
for a tox screen.

121
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,033
It's gonna be at least 24 hours.

122
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,267
24 hours?

123
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,734
Well, most of the labs
in the area

124
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,134
were destroyed by the hurricane.

125
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,667
We'll find out what happened.

126
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,401
You just take care of your,
uh, partner.

127
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,534
Another present from the bayou.

128
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:24,367
I keep asking for a baby T
that says "The Big Easy."

129
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,334
Oh, we're all hoping for that.

130
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:29,501
For you, I mean.

131
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,667
Does our funding
allow us

132
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,033
to do Dr. Brennan's
vacation work?

133
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,634
Uh, we're just doing
what the Feds didn't.

134
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,134
It's the yin-yang
of government spending.

135
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,567
So we're sneaking?

136
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,234
That's what makes it fun.

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,000
John Doe 361.

138
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:49,234
Well, bad things happened
to Mr. Doe.

139
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,000
<i>It'll come back, Bones.</i>

140
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,834
<i>You don't know that.</i>

141
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,100
<i>Head injuries are extremely</i>
<i>unpredictable.</i>

142
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,367
I'm just being reassuring.

143
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,734
Brennan.

144
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:02,200
Regarding the X-rays
of John Doe 361.

145
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,534
John Doe 361?

146
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,401
Yes, you sent his X-rays.

147
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,033
I don't remember that.

148
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,434
You don't remember?

149
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,167
What about the X-rays, Zack?

150
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,501
Male, late 40s, mixed race.

151
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,534
Anomalies on his spine,
which I'm looking into,

152
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,868
but the point is, his
death was not accidental.

153
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,367
I sent you the X-rays
of a murder victim?

154
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:22,567
How'd he die?

155
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:23,933
Is that Booth?

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,567
Yes.

157
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:29,100
You're hopping the streetcar
named Desire with Booth?

158
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,834
Oh, I love this.

159
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,868
Obviously, they're working the
murder of John Doe 361 together.

160
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:36,100
Precisely.

161
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,567
How did 361 die?

162
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:40,033
The pelvis
shows crush fractures.

163
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,900
There's also
what appears to be

164
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,134
a bullet hole in the skull,
but there's no exit wound.

165
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,534
Okay, keep working on it.

166
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,834
You don't remember the case?

167
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,334
No. And it's a murder.

168
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,768
God, I'm hungry.

169
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,167
Well, when was
the last time you ate?

170
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:56,667
Oh, my bad.

171
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:58,734
You have amnesia.

172
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:02,134
I think I know a place.

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,601
All right, so what is the last
thing that you do remember?

174
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,367
I told you, Graham:

175
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:10,634
Dr. Legiere knocked over a tray
of surgical instruments.

176
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,300
I want to talk
to Legiere.

177
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,534
We must have been about
to examine John Doe 361.

178
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,100
Dr. Brennan.

179
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,100
I thought
you were leaving today?

180
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,501
Peter, this is my
friend Seeley Booth.

181
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,334
My God, what happened to you?

182
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,033
I'm not certain,
but the...

183
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,501
the bruising
suggests Tuesday night.

184
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,734
After you left here?

185
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,267
I was here Tuesday?

186
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,267
What time?

187
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,234
In at 8:00, left at 9:00.

188
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,634
Don't you remember?

189
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,967
You had dinner
with Sam Potter.

190
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,067
<i>Bones.</i>

191
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:46,167
We have to go back
to the morgue, talk to Sam.

192
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,967
Who's Sam?
He's an orderly.

193
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,933
He practices
voodoo.
Hey, wait up, Bones.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,100
<i>You invited me to dinner.</i>

195
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>Why?</i>

196
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:58,100
You found this in the mouth
of a John Doe.

197
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:02,434
Let me see that.

198
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:05,967
That's voodoo?

199
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:08,033
It's gris-gris bag.
It's a mojo.

200
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,501
This one is meant to silence
the dead so they can't speak.

201
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,634
Well, usually dead people are
pretty much silent on their own.

202
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:14,434
Voodoo embraces the premise

203
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,967
that spirits can speak to us
from beyond the grave.

204
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,033
Voodoo is all about

205
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,334
the balance
of the forces.

206
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,100
That wind, the flood,

207
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,200
this death, it's all
out of balance now.

208
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:28,667
Katrina was Armageddon
for the ones who love balance.

209
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,401
Some think it was Secte Rouge
that brought it on.

210
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,900
What's that,
some kind of a gang?

211
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,567
The ones who follow evil.

212
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,067
Some believe
that they purposely angered

213
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,467
the sirens who sent the flood.

214
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,467
This, this is Secte Rouge.

215
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:41,801
Okay, so that's
literally bad voodoo.

216
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:45,067
It's black gum root.

217
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:47,701
There's only one place
you can find it:

218
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:49,334
a voodoo shop
on Pontchartrain Avenue,

219
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,300
run by Richard Benoit.

220
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:52,534
He's a good man.

221
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,367
Maybe he can help you.

222
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:58,501
Okay, thanks.

223
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,401
Dr. Brennan, a lost day?

224
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,534
Perhaps a spell
was cast on you as well.

225
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:09,601
No disrespect, Sam,
but it's not my religion.

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,100
Come on, Booth.

227
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,434
<i>Voodoo-- who's gonna</i>
<i>believe that stuff?</i>

228
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,967
<i>It's a religion,</i>
<i>no crazier than...</i>

229
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,401
<i>Well, what are you?</i>

230
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,868
Catholic.

231
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,734
They believe in the same
saints you do, in prayer...

232
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,033
What they call spells,
you call miracles.

233
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,167
They have priests.

234
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,900
Yeah, we don't make zombies.

235
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,134
Jesus rose from the dead
after three days.

236
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,933
Brennan.

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,300
Jesus is not
a zombie.

238
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,701
All right? Man.

239
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,401
I shouldn't have
to tell you that.

240
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,567
On John Doe 361,

241
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:46,000
there's a narrowing
of the disc space on L2 and L3.

242
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,634
Congenital?

243
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,033
Unclear.

244
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,501
Extensive injuries
consistent with a body

245
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,334
being thrown around
by a flood.

246
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,300
Cross-reference
what you know so far

247
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,467
with the D-Mort records
of missing Katrina victims.

248
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:58,768
Hey, Brennan.

249
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,900
Why haven't you
come home?

250
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,834
Pretty soon, Ange.

251
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,467
Is Booth there socially?

252
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:05,667
Of course not.

253
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,200
All right, what's going on?

254
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,467
Hey, Bones has
amnesia because

255
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,367
a voodoo murderer
put a spell on her

256
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:11,734
to keep her from solving
the murder of John Doe 361.

257
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,868
That's a huge supposition.

258
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,801
That's fine if you
don't want to tell me.

259
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,701


260
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,667
Ha. Voodoo amnesia.

261
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:20,667
It's a good one.

262
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:21,634
Mm-hmm.

263
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,100
Yeah. It's great.

264
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,534
Brennan's fighting zombies
in New Orleans.

265
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,434
and we're stuck here.

266
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Oh, what's that smell?

267
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,701
I imagine everything
smells in here.

268
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:41,701
Oh...

269
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,100
Please just tell me

270
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,601
that that car

271
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,868
survived Katrina.

272
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:46,933


273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,367
We used it to evacuate.

274
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,900
Did you restore
it yourself,

275
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,401
or did you use, uh, voodoo?

276
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,033
Ah...

277
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,167
An unbeliever.

278
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,434
What can I do for you?

279
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,401
You, uh...

280
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,100
You know what that is?

281
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,401
This is a dark spell.

282
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,067
Forbidden magic,
very strong.

283
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,134
This is Secte Rouge.

284
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,267
I certainly wouldn't make
anything like this.

285
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,100
But you have
the ingredients here.

286
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,900
Well, the individual
ingredients are not malignant.

287
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,734
It is how they are combined

288
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,868
and what intention
they are used for

289
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,401
that makes a spell good or bad.

290
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:22,801
Do you recognize me?

291
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,701
No. Should I?

292
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,501
Anyone else work here?

293
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,967
My daughter, Eva.

294
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,434
What is this about?

295
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,200
We're conducting
an investigation.

296
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,734
Eva!

297
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,434
What kind of investigation?

298
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:37,933
Is it true
that this is the only place

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,768
a person can buy black gum root?

300
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:44,567
Yes. Most places like this
are all gone now.

301
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,868
It's not a coincidence.

302
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:55,734
Yes, Daddy?

303
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,234
Have you ever seen
this lady before?

304
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,501
No. Why?

305
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:00,567
We need to know

306
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,734
who's bought this lately?

307
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:04,401
Don't they need a warrant?

308
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,667
Eva will pull up what
you need on the computer.

309
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:08,200
Eva...

310
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,734
What you said before.

311
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,334
What'd you mean
it's just a coincidence?

312
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,434
Most places like this

313
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:19,000
where a houngan, a priest,
can get what he needs--

314
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,501
they are all gone now.

315
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,134
Because of the hurricane
and flood.

316
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,334
Which occurred because
of a lack of balance.

317
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,801
Mr. Benoit,

318
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:29,033
are you suggesting
that Secte Rouge

319
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,567
somehow conjured up a hurricane?

320
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:31,768
Secte Rouge
voodoo

321
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,534
is much more powerful than ours.

322
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,768
No, Eva.
Not more powerful.

323
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:39,200
Destruction is easier
than harmony, but not

324
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,834
more powerful.

325
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,868
There are a lot of
misunderstandings about voodoo.

326
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,667
Yeah, I know
that whole zombie stuff

327
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:47,467
puts a crimp
in your public relations, I bet.

328
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,100
These are the people who bought

329
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:52,933
black gum root
in the past month.

330
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,100
Graham Legiere,
the medical examiner.

331
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,567
<i>I tried to get</i>
<i>in touch with him.</i>

332
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,000
<i>He was scheduled to be</i>
<i>out in the field this week.</i>

333
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,033
Graham?

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,434
It's Temperance.

335
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,167
What if he's not here?

336
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,367
He's probably asleep.
He's been working nights.

337
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:14,534
Graham!

338
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,434
Graham?

339
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:18,534
Cracker.

340
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,200
Hey, that's
not funny.

341
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,134
I think he invited me
to dinner that night,

342
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,033
or drinks.
Can't remember.

343
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,033
Mm-hmm.

344
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,067
You know what?

345
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:27,067
Maybe he roofied you.

346
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,267
I'm sure he bought
the black gum root

347
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,967
to look into its
medicinal qualities.

348
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:34,467
Yeah, because we all know
how effective that is.

349
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,567
Voodoo healing
is quite effective.

350
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:39,334
No crazier than acupuncture

351
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:40,367
or exorcism.

352
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,900
Hey, hey. Easy on the Catholics.

353
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,567
Okay? Just easy.

354
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:44,667
Bones.

355
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:52,967
There you go again.

356
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,300
Bones!

357
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,234
Please.

358
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,234
Something bad happened here.

359
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,933
They got away.

360
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,501
Oh, yeah.

361
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,601
Something bad.

362
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,534
What exactly
were you doing here?

363
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,733
It's Graham, isn't it?

364
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,034
Tell you what, Dr. Brennan.

365
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,900
I'm going to ask the questions.

366
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,667
Oh, come on, Detective.
She was working with the guy.

367
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,900
How closely?

368
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,367
What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,067
Answer my question, <i>please.</i>

370
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,468
What brought
you here?

371
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,600
Was it a social call? Business?

372
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,134
Revenge killing?

373
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,501
Look, Legiere bought
some black gum root

374
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,034
from the voodoo store.

375
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,267
We just stopped by to ask why.

376
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,134
Why?

377
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,633
That's what we came here to ask.

378
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,401
You want to look behind me
and remind yourselves

379
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:17,267
why I'm a little low
on sense of humor?

380
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,733
What? That wasn't a joke.

381
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,334
All right, she's
not wisecracking.

382
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,834
She just tends to be
a bit, you know, literal.

383
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,301
Day before yesterday I showed
a voodoo expert a mojo

384
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:28,134
that Graham found lodged
in the mouth of John Doe 361.

385
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,367
This, uh, voodoo
consultation.

386
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,834
Did it occur
before or after amnesia?

387
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,834
The amnesia's real.

388
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,633
Graham purchased

389
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,468
a rare ingredient at a voodoo
shop on Pontchartrain Ave.

390
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:40,733
So Graham made voodoo spells,

391
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,633
shoved them into
corpse's mouths

392
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,501
and pretend to be surprised
when he found them?

393
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,733
What's that?

394
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,501
Split cast, huh?

395
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:49,600
More voodoo, just like
the symbol on the wall.

396
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,501
Bag it as evidence.

397
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:54,234
Secte Rouge?

398
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:56,134
What do you know
about Secte Rouge?

399
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,733
If you're done with us,
Detective, we're going to go.

400
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,733
I'm going to tear

401
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,201
this place apart,

402
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,167
and if I find
one piece of evidence

403
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,867
that ties you to the scene,
I <i>will</i> take you into custody.

404
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,633
Do you really think someone
could go into a trance,

405
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,267
commit a murder like that
and not remember it?

406
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,967
No, I don't.

407
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,834
But I sure as hell think
someone can fake amnesia.

408
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,534
That's great.
Thank you, Detective.

409
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,568
These files are everything
you and Graham

410
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:22,800
worked on the day
before yesterday.

411
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,234
James,

412
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,267
meet Agent
Seely Booth.

413
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,568
Dr. Embry is

414
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,468
Graham's second in command.

415
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,834
Condolences on your
sudden promotion.

416
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,301
Um... um...

417
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,067
How do you think
the job had anything to do

418
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:36,834
with Graham being killed?

419
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,434
Bones has voodoo amnesia;
Legiere is voodoo-dead;

420
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:43,101
and the last thing they worked
on together was a voodoo

421
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,800
ritual murder,
so I'm thinking

422
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:46,501
there might be some kind
of a connection.

423
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:47,834
Legiere's body--

424
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,834
is it, uh, bad as they say?

425
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,667
How bad are they saying it is?

426
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,568
No matter how bad they're saying
it is, it's worse.

427
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:59,534
I just want to mentally
prepare myself.

428
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,468
I-I start his autopsy
in a few minutes.

429
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:05,468
The file I need is John Doe 361.

430
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,733
According to the records,
these are the only cases

431
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,700
you worked on
the day before yesterday.

432
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,534
Four sets of remains,
two were easy IDs,

433
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,101
drown victims processed
and booted for burial.

434
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:17,900
The other two were both males,
John Does 349 and 350.

435
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:20,633
I sent 361's X-rays
to the Smithsonian.

436
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,401
Well, I'll check again.

437
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,733
Can I make a lifestyle
suggestion here?

438
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,301
Go ahead.

439
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,401
You know, "vacation"--
it's from the Latin, <i>vacatio.</i>

440
00:18:32,468 --> 00:18:34,034
It means "freedom"
or "release."

441
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:36,401
You might want to
consider that next time.

442
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,633
Learning Latin?

443
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,967
This is the opposite
of vacation.

444
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:42,667
I mean, the one
that you snapped,

445
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,201
went insane and totally
lost your mind.

446
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:45,867
Oh, thanks
for your understanding.

447
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,067
Uh, Dr. Brennan.

448
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,667
There's no John Doe 361.

449
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,401
Then whose X-rays
did I send to DC?

450
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:53,434
No, I mean the file is gone.

451
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,167
Oh... Okay. I'll hold that.

452
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:04,667
Zack Addy.

453
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:08,101
Zack, it's me. Anything
else on John Doe 361?

454
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,134
Yes, Dr. Brennan,
we found some damage

455
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:12,600
to the pubic bone,
some kind of strike marks.

456
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:15,800
Did you get Angela to
reconstruct the pattern?

457
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:17,867
Yeah. Hi, sweetie. I'm here.

458
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:20,867
I tried to make a digital
positive, but it didn't work.

459
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:21,967
Why?

460
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:23,667
It was voodoo, probably.

461
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,534
The extrapolation protocols
can't resolve

462
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
the gradient fluxes
in the bone shadings.

463
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,534
What's that?

464
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,267
That's mumbo jumbo.

465
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,434
It's scientific voodoo.

466
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,667
Can you do
them manually?

467
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:32,700
Off an X-ray?

468
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,234
Mm... not really.

469
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,967
Can you send the
actual remains?

470
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,301
They don't exist.

471
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:38,468
That makes no sense.

472
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:39,967
It was probably voodoo.

473
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,067
Voodoo?

474
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,800
Okay, quit saying "voodoo."

475
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,201
Yeah, because, you know

476
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,700
it's not a factor.

477
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,034
Okay, let me know
what you find. Bye.

478
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,234
How do we know
this is not the guy

479
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,067
shoving mojo bags
into dead people?

480
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,401
Those spells are the work
of a sorcerer.

481
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,667
Priests-- houngans--
can make healing motions mojoes,

482
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,067
but I'm not allowed.

483
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:59,700
But snake shaking-- that's fine?

484
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,900
The snake pulls the evil
out of the soul,

485
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,301
freeing the spirit...

486
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,201
I must do
what small things I can.

487
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,468
The floods washed away too much
of what was good.

488
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,534
Hey, Bones,

489
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,767
how's about while
you're a murder suspect,

490
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,101
you, uh, act
more like a normal
woman and less

491
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,267
like Lily Munster, okay?

492
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,468
Bye. Good snake.
Bye-bye.

493
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:21,000
You know,
call me crazy,

494
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,700
but I'm suspicious
of snake man.

495
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,434
Oh! That's because
you've been inculcated

496
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,967
by the mainstream culture's

497
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,800
prevailing
Judeo-Christian tradition

498
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:31,967
into instinctive skepticism
of alternative mores.

499
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah. Thanks
for that explanation.

500
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,301
I've been over every inch
of these X-rays.

501
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,667
Me, too.

502
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,633
There's evidence
of particles on the bones,

503
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,568
but there is no way
for me to know what they are.

504
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,101
Probably dirt.

505
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,468
Yes, thank you, Zack,
but dirt is a meaningless word.

506
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:52,101
It's as non-specific
as saying air.

507
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,767
You can't see air
on an X-ray.

508
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:54,934
What?

509
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,468
I never said you could.

510
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:58,034
What? I'm not even talking
about air.

511
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,633
You can see a space
where air might be,

512
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,267
like a cavity, but
not the air itself.

513
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:07,267
What I'm saying is that, yes,
there are flecks on the X-ray

514
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,167
that might be dirt,
but that doesn't

515
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,733
tell us anything.

516
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,434
Is it sandy, hmm?
Silty, humusy?

517
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,667
Is it clay?
Is it more organic than mineral?

518
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,700
Is it soil?
Is it pulverized gravel?

519
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:18,867
What minerals are in it?

520
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,834
Are the minerals crystalline?

521
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,600
See, these are all details
a person cannot get off an X-ray

522
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,034
no matter how long
he stares at it.

523
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:28,401
Sometimes a person
should look for things
that <i>aren't</i> there

524
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:29,934
instead of things
that are there.

525
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,034
You mean me?
In dirt?

526
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,733
No. Me.

527
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,167
On the X-ray.

528
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,034
I've been looking for anomalies
which exist

529
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:39,067
instead of anomalies
which don't exist.

530
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:41,468
Zack, if you are ever going

531
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,834
to successfully mimic
being human,

532
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
you have to stop
making everything about you,

533
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,534
and feign interest
in the other guy.

534
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,834
Zack!

535
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,301
I've noticed that you try
to look taller.

536
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:54,101
When?

537
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,367
Around Dr. Brennan.

538
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,301
I do not.

539
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,767
And Angela, because
they are both taller than you.

540
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,667
You know what?
I take it back.

541
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,934
Don't take any interest
in the other guy.

542
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thank you for your help.

543
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,967
<i>So, do you remember anything</i>
<i>else that could help us out?</i>

544
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,434
It could have been me.

545
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,800
You remember that?

546
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,568
Look at it
objectively.

547
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:22,267
Graham Legiere was killed
between 11:00 P.M Tuesday

548
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,534
and 3:00 A.M. Wednesday.

549
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,767
Not only do I not

550
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,800
have an alibi, I...

551
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:32,967
I can't even explain to <i>myself</i>
where I was.

552
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:34,434
It could have been me.

553
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,667


554
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:36,967
No, it couldn't.

555
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:38,401
Yes... Wha...?
How do you know?

556
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:39,800
I just know, okay?

557
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,201
I'd bet
my professional career on it.

558
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,034
I already did.

559
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:43,568
What?

560
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:44,234
Nothing.

561
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:44,834
What did you do?

562
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,867
Bones... stop.

563
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,534
This is the last
time and place

564
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,534
that you want to be
rational, okay?

565
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,967
Let's just be wildly emotional

566
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,534
and assume
that you didn't

567
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,867
psychotically murder
a co-worker

568
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:54,700
who invited you
over for dinner.

569
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:58,401
What's that?
What?

570
00:22:58,468 --> 00:22:59,034
That.

571
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,501
Ew...

572
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:05,034
It's another voodoo dumpling?

573
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,733
It's some kind of flesh.

574
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,934
And these
are seashells.

575
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,468
Leather, I think.

576
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,234
Is that a human tooth?

577
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:16,867
Yes. A canine.

578
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,867


579
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,534
Put down your weapon,
Agent Booth.

580
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,700
Put down your weapon.

581
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:23,800
There's no threat from us.

582
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,501
You're holding a gun on me.

583
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,367
Yeah, well, you know, my finger
here is not on the trigger.

584
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:29,700
It's the best I can do
under the circumstances.

585
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:33,000
Holster your weapons.

586
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:35,767
I'm here to arrest
Dr. Brennan

587
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,468
for the murder
of Graham Legiere.

588
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:38,800
Oh, that's not
going to happen.

589
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.

590
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:40,934
I told you,
Booth.

591
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,633
Bones, please!

592
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,600
Just once in your life
will you be quiet?

593
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,134
That's good
advice

594
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:47,967
because everything you say
can and will be

595
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,234
held against you
in a court of law.

596
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:50,600
What is that?

597
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,367
It's, uh... I found it
on my pillow.

598
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:53,600
Bones!

599
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,867
Thank you,
Dr. Brennan.

600
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,667
What's the probable cause?

601
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,568
Traces of Dr. Brennan's blood
in Legiere's home,

602
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,434
Legiere's blood on her clothing.

603
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,434
From the clinic.
Is that it?

604
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:06,667
All I'm prepared to share
with the federal government.

605
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,201
Now, please,

606
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:09,767
step away from my collar.

607
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,733
I'm afraid I can't
let that happen.

608
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,900
Bones! Geez!

609
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,501
It's better if nobody else dies

610
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:16,101
while we get
to the bottom of this.

611
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,534
Uh! Well, you
know what?

612
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,534
I wasn't planning
on dying.

613
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:21,201
Ow! It's not you
I worry about.

614
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:22,633
Ow!

615
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,201
You're welcome to the room.
It's paid for.

616
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:46,434
Were you sleeping
with Graham Legiere?

617
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,900
I don't...
I don't think so.

618
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,301
You don't think so?

619
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,201
I don't remember

620
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:54,167
sleeping with him,
and at the clinic,

621
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,900
they said there was no sign
of sexual activity.

622
00:24:58,007 --> 00:24:59,607
I hope you kept
your mouth shut.

623
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:01,274
Okay, Temperance Brennan,
Carolyn Julian.

624
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,074
She's your lawyer.
She's from the US
Attorney's office.

625
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,507
She's the best
there is.

626
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:07,208
You found a prosecutor
to defend her?

627
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:09,107
Interesting
tactic.

628
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,208
I've told Detective Harding
everything I know so far.

629
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,274
She's a fool? You didn't
tell me she's a fool.

630
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,241
No, she's a brilliant
forensic anthropologist.

631
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:16,308
Well, I have three degrees.

632
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:17,941
I've pioneered research in...

633
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,208
What's that?

634
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,707
A gris-gris bag.

635
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:22,941
I found it in
my hotel... room...

636
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,674
I'm assuming the person who left
it there is trying to frame me,

637
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,407
so the tooth is
probably Graham's.

638
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:30,407
Three degrees
and still a fool.

639
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:32,340
This interview is over, Rose.

640
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,241
I need to speak
with my client alone

641
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:36,473
before she gives herself
a lethal injection.

642
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,807
Of course.

643
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:39,141
Of course.

644
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,740
It's nice seeing
you again, Carolyn.

645
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,074
Okay, Bones,
what the hell

646
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,107
were you talking
to her for?

647
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:45,941
I was just trying to help.

648
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,740
You sew those lips
together, girl,

649
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:49,540
because there is
no such thing as helping

650
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:50,907
the New Orleans police.

651
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:52,308
They just want
to close the case

652
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:54,574
as quickly and easily
as they can,

653
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,407
and you are making it
Christmastime for them.

654
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,007
Okay, listen,
there's no way

655
00:25:58,074 --> 00:25:59,308
that Bones could have
killed Legiere.

656
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:00,174
I mean, it's
just not her.

657
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:01,707
I mean, look at her.

658
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:04,208
I am doing you a favor
taking this case, Booth.

659
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:05,407
But as the
lady cop says,

660
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:07,507
I'm a prosecutor.

661
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:11,607
And as it stands now,
I could try this case in my PJs

662
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,308
and still
get a conviction.

663
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,241
Well, shouldn't you get to know
your clients

664
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,974
before you make snap judgments?

665
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,373
Bones...

666
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,308
Fine. Stop me when I
get something wrong.

667
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,674
Trained in three types
of martial arts,

668
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,640
two assault charges,

669
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:28,241
registered marksman
with the NRA,

670
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:29,640
hunting licenses
in four states...

671
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:30,340
You hunt?

672
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:31,274
Only for food.

673
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,707
Shot an unarmed man.

674
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,807
He was trying
to set me on fire.

675
00:26:34,874 --> 00:26:36,274
All right,
just...

676
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,141
just arrange bail for us,
Carolyn,

677
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,941
so we can get
out of here.
Sure, sure.

678
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,473
Don't want to get this one
mad at me.

679
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,340
Bones, you just couldn't
keep your mouth shut,

680
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,141
could you?

681
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,007
I can identify this guy.

682
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:52,874
You know, Angela isn't
that much taller than me.

683
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,274
Spina bifida.

684
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:55,807
He had a shunt

685
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:57,740
from his brain stem
down to his heart.

686
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:59,841
It was removed
more than a decade ago.

687
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:01,941
We both like Brussels sprouts.

688
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:03,208
You don't like Brussels sprouts.

689
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,774
A man can change, Zack.

690
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,607
<i>What, a human tooth?</i>

691
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:12,807
<i>Yeah, it was</i>

692
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:15,141
some kind of...
some flesh,

693
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,308
some fabric; it looked
like some kind of shell.

694
00:27:17,373 --> 00:27:21,440
Yeah, sounds like
to make you forget.

695
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,141
Somebody
doesn't want you

696
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,241
to know what happened
to John Doe 361.

697
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:26,208
Booth, I'm not under a spell.

698
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:27,841
Well, you forgot a whole day.

699
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,640
The spirits
don't need you

700
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:31,407
to believe in them, Dr. Brennan;
they believe in you.

701
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,907
See you back at work, huh?

702
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,440
How'd I get away?

703
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:43,340
You know, Graham got killed.
I got away.

704
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:45,074
How did I do that?

705
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:47,941
You know, Bones, all those
things that Carolyn mentioned,

706
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:51,941
you know, the martial arts,
the shooting, the assaults...

707
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:53,974
it's just you're just
the type of woman that fights.

708
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,874
Maybe they didn't
expect it.

709
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:58,074
Maybe they thought some kind
of magic could hold you.

710
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,540
I don't believe in magic.

711
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:00,607
Exactly.

712
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:02,274
You're a surprising woman.

713
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,507
Sometimes that's enough
for getting away.

714
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,640
Why are you nice to me?

715
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,540
Because. Because they think
they get away with it.

716
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:14,841
What?

717
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:17,041
They burn their victim.
They blow him up.

718
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:19,407
They toss him in the ocean.
They bury them in the desert.

719
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:21,540
They throw 'em to wood chippers.

720
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:22,707
Sometimes, you know,

721
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:24,274
years go by,
they relax.

722
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,841
Then they start
living their lives

723
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,340
like they didn't
do anything wrong.

724
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:28,941
Like they didn't spend
somebody else's life

725
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,941
in order to get what they got.

726
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,574
They think they're safe from
retribution, but you know...

727
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,941
you make those
bastards unsafe.

728
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,473
That's why I'm nice to you.

729
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,440
I couldn't do that
without you, Booth.

730
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:45,007
Yeah. So, um, you should
be a little nicer to me, huh?

731
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,574
I really should.

732
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,440
I walk in
on something?
Yeah.

733
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:55,574
Beignet and a caf\, <i>cher.</i>

734
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Hospital records.
The tox screen was negative.

735
00:28:59,707 --> 00:29:01,841
What? That's impossible.

736
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,540
No rohypnol, no ketamine?

737
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,540
Nothing but a touch of alcohol,
not enough

738
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:07,674
to affect
a baby.

739
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
A jury is never going to believe

740
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,007
this amnesia
story.

741
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:12,308
Well, but it's true.

742
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:14,074
Maybe this is true, too.

743
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:16,174
Legiere tried to rape you.

744
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:17,841
He was a notorious horndog.

745
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:19,774
We claim
self-defense,

746
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,440
cop a plea,
you're out in three years.
No, I don't care

747
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,540
what it looks like, or how
you're reading the evidence,

748
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:25,907
Carolyn,
she didn't do it.

749
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,574
Could be that's
true, Seeley.

750
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,174
You vouch for her,
that's good enough for me.

751
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:32,041
But, <i>cheri,</i> this looks bad.

752
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:34,041
All you've got on your side

753
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,974
is proof you got
roughed up.

754
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,874
These picture from
the clinic, these X-rays.

755
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:41,274
New wrist.

756
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,041
The doctor was wrong.

757
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:45,107
He said this was a
Colles' fracture from a fall.

758
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,274
This break shows
surface trauma

759
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,507
on the outside
of the bone.

760
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,041
This was either defensive,

761
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:51,774
or someone slammed my wrist
into something.

762
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,640
Maybe because you tried to stab
him in the heart with a knife.

763
00:29:54,707 --> 00:29:56,074
No, think
about it.

764
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,841
If I'd already
stabbed the attacker,

765
00:29:57,907 --> 00:29:59,607
he wouldn't have been able
to break my wrist.

766
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:02,774
I like this story.

767
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:03,674
What else?

768
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,507
There's the mojo bag.

769
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:06,373
I mean, someone was trying to
put a forgetting spell on her.

770
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,807
Booth.

771
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,041
Hey, I can work with that.

772
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,841
This is New Orleans, baby.

773
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:11,607
And where's my beignet?

774
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:12,874
Brennan.

775
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,340
John Doe 361 is named
Rene Mouton.

776
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:17,141
How can you be sure?

777
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,640
I looked for something
that wasn't there,

778
00:30:18,707 --> 00:30:20,107
which turned out to be
a shunt channel.

779
00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:21,208
Good work.

780
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:22,807
You understood
that?

781
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:25,308
All Zack had to do was
cross-check with D-Mort.

782
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:27,373
I only thought of it
because of Hodgins.

783
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,308
I can discern particulates
on the X-ray,

784
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:31,007
but I have no way of
telling what they are.

785
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:32,473
Some kind of dirt?

786
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,841
Okay, everybody,
the word "dirt" means

787
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:37,407
nothing here in the lab,
scientifically.

788
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:39,041
Any progress on the design

789
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:41,607
that was pressed
into the pelvic bone?

790
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,373
I've tried three different
computer programs.

791
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,874
I fed in
the information

792
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,308
into multiple
impact scenarios,

793
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:49,340
but this isn't going
to work on X-rays.

794
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:51,707
I need the
actual remains.

795
00:30:51,774 --> 00:30:54,007
Booth and I are looking for them
as hard as we can.

796
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:55,607
Or, better still,
you could forget the whole thing

797
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:56,640
and come home.

798
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,607
Don't worry. I made bail.

799
00:30:58,674 --> 00:30:59,340
Bail?

800
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,274
Bail? For what?

801
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,907
I told you. Don't worry.

802
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:04,807
The murder charge won't stick.

803
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:07,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Murder charge?

804
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,640
Brennan, the next
plane, okay?

805
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,141
The next plane,
or I'm coming
down there

806
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,308
to get you myself.

807
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,407
Everything's fine.

808
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,740
I'm healing up satisfactorily.

809
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:18,107
Bye for now.

810
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:19,241
Healing up?

811
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,174
You know what?

812
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,241
This whole state of affairs

813
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:27,141
where Brennan just runs around
fighting crime?

814
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:30,041
It's stupid. It's nuts.

815
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:31,041
Don't you agree?

816
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,241
Go.

817
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,208
Go. I'll be... fine.

818
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,507
Brennan will be fine,
Angela.

819
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:43,774
She got bail
and the murder charge
won't stick.

820
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,274
What is going on with her?

821
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,674
Angela...

822
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,974
she started to change
the day she met you.

823
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,308
What?
Well, she sees
how you do it.

824
00:31:52,373 --> 00:31:57,507
All fun and involvement
and pizzazz.

825
00:31:57,574 --> 00:31:59,440
Big, you know?

826
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:01,041
Big life.

827
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:04,174
Booth came along
and gave her the
opportunity,

828
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,907
but she got the idea
from you.

829
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:11,007
Brennan wants
a big life like yours.

830
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:16,274
That's how it looks
to me, anyway,

831
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
but what do I know?

832
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:19,874
I'm a bug guy.

833
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,174
Bug and slime.

834
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:24,041
And dirt.

835
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:25,407
Yeah.

836
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:26,740
So...

837
00:32:29,107 --> 00:32:30,041
Okay.

838
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,241
Hmm.

839
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,107
According to Bureau files,

840
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:44,074
Rene Mouton headed up
a small voodoo church.

841
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:46,107
By all accounts,
he was a very good man.

842
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,707
He rescued scores of people
during Katrina.

843
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:51,574
Then he just disappeared.

844
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,174
Some thought he was just
swept away when the levee broke.

845
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,907
Why would anyone
murder him?

846
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,208
You know the chaos,
during the evacuation.

847
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:00,074
Could even have been
for a bottle of water.

848
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:03,640
Or because he was
a priest.

849
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:06,774
The gris-gris box,
the murder of Dr. Legiere,

850
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:09,407
your amnesia--
this is the work of a bokor,

851
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:11,707
a Secte Rouge sorcerer.

852
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:13,974
Rene Mouton
was a houngan,

853
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,141
a powerful and well-loved
priest.

854
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,507
For Secte Rouge to claim
his soul,

855
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:19,141
this would give them influence

856
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,107
on all the people
that he influenced.

857
00:33:20,174 --> 00:33:21,141
Like a chain letter.

858
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,308
Or in the real world,

859
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:23,707
somebody who wanted his shoes.

860
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:25,373
No, Booth, it makes sense.

861
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
What does?

862
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:28,041
Graham and I were on the trail
of a broker...

863
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,473
Bokor.

864
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,841
And he found out,
or Secte Rouge did.

865
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:33,540
All right,
great.

866
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,174
Then we just toss the ring
into the molten river

867
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:36,941
and blah, blah, right?

868
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,740
Look, in the meantime,
somebody here

869
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,507
had the ability
to hide Mouton's body

870
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:41,640
and files.

871
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,907
James Embry.
Me.

872
00:33:43,974 --> 00:33:45,941
Mike Doyle.
Say you wanted to hide
a particular body

873
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,373
and you didn't want
anyone to find out--

874
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,473
where would you put it?

875
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,774
If I wanted to hide a body,

876
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:54,740
I'd change the nametag
on the coffin.

877
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:57,174
Not Mouton, too young.

878
00:33:57,241 --> 00:34:00,208
He's buried and the
evidence is gone forever.

879
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,373
Female. You know,
I find that hard to believe

880
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,574
that horny little Mike Doyle
is a voodoo sorcerer.

881
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,874
Mm-hmm.

882
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:09,174
Me, too.

883
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,707
And he's not alone.

884
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,407
You said to avoid
the police.

885
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,574
Not cooperating is
one thing, Bones, okay?

886
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,507
Concealing a
double homicide?

887
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:22,340
We might as well give them
an excuse to hang us.

888
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:25,491
Dr. Embry says that you
can identify the bag of bones,

889
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:28,157
The skeletal remains belong
to a man named Rene Mouton.

890
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,624
His skull is missing.

891
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,224
Looks to me
like Mike Doyle

892
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,391
was drugged; a spike was driven
through his head

893
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:36,024
during or immediately following
sexual intercourse.

894
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,757
Well, it appears
that Dr. Brennan, Dr. Embry,

895
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:39,658
and Sam Potter here

896
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:41,257
are the three
people who could
have pulled this off.

897
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:42,890
Sam Potter brought us

898
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,890
to the body;
we called <i>you</i> in.

899
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:45,924
Who does that leave?

900
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,324
Oh, please.

901
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:49,857
There's no security
in this place.

902
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,790
Anyone could have gotten
in here.

903
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,324
You said that Mike
was having sex when he died.

904
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,957
James, he must have been killed
by the coffin girl.

905
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:57,291
What?
What's her name?

906
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:58,790
Well, I never got her name.

907
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:00,723
Is there a mojo
in Doyle's mouth?

908
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,291
I don't feel comfortable
releasing that...

909
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:03,157
The girl
is a voodoo sorcerer.

910
00:35:03,224 --> 00:35:04,924
She works for Secte Rouge.

911
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,757
Detective Harding,

912
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:09,024
I know this is, you know,
sounds superstitious, but...

913
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,957
Three ritual murders and a
world-renowned anthropologist,

914
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,658
who can't remember
how she ended up

915
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:15,558
smeared with the blood
of a skinned man,

916
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:17,890
crucified to a wall
with spikes.

917
00:35:17,957 --> 00:35:19,857
Call me superstitious.

918
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,790
Excuse me.

919
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:26,624
May I scatter fwan ginea
over Mr. Mouton?

920
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,291
To purify his remains.
No!

921
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:30,090
No more
of this voodoo crap.

922
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:31,491
I don't want you
contaminating the body.

923
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:32,757
What is it?

924
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:34,757
Ashes from a ritual fire pit.

925
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:38,424
Ashes from a dove's feather,
salt mixed with holy water.

926
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,558
Okay, okay, you know,
we get the idea, just...

927
00:35:40,624 --> 00:35:43,024
It should have no effect
on the bones, Detective Harding.

928
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:46,924
Fine, fine, go ahead.

929
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,757
Whoa! Did you see that?

930
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:03,024
Very interesting phenomenon.

931
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,324
The electrostatic charge of the
particles reacted with the bone.

932
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:09,057
Angela was unable to
recreate that pattern

933
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:11,224
from the X-rays using the
best technology in the world.

934
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,024
Electrostatic, my ass.

935
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,124
That was part of an emblem
of a 1959 Caddy Brougham...

936
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:16,257
Oh, boy.

937
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:17,924
What?
The voodoo shop guy

938
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,723
owns a 1959 Cadillac.

939
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,658
He's got a voodoo daughter.

940
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:25,790
You're taking my Caddy? Why?

941
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:27,357
Why? Because we have reason

942
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:29,224
to believe that your Caddy
was used in the wrongful death

943
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,624
of Rene Mouton.

944
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,524
You think that someone
did a hit-and-run

945
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,723
on Rene Mouton in my Caddy?
Yes.

946
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,391
Mr. Benoit, does your daughter
have a boyfriend?

947
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:38,024
Yeah!

948
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,591
This him?

949
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,257
Mike Doyle.

950
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:44,924
Yeah. Why?
We need to speak

951
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,090
to your daughter...

952
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:47,090
by which I mean
Detective Harding

953
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:47,957
needs to speak
to your daughter.

954
00:36:48,024 --> 00:36:49,990
I don't know where she is.

955
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:51,558
Mr. Benoit, right now,
she's a suspect

956
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:53,157
in the murder of Mike Doyle.

957
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,658
Why would Eva
kill her boyfriend?

958
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,257
It's hard to explain.

959
00:36:57,324 --> 00:36:58,291
She was involved

960
00:36:58,357 --> 00:36:59,658
in a hit-and-run.

961
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:01,291
When the body surfaced
at the morgue,

962
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:02,857
she asked her boyfriend
to help her hide it.

963
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:04,723
He refused, so she killed him.

964
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,723
Also, she's a member
of Secte Rouge.

965
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,024
No, no, no.

966
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,658
I bet there are
drugs in this shop

967
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:12,757
that could knock me
out, make me forget.

968
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:24,624
Eva is downstairs, praying.

969
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:33,658
Eva?

970
00:37:33,723 --> 00:37:35,524
Eva, open the door.

971
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:40,391
No!

972
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:42,690
Eva.

973
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,257
Booth.

974
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,823
Could that be
Mouton's skull?
Yes.

975
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,990
And this could be the spike

976
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:05,757
that she used on Mouton
and Mike Doyle.

977
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,591
This is the lair of bokor,

978
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:13,524
someone who can call
the dark spirits.

979
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,090
This is used for ritual

980
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:16,890
animal sacrifice.

981
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,690
It was heated to red-hot first,

982
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:21,157
to cauterize the wound
so it wouldn't bleed.

983
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:23,124
What, she killed herself
because she knew we were coming?

984
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:26,090
No, no, not my Eva.

985
00:38:26,157 --> 00:38:27,757
She drove the spike
through her sternum?

986
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:29,291
Sternum, heart.

987
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,024
Through the chest cavity,
through the spine.

988
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,024
Can I open this?

989
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,924
What?

990
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,957
This one holds the soul
of Mr. Rene Mouton.

991
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,658
I believe this one
holds the soul of the bokor.

992
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:39,524
Why don't you just shut up?

993
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:40,690
I would like to release
Mr. Mouton's soul,

994
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,690
so no other bokor
can use it.

995
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:44,491
No, it's evidence.
Don't touch it.

996
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:47,391
I raised my Eva to be a houngan,
a healer.

997
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:49,624
How could this happen
right underneath my nose?

998
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,823
Rebellious adolescent?

999
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,057
Do you remember how much

1000
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,658
of this spike was protruding

1001
00:38:53,723 --> 00:38:55,391
through her back
when we first came in?

1002
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:57,157
Six, eight inches.

1003
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:59,157
Would the fact that the spike
was red-hot

1004
00:38:59,224 --> 00:39:00,990
cause it to go through the body
more easily?

1005
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:02,857
No. It might even
make it harder.

1006
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:09,357
Eva Benoit
did not commit suicide.

1007
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:11,424
Based on what?

1008
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:12,890
This room isn't
even 12 feet wide.

1009
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:14,391
Even if she ran

1010
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:16,457
at full speed
and her aim was perfect,

1011
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,357
no way the spike
would go through her spine,

1012
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:20,624
unless she was pushed onto it.

1013
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,790
He is the sorcerer.

1014
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:29,090
He believes he can bring her
back to life.

1015
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:34,291
Okay, everyone,
just simmer down, okay?

1016
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:36,257
You're saying that he murdered
his daughter

1017
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:37,890
thinking that he could bring her
back to life?

1018
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,957
You find her dead, you stop
looking for Mouton's murderer.

1019
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:41,057
An inch or two

1020
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:42,391
to the left or right,

1021
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:44,157
we would have never
known it was murder.

1022
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:46,124
It had to have been hard
pushing her onto the spike,

1023
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:48,491
especially if she
were resisting.

1024
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:50,790
You'd have some
wounds of your own.

1025
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:55,790
There's your killer.

1026
00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:00,857
I'd really like to go home now.

1027
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:03,291
Yeah, me, too-- all right,
my advice, cuff Mr. Wizard here,

1028
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:04,790
before he puts a spell on you.

1029
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:06,591
What, no written confession?

1030
00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:08,090
You want a confession?

1031
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,324
Threaten to release
his daughter's soul,

1032
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:10,591
he'll tell you everything.

1033
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,291
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

1034
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,424
You leave here, you go home,
it does not matter.

1035
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:16,191
There are powers,

1036
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,857
dark powers
to which distance

1037
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:21,524
makes no difference.

1038
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,090
Easy, buddy.

1039
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:33,723
I've noticed that very
few people are scary

1040
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,191
once they've been
poked in the eye.

1041
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,424
Whew!

1042
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:43,790
<i>I got in the middle of a battle</i>
<i>between two religious sects.</i>

1043
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:46,558
Benoit used Hurricane Katrina
as a diversion

1044
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:49,558
to take the soul
of a voodoo priest.

1045
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:51,291
And he killed
his own daughter.

1046
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:53,391
Dark sorcerers
suck, man.

1047
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,723
Oh, but you know,
he intended to bring
her back to life.

1048
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,124
There's not really
any such thing

1049
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:58,790
as spells and magic.

1050
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,558
What are you talking about?

1051
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,823
They put a forgetting hex
on Dr. Brennan.

1052
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,690
It wasn't the spell

1053
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:06,157
that made me forget;
it was the drugs-- rohypnol.

1054
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:07,723
Blood test
didn't find any.

1055
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,024
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate?
Not a trace.

1056
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,090
Sodium petathol?
Nope.

1057
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:14,090
Severe emotional trauma.

1058
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:15,757
Honey, even I think

1059
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:17,124
you're too strong-minded
for that.

1060
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,857
There were
too many delays

1061
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:20,391
in doing my blood test--
that, plus the adrenaline

1062
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:24,157
of my escape,
the drugs were out of my system.

1063
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,790
They put the voodoo
on you, baby.

1064
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,191
I didn't really mean
to call you "baby."

1065
00:41:31,257 --> 00:41:32,658
You guys, stop.

1066
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,057
Now. I mean it.

1067
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:36,890
You do believe
in voodoo?

1068
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,391
Because even if a small part
of you believes in it,

1069
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,823
then it has a grip.

1070
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,257
I do not believe.

1071
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,790
Maybe just a little?

1072
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:44,391
No.
Good, because,
you know,

1073
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:46,624
if you have any doubts,
we'll just have Benoit

1074
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,990
send you back one of those
little satanic mojo pouches

1075
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:49,391
from prison.

1076
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:51,457
Booth, objects have
no intrinsic power.

1077
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:53,957
A person's future
does not depend

1078
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:56,324
on some thing.

1079
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,990
Things are just things.

1080
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,591
They do not have magical meaning
or powers.

1081
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,957
Where'd you get that?

1082
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,090
What does it matter?

1083
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:10,658
It's just a thing.

1084
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:11,990
Right?

1085
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:13,723
My mother's earring.

1086
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,690
No, uh...

1087
00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:16,191
magical power

1088
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:19,990
over your future.

1089
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:22,723
Does that prove something?

1090
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:27,624
Yeah.

1091
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,024
It proves something.

1092
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,924
