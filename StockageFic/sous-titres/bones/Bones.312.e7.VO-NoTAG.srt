1
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:05,561
What do you know about
the Cayman Islands?

2
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:07,390
Great diving, lots of sea turtles.

3
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:09,332
- Why, are you going?
- No, my accountant

4
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:11,658
wants me to set up a tax shelter there.
- Tax shelter?

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,141
Exactly how loaded are you?

6
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,062
Well, that is an offensive
way to phrase a question.

7
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,848
I'm quite loaded. I'm betting on...

8
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:21,521
a seven-figure advance for my next book.

9
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,430
Seven figures, wow.

10
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,107
Without the decimal point?

11
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,515
The publishers make considerably more.

12
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:31,215
What's the first of those seven figures?

13
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,239
A prime number.
What do you do with your money?

14
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:34,840
I use it for food and rent.

15
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:45,509
What do we got here?

16
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,619
- You Agent Booth?
- Special Agent, how you doing?

17
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,420
- Sheriff Delpy.
- This is my partner.

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,686
I can introduce myself.
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

19
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,239
- Somebody ran the car off the road.
- Gravel makes it impossible

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,188
to get an traceable tire marks.

21
00:00:57,994 --> 00:01:01,240
The victim was doused with
gasoline and then set on fire.

22
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:04,432
Farmer three miles away
saw the smoke, called it in.

23
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:06,060
It's female,

24
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,608
probably in her early 20s.

25
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,492
Preauricular sulcus on the iliac.

26
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,223
She's given birth.

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,772
Ran off the side of the road,
set on fire.

28
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:19,541
Somebody wanted her dead.

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,983
That's why I need your help.

30
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,614
I've only got six deputies
covering 400 square miles.

31
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,075
We're stretched thinner
than plastic wrap.

32
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:29,197
Compound fractures to the
right tibia and fibula,

33
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,051
crushed menubrium, massive skull trauma.

34
00:01:33,722 --> 00:01:37,542
I'm not certain yet whether she died
in the accident or the fire.

35
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:40,559
You hear that?

36
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:45,120
Everybody, keep quiet! Stop working!

37
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,209
- Did you hear that?
- It sounds like a cat.

38
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,281
It's a baby.

39
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:01,609
Holy crap!

40
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,286
Get a ladder down here now!

41
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:08,908
- There's not even a scratch on the boy.
- It's a miracle.

42
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:12,911
Hardly. Car seats are specifically
engineered to protect the child from...

43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,260
From what, flying out of the back
of the car and landing in a tree?

44
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:20,004
Oh, look at him, Bones.
He looks a little fussy there.

45
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:22,168
Why don't you pick him up
and give him a cuddle?

46
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,211
Just because I have breasts doesn't
mean I have magical powers over infants.

47
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,657
- You're the one with a son.
- All right, fine. I'll take him.

48
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,318
Here you go. You can have fun with
the diaper bag. You look good.

49
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,023
Come on, little man.

50
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:33,771
Hi.

51
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,646
Why don't you say hi to
your grumpy old Auntie Bones?

52
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:39,183
I am not grumpy.

53
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,802
The, the vinyl

54
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,359
seat melted
and fused to the body,

55
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,480
so we need that brought
back to the Jeffersonian,

56
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,073
and the driver's door
for particulate evidence.

57
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,261
Kid smells a little ripe.

58
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,868
Might want to take care of that.

59
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,482
Bones, I'm gonna have to change him.
Just hold onto to him here.

60
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:59,423
Got him? Okay.

61
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,328
All right, here we go.

62
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,237
We'll work together on this one.

63
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,105
Changing Diapers 101, Bones.

64
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,836
Here we go, little big man.

65
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,458
Okay, watch your head.

66
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,876
We'll put you down right here.
Look at that! All right.

67
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:14,164
Give me a diaper there, Bones.

68
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,846
- All right. Here you go.
- Thanks.

69
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:16,928
Baby powder.

70
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,957
You know, Booth, I have better
things to do with my time...

71
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:23,030
- There's no powder.
- No powder?

72
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:25,443
Yeah. Hey, wait a minute.

73
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,333
- Where'd that come from?
- There's a rip in the ling of the bag.

74
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,396
Seems like someone's trying to hide it.

75
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:37,788
I'll get an evidence bag and I'll ask
EMT if they have any baby powder.

76
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,383
- Just watch him.
- Wait, wait.

77
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,197
Booth, there's a baby.
I don't feel comforta...

78
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,077
Coochie-coo.

79
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:50,247
No, no, no need to fuss.

80
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,033
Obviously, something's upsetting you.

81
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,230
- Children have toys.
- You must have some.

82
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:55,366
Let's see.

83
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,147
Elephants are not purple. This is wrong.

84
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,692
Hey, look at that. He flipped over.

85
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:07,080
Bones, that's because you got
to watch him! Geez! Okay, whoa!

86
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,974
All right, okay, look, little big man,
if you're gonna be in my jacket,

87
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,814
we got to get you out of
that dirty diaper. Oh, whew!

88
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,259
Okay, where's the key?

89
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,914
I put it on your jacket.

90
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,821
Next to the baby?

91
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:18,778
Yeah.

92
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:22,187
Are you crazy? Do you know that babies
put everything in their mouth, Bones?

93
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:24,729
He could swallow the key.
It's so dangerous!

94
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,660
All right, look, okay, shh-shh.

95
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,435
Oh, look. Okay, look.

96
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,042
Key, Bones, look for the key.

97
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,076
It's not here.

98
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:34,289
Oh, no, he must have...

99
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:35,692
... swallowed it.

100
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,336
Okay, here you go.

101
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,374
- Get used to him.
- What do you mean?

102
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,663
That key was evidence.

103
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:44,464
You know how chain of custody works.

104
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:46,585
That kid stays with us
till we get the key back.

105
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,380
That's a stream.

110
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:28,577
I've never seen anything so
gorgeous on this table before.

111
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,125
Or so alive.

112
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,328
Why is Dr. Brennan
the official custodian?

113
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,427
She's registered as a foster parent.

114
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,719
Russ asked her to do it after
he began his prison term.

115
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,695
Russ wants to make sure his
stepdaughters are taken care of

116
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,480
if anything happens to Amy.

117
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,049
Prodigious saliva production.

118
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,059
Okay, now if we can determine
if the little guy

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,015
really did swallow a key or
if he has been falsely accused.

120
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:54,681
Well, unless

121
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,775
he's already had a hip replacement,
sounds like there's a key in there.

122
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,637
He liked it. Do it again.

123
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,651
What are you doing?

124
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,501
We're just...

125
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:09,419
We verified that the baby
did indeed swallow the key.

126
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,919
Then you should X-ray him
to get a clear view of it.

127
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:13,607
He's not a plaything.

128
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:16,079
And you're supposed
to be examing the victim.

129
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:17,825
We thought it would be bad for him

130
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,881
to examine the remains
in front of the baby.

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,677
You know, creepy formative memory.

132
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,798
Then would you mind taking him
for a little while so that we can work?

133
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:25,826
I'd love to.

134
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:32,686
Get used to it.

135
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,785
I want, like, a million of these.

136
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:35,964
Cool.

137
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,618
What do you think she meant
by "a million"? Two?

138
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:47,492
Agent Booth?

139
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:49,272
- Yeah?
- Got a hit on your burned car.

140
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:50,949
It was registered to a dead guy.

141
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,254
Dead woman driving a dead man's car.

142
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,093
Plates expired five years ago.

143
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:57,527
Dead guy's family said
they sold the car for scrap

144
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:00,114
at a junkyard in
Seneca Rocks, West Virginia.

145
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:03,100
Let me guess. Junkyard guy sells off

146
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:05,374
the old heaps to people
who want to get off the grid?

147
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,317
He used to.

148
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,925
Operation got shut down two years ago.
No one's seen him since.

149
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:12,512
Let me know if Forensics finds anything
to help Bones ID the remains.

150
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,840
Is it true that Dr. Brennan's
taking care of the baby?

151
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,934
Because that's something I'd pay to see.

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,492
Good-bye, Charlie.

153
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,495
The victim exhibits enlarged
hypertrophic lesions

154
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:28,284
at multiple muscle attachments.

155
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,228
The result of strenuous activity,
most likely occupational.

156
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,208
Ligamenta flava shows
evidence of whiplash.

157
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,319
All the perimortem injuries are
consistent with vehicular trauma.

158
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:40,213
She was dead prior to immolation.

159
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:43,882
Zack, grind some bones so Hodgins
can perform an isotope analysis.

160
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:45,885
We might be able to
figure out where she lived.

161
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:48,909
Junior made us a little present.

162
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,430
The key, finally.

163
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,375
Not yet.

164
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:53,504
This is just the usual present, but

165
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,977
with one major difference.

166
00:07:57,205 --> 00:08:00,050
I assume pink isn't a normal
color for this type of thing.

167
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:01,856
Does yours ever look pink?

168
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,798
No, but I'm not an infant.

169
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:06,189
- Where's the baby?
- A sleep in your office.

170
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,266
I was gonna start the facial
reconstruction

171
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,122
He's my charge. I'll sit with him.

172
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,818
Let me run some tests.

173
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,874
- See what I can find.
- Actually,

174
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:18,007
one time when I was visiting
my cousins, we ate a lot of beets,

175
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,862
- and the next day...
- Zack, really,

176
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,647
too much sharing.

177
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,386
You know, you look very mom
like with that baby monitor.

178
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,146
I have responsibilities under
state law as a foster parent.

179
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,569
I already bought him toys and clothes.

180
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,383
- Ah, so you bought him some clothes.
- I sent an intern who

181
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,535
apparently loves bears which,
in reality, would devour a small child.

182
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,385
I tested the ground bone for strontium.

183
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:41,896
Strontium is an element
found in most rocks.

184
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,746
Human beings absorb it through

185
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,131
the consumption of
local vegetation and water.

186
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,625
Over time, the isotope collects
in the bones, meaning...

187
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,854
You can use it to figure out
where someone's from.

188
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:55,504
That is right, people:
I am a constant surprise.

189
00:08:58,863 --> 00:08:59,999
I don't understand.

190
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,764
He's been fed; he's changed;
I patted him;

191
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,230
and now he's just complaing.

192
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,126
He's acting like a real baby.

193
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,435
The victim was from
northern West Virginia.

194
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,706
Tucker County, to be more precise.

195
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,278
Are you sure she's from Tucker county?
The crash was in Pendleton.

196
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:14,229
Very sure.

197
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,779
Particulate matter collected
from the salvaged area of the car

198
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:20,440
contained guano from a corynorhinus
townsendii viginianus.

199
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,185
So we know where to look.

200
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:26,665
- Are you gonna go?
- No, I figured you'd get him.

201
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:28,830
Don't you have a responsibility
under state law?

202
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,760
- But you're the baby daddy.
- Baby daddy?

203
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:33,438
You have prior experience
with preverbal infancy.

204
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,817
- You can be the daddy mommy.
- OK, you two better get

205
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,212
your act together or
I'm suing for custody.

206
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,781
This is my rendering of the victim.

207
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,139
There are numerous genetic similarities.

208
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:52,479
Cam's running DNA tests to be sure,
but I'm comfortable with the assessment

209
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:54,482
that this was the child's mother.

210
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:58,498
It misses its mother.

211
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,340
He's sad.

212
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:16,855
We need to go to Tucker County.

213
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,272
Last coal mine closed
about eight years ago.

214
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,589
- This place is a ghost town.
- The local economy is devastated.

215
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,990
That could be why our victim
was driving a junker.

216
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,716
She couldn't afford the
registration, insurance.

217
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,346
I don't want to sound insensitive here,
but I'm telling you, real estate,

218
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:37,005
it's gotta be a steal.

219
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,609
I mean, I mean you could build
yourself a beautiful house on the river.

220
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:42,750
I could come out and fish.

221
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,830
You could put in one
of those media rooms.

222
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,275
You know, I saw a 103-inch
flat-screen TV...

223
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:49,351
I don't need another residence, Booth.

224
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:54,070
Just, you know, trying to give you
a little financial advice. That's all.

225
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,082
He seems so peaceful.

226
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,911
He has no idea that he's all alone.

227
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:01,721
Maybe that wasn't his mom.

228
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,092
Maybe there's a dad.

229
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,265
No one filed a report, Booth.

230
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,875
No one's worried about him.

231
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,371
Well, you are.

232
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,661
There's someone.

233
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:20,104
- You people are from the government?
- Yes, sir, with the FBI.

234
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:22,901
You're traing 'em young, I see.

235
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,264
If you could just help us.

236
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,378
Right, just like the government
helped us

237
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,218
when the bridge washed out,
when they closed the school.

238
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:32,835
Well, the business and
industry have left the area.

239
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:34,841
The local tax base is nonexistent.

240
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,697
The government can't be expected
to provide services without

241
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,550
the fiscal means to do so.

242
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:42,043
What'd she say? Are you
from France or somewhere?

243
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,438
Economies live and die
just like any organism.

244
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:46,617
When they expire, the logical
thing to do is to move.

245
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,048
This land is part of me.

246
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:49,521
I've lived here all my life.

247
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,314
My father before me, his father!

248
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,834
Paul, who are you hollering at now?

249
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,287
They're from the government.

250
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,162
Oh, my God!

251
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,634
You have no right! No right at all!

252
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,444
Taking people's children away?

253
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,375
You should be ashamed.

254
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:06,400
That girl does the best
she can to provide for Andy.

255
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,790
Andy? Do you know this baby?

256
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:11,376
Yeah, folks up the street,

257
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,310
Carol and Jimmy Grant.

258
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:15,608
They take care of him
when his mama works.

259
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:16,908
Is that his mother?

260
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,117
Looks like her, but you should
check with the Grants.

261
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:22,534
What's going on?

262
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:24,128
Something happen?

263
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,381
Yeah. That's Meg.

264
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,473
Meg Taylor.

265
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:33,428
We all went to high school together,
me and Jimmy and Meg

266
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,978
Meg's husband Lou.

267
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,772
Back when wehada high school.

268
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:38,967
Meg's husband he still live around here?

269
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,297
Well, I haven't seen him lately.

270
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:43,021
Not that I'd want to.

271
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:44,928
He's in and out of jail.

272
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,150
Does anything for a drink. Left,

273
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,052
Meg before Andy was born.

274
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:52,060
I'm not sure he's even laid eyes
on Andy more than twice.

275
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,220
Meg worked herself
to the bone for this boy.

276
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,290
We couldn't have one of our own, so

277
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,230
we were real happy to help Meg out.

278
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,347
Meg would have to

279
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:02,883
pry her away from him
at the end of the day.

280
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,361
- Where did she work?
- Fallbrook Rubber.

281
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:06,691
They recycle tires.

282
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:08,896
They turn them into ground
coverings, you know,

283
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,365
for playgrounds and such.

284
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,949
It's one of the only places
left around here to work.

285
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:15,637
And how about the two of you?
You're both currently, what,

286
00:13:15,854 --> 00:13:17,581
- unemployed?
- No. I...

287
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:21,012
I work part-time looking after some
of the buildings they shut down.

288
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:24,477
Jimmy used to teach high school
and I did some project management,

289
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:27,017
mostly for construction, but now

290
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:28,962
we do what we can.

291
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,101
This town used to be something.

292
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:34,592
We were on the scenic route.
You know, people would come to visit.

293
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:36,422
It wasn't all coal.

294
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,859
What will happen to Andy?
'Cause we can watch him.

295
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,053
He's going to have
to stay with us for now.

296
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,220
Could you tell me where Meg lived?

297
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:46,043
Looks like everything
is closed down around here.

298
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,519
Yeah. Probably lost all its customers.

299
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:51,847
With no bridge, the highway routes
all the traffic away from the town.

300
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:57,171
- Brennan.
- Got the scoop on the poop.

301
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:59,934
It was pharmaceutical dye,
used to color the phenobarbital

302
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,900
that showed up in his tox screen.

303
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,965
Andy had phenobarbital in his system?

304
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,158
Oh, his name's Andy? Adorable.

305
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:11,797
I had a dog named Andy.
That came out wrong.

306
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:14,023
Why does he have
phenobarbital in his system?

307
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:16,162
It's often prescribed for seizures.

308
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,777
Perhaps the infant is epileptic.

309
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,047
Don't say that.

310
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,947
Andy's going to be just fine.

311
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,439
He was still breast-feeding,
so there's a slight chance

312
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:26,602
he ingested the drug that way, but
the depth of color makes it unlikely.

313
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,712
We're on our way to check out
his mother's home.

314
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:31,090
I'll see if I can find
the prescription bottle.

315
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,032
- OK
- No, no, no, no,

316
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,965
- What?
- No, no, no, no. Look.

317
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,495
Front door is open. You stay here.

318
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,189
- But...
- There is a baby involved.

319
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,436
You hear gunfire, anything like that,
drive away.

320
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:50,358
- I'm not leaving you, Booth.
- Yes, you will because this is

321
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:51,857
about the baby, not me.

322
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:53,442
Promise me.

323
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,129
I promise.

324
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,485
Easy.

325
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,262
Both hands to the ceiling.
Nice and easy.

326
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:40,900
Easy! God!

327
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:42,243
You know,

328
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,599
I asked you very nicely.

329
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:51,095
We will find out what
happened to your mother.

330
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:52,523
I promise.

331
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:57,929
Booth is an excellent investigator,
and I don't like to boast,

332
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:00,513
but I am the best in my field.

333
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,183
What do you want?

334
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:09,487
How... how about some visual
and auditory stimulation?

335
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,610
Okay. Let's see.

336
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,157
I told you, I'm Meg's husband.
I live here.

337
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,329
If you live here, why
did you break the front lock?

338
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,679
I didn't do it. Somebody else broke in.

339
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,787
I saw it, I thought I'd
come in and check on Meg.

340
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,792
You live here, or you came by to check
on Meg? Which one is it?

341
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,595
Man, you got me all confused.

342
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,670
Yeah. I bet.

343
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:33,690
Look.

344
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:34,746
Meg

345
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,371
bails me out sometimes, if she can.

346
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:41,095
When I saw she wasn't here,
I just figured I'd, you know,

347
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,268
help myself.

348
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,234
You often do you steal from your wife?

349
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:47,122
It's not stealing. She likes to help me.

350
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,669
Yeah. Meg's dead. She was killed.

351
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,721
How?

352
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:53,067
You seem shocked.

353
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,136
Well, of course I am!

354
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,286
Where were you last night?

355
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,513
Last night?

356
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:05,691
I don't remember.

357
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,484
Phalanges!

358
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:20,697
Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges!
Dancing phalanges!

359
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:22,522
Dancing phalanges!

360
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:24,319
Yeah!

361
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,251
Booth thinks that bones are
dry and boring, but...

362
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,347
Show me your phalanges!

363
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:32,458
Hey, Bones?

364
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,255
Her husband. Real genius.

365
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,166
Doesn't even rember
where he was last night.

366
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,610
We've got your son in here.

367
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,091
His mother is dead, and
now you're the only one...

368
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,415
No. I never wanted that kid.

369
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,763
She did it because she thought it
would straighten me out,

370
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,546
but I told her I couldn't handle
a kid because I'm a free spirit.

371
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,458
What you are is a drunk, Lou.

372
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:52,983
Dispatch, I need a
forensics team and a car

373
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,985
for a burglary suspect and
a possible murderer.

374
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:57,265
No. I didn't kill her.

375
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,812
Why would I?

376
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:03,526
Who else would feed me?

377
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:08,031
I determined an approximate size
and shape for the key.

378
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:10,964
Did you reference it against
currently registered key patents?

379
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,181
Yeah. The closest match is an
old design used

380
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,343
for safe deposit boxes in banks.

381
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,216
I'm looking into banks near
Huntsville that still use them.

382
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:20,389
Most safe deposit keys
are numerically coded.

383
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,898
Well, we couldn't get
a clear enough picture

384
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,082
without exposing Andy
to too much radiation.

385
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:26,560
Okay.

386
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,277
How many exactly?

387
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:31,981
Excuse me?

388
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,931
Kids. Because a million
seems a little impractical.

389
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:36,701
I don't know.

390
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,078
I kind of have a thing for chaos.

391
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:42,446
I guess I'll stop when the Feds
need to airlift me in supplies.

392
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,454
You don't, by chance,
live in a shoe, do you?

393
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:47,276
You don't want kids?

394
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:51,418
Screaming, crying, vomit,
other bodily fluids...

395
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,646
Like a day around here.

396
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:56,161
Not worth giving up this body for that.

397
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,211
Let's see what you got there.

398
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:12,602
Hey, Bones, sweep's finished.
It's all yours. Come on.

399
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:22,113
The phenobarbital was prescribed
to Andy in a clinic over 50 miles away.

400
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,594
That's probably the closest
medical care they've got.

401
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,594
It's an extremely harsh
drug to give to a child.

402
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:29,727
It's quite sweet,

403
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,393
these pictures.

404
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:32,755
She really loved him.

405
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:36,693
Check this out. Somebody had a doctor's
appointment in DC yesterday.

406
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:39,405
- Maybe that's where they were headed.
- Okay, we'll need

407
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,937
this prescription and
Andy's medical records.

408
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:45,034
Okay. I'll have them sent to the
Jeffersonian 'cause that's what we do.

409
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,821
I've made some discoveries
regarding our victim.

410
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,108
- Is this a good time?
- No, no, no.

411
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,231
Okay.

412
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:58,285
Zack?

413
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,106
Hello?

414
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:05,082
Dr. Addy.

415
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:06,412
It's Dr. Brennan.

416
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,237
Oh. Is this a better time?

417
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,586
No, no, no.

418
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,095
Then why did you call back?

419
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,731
- I'm wasn't speaking with you, Zack.
- I believe you are.

420
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,480
I was saying "no" to Andy.

421
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,043
He was grabbing my necklace.

422
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,787
Here you go.
You were saying?

423
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,515
Our victim had healed
compression fractures

424
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:23,528
in her L1 and L2 vertebrae.

425
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:25,269
From a traumatic injury?

426
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,107
No. Malnourishment.

427
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,064
She also has some minor deformities

428
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:31,441
including a slight bowing of the legs

429
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:34,361
and bony outgrowths at a number
of muscle attachments.

430
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:37,865
Do you know if Cam found any painkillers
in Andy's tox screen?

431
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,491
No. Just the phenobarbital.

432
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,739
First a key. Now jewelry.
What's next?

433
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,415
You gonna let him
play with a ball?

434
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:47,833
I'm watching him.

435
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:50,669
Meg had a number of bone conditions
that would have caused

436
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,537
chronic pain, but she wasn't
taking any pain medication.

437
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:56,544
Here. Probably because she didn't
want it affecting her...

438
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,760
you know, her supply.

439
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:00,488
You mean her breast milk.

440
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,663
You know,
you can say the word "breast," Booth.

441
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,016
Yeah, I know, Bones.

442
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,018
Well, didn't Rebecca breast-feed Parker?

443
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:07,038
You know...

444
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:12,399
- I am not discussing that with you.
- Would teat make you feel comfortable?

445
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,098
I'm not talking teats with you.

446
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,609
- Why not?
- Enough!

447
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,074
So our victim wasn't taking
any painkillers.

448
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,411
No, but her occupational markers in
her lateral epicondyle and lower discs

449
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,872
suggest that her job requires
manual labor.

450
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,483
Her pain might have been excruciating.

451
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:30,913
Probably had no choice.

452
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,811
Jobs around here are pretty scarce.

453
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,063
What do you say we go talk to her boss?

454
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:36,757
Wait. Weren't you breast-fed?
I was.

455
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:43,270
Yesterday was her day off.
When she was late today, I just...

456
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,141
God! I mean, who did it?
What happened?

457
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,269
We're not sure yet. Mr. Barnett, how
long you been the manager of this plant?

458
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:50,786
It's three years now.

459
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,148
It's the only real
business left around here.

460
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:55,025
Since Meg's job involved

461
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:57,548
a lot of physical labor, were you aware
of her spinal condition?

462
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,422
The pain, you mean?
Yeah, I saw.

463
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,615
I offered to put her on disability.
She said she and

464
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:03,354
the baby couldn't get by on that.

465
00:22:03,474 --> 00:22:05,507
She was tougher than half the guys here.

466
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:07,778
Poor little bug.

467
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:11,083
I got five kids myself.
I... I can't imagine...

468
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,329
Any reason to think Meg was in trouble?

469
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:16,547
No. I was her boss.
She didn't confide in me.

470
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,590
How about that husband of hers?

471
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:21,176
He was trash on a cracker
if I've ever seen it.

472
00:22:21,336 --> 00:22:22,970
They weren't living
together anymore.

473
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,596
Doesn't mean he ain't jealous.

474
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,391
- Maybe someone told him about Shepard.
- Who's Shepard?

475
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:31,645
Dave Shepard. Some accountant
from corporate headquarters in DC.

476
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:33,981
He was here for a week.
Left a few days ago.

477
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah. He was here to cut costs.

478
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,356
- We've all heard that before.
- Good-bye, jobs.

479
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,612
Was there anything between
Meg and Shepard?

480
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,531
Guy was kind of slimy.

481
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,617
You know, offering to buy her sodas,
asking about her kid,

482
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:48,495
all the time looking at her, you know...

483
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:49,913
Breasts?

484
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:53,083
Meg return the attention?

485
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:55,408
He was from the city, had money.

486
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,985
After her deadbeat of a husband, you
can't fault her for wanting a good meal.

487
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,549
But the only guy Meg really
cared about is right there.

488
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:03,468
She would have done
anything for this kid.

489
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:08,540
Just do a check on all
the employees and also,

490
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,811
get me the contact information for
this Dave Shepard out of the DC area.

491
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:14,417
I'm telling you, Lou Taylor,
he didn't do it. He was in jail.

492
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:17,172
They picked him up passed out
in another county.

493
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,544
Hold on.
Yeah. Well, you know what?

494
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,111
If Lou didn't toss the place,
then somebody else did.

495
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:25,674
All right? So just keep
checking for prints.

496
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,164
I'm telling you,
somebody else is looking for that key.

497
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:31,318
Andy's making that face again.

498
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:36,674
I'm serious, Bones. Next time,
you're changing the diaper.

499
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:38,362
There's a series of numbers on it.

500
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:41,339
These keys were coded to indicate
the specific bank.

501
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,048
So read me your numbers.

502
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:44,801
36, 09,

503
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:46,511
20, 14.

504
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:48,338
Okay. It's searching.

505
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:51,098
Got it.

506
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,226
It's from Green Hills Bank,
in Petersberg,

507
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:56,311
West Virginia. I'll send the directions
to your phone.

508
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:57,487
Thanks, Angela.

509
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:58,440
No problem.

510
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,309
How's my little bruiser?

511
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,319
He looks pleased

512
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,536
that a piece of metal is
no longer passing through

513
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,407
- his intestinal tract.
- No more metal.

514
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:10,232
- His legs are bowed.
- All babies' legs are bowed.

515
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:11,495
No, not like this.

516
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:12,996
How could I have missed that?

517
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:16,875
Tell Zack to run a P ratio test
on the victim's teeth.

518
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:19,046
He'll know what I mean.
Sure thing.

519
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,213
- Take care of him, sweetie.
- I will.

520
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:25,967
We've got the bank's address.

521
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:27,982
It's in Petersberg, one town
from Huntsville.

522
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:29,489
Great, I'll request a warrant.

523
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:32,265
That'll give us time to
go to Family Services in Parsons.

524
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:33,392
What? No.

525
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,644
- Not yet.
- I know this is difficult, but we both

526
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:38,852
agreed that we keep Andy to get the key.
Now that we have the key...

527
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:42,238
You can't leave him with Family Services
in the middle of nowhere.

528
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,566
Cam still needs to review
his medical records.

529
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:46,321
Bones, there are doctors there.

530
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:49,288
You have no idea what that
place will be like, Booth.

531
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:52,619
Med students, underfunded, understaffed.

532
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:55,810
His mother is dead and
his father is a felon.

533
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,582
I've been in his situation, Booth.

534
00:24:57,742 --> 00:24:59,501
I'm not turning him over until

535
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:03,213
I'm satisfied that he is somewhere safe
where he'll get the care he deserves.

536
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:06,258
Fine, he can stay with us.
For now.

537
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:08,385
Thank you.

538
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:10,952
Okay, I'll go lock the back up.

539
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:26,211
Just let me know if there's anything
else you need.

540
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:31,600
Bank manager said Meg was a new client.

541
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,155
Only got this box a few days ago.

542
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,236
Uh-oh.

543
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:40,959
"Uh-oh" is right.

544
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,855
Ah, Andy...

545
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,800
What kind of trouble was Mama in?

546
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:56,657
There's a sticky residue lining
the trigger and

547
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,144
I see fragments of a foreign

548
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:00,687
object inside the barrel.

549
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:03,671
We need to take this back
to the Jeffersonian.

550
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,803
Well, Meg Taylor didn't own a firearm,
at least not legally.

551
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:09,929
We need to find out where Mommy
got the gun, don't we?

552
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,552
Hey, someone filed
off the serial numbers.

553
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,047
You think I didn't know
that before I handed it to you?

554
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,871
I mean, I am FBI, not just some guy who

555
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:19,706
changes your stinky diapers.

556
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,333
It's been fired recently.

557
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,167
I'm finding gunpowder residue.

558
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:25,545
Gunpowder's not going to get me
the owner's name.

559
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:27,547
I need fingerprints, DNA.

560
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,759
Do you think there are any public
pools around here?

561
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:36,167
It's a pretty depressing job, you know,
keeping an eye on the ruins, but

562
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:38,234
I try to think positive.

563
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:41,088
Like I'm keeping them safe till
they open up again.

564
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,018
Chemicals are down here.

565
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:46,300
Thanks.

566
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,653
Can I hold him?
Just for a bit?

567
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:52,712
Okay.

568
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,372
Just for a little bit.
Right, Andy?

569
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,330
Did you know of any medical conditions
that Andy was being treated for?

570
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,502
Meg never liked to share her problems.

571
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,200
She was pretty independent.

572
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:06,952
But, I mean, Andy's always
seemed just fine.

573
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,129
Is he sick?

574
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,007
We're just checking.
Must've been a pretty nice pool.

575
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:15,178
Coached a high school team once
back when I was teaching.

576
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:17,176
Perfect.
Muriatic acid.

577
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:19,348
Bones, what are you doing?

578
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,018
Hey, I get it.

579
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:23,853
Someone filed the numbers off?

580
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:25,227
How'd you know that?

581
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:28,179
She's using the acid
to react with the metal.

582
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,008
Restores the original etchings.

583
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:32,347
I taught science.

584
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:33,362
Really?

585
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:35,200
You must've been a good teacher.

586
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,271
I got the numbers.

587
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:43,039
Mr. Delancey, you worked at Fallbrook
Rubber before you came to DC.

588
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:46,918
Got laid off a couple months ago.

589
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:48,878
Surprised that place is still
in business.

590
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:51,216
- So you knew Meg Taylor?
- Sure.

591
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:55,093
Can't picture her with a gun, though.
She was sweet as they come.

592
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:57,470
The gun was registered to you.

593
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,389
But I haven't seen
it in a couple of years.

594
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:02,183
I pawned it when things
first started getting tight.

595
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:05,145
It's illegal for pawn shops to buy guns.

596
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:07,572
You've seen Huntsville.

597
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:10,400
People do whatever it
takes to stay afloat.

598
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,811
Says here in your file that
you assaulted

599
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:14,675
the plant manager when he laid you off.

600
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,183
- Also took a swing at Dave Shepard.
- That's right, yeah.

601
00:28:17,303 --> 00:28:21,036
Look, that son of a bitch drives up from
DC every few months, and when he leaves,

602
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:23,619
five more of us are out on our asses.

603
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:25,373
Sure, I took a swing at him.

604
00:28:25,643 --> 00:28:27,917
I'd do it again, too, if I ever saw him.

605
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:29,961
Where's the pawn shop?

606
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:31,701
Corner of Elm and Wilson.

607
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,435
Went out of business, though.

608
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,581
Too many people selling,
not enough people buying.

609
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:45,363
This gun's covered in a fine dust
of particulate matter.

610
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:47,498
That's gonna take a while to ID.

611
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:50,102
The fragments inside
the gun's barrel are bone.

612
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:51,639
Really?

613
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,236
To get blow-back like that, somebody

614
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:57,280
would have to have been
shot point-blank.

615
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,489
In the head.

616
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:01,469
Brain tissue on the fragments means
they're from a frontal bone.

617
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,745
Think maybe our victim shot somebody?

618
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:08,739
If she did, then why would she put
the gun in a safe deposit box?

619
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,048
It's not logical.

620
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,112
Yeah, you're right.

621
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,172
We'll soon know for sure.

622
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:15,932
- What do you mean?
- I identified

623
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:18,593
the residue that's on the gun's trigger.
It's burned skin.

624
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,308
Finger must've gotten caught and burned
when the shooter fired the gun.

625
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,516
Cam should be able to get some DNA.

626
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,813
Hey, Bones, the pawn shop
that closed last year...

627
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,208
no one has seen the owner.

628
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:30,961
I mean, this gun, that could've been
floating around for months.

629
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:32,805
Little man.

630
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,944
Yeah, Bones, what's with the music?

631
00:29:36,104 --> 00:29:37,054
I'm on hold.

632
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:40,052
There's an anthropologically proven link
between poverty and violence.

633
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,909
More people competing for
scarcer resources.

634
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:44,240
That's great, Bones.

635
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,288
Bottom line is, we're not gonna know
if the gun owner's telling the truth.

636
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:48,564
Dr. Brennan?

637
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:51,501
Yes, I'm still here.

638
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:56,566
Well, then tell the Congressman
I'd appreciate a call back.

639
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:58,258
- Thank you.
- Congressman?

640
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:00,680
Oh, what is Bones up to, huh?

641
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,605
I'm just putting in a few calls.

642
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,480
You know, I've contributed
to numerous campaigns.

643
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,320
I think these politicians owe me.

644
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,419
Bones, that's not
how it's supposed to work.

645
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,020
That is exactly how it does work, Booth.

646
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,419
If the government fixed that
bridge leading to Huntsville,

647
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:16,220
they'd be back on the scenic route.

648
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,219
Okay, what about the lack of fiscal
resources that you were talking about?

649
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:22,699
They found millions to build
a bridge to nowhere in Alaska.

650
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:25,573
Do you need to burp?

651
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:26,501
No.

652
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,222
I was talking to Andy.

653
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:31,080
I know you were talking about Andy.

654
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,580
My man Andy.
So what's up with the little guy here?

655
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,120
How's his condition? Any news?

656
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,784
Cam's still looking in his records,

657
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,720
consulting with some pediatricians.

658
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,580
He's gonna be just fine, isn't he?

659
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,072
He's a tiger.

660
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:43,520
Tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger.

661
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,634
Tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger.

662
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:47,680
You know, verbal development
would be heightened

663
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,420
if you didn't talk to him like a fool.

664
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,828
- Were just doing just now?
- What? I wasn't doing anything.

665
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,851
- You were going
- What are you talking about?

666
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:56,087
- I never did that.
- That's what you sounded like.

667
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:57,066
Hello.

668
00:30:57,226 --> 00:31:00,480
I have some info about the skin
Hodgins found on the gun's trigger.

669
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,401
Yeah.

670
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:03,071
It was male.

671
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:04,815
Not Meg Taylor.

672
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,557
So Meg was either an accomplice...

673
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:11,479
Or she witnessed the murder,
got her hands on the gun, then hid it.

674
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:13,424
Excuse me.

675
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:14,551
Booth.

676
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:15,709
Yeah.

677
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:17,484
- Yeah.
- Huntsville?

678
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,319
We just found our missing accountant.

679
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,424
He used his credit card to check
into a motel near Huntsville.

680
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,780
Great, thanks.

681
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,513
Local police are picking him up now.

682
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,876
You're kidding, right?

683
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:37,212
This isn't Dave Shepard.
You're not Shepard.

684
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:40,118
- Tell me something I don't know.
- How'd you end up with his credit card?

685
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:42,280
It was inside that bag.

686
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,820
I found it in a trash heap
near the old coal mine.

687
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,347
I thought my luck had changed.

688
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:49,416
Was there blood on this bag
when you found it?

689
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,480
I guess. Hey, can I have the sweaters?

690
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,720
They're really soft.

691
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,749
I'll take the bag,
everything in it back to DC.

692
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:57,202
- Cut this guy loose.
- Cut me loose?

693
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:58,691
I don't mind staying here.

694
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:00,523
You know, a couple of nights, maybe?

695
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,202
What do you say?

696
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,900
Couple of nights?

697
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:07,280
So this Dave Shepard guy
is an accountant?

698
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,513
That's not a profession
I associate with killers.

699
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,480
Booth thinks that our
victim may have seen

700
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,380
Dave Shepard shoot someone.

701
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,180
Since he's been missing since her death,

702
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,880
he could've killed her, too.

703
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:19,170
Yeah, well, tell Booth
I just found the guy.

704
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,130
Or parts of his skull anyway.

705
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:23,619
I ran the DNA from
the blood on the duffel bag

706
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:26,600
and the frontal bone fsagments
from the gun through CODIS.

707
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:27,698
Both his.

708
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,450
So Dave Shepard isn't our
killer ; he's another victim.

709
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:32,125
He was shot in the head by a male

710
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:34,420
with a gun Meg Taylor
was trying to hide.

711
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,392
Hey.

712
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,620
You wanted me?

713
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,119
Yeah there was a flash drive

714
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:41,200
in Dave Shepard's duffel bag.

715
00:32:42,385 --> 00:32:44,360
- It's crushed.
- That's why you come in.

716
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:47,593
We need to know if Dave Shepard found
something that have gotten him killed.

717
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:49,700
Okay, I'll get right on it.

718
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:55,743
- Did you call your pediatrician friend?
- He's on his way.

719
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,217
And you know he's good?
'Cause we have to be certain.

720
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:01,923
Dr Brennan, he's the chief of pediatrics
at Children's National Medical Center.

721
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:03,275
He's the best.

722
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:10,358
Hi, beautiful.

723
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,047
Coming to visit?

724
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,665
Yeah, I need
some cotton swabs and some bleach.

725
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:19,200
Cleaning dried blood
off that flash drive.

726
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,049
You do want kids, don't you?

727
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:29,343
What?

728
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:31,568
Kids.

729
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,280
Small humans.

730
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,300
I'll admit I only
ever planned on one or two, but...

731
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,480
if you want a million,

732
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,773
I want a million.

733
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,300
- Really?
- Absolutely.

734
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,720
I don't care if you're
mushy and shapeless,

735
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,364
puffy from constant
hormonal fluctuations.

736
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,280
I'll still find you sexy.

737
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm not gonna look like I'm...

738
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,080
It's okay. When you get wider,
there'll be more of you to love.

739
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,266
I think we should start right now.
Why wait until we get married?

740
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,169
There's no telling how long
it's gonna take you to get your divorce.

741
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,320
Your computer is...

742
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,715
it's beeping.

743
00:34:16,296 --> 00:34:17,980
- That's interesting.
- What is it?

744
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,531
Particulates from the gun.

745
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:23,600
The dust was composed of silica,
sulfur compounds, and synthetic rubbers.

746
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,364
Sounds like tires.

747
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,410
The gun was used at
the tire recycling plant.

748
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,353
I'm not going to get wider.

749
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:37,829
What exactly are you looking for?

750
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,112
We're not sure yet.

751
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,329
Anything that will help us figure out
to Dave Shepard and Meg Taylor.

752
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,900
Okay, people, back to work.

753
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:47,659
- You let them do their job.
- They'll let us do ours.

754
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,920
Where you going?

755
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,802
Bones...

756
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,028
Hey, pal, here, hold on to that for me.

757
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Bones, where you going?

758
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,397
Hey.

759
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,652
Booth, look at this.

760
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:15,282
Turn off the machine.

761
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,123
Okay, if I were a dead body
and I needed to disappear...

762
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,099
This would be a pretty
thorough way to do it.

763
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:23,791
Hey, pal, how often do you
ship out a load of this mulch?

764
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:25,568
We collect a week's worth at a time,

765
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,502
but we bag it up every couple hours.

766
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:30,196
Dave disappeared four days ago.
He could still be here.

767
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,650
It's this lot right here.

768
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:33,980
<i>- Bones.
- Yeah.</i>

769
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,280
This lot was collected
right after Dave's disappearance.

770
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,720
Everything's washed, sanitized
and ready to be shipped.

771
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,692
Means all the evidence
has been washed away.

772
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:42,116
Not necessarily.

773
00:35:42,236 --> 00:35:43,518
Scoop up some of the mulch.

774
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:51,296
Put it in this water.

775
00:35:57,838 --> 00:35:58,784
Next bag.

776
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:00,520
What exactly are we doing here?

777
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,913
I'll explain in a minute.

778
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:06,012
- Try the next bag.
- Next bag.

779
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,878
Next bag.

780
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,590
The rubber pieces float, see?

781
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,844
But bone...

782
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:22,133
It sinks.

783
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:24,106
We just found Dave.

784
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,582
Tell the manager to shut
this plant down now.

785
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,089
Brennan.

786
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:31,342
- Brennan, it's me.

787
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:33,874
- Turn on your video stream.
- Is Andy all right?

788
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:36,279
The pediatrician
is examining him right now.

789
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,993
The baby is fine.

790
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,145
Take a look at this.

791
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,662
I recovered most of the memory
from that flash drive.

792
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,680
Dave Shepard's internal audit showed

793
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,386
a completely different set of numbers

794
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,440
than those reported
to corporate headquarters.

795
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,400
Someone was doctoring
the profit reports.

796
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:53,470
<i>Siphoning the money
into a private account.</i>

797
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,310
Dave figured it out while he was in
Huntsville, that's what got him killed.

798
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,886
And if Meg knew about it, then the
killer would want her dead, too.

799
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,388
Hey, where's Barnett? Chip left.

800
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:02,848
Where did he go?

801
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,534
Said he had an emergency at home.

802
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:19,962
Damn!

803
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,220
Chip Barnett, you're under arrest
for eluding a federal agent.

804
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm sure we'll be throwing in
a few murder charges as well.

805
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,600
- You know your rights.
- Yeah.

806
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:58,416
It's only a matter of time
before they close the plant.

807
00:37:58,536 --> 00:37:59,959
You embezzled from the company?

808
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,781
A man does what
he has to for his family.

809
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:04,140
So that justifies killing
two innocent people?

810
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:06,466
- Shepard was going to turn me in.
- So you shot him.

811
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:08,343
Meg witnessed it,
got a hold of the gun...

812
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:10,130
She wanted money to keep quiet.

813
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,934
- Take her kid to some doctor in DC.
- You knew where she was headed.

814
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,857
You followed her out of town so
you could kill her with no one around.

815
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:18,561
I didn't want to kill her.

816
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:22,258
I went to her trailer, I looked for the
gun first, but you do what you have...

817
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:24,387
There was a baby in that car!

818
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,093
Son of a bitch.

819
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,432
Hi.

820
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:33,313
Hey.

821
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,069
One of the techs found
this in Meg's trailer.

822
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:40,480
What is it?

823
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,907
A letter that
Meg wrote to her friend Carol Grant.

824
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:45,825
<i>Hey.</i>

825
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,370
Andy has a genetic condition.

826
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:49,424
What is it?

827
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,900
Vitamin D-resistant rickets.

828
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,729
Meg had a mild form, very few symptoms.

829
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:54,626
She probably didn't even know
she had it.

830
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:57,420
But males are prone to more
severe cases than females,

831
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,465
so Andy would have exhibited
more extreme symptomatology.

832
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:01,980
Including the seizures.

833
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,246
The clinic probably
prescribed him phenobarbital

834
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:06,096
without searching for underlying causes.

835
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:08,146
Is Andy going to be all right?

836
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,100
Absolutely.

837
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:11,816
Very treatable.

838
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:13,898
My friend can treat him
as an outpatient.

839
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:15,814
Andy's going to be fine.

840
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Thanks, Cam.

841
00:39:19,944 --> 00:39:20,944
Really.

842
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:22,593
Don't mention it.

843
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,880
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah, it looks like our little guy

844
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,202
is going to be fine just fine.

845
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,250
<i>The little guy.</i>

846
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,843
Andy.

847
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,800
Andy's going to be just fine.

848
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,580
You should read this.

849
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,380
<i>Dear Carol,
if anything happens to me,</i>

850
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,176
<i>take care of my Andy.</i>

851
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,800
<i>I know you don't have much.</i>

852
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,580
<i>None of us do...</i>

853
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,380
<i>but you have love.</i>

854
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,200
<i>And I know Andy would be lucky
to be a part of your family.</i>

855
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,580
<i>I'm going to miss that little guy.</i>

856
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,880
<i>And so are you, so don't deny it.</i>

857
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,880
I'm not ashamed to say
that I've developed

858
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,980
a certain affection for Andy.

859
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,180
It's a natural by-product of caregiving.

860
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,280
Yeah.

861
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,600
So... what do you think, huh?

862
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,257
Change your mind about having kids?

863
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:07,280
Booth.

864
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,980
Okay. All right.

865
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,428
You got some time.

866
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,877
Not that much time.

867
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:16,500
- Booth!
- Hey!

868
00:41:17,203 --> 00:41:18,334
Now look what you did.

869
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:19,716
- What I did?
- Yeah.

870
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,136
You're the one who hit me.

871
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,200
What is all this stuff?

872
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,320
It's information Carol gave me

873
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,134
from a structural engineer.

874
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:30,838
Ah, I see you took
my financial advice, didn't you?

875
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,457
- You're going to build that home.
- No.

876
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,049
The congressman couldn't help

877
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:37,480
so I'm rebuilding the bridge
into Huntsville.

878
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,020
I've hired Carol Grant
as the project manager.

879
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,143
- That is going to cost a fortune.
- To you it's a fortune,

880
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:46,456
but with my advance and
selling the movie rights...

881
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:47,708
Yeah, I get it.

882
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,478
You know, I thought you said that
towns lived and died like organisms,

883
00:41:51,598 --> 00:41:54,100
that sometimes we should
just let them go.

884
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:56,080
And sometimes all it takes is one thing,

885
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,916
like a bridge,
for a town to start recovering.

886
00:41:59,097 --> 00:42:02,280
Back on the scenic route,
the gas stations could reopen,

887
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,718
restaurants, maybe a bed and breakfast

888
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:06,491
for people who want to stay in the area.

889
00:42:08,412 --> 00:42:09,900
Listen to you.

890
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,531
Good for you.

891
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,409
You know, it's, um...

892
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:19,300
it's a shame.

893
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:20,855
What?

894
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,380
No kids. Who's going to be proud of you?

895
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,398
- I didn't do it for that.
- Yeah, OK, I know,

896
00:42:25,518 --> 00:42:26,500
I know.

897
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,922
You know, with next year's book,

898
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,980
you should... you should get
that second home in the town you saved.

899
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,520
It only makes sense, right?

900
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,639
'Cause every year,
the plasmas... they go down,

901
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,149
they get cheaper and cheaper.

902
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:38,914
- It happens all the time.
- Forget it.

903
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,320
What? I'm just saying.

904
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,280
Andy's going to miss his Auntie Bones.

905
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,980
Gonna want to see.

906
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:46,714
We could all go fishing, come back home,

907
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:48,454
plop ourselves in front of that big,

908
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:50,495
103-inch

909
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:52,890
plasma screen of heaven:

910
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,480
football.

911
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,011
- And you can make the five-layer dip.
- Seven-layer dip.

912
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,980
Even better, seven layers, perfect.

913
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,320
You could talk to Andy.

914
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,708
"Hello, Andy. Little man,
little baby, baby..."

915
