   Sync:YTET-Vicky8800    -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,360
Upward of 30 times.Every rib is marked--

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,840
vertebra sternal,vertebra costal...

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,290
what kind of weapon?

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,770
vacations in the desert.It's like lunching at the dump.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,500
pointed with no cutting edge,like a giant ice pick.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,460
angela.

8
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,920
Or a sharpened screwdriver.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,350
We warned her about the sun,right?

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,780
We told her cover up,avoid melanoma.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,000
Who's the guy?

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,790
Her boyfriend,kirk.

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,450
Angela has a boyfriend?

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,790
Every year for three weeks,angela has a boyfriend and a vacation.

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,430
playing house in a post-boho,rustic artist cabin in the desert 

16
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,660
with her overpaid,pseudo-celebrity photographer boyfriend,

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,160
that is not a vacation.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,680
Eight months to a ye dead,correct?

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,930
pupal casings,maggots,eight months to a year.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,450
Angela,we're betting.Are you using crisco or butter for sunscreen?

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,090
brennan,could I talk to you in private,please?

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,330
You're going to think I'm crazy.

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,890
What's up,boyfriend trouble?

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,170
No,I-I-I'd just send it to you,but the sheriff won't let me.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,730
Send what?

26
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,270
Somebody left a human skull in a box on the sheriff's porch.

27
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,300
He says it was probably a navajo who respects the dead,

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,070
but doesn't want to get pulled into the whole white justice system.

29
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,780
The thing is,is that kirk 

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,840
went out into the desert five days ago on a photo shoot,and he hasn't come back.

31
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,190
Nobody can find him or his guide.

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,090
You think the skull is kirk's?

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,960
No. No.

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,380
Kirk's always going out into the desert for days at a time.

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,280
You're really sending me mixed messages,ange.

36
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,630
well,I'm freaking out,I guess.

37
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,550
I'm sorry.Look,you know,I'm sorry.I shouldn't have called.

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,090
Pretend I didn't call.I'll just...I'll talk to you when kirk gets back.Sorry.

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,020
You're taking a vacation in the desert with no notice?

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,880
I don't get the attraction,I really don'T.

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,540
Snakes,scorpions..--it should only be for a few days.

42
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,970
Buzzards and snakes.

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,010
What about the stabbing victim?

44
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,510
Zack identified the weapon and the victim.Our job is done.

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,600
I mean,it's not like I actually think that the skull is kirk'S.

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,580
But I mean,if you could just look at it 

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,230
and just tell me it isn't,then I could stop worrying about 

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,440
him being dead and just be mad at him for being a flaky artist. 

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,620
You won't get anything out here.

50
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,550
We're about 100 miles past where jesus lost his sandals.

51
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,450
I assume that's a way of saying "we're extremely isolated."

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,720
it's why we come out here every year.

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,660
It's like you stand still and the whole universe just comes at you.

54
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,670
At 110 degrees.

55
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,670
You know,kirk was out with a good guide,our friend dani.

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,700
I mean,he said he'd be back,he said we'd go out for nachos and beer.

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,760
And this is a man who's serious about his beer.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,870
I got the navajo police looking between dona ona canyon and the otero bluffs.

59
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,270
Ben,dr. Brennan is a forensic anthropologist with the jeffersonian institution.

60
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,650
I spend most of my time helping the fbi conduct murder investigations.

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,760
Angie,I kind of got my hands full getting searchers out to look for dani and kirk.

62
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,880
The state police said that they would lend us a chopper,

63
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,640
but only if we narrowed down the search area.

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,570
They got to be running low on water.

65
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,410
I don't give them more than a couple of days.

66
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,740
Ben,if you could just show dr. Brennan the skull.

67
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,900
Or point me toward the morgue.

68
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,660
Welcome to the merville county morgue.

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,870
Prominent brow ridge indicates the victim is male.You mind?

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,380
Be my guest.

71
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,300
Oh,no,she wants the plate,ben,not the muffin.

72
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:10,300
Cranial shape and nasal features suggest caucasian.

73
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,050
Died in the last several days.

74
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,840
Critters been at it pretty good.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,400
Pattern of basilar suture fusion puts age 30 to 35.

76
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,300
Well,it doesn't look like kirk.

77
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,830
Doesn't look like anyone,angie.

78
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,030
Putrascine.Early stages of decomp.

79
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,550
Cause of death?

80
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,960
A man gets caught unawares out in the desert,he could be dead in a few hours.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,070
What?

82
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,870
Base of the skull here detached from the spinal cord.

83
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,060
See these little bevel marks?Perimortem contact: Gunshot.

84
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,590
It wasn't the desert who caught this man unawares.

85
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,400
It was someone with a gun. 

86
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,580
You can't say that it's kirk.

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,300
I know.

88
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,920
You want some tea?

89
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
I'd rather have a beer.

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,020
This woman modeling in these pictures,is this dani?

91
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,300
Dani weber.It's kirk's guide in the desert.

92
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,890
She's beautiful.

93
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,760
Dani has lived her whole life.

94
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,750
You know,ben says that she knows the desert better than anybody.

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,110
Look,there's no way that she gets lost or she runs out of water.There's just no way.

96
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,770
No.

97
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,380
What?

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,210
Brennan,if you hug me and you be all caring it's because you think kirk is dead.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,340
Or because he was sleeping with dani.

100
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,460
No,it's because...

101
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm sorry that my friend is upset because someone she loves is missing.

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,650
all right.I can buy that.

103
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,080
You know,if you don't mind,I'm just going to head to bed.

104
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,580
Good night.

105
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,290
booth.

106
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,740
How far are you from dulles?

107
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,410
As far as your office is from dulles.

108
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,900
Why are you in my office?

109
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,360
I need your findings on the richmond case.Listen,zack,

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,140
he won't tell me where they are unless you give him permission.

111
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,340
There's a 9:15 flight to denver.Then there's an 11:35 flight to santa fe.

112
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,020
You'll have to run to make the connection.

113
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,020
Forget it.

114
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,290
Booth,please.Angela's boyfriend is missing.Maybe dead.

115
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,680
It took all of my charm...

116
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,040
just to get the sheriff your charm,oh boy!

117
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,300
just tell the sheriff To let me look at the skull.

118
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,780
When I asked him to let me send the skull to the jeffersonian,

119
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,350
he told me I am not a cop and that I don't have any jurisdiction.

120
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,500
Which is true.Okay,what,look...what do you want me to do?

121
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,460
I want you to get federal on his ass.

122
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,580
You know,people in the desert don't have actual addresses.What's up with that?

123
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,630
Booth,you made it.

124
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,620
You know,I'm touring the hottest places in the universe.Next stop-- here you go-hell

125
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,390
I'm not really awake yet.

126
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,810
Last night before I left,I used my fbi powers 

127
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,040
to force the sheriff to send the skull back to the jeffersonian.

128
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,210
I talked to him this morning.seems a little resentful.

129
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,390
What time is it?

130
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,870
Let's go.Drink that on the way.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,010
Wha-- on the way where?

132
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,290
You know,to gocheck out the mode guide,whatever's place.

133
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,070
Dani.Can I come with you?

134
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,710
No,no,we can ask tougher questions if you're not there.

135
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,520
Wait outside while I get dressed.

136
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,460
No.Sun's been up for an hour out there.It's already the surface of mercury.

137
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,600
I can stand here and close my eyes,eat my doughnuts,best I can do.

138
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,210
What tougher questions can we ask without angela being here?

139
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,260
Things like,did her boyfriend run off with a model,guide,whatever?

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,580
Angela and i discussed this.She said it couldn't happen.

141
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay,no offense to angela,but she doesn't really know this guy.

142
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,050
She's only with him,what,three weeks out of the year.

143
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,490
No offense to you,but you're a stodgy traditionalist when it comes to relationships,buddy.

144
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,130
Stodgy? Stodgy?Okay,ay,here's the deal. --stodgy.

145
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,510
Here's the deal,bones.We found out that the skull isn't kirk,we go home,

146
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,340
we let the locals handle it,okay? --of course.

147
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,140
you say "of course," but then you get all caught up in it.And then... what?

148
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,560
What do you want?

149
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,040
Fbi.We're looking for dani weber.

150
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,030
Who are you?

151
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,740
I'm the guy holding the big gun.

152
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,730
on a federal agent,which I've been very nice about so far.

153
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,650
Let's rush him.He can't shoot us both.

154
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,000
How about I just show him my badge,so we both survive,all right?

155
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,780
See?

156
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,750
Name's alex joseph.This is me and dani's place.

157
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,160
Where's dani weber?

158
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Missing...in the desert for almost a week.I've been looking for her.

159
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,960
You point your gun at everybody who comes by?

160
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,650
Maybe I'm nervous.

161
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,520
Anything in particular you might be nervous about?

162
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,430
Maybe something dani got caught up in.

163
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,370
Nothing I can think of.

164
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,490
Could we look in the trailer?

165
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,050
Not without a warrant.

166
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,800
You have a problem with law enforcement?

167
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,130
You could say that,I guess.

168
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,470
Model runs off with handsome photographer,

169
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,240
jealous boyfriend with a gun finds them in the desert...

170
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,180
he's definitely twitchy about something.

171
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,610
What if he's escaping out the back door?

172
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,100
You don't spend a lot of time in trailers,do you?

173
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:25,230
What?That's sheriff dawes.

174
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,200
he definitely has a problem with law enforcement.

175
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,940
dr. Brennan doesn't like us to listen to music while we're working.

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,580
Dr. Brennan is not here.

177
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,420
She thinks the work deserves our full concentration.I need the skull now.

178
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,290
Well,I'm still finding particulates.

179
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,380
And since you're only dr. Brennan's assistant,

180
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,490
without her,you don't carry all that much weight around here.

181
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,770
I'm telling dr. Goodman.

182
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,960
why didn't you mention your relationship to dani weber?

183
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,460
Dani weber dropped you for the photographer,the indian guy,or both.

184
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,790
Moron.Dani's my sister.Half sister.

185
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,230
Mostly I raised her.You can check with angie.

186
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,350
Okay  well,I got that one... wrong.

187
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,300
I pretty much don't like the look of your sister's boyfriend,alex joseph.

188
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,740
asault.Narcotics.He bootlegs for threservation.dani could do better.

189
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,710
Any chance that dani got caught up in mething ugly because of him?

190
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,160
tell you why I'm as that dani and kirk are lostn the desert.

191
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,060
Ex joseph-- is he bad enough to hurt finds 'em ou heesert toge?

192
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,450
It'S on my list of nightmares

193
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,130
brennan.

194
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,260
Dna results e in.The skull is definitely kirk Persinger.

195
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,200
Poor angela.

196
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,900
also,the hair test's off the charts for ophophora williamsii-derived mescaline.

197
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,810
What's that?

198
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,900
Peyote.

199
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,670
Anything on the cranial scoring?

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,310
i haven't rely had a good crack at the skull yet.Hodgins ho it.

201
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,820
The markings traced to several desert dwelling species-- 

202
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,750
it seems a full-grown male coyote did the most work on it,

203
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,130
but one with a malformed very unusual bite formations.

204
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,500
Ask dr. Goodman to find a naturalist.

205
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,510
Kirk persinger?

206
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,370
Yes.Ey found traces of peyote.

207
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,370
Drug-related.Shot to the spine,execution-style.

208
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,910
So,sheriff,do you still think this is a simple missing persons case?

209
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,440
I have to tell angela.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,100
Listen,sheriff,sorry for the concern you must be feeling for you sister.

211
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,770
I will call the fbi office in albuquerque,

212
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,080
and I will officially take over the investigation.

213
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
I won't do that.--Why?

214
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,640
Desert dwellers are very insular.Mongolians,

215
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,870
bedouins of the sahara,the himba of kalana.

216
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,560
Good hosts but extremely distrustful of outsiders.

217
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,660
Bone,this is the united states of america.It's not outerongolia.

218
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,690
The only reason sheriff dawes talks to us at all is because we know angela.

219
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,040
Alex joseph held a gun on us.

220
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,730
I'll admit,I've met friendlier people.

221
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,850
If a bunch of outsiders come in from albuquerque led by an outsider from D.C.,

222
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,780
I promise you the people here will close ranks and shut up until we go away.

223
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,340
Then they'll take care of it in their own way.

224
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,170
Okay,who are you,dr. Phil?

225
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,250
Who is dr. Phil,some kind of expert?

226
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,520
He likes to think so.Okay,look,I'll take what you say under advisement.

227
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,520
In the meantime,we need to go find out who supplied kirk with his peyote.

228
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,170
Well,how are we going to do that?

229
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,200
Talk to his girlfriend.

230
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,890
I am so sorry,angela.We both are.

231
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,770
I knew it was kirk.That's why I called you.

232
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,500
We have to find out what happened to dani.

233
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,610
Angela,I'm going to have to ask you a couple difficult questions,okay?

234
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,780
What can you tell me about kirk's drug use?

235
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,560
Kirk didn't do drugs.

236
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,140
Well,hodgins found peyote in his hair.

237
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,180
I thought...I thought that you meant drug drugs.

238
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,970
The peyote wasn't recreational.

239
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,230
Kirk took part in some native indian rights.

240
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,680
While high on drugs?

241
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,210
did you do peyote with kirk?

242
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,500
The peyote has nothing to do with anything.

243
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,780
Angela,you may have come in contact with kirk's killer without even realizing it.

244
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,120
who was his connection?

245
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,200
he's kirk's friend.

246
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,380
I need the name.

247
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,480
Wayne.Wayne kellogg.

248
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,020
He's an important local artist.

249
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,210
I don't deny having participated in the peyote ritual on several occasions.

250
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,190
Utterly spiritual experience.

251
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,480
You're not indian.

252
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,160
Not by birth,no,but as you can see from my artwork,

253
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,370
I have a deep spiritual connection to the navajo.

254
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,820
You sell a lot of your work?

255
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,480
I sell very well overseas,enough to keep this place and a beach house in los angeles. Why?

256
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,770
Why not buy navajo art created by actual navajos?

257
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,190
Peyote is only legal if you're a member of the native american church,

258
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,650
which means,you and kirk bought it illegally.

259
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,720
Buying illegal drugs involves drug dealers.

260
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,960
I mean,you can follow my train of thought here,can't you?

261
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,420
Look,I realize kirk's missing.

262
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,590
Kirk's not missing.

263
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,490
He's dead.

264
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,090
What about dani?

265
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,970
Dani weber remains unaccounted for.

266
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,120
God,this is terrible.

267
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,140
I need the name of your drug connection.

268
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,220
No.I'm sorry.

269
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,290
These people trust me.I understand the difficulty in finding 

270
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,730
the peyote plants miles out in the desert.Secret places passed on 

271
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,550
from generation to generation.

272
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,530
Mr. Kellogg,is that your vehicle?

273
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
Yes. Why?

274
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,330
Alex joseph borrowed that humvee.

275
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,580
Wait. Alex joseph didn't go out to the desert to look for dani weber.

276
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,400
He went out to look for peyote.

277
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,380
I never said that.

278
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,100
Mr. Joseph?It's fbi again.

279
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,000
Like to ask you a few more questions.

280
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
Booth?

281
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,540
Booth.

282
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:02,180
come on,sheriff.Come on,even out here you know how the drug world workshuh?

283
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,150
Kirk is found dead.Joseph is beaten to a pulp.It's all connected.

284
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,470
My first priority is to find dani.

285
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,790
You find kirk's murderer,we probably find dani.

286
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,000
Maybe dani is the murderer. 

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,940
What? I got to ask.

288
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,200
Dani never hurt anybody in her life.Except maybe herself.

289
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,660
You know,another thing i have to consider--maybe dani,you know,calls up her,

290
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,290
brother the sheriff and says,you know,"this photographer "raped me.What do I do now?"

291
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,560
What you're proven right now--

292
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,740
you don't know anything about the people that live around here.

293
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,770
Joseph met us with a rifle.

294
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,300
Maybe because he was afraid it was you coming around the corner of that house.

295
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,500
Alex joseph is unconscious.You maybe can talk to him when he wakes up.

296
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,460
Me-- I'm going to help the search parties find my sister.

297
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,950
Thanks to fish and wildlife,

298
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,960
most of the coyote packs in this region have at least one member wearing a gps collar.

299
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,840
You can find one coyote with a wonky jaw in the desert?

300
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,380
What we do here is process information from rangers,

301
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,440
amateur naturalists,conservationists,even school groups.

302
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,560
The desert coyote packs range is not huge. Perhaps ten square miles.

303
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,280
The pack is typically three to eight animals led by the alpha mating pair.

304
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,870
Why wow?

305
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,150
Professor inez has found your coyote,but he's-he's way out in the desert.

306
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,790
Three pups,three females,two males--including the leader with the wonky jaw.

307
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,300
With eight coyotes going at a cadaver.

308
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,720
You know,we're talking needle in a haystack,you know,finding the remains.

309
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,760
Mamas and the pups feed together,

310
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,030
so I'd expect rib cage and smaller bones to be in a concentrated area.

311
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,180
But the males move away from each other with the larger pieces.

312
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,600
No more than a half a mile.

313
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,070
Three weeks a year.I mean,15 weeks in total.You think that's crazy.

314
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,000
Well...it's not typical,that's for sure.

315
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:13,420
And if he was yours,100% yours,for three weeks a year,that'S...

316
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,900
it's more than I've ever had.

317
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,860
Kirk's photographs show the world as a more beautiful place 

318
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,540
than it is.A-a better place.

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,620
He made me feel like it was my real home.

320
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,600
That I belonged there...with him.

321
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,980
He's the guy i compare all other guys to.

322
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,650
Now he's gone,and I-I feel like i can't even breathe,sweetie.I can't even take a breath.

323
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,440
You think it's possible that dani's still out there?Could she still be alive?

324
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,350
I don't know.

325
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,150
There's no crime scene,and...

326
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,090
we're not even sure where the rest of 's remains are.

327
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,240
Well,I want to help you look for her tomorrow.

328
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,100
You sure?

329
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,580
Dani was our friend.

330
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,840
I have to help find her.Please?

331
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,620
I love the desert.Or I used to.

332
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,720
Nothing looks the way it should.

333
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,140
Stuff that's far away looks ne,stuff that's near looks far.

334
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,340
well,you can't trust your eyes out here.Not your eyes alone.

335
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,660
You know,kirk said that if you stood still long enough,

336
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,120
that the desert would actually speak to you.

337
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,540
Show you some kind of truth.

338
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,290
That ever happen to you?

339
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,960
No,but he really believed that.

340
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,620
Alex joseph woke up.

341
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,950
Good.

342
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,480
You think whoever beat him up had something to do with kirk persinger's murder.

343
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,120
Nope.

344
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,780
How can you be so sure?

345
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,640
You were the one that beat him up?

346
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,750
No.

347
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,940
Okay.Well,uh... do you know who did?

348
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,920
These guys.Or guys just like 'em.

349
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,000
Why?

350
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,390
Peyote ritual.These people take it seriously.It's their religion.

351
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,410
A guy like alex joseph starts selling it to white guys like kellogg and kirk,

352
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,850
they don't like it.

353
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,900
Aren't you going to arrest any of them?

354
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,000
No.

355
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,570
But I might deputize a couple.

356
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,030
You know,sheriff,I get how you people handle things out here,

357
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,840
but I got ask you--I mean,if they'd beat up an indian for selling peyote,

358
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,670
what the hell are they gonna do to kirk for taking it?

359
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,630
Nothing. Kirk's a white man.

360
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,400
The way they see it,he's my responsibility.

361
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,600
I got something here!

362
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,990
Ange,they found some bones over here.It might be kirk.

363
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,580
It is kirk.This is his camera.

364
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,320
Are you sure?

365
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,590
No,no,no.Don't,don'T.

366
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,350
There could be exposed film in there.It's cracked.

367
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,430
Can't let anymore light in,it'll damage the film.

368
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,440
Maybe kirk was right.

369
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,520
This could be a good way for the desert to tell us what happened to him.

370
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,130
Photograph of his murder.

371
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,080
this camera is going straight to the state police crime lab.

372
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,890
Angela is better at developing film than anyone in santa fe.

373
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,000
Plus I can use kirk's equipment.It's top of the line.

374
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,440
and we won't have to wait for the results,sheriff.

375
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,050
With your sister maybe still alive out in the desert,every hour counts.

376
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,070
Can't do it.

377
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,080
Booth...

378
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,100
you know,according to homeland security,

379
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,310
kellogg sold exactly $120,000 worth of art overseas.

380
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,610
What's that got to do with anything?

381
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,100
Well,it sure as hell doesn't buy him a beach house in los angeles,now does it?

382
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,520
He lied.Let's go check him out.

383
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,750
What will we be looking for?

384
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,860
You know,what we always look for.

385
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,400
You know,something that doesn't fit.Something that,you know...something.

386
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,500
I can't believe that you think that I am a suspect.

387
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,970
Angie,not to speak ill of the dead,but,a woman like you,

388
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,100
you're worth more than three weeks a year, you understand?

389
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,900
U think I murdered kirk because he didn't give me enough time?

390
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,540
I'm just a lawman.

391
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,430
People are people.

392
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,260
Ben,kirk wasn't the one who put limits on our time together.

393
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,870
He wanted me to marry him,and he deserved more,and better.

394
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,130
Please,ben,I want to help find dani.And there could be evidence on this film.

395
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,200
Just let me do what I do better than anybody else.

396
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,110
Thank you.

397
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,490
Angie...

398
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,890
maybe he deserved more,not my place to say,

399
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,160
but he couldn't have done better.No man could.

400
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,010
I haven't attained anything like the success kirk has,but I do all right-- why?

401
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,980
You have a beach house.

402
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,170
I applied for a warrant to check for your assets,your tax returns.

403
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:16,380
I told you,I do well in europe,germany especially appreciates native-themed work

404
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,470
kersinger's remains we found way out in desert.

405
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,030
What's that got too with me?

406
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,160
because you have a vehicle that's capable of going out that far.

407
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,820
A vehicle I often loan out.

408
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,670
what are these?

409
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,270
Engraving plates.

410
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,230
Please don't touch them.The oils on your skin will comprise the integrity.

411
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,720
Why would I kill kirk?

412
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,300
Maybe because,you know,you had a little thing,you know,for dani.

413
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,130
Or maybe because you were jealous of kirk's artistic success.

414
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,690
These aren't native design.

415
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,160
Bones,I'm working a line of inquiry here.

416
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,410
All of your work is stolen from native designs.These are floral.It doesn't fit.

417
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,100
Not stolen.Inspired by.

418
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,980
And th piece is commissioned.

419
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,600
Another way I make money.

420
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,340
Hi,angela.

421
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,190
Well,most of the film was wrecked,but I developed a few usable images.

422
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,100
That's great.

423
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,470
No,no,because ben got me to make a couple of prints and then 

424
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,320
he bolted with them and all the negatives.

425
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,740
Sheriff dawes took off with the negatives.

426
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,240
What'd she find on them?

427
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,570
Did you recognize anything?

428
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,230
Dani in the desert,and that's all.

429
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,500
I have no idea what he got so excited about.

430
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,350
Nothing that meant anything to angela.

431
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,310
We'll go take a look for ourselves.Talk to you again.

432
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,110
I wanted to show these photographs to alex joseph.I don't need your permission.

433
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,180
Why joseph?

434
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,630
Angela says there are only a few partial photos of your sister in the desert.

435
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,730
That's right.The only person that knows the desert as good as dani is joseph.

436
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,340
This formation here,I'm not familiar with it.

437
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,330
There's nothing like this anywhere near where we found kirk's remains or the camera.

438
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,420
Well,he was killed somewhere else and moved.

439
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,160
If we find that outcropping,maybe we find the place where kirkas killed

440
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,570
and maybe we find my sister.

441
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,220
Did joseph recognize the rock?

442
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,010
Where?

443
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,260
It's easier I take you than explain.

444
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,500
okay,if joseph is a murderer,he's just sending you on a wild-goose chase.

445
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,450
Well,then we know he's the murderer and all we've wasted is a tank of gas in a goose chase.

446
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,500
How far out are we going?

447
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,560
A ways.

448
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,090
One week in the desert and there's nothing but bone left.

449
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,350
Same guy?

450
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,750
Looks like it.

451
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,970
I think it would be better if I went over the bones for particulates before you start your thing.

452
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,220
I disagree,and you can't have them unless I release them to you.

453
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,330
You're gonna have to do the "boss thing," boss.

454
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,230
Sir,dr. Brennan needs to know how this man died,which is my territory,

455
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,240
more than when and where he died.

456
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,030
Dr. Hodgins? --Even I can see he got shot in the back of the head.

457
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,780
What dr. Brennan needs is the murder scene.

458
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,610
It's the desert.Insects and particulates aren't going to narrow it down any more than that

459
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,200
We won't know that until i look at the particulates.

460
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,860
Dr. Hodgins will have access to the bones first,mr. Addy.

461
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,910
That's the wrong decision.

462
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,720
My lungs are going to come out through my throat.

463
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,260
You know,where I come from,when you say you're driving a ways,you know it means 45 minutes

464
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,540
Out here,it means four hours.

465
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,250
We've been driving five.

466
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,670
I maybe should have said quite a ways.

467
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,020
There it is.

468
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,990
Well... that it?

469
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,610
I think so.

470
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,800
Different time of day.

471
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,840
You people look for the exact spot the pictures were taken.

472
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,310
I'm gonna takenother circle in the truck.

473
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,250
Looking for your sister?

474
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,830
I think we want to go south slightly.Maybe southwest.

475
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,800
You can tell from the shadows?

476
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,770
and the angle on the outcropping.

477
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,700
Where's he going?

478
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,070
He's looking for his sister.

479
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,340
Either of you two bring any water?

480
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,500
Why?You worried?

481
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,160
About what?

482
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,200
Because we are way past where jesus lost his sandals.

483
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,530
And I don't hear the truck anymore.

484
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,590
No cell phone service.No water.

485
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,210
How long do you think we'll survive out here if the sheriff doesn't come back?

486
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,460
Three days,max.

487
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,920
Well,how far are we from the highway?

488
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,250
Five days,minimum.

489
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't like that math.

490
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,820
Wait a second.

491
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,290
Kirk's?

492
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,250
It looks like it

493
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,340
distributor's smashed.All the wires are pulled out.

494
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,150
It doesn't make sense that the sheriff brings us to the scene of the crime 

495
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,850
and then leaves us to die,does it?

496
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,160
One godforsaken part of the desert just as good as another godforsaken part of the desert.

497
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,730
We don't even know if sheriff dawes actually called alex joseph.

498
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,560
I mean,for all we know,he could have done all this himself.

499
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,300
Could dawes do that,ange?

500
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,120
Well,I always thought ben dawes was a good man.

501
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,390
It would take a lot to change my mind.

502
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,990
Well,like,being left to die in the desert?

503
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,560
These tracks here,they don't match the sheriff's vehicle,they're too wide.

504
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,400
Humvee maybe?

505
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,660
This is blood,I think.

506
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,740
The victim was kneeling here.

507
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,220
Bones.

508
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,740
Sorry.

509
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,500
He was dragged this way,then the blood trail ends.

510
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,680
He was thrown into the humvee.

511
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,910
We've got to be 200 miles from where we found kirk's bones.

512
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,170
You think the murderer drove that far to drop the body?Where are you going?

513
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,760
Boo... hey.

514
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,030
tracks,they stop right here.

515
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,540
What here?There's no here here.

516
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,200
Landing strip,huh?I knew this was about drugs.

517
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,520
mexico's about 80 miles that way.

518
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,430
yes.

519
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,300
Only angela could get a ride in the middle of nowhere.

520
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,710
Any signs of your sister?

521
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,050
She's been out there a week.

522
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,080
She could still be alive if she had a few canteens of water.

523
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,860
Humvee tracks,sheriff.

524
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,380
Alex joseph?

525
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,900
Catches kirk and dani out here...

526
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,250
sandy,this is dawes,do you receive me?

527
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,940
Loud and clear on the satellite,sheriff. Where are you?

528
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,960
Hell and gone.Listen,sandy,I need a deputy down at the clinic,

529
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,050
slap some cuffs on alex joseph.

530
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,140
Alex joseph took off,sheriff.We got no idea where he went.

531
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,140
Kellogg's humvee.

532
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,700
Sandy,go collect wayne kellogg's humvee and we'll see you in a few hours.

533
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,000
Any blood stains should flare a bluish-green when the luminol hits them.

534
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,690
Nothing.

535
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,730
Well,we know that kirk's body was put into the humvee.Tire treads match.

536
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,570
It's clean.Give kellogg his truck back.

537
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,350
Tell him sorry for the inconvenience.

538
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,380
Try the hood.

539
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,180
You think they tied kirk's bloody,dead body to the hood like an elk

540
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,930
then drove him 200 miles before dumping him for coyotes?

541
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,250
Even out here,people might notice.

542
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,440
Right there.

543
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,870
I'll be damned.

544
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,760
zack?

545
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,170
Yes,dr. Brennan?

546
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,380
I need to know if kirk's bones show more damage than can be explained by animal activity.

547
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,610
Preliminary analysis indicates that the pubic rami are fractured,

548
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,870
and the left hemipelvis is severely displaced.

549
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,820
Congruent with a fall?

550
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,770
Yes,dr. Brennan.Were the remains found at the base of a cliff?

551
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,910
He wasn't driven 200 miles.He was driven a cole hundred yards.

552
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,180
Loaded his body the airplane...then tossed it.

553
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,420
Zack,I'm not happy with how long it took you to get back to me on this.

554
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,200
We'll talk about it when I get back.

555
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,860
Sorry,dr. Brennan.

556
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,200
You could have told her it wasn't your fault.

557
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,230
I still have some work to do here.

558
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,830
They dumped kirk's body from a plane,then they could have done the same to dani.

559
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,070
well,kirk was dead when they tossed him,right?

560
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,330
Absolutely. And I saw no evidence of a second murder at the site.

561
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,170
Which leaves me hoping either my sister is kidnapped by drug dealers or 

562
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,840
dying somewhere in the desert.

563
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,050
Kidnapping's a federal offense.It's an fbi matter.I can help you,if you want.

564
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,590
brennan.

565
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,820
Dr. Brennan,those cell phone photos you nt me of engravings...

566
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,830
kellogg said it was a commissioned work.

567
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,880
I think these are engravers' plates.

568
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,720
For what?

569
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,130
Currency.To be exact,I believe these are dyes for the venezuelan 500 bolivar bill.

570
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,600
Dyes? Counterfeiters' dyes?

571
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,860
Yes.

572
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:34,060
Did you say "counterfeiters."

573
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,210
I got a warrant here to search your client's studio for engraving plates.

574
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,300
Well,as mr. Kellogg's attorney,I can advise you,you're certain to find some.

575
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,980
I'm an engraver.

576
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,040
Larry,did you tell wayne about how when someone dies during the commission of a felony,

577
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,310
everyone involved in that felony is charged with murder?

578
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,300
Counterfeiting is a felony.

579
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,260
My client will confess to the counterfeiting charges,

580
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,270
in return for immunity from the murder charge.

581
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,520
Not good enough.

582
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,220
He will also provide the time and place of the next pickup out in the desert.

583
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,040
You'll be able to arrest the actual murderers.

584
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,800
When sheriff dawes says "not good enough,"he means his sister,larry.

585
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,360
My client doesn't know anything about dani weber.

586
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,720
What does he know?

587
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,130
One week ago,I arranged to meet some associates at an airstrip in the desert

588
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,110
to pass on some commissioned artwork.

589
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,900
He means counterfeit plates.

590
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,600
As the plane landed,my associates noticed two people spying on them

591
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,090
from a vantage point above the airstrip.They became very agitated.

592
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,010
They commandeered my vehicle,and they drove up the hill.

593
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:51,340
I got my humvee,then I drove up there.But I didn't see anything.

594
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,430
Like blood on the hood of your vehicle?

595
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,560
Well... the fact remains that 

596
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,250
agreeing to this deal is the only way that you're going to catch the actual murderers.

597
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,790
You know where to find me.

598
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,460
Wayne,I need to know if they loaded dani on that plane.

599
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,850
I never saw dani 

600
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,040
Easy,sheriff.That's my sister. My sister!

601
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:24,060
I am truly sorry about dani,ben.Truly sorry. But I don't think wayne knows anything.

602
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,120
Come on,dawes.Easy.Come on.

603
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,770
I guess we're gonna have to take that deal,right?

604
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,430
I was trained as an army ranger.

605
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,210
That mean anything to you,sheriff dawes?

606
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,440
I'd be more than happy to go back out to that crime scene,

607
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,670
see if there's anything we haven't missed.

608
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,060
Appreciate it.

609
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,950
If you expect to win arguments around here,you will need at least one doctorate.

610
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,540
I am dr. Brennan's grad student.

611
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,980
I'm aware.

612
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,690
Once I get my doctorate,she will take on another grad student.

613
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,940
My job here will go to that person.

614
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,450
You have a first-rate mind,mr. Addy.

615
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,660
You can't assist dr. Brennan forever.

616
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,930
I really hope this is necessary.

617
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,710
He's comfortable here.

618
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:25,440
He's enamored with dr. Brennan, and he's stopped working on his thesis. It's necessary.

619
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:30,420
It's just...I like the guy.--So do I.

620
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,860
Which is why we must think of what's best for him.

621
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,970
It's time for mr. Addy to grow up.

622
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,190
So,you say dani knows the desert pretty well?

623
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,110
That's right.

624
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,960
If it were you here stranded,which way would you go?

625
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,200
Highway's about a five-day walk that way.

626
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,300
Mexico is three days that way,and...

627
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,060
that way's two days to a ranch.You might find some stock water,

628
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,680
but I wouldn't count on it.And the teain is rougher.

629
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,580
So,it all depends on how much water she had.

630
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,160
Is there any way to know?

631
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,610
All right,look,we'll take a point off this compass,all right?

632
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,070
Walk out in a straight line for 15 minutes, we look for tracks.Good?

633
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,490
You all right?

634
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,840
Dani went that way.

635
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,300
Okay.

636
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,320
You wanna go home?

637
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,400
You're not coming back again,are you?

638
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,240
No.Never.

639
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,960
He loved me.

640
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,130
For three weeks a year.

641
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,630
No.He loved me all the time.

642
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,200
I was the one who could only manage three weeks a year.

643
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,750
I'm afraid that I...

644
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,250
I'm just afraid that I don't have a generous heart.

645
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:19,390
I'm afraid that I won'T...have the chance that I had with kirk ever again.

646
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,580
You will.

647
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,450
How can you be so sure?

648
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,760
Because nothing in this universe happens just once,angela.Nothing.

649
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:39,880
Infinity goes in both directions.There is no unique event,no singular moment.

650
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,220
I don't know what that means.

651
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,140
It means you will get another chance.

652
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:53,070
You promise?From your heart?

653
00:41:53,330 --> 00:42:03,430
Better.From my head.And yes,ange,I promise...from my heart...

654
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,150
you will get another chance.

655
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,610
Well,dawes and his deputies,they caught the counterfeiters.

656
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,660
Dani gave a statement saying that it was kellogg who pulled the trigger on kirk.

657
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,220
Dani knows that you saved her life.You pointed that helicopter in the right direction.

658
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,380
Obviously,you subconsciously sifted through the rational facts of the case and 

659
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,920
processed the most likely scenario.

660
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,560
I'm sure that's it.

661
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,530
what else could it be?

662
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,680
Well,it's the only rational explanation.

663
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,890
Are you guys making fun of me?

664
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:42,970
you know,let's go back home.You know?Where there's water,shelter and living things.

665
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,830
Come on!
