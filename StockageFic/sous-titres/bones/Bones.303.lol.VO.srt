1
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:06,694
Aaron, where's Joey?

2
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:07,904
Taking a leak.

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,489
Buddy system.

4
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:10,653
Come on.

5
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:11,866
Which way did he go?

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,591
I don't know. Geez.

7
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,828
Joey's gotta whiz,
like, every ten minutes and I...

8
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,679
Trauma to the forehead.

9
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,681
Eyes full of maggots
and all you see

10
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:37,407
is the boo-boo on the forehead.

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,393
Hands bound in front of him.

12
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:42,063
Definitely not execution style.

13
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:44,548
What's the...
shiny stuff on the nose?

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,527
Some kind of emollient.
It's around his lips, too.

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,644
You get anything out of the boy
who found him?

16
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,546
Only thing came out
of the kid was vomit.

17
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:53,741
That would explain
the pervasive smell.

18
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,118
Why am I here? Dead guy.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,954
Foul play.
It's your main function.

20
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:59,425
With... bones.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,958
This is... very meaty,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,983
there's a bit of bone here.
And... there.

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,671
And look at all the maggots.

24
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,756
Bones, I said, not "bugs".

25
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:10,455
Lividity looks fixed.

26
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:13,427
So, it's not a body dump...
he was killed here.

27
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,191
This is all flesh.

28
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:17,088
Why'd you call me in on this?

29
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:18,144
Wasn't me.

30
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:19,392
- It was me.
- Why?

31
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:21,477
Is it because you're trying
to think of excuses

32
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,229
to put Booth and me
together on cases?

33
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,814
I wouldn't do that, Dr. Brennan.

34
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:27,650
'Cause we worked things out
and we're fine. Right?

35
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:28,943
Yeah. Hundred percent.

36
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,237
That's... That's not
why I called you in.

37
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,279
Then why?

38
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:35,962
- Feet are missing.
- Because his feet are missing,

39
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:38,428
which... suggests bone trauma,

40
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:40,496
which immediately suggested you.

41
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:41,747
Oh, look at that.

42
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:43,554
Blood.

43
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,146
Do you think that's from...

44
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,504
the wound on the forehead?

45
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:47,837
No. Too much.

46
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:51,146
All right, looks like the blood

47
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,092
trail stops here.

48
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,844
You want the honor?

49
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,964
The honor is all yours.

50
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:04,291
I got a foot...

51
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,315
Me, too.

52
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:10,023
Find a third one, and I'll be impressed.

53
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:15,239
I estimate time of death
at or around four days.

54
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:17,491
Hodgins took a look
at the maggots and agrees.

55
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,763
Trauma to the frontal bone
would have been fatal.

56
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,996
Yeah, and tissue damage indicates
some kind of blade.

57
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,488
So does bone damage.

58
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:26,932
Dr. Brennan,
you aren't being competitive

59
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:28,836
between flesh and bone, are you?

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,713
It's possible.

61
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,967
Absence of pronounced ecchymosis

62
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,128
on the wrists

63
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,122
indicates the hands
were bound post-mortem.

64
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,472
Consistent with the feet.

65
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:42,391
No hemorrhagic tissue.
They were removed post-mortem.

66
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:45,531
- Was that competive?
- No, I'm hearing a tone, but...

67
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,021
it could be my imagination.

68
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:49,200
Angela's going to be hypnotized.

69
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,360
Why?

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,569
She's going deep into her subconscious
to remember her husband's name.

71
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,509
So we can find him,
divorce him, get married ourselves,

72
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:58,107
and live happily for all eternity.

73
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,506
You won't live for eternity.

74
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,891
I thought you had a name.

75
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:01,981
A name for what?

76
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,021
Angela's husband.

77
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,099
Birimbau.

78
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,208
But our private investigator
says it's a nickname.

79
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,711
You can't get much off a nickname.

80
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,752
Birimbau is... "little flute".

81
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,170
Brazilian.

82
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,245
What?

83
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,760
A "little flute"?

84
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,565
I'm suddenly filled
with a sense of...

85
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:18,629
well-being.

86
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,082
The jury is out on the efficacy

87
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:21,893
and validity of recovered memories.

88
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,833
That's great. Speaking of names,

89
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,101
I... ran the vic's prints.
I got a hit.

90
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:27,853
Ed Milner, from Maryland.

91
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:30,564
The shiny substance you found
on the victim's nose and mouth...

92
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:31,954
it's sunscreen.

93
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,902
Per the manufacturer,
"it protects and maintains

94
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:38,072
the natural color of coats,
manes and tails."

95
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:41,534
Coats, manes and tails. Oh, my...

96
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,202
Formulated for horses.

97
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,575
Any human applications?

98
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:47,234
The manufacturer recommendsagainst
use on human skin.

99
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:50,863
Guys, contents
of the victim's stomach are corn,

100
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:53,254
raw oats and dried molasses.

101
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,156
- Horse food?
- FYI.

102
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:56,881
There's such a thing
as too much fiber.

103
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,898
All right, I can draw inferences
from multiple equine implications.

104
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:01,787
What?

105
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,543
She's going along
with the horsey theme.

106
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:07,351
Incised wounds extending
into the periosteum of the maxilla,

107
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:09,854
between the molars and premolars.

108
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,661
What?

109
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,608
His teeth and jaw show evidence
of a bit.

110
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,321
His name is "Ed."

111
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,182
Why is that funny?

112
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:23,619
As in, "A horse is a horse..."

113
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,327
Of course, of course.

114
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:27,705
The famous Mr. Ed?

115
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,246
Mr. Ed?!

116
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:38,007
Bones S03E03
"Death in the Saddle"

117
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,843
Capture: swsub.com

118
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:46,557
Sync: Shadow

119
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:03,532
--==All-about-Subs.fr

120
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:07,485
He was supposed to be in a corporate
retreat in Orlando, Florida.

121
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,499
He's in marketing.

122
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,612
Are you able to identify your husband's
body from that photograph?

123
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:15,240
Yes, that's Ed.

124
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:18,447
I don't understand...

125
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:21,216
who could've done that.

126
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:26,618
We found your husband's body
just outside Harrisonburg, Virginia.

127
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:28,739
Virginia?

128
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:32,979
Did he... mention any
recent disagreements?

129
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:36,835
- Friends, co-workers, family members?
- No.

130
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,244
Ed was one of "those guys."

131
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,193
When we got married,
we owned an apartment building.

132
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,913
If a tenant couldn't afford the rent,
Ed would cut him a break.

133
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,369
That's how he was with everyone.

134
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,600
Do you have a ranch?
Own a racehorse,

135
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,488
- a pony ride, anything like that?
- No. Why?

136
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:57,845
Did Ed ever go to the racetrack?
Rodeos?

137
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:01,505
I'm not sure Ed even ever saw
a real horse up close and in person.

138
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:02,819
Why?

139
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,845
I don't have anything concrete,

140
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:07,653
right now, but when
I do I'll let you know.

141
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,338
Hey!

142
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:18,466
Hay is for horses.

143
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,201
Hey, that's funny, Bones.

144
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,087
I found it on this Web
site about horses.

145
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,169
- Yeah?
- Where do horses stay in a hotel?

146
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,031
Bridle suite.

147
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:30,441
- That's correct.
- So, did you find out anything useful?

148
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:33,170
The hooves of champion thoroughbreds

149
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,236
are buried separately
from their corpses.

150
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:38,490
The hooves represent "power"
and are given their own resting spot.

151
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,056
Our victim's feet were separated
from his body.

152
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:44,099
The victim's wife said
he was at a corporate retreat.

153
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:46,743
And his boss said he took time off
to spend with the family.

154
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,113
- He lied.
- Yeah, they could all be lying.

155
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:52,304
How did you know the answer
to the bridle suite joke?

156
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:53,696
I have a five year old son.

157
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,330
Hey, have you seen Brennan?

158
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,920
You just missed her. Booth tracked down
the victim's last credit card

159
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:09,094
purchase to a country inn in Virginia.

160
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:10,987
Why? Do you need her?

161
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,163
No, I was sort of hoping
that she needed me.

162
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,628
Well, I admire your work ethic
but she didn't say anything to me.

163
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,280
What about you?
You need anything?

164
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:23,768
I am weighing human organs.
Not really your thing.

165
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:25,818
Right. Okay.

166
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:28,703
Are you passing the time until
you're hypnotized?

167
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:32,669
- Did Hodgins tell everybody?
- Oh, he's excited, we all are.

168
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,264
Delving into the subconscious to find
the name of the mystery husband?

169
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:37,898
Very romantic.

170
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,073
Yeah, well, it won't be so romantic
when I divorce him.

171
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,539
Romantic for you and Hodgins when you
can finally get married. You nervous?

172
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,034
No. No, I'm annoyed.

173
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,388
I know about this hypnotism thing.

174
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:53,495
I was a magician's assistant at
a little gypsy carnival in Brazil.

175
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,122
Now, that's an opening line.

176
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:58,274
Mysteria was really cute
and I was younger then and...

177
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:01,488
the whole being sawed in half thing
was actually kind of hot.

178
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,428
We were talking about hypnotism.

179
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,775
Right. Well, this guy

180
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:09,396
could rub an alligator's stomach so
I could stick my head inside its mouth,

181
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,633
but every time he hypnotized people,

182
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,471
it was always a scam.

183
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,491
Angela, therapeutic hypnosis
is a proven technique.

184
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,274
Electroencephalography shows
an increase

185
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:22,411
in activity in the the cerebral cortex
which opens the subconscious.

186
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:23,530
Really?

187
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:26,151
Yeah, it alters the alpha
and the theta waves.

188
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:28,785
Read the Stanford University study.
It's not a party trick.

189
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:29,858
You read that?

190
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,971
And I've been hypnotized myself.

191
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,482
- Why?
- I was in Vegas.

192
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,477
I got called up on stage,

193
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:42,607
and apparently, I clucked like a chicken
in front of 3,000 people,

194
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:44,578
but I have absolutely no memory of it.

195
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:47,447
Was this little episode
in the Stanford study?

196
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:48,727
No, it should have been.

197
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,615
For the next three days, every time
someone said "coffee,"

198
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,159
I'd cluck. Awkward.

199
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,390
Okay, why am I not feeling
better about this?

200
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:59,051
Trust me. No crazier than you drinking
kava and marrying a giant in Fiji.

201
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,382
And Hodgins seems to be pretty
cool with that, so...

202
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:05,082
if he wants you to try hypnosis
I'd say get drowsy.

203
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:07,679
I guess you're right.

204
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:10,229
- I've done crazier stuff than this.
- Yeah.

205
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:12,341
- What can happen, right?
- There you go.

206
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,337
- Coffee?
- Kidding.

207
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,809
It's been two years.

208
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,344
So you say you're with the FBI.

209
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:38,366
That is the third time
he's shown you his I. D.

210
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:40,384
Why would I know this man?

211
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:43,088
Because we have his credit card
history and you're part of it.

212
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:44,692
Sir, why are you being so difficult?

213
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:46,125
Not difficult.

214
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,667
Discreet.

215
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,497
What do you do? Run a service
for cheating husbands?

216
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:53,947
Call in the SWAT team.
They're anything but discreet.

217
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:57,788
O-Okay, okay, that's Mr. Ed.

218
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:01,710
A horse is a horse,
of course, of course?

219
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,388
That's the general idea, yes.

220
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:06,853
Come with me, please.

221
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:14,929
The Ambassadora is a place where people
come to indulge in pony-play fantasy,

222
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,533
24 hours a day,
without fear of judgment.

223
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,732
Mr. Ed is a pony.

224
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,780
Is this some kind of sex thing?

225
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,236
How'd you get there so quickly?

226
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:26,214
The man said "fantasy."
I just made the leap.

227
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,165
Ed took off a couple of days ago,
which was odd, since he pre-paid.

228
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:31,589
Pre-paid for what?

229
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,523
Oh, we're... we're in the middle
of what you might call our convention.

230
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,668
So, unless this is really important,
I'd rather not disturb my guests.

231
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,888
Well, two miles from here, in the woods,

232
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:45,905
Mr. Ed was found dead.

233
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,115
What's going on here?

234
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:56,482
It's a fetish.

235
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,351
So the idea here is that

236
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,831
one of them is the horse
and the other one is the rider?

237
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,100
- Basically.
- Well, this isn't about the horses.

238
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,651
It's about a dominant versus
submissive balance of power,

239
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,779
a variation on sadomasochism.

240
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,392
Those people are eating from troughs.

241
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,805
Do you think that's sexy?

242
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:16,788
Fetishism is a way of indulging
in sexual activity

243
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,806
without actually engaging emotionally

244
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,325
with the other person
as a fully formed human being.

245
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,577
Okay, sex is all about engaging.

246
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,996
You don't want to engage,
you just stay home and... you know.

247
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,724
They have masturbation fetishes,

248
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:31,610
often involving women's shoes
or undergarments.

249
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,581
Can we just talk to Mr. Ed's
mistress, dominatrix, whatever.

250
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,750
I'm going to have to talk to a few
people and ask permission to "out" them.

251
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,869
We have three lawyers,
a half a dozen doctors...

252
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,794
Excuse me, we need to speak
with Mr. Ed's groom?

253
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,839
Whoever... rode him last?

254
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,198
It's a great way to cut
to the chase there, Bones, okay?

255
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,669
All right, FBI.

256
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,690
And, sir, could you turn your behind
around so it's behind?

257
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,267
My name in the world is
Anne Marie Ostenbach.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,552
- Here, I'm Annie Oakley.
- Naturally.

259
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,705
So Mr. Ed is dead?

260
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,480
How well did you actually know him?

261
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,169
Obviously, she knew him very well.

262
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,586
Sexual fetishes are
all about role playing.

263
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,713
She probably never knew his real name.

264
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:21,326
We met online over a year ago.

265
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:24,353
We were a match-- I mean,
compatible in every way.

266
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,958
You have no idea how hard
it is to find the perfect pony.

267
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,413
Don't look at me.

268
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:31,439
Mr. Ed was easy to handle,
but he wasn't mindlessly obedient.

269
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:32,988
Okay.

270
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,984
And yes, we had sex,
if that's your next question.

271
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:39,699
When did you first meet in person
so that you could, you know...

272
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,569
- ride him?
- Six months ago.

273
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,087
I fell in love with him.

274
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:47,363
Meaning, what, a little light whipping?

275
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,030
When I say "love,"
I don't mean romantically.

276
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,074
I mean the way a young girl
feels about her first pony.

277
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,526
Have you ever heard of anything
like one pony fighting another?

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,790
No. No, pony play is not like that.

279
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,106
Mr. Ed's body was found
only a few miles from here.

280
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:05,953
Evidence on the body
suggested an equine fetish.

281
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:07,708
So you understand why we might think

282
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,536
that someone from your sex game
community killed him?

283
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,045
You should talk to his wife.

284
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:13,344
- His wife?
- His wife?

285
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:15,816
Yes, she showed up here and
the next morning, Ed was gone.

286
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:19,555
Well, he didn't just run off and join
a band of wild mustangs now, did he?

287
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:23,176
You know, I'm speaking to you willingly,
without a lawyer present,

288
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,140
you could at least pretend
to show me some respect.

289
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:27,861
Yeah, I'll try.

290
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:31,772
The night Ed took off,
I was in the stables with him.

291
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,846
I'd worked him hard that day
and was rubbing him down.

292
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,581
Which is when she caught us.

293
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:38,947
Did you know he was married?

294
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:42,323
I didn't want to marry the man,
I just wanted to play with the pony.

295
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:44,435
How did he react when he saw his wife?

296
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:46,680
He never broke character.

297
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,995
- What?
- He remained a pony.

298
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,654
I finished rubbing him down
and I went to bed alone.

299
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:53,786
The next morning at breakfast,
he was gone.

300
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,499
I assumed he went back to his wife.

301
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,481
Okay, I'd appreciate
if you kept the fact

302
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:59,827
that Ed Milner was murdered
to yourself.

303
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:05,838
What's worse?

304
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:09,125
Okay, finding out that
your spouse is having an affair

305
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:13,052
or finding out that
he has a secret life as a pony?

306
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:15,516
Pony fetishism has been
around since the Greeks.

307
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,534
Had to have been the wife, right?

308
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:20,384
Aristotle extolled the joys
of being ridden like a horse.

309
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:21,608
Aristotle also thought

310
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:24,251
that the purpose of the human heart
was to solve math problems.

311
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,801
I'm surprised you know that.

312
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:28,078
Oh, it turns out I'm smarter
than a fifth grader.

313
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:31,903
In Victorian England,
scantily clad women

314
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,375
put on erotic shows dressed as ponies.

315
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,402
Just saying, wife sees some woman
in a harness rubbing her husband down

316
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,132
while he's nibbling on oats?
That's harsh.

317
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:43,740
In 16th century Turkey,
the king kept stables of pony girls

318
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,245
and pony boys for his pleasure.

319
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:47,020
Okay, the king of Turkey was a freak.

320
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,615
Why are you being so judgmental?

321
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:53,137
When you turn someone into an objective
sexual pleasure, it's wrong.

322
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,200
How do you know?

323
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,124
- It says in the Bible.
- It does not.

324
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,845
Then it got left out by mistake.

325
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,184
We are all hard-wired differently.

326
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,767
If someone needs to shout "giddyup"
to heighten arousal,

327
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,691
what's wrong with that?

328
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:09,031
Maybe if Ed lived like a man,
he wouldn't have died like a horse.

329
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:10,931
That's all.

330
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,851
You knew your husband
wasn't in Florida.

331
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,510
Yes, I lied.

332
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:18,658
Why?

333
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:22,242
I was married to Ed for nine years.
We have kids.

334
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,685
My first concern was to make sure that

335
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:27,138
they didn't find out
their father was a pervert.

336
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:28,945
So his fetish was a surprise to you?

337
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:30,760
Try a complete shock.

338
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:34,515
Why would Ed do that?
We had a good sex life.

339
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:36,572
More likely, there was a part
of your husband

340
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:38,840
that could never have been
satisfied by love alone.

341
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,874
Bones, that's one of those-- we...

342
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,046
how did you track him down?

343
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:44,091
What?

344
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,490
Well, I mean, you didn't just,
you know, wander into his,

345
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,246
his stable, or paddock, or whatever.

346
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:54,086
No, I really did think he was
in Orlando on a business trip.

347
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,971
- I got a call.
- From whom?

348
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:57,034
A man.

349
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:01,478
He said Ed was with another woman
and told me where I could find them.

350
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,919
He didn't mention the pony stuff.

351
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,226
- Did you recognize his voice?
- No.

352
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,119
Anything distinctive at all?

353
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,697
An accent.

354
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,985
Australian maybe, English.

355
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,857
So, you walked in on Ed and his...

356
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,423
- Rider.
- Rider.

357
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,503
Is that what they call it?

358
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,451
What happened next?

359
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,259
I got the hell out of there.
I drove home.

360
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,808
Did you hear from him again?

361
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,545
No, I engaged a divorce
attorney right away,

362
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,962
who said all communications
should go through her.

363
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,168
Did anyone see you come
home that night?

364
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,280
Why is that important?

365
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:41,386
I think you know why
that's important, Mrs. Milner.

366
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,407
Agent Booth, if I had killed my husband,

367
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,933
then I wouldn't need a divorce
lawyer, would I?

368
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:51,688
No, but you would need an alibi.

369
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,401
So, you don't think she did it ?

370
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,121
- No.
- You want to put that down?

371
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,265
Why, because of the whole
lawyer/alibi thing?

372
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,189
No, because of the feet cut off thing.

373
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:07,279
It was ritualistic.
The killer knew about horses.

374
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:10,877
Or maybe she started cutting
him into little bits

375
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:14,576
to scatter across the countryside and
it was too much work for her or maybe

376
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:17,588
it made her sick.
Or he wouldn't fit in the trunk.

377
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:19,598
Booth, we are immersed
in a culture here.

378
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:20,912
Pony play is a culture?

379
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:24,072
Anthropologically speaking.
And not just because of the feet.

380
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:27,866
Ed's hands were tied together.
Historically, ranchers bound

381
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,081
the front two legs of horses
to prevent them from straying.

382
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,946
Not to mention all the other equine
attributes associated with this case.

383
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,246
Yes, this is a culture and
we need to investigate accordingly.

384
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:41,688
- Do you still think she did it?
- No, not now.

385
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,167
We need to find the mystery caller.

386
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:47,194
If he had a reason to contact Ed's wife,

387
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:50,002
he had a motive to murder him.

388
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:52,177
Right, so, what, back to
the Ambassadora?

389
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:54,759
- Giddyup.
- Yeah...

390
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,738
Don't, don't say that.

391
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,878
There were radiating of the wound,

392
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,059
which suggest the tip
of the blade was blunt.

393
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,820
I'm trying to determine
the type of weapon.

394
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:08,666
Fill the negative space with microsil,

395
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,150
thus determining the approximate
shape of the blade's tip.

396
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,204
Yes.

397
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:17,583
You know, this guy got his rocks off
pretending to be a horse.

398
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,039
- Yes.
- I've never tried that.

399
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,171
I pretended to be a horse
a lot as a child,

400
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:23,757
but there was no sexual component.

401
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:25,327
What melon is in season?

402
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,118
Why?

403
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:28,964
Once I've I. D.'d a possible
murder weapon,

404
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,874
we'll want to compare an exemplar
to the entry wound.

405
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,041
Cantaloupe.

406
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:44,192
Okay, what is this, a sicko rodeo?

407
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:48,111
Stylized movements, posturing as a kind
of sexual signal.

408
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:50,004
Who are these people?

409
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,928
In real life, they tend
to be very orthodox.

410
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,410
You heard what Lucky said,
they're lawyers, judges, FBI guys.

411
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,960
Oh, this is not normal.

412
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,017
- It's...
- It's what, Booth?

413
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,543
You're not interested in...?

414
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:04,725
Pony play?

415
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:08,072
No, but I'm the first to admit
that in sexual situations,

416
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:10,411
I have indulged in role playing.

417
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:12,930
Hey, you know what, it's getting
a little warm out here.

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,831
Any leads?

419
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:18,867
We were wondering if any of the riders
or ponies has an accent.

420
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:20,595
Thor.

421
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,723
That's good.
You're doing good.

422
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,366
He grew up in England.

423
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,391
- With Annie Oakley?
- Yeah, that's right.

424
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,175
You know, I'm going to need
Thor's actual, normal, human name.

425
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:30,650
- Calvin Johnson.
- Calvin Johnson.

426
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,782
That's great, come on.
Thanks.

427
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,237
Come on! Higher!

428
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:37,725
We all indulge in role playing
in sexual situations.

429
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,220
Oh, not me.
Completely normal here.

430
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:43,283
Booth, anytime you look at a woman
and make the judgment

431
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:45,263
that she's beautiful,
you're objectifying her.

432
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:49,354
And anytime I put on lipstick and nice
clothes, I'm objectifying myself.

433
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,575
It's more subtle than what these
people are doing,

434
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,718
but otherwise, it's the same dynamic.

435
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:57,558
You wearing lipstick, Bones,
it's not like this.

436
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:59,536
Calvin Johnson?

437
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,672
Calvin Johnson.

438
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:04,808
He's wearing a bit gag.

439
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,685
Could I help you take that off?

440
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:09,117
No, not until I say so.

441
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,925
Well, we either talk to him here
or we all go downtown

442
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,959
and he misses a whole day
of horsing around.

443
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:17,855
How do you release him from his pony
personae? Is it a word? A motion?

444
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,632
Oh, just tap him on the forehead.

445
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:24,832
So what's up, then?

446
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,080
Hardly even knew Ed.
Never even spoke to the guy.

447
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,598
Oh, then why'd you call his wife?

448
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,899
Well, I'm fairly certain
you can't prove that was me.

449
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,345
She recorded the call.
We can do voice analysis.

450
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,532
You know what, and if you lie, we'll
charge you with obstruction of justice.

451
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,536
And public display of sexual
paraphernalia.

452
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,786
Okay, then yes, I called her.
So what?

453
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:46,375
Why'd you call her, Calvin?

454
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:47,516
Swap recipes.

455
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:50,384
He did it so that he could have
Annie Oakley as his groom.

456
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,823
Oh, come on, ratting on a guy to his
wife is hardly a federal crime, is it?

457
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,472
How'd you get his home phone number?

458
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,521
It was under "home"
on his cell phone.

459
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:58,682
Ed Milner's an idiot.

460
00:20:58,713 --> 00:20:59,714
Was an idiot.

461
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:02,202
Now he's a murder victim.
So what happened there, Thor?

462
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,177
Ed's wife showed up, but to your
chagrin, she left without him,

463
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,157
so you do what you had to do
in order to get your groom back.

464
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,974
Annie's one hell of a jockey,
but she's not worth killing for.

465
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,962
I did not kill Mr. Ed.

466
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,888
I may enjoy being dominated
by the ladies

467
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,046
from time to time,
that doesn't make me crazy.

468
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,713
Might want to look in a mirror there,
my friend Flicka.

469
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:23,834
No.

470
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:26,946
I went to Stanford Law.
Clerked for a federal judge.

471
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:30,122
Might want to rethink your actions
there, Agent Booth?

472
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,266
Thank you.

473
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:40,918
- Yeah, he's got motive.
- He knows about horses.

474
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,585
What was with all the lying?

475
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:46,049
We've got voice tapes and public display
of sexual paraphernalia?

476
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,842
It was role playing.
I was being all lard ass and good cop.

477
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:52,080
Hard ass and bad cop, Bones.

478
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:54,129
Hard ass and bad cop.

479
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:01,933
What's going on?

480
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:04,421
You first.

481
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:06,658
Cantaloupes.

482
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,098
Zack and I need them for an experiment.

483
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,616
Of course you do.

484
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:13,964
I talked to Dr. Jasper, that hypnotist.

485
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:16,209
- Yeah?
- She asked me to bring in photos.

486
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,791
But all I could find are these.

487
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,529
I'm not sure those'll going
to any help.

488
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,608
Which is why I'm looking
for the wedding photo.

489
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:26,612
You were married on the beach
at dawn in the middle of nowhere.

490
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:29,514
Well, when I got off the phone
with Dr. Jasper, I remembered

491
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,175
that somebody snapped a Polaroid
of me right after I said "I do."

492
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:36,719
And I stuck it in a book as a bookmark,
but I, I can't find it.

493
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:42,183
You know, I really hate going
through this story of marrying a guy.

494
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,213
I didn't even know his name.

495
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,521
People are looking at me like I'm nuts.

496
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,484
You are.

497
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:49,767
Thanks a lot.

498
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:52,497
Come on, Angie, embrace the irony.

499
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:55,923
It's what makes you you.
You married him,

500
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:58,566
then you're going to marry me.
None of it makes any sense.

501
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,942
I'm supposed to take advice

502
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:02,289
from a guy who's walking around
with honeydew melons?

503
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:05,074
Cantaloupes, it's a common
mistake, and hey...

504
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,209
you need to relax.

505
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,808
You want me there when you go under?

506
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,437
I can hold your hand or something.

507
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:17,808
I'm not "going under."
I'm being hypnotized.

508
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:25,433
Okay, this is me walking away
with my melons, so you can relax.

509
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:29,019
I love you. Psycho.

510
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:40,170
The weapon was blunt,
an inch wide and curved.

511
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:41,272
That's unusual.

512
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:43,932
- Not if you're a horse.
- I'm not a horse.

513
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:47,037
But the victim was.
At least he pretended to be one.

514
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:49,234
What is that?

515
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,291
A hoof knife.

516
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:53,568
They're curved to conform with
the natural shape of a horse's foot.

517
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,665
Could I have one of those honeydews?

518
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:57,331
It's a cantaloupe.

519
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,177
My research shows
the horses was slaughtered

520
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,865
by a single blow to the forehead.

521
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:06,764
All right now, I'm thinking that we
should place the melons at exactly

522
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,942
five-foot-11, which was the victim's
height.

523
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:11,317
Now, we should devise
a plan to pull the cantaloupe away

524
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:13,316
because he most likely
saw the knife coming...

525
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:16,155
OK, fine.

526
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:20,199
You know, we used to think
things through together.

527
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:22,514
Oh, I-I apologize.

528
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:26,151
It's possible that my time in Iraq
transformed me into a man of action.

529
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:28,106
I'll watch out for that.

530
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,703
Looks like we found the right weapon.

531
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:35,467
Mr. Ed wasn't just playing like a horse,
and having sex like a horse.

532
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:39,065
He was slaughtered like one, too.

533
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:44,295
The victim's hands were tied together
like this with baler's twine.

534
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:45,646
Bales of hay baler's twine?

535
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,932
Yup. It's embedded
with a UV protective filament

536
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:50,060
that prolongs the life
of the twine in sunlight.

537
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:53,037
The technology is patented,
and they sell directly to the consumer.

538
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:55,379
They had only 228 sales last year.

539
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,682
Booth can get a warrant to identify all
the pony players and cross reference.

540
00:24:58,714 --> 00:24:59,903
I'm on it.

541
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,166
Hodgins? Hodgins?!

542
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:09,743
Is somebody there?

543
00:25:11,182 --> 00:25:12,340
Hodgins?

544
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:14,522
Why don't you just open your eyes?

545
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,996
Sweetie.
It'll break the spell.

546
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,514
What spell?
Are you still hypnotized?

547
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:22,233
No.

548
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:24,761
- It never took.
- Why?

549
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:28,875
Because that doctor said
that I wasn't relaxed enough.

550
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:31,214
Can you believe that?

551
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:34,132
I mean, how would she know
if I'm relaxed or not?

552
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,632
Well, you're twisting your bracelet,

553
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:40,339
your voice is half an octave
higher than usual,

554
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:43,390
- and you smell like nervous sweats.
- Oh, don't say that.

555
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:46,941
Really?
I'm going back there at 6:00.

556
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:49,272
She says that if my pulse
rate is still above 60

557
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:51,619
that she's going to push
me off till next week.

558
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:53,395
Rapid pulse rate, high blood pressure,

559
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:56,102
they're indicators of
emotional distress.

560
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,129
What, you think I don't want
to be hypnotized?

561
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,663
I simply made a factual observation.

562
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,379
You think I'm afraid
of disturbing old memories?

563
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:08,522
You think that somehow
I-I like this idea

564
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:11,792
of Birimbau as some sort of
untouchable fantasy figure?

565
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:14,749
That somehow finding
his real name will just

566
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:17,275
bring him down to earth
and make this whole

567
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:20,419
mishegas banal and uninteresting?

568
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:24,846
I don't know what mishegas means.

569
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,661
I'm not sure I know
what any of that meant.

570
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,355
Why do I feel like I need
to apologize for something?

571
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,945
I'll be ready next time, okay?

572
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,213
You'll see.

573
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,215
Could you excuse me... sweetie?

574
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:44,024
Hey, shut that door behind you?

575
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,619
You recognize that?

576
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,308
Yeah.

577
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:57,935
That'd be twine.

578
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:00,453
Fairly specialized stuff?

579
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:02,972
Doesn't deteriorate in the sun.

580
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:06,320
Only the best for your pony clients.

581
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,831
You got it off one of my hay bales?

582
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,646
Got it off the corpse of Ed Milner.

583
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,485
Do I need a lawyer?

584
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:15,183
That's your call.

585
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:16,356
I didn't kill Ed.

586
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,953
We traced the owner of that twine
to the Ambassadora Ranch.

587
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:21,652
Any of my guests could have taken
this twine off my hay bales.

588
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:24,593
Your company used to be co-owned
by your ex-wife till recently?

589
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:25,995
I paid her off in the divorce.

590
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,933
Your ex-wife being
Anne Marie Ostenbach?

591
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:31,023
Rider named Annie Oakley?

592
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:32,807
Ed Milner's sex partner.

593
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:35,795
You can see how things are starting
to line up against you here, Lucky?

594
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:37,774
We aren't married anymore.

595
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:40,186
You're going to tell me
that it doesn't bother you

596
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:43,427
to see your ex-wife playing
sex games with other men?

597
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:50,631
What's that?

598
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:51,929
It's a warrant.

599
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:55,003
I already told you, I've got
that twine all over the ranch.

600
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:56,723
We'll be looking for a hoof knife.

601
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:57,952
I've got a hoof knife.

602
00:27:57,982 --> 00:27:59,359
Great. And it was stolen.

603
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:00,623
Four days ago from my truck.

604
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:01,691
Did you report the theft?

605
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:04,160
Come on. Like the cops are going
to care about a $10 knife.

606
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,544
Think I know who did it, though.

607
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:06,607
I'm listening.

608
00:28:07,046 --> 00:28:10,066
I have a rider client named Tom Mularz.

609
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,757
Couple days ago, he starts passing out
fliers advocating the consumption

610
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,006
of horse meat, but what do you expect
He's a butcher.

611
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:17,199
Why did he break into your truck?

612
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,579
Well, I took the fliers from him,

613
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,957
I tossed them in the truck,
and I kicked him out of the convention.

614
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,918
So, he took back the fliers
and the hoof knife?

615
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:25,274
I don't know. All I know is,
I came out the next morning,

616
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:27,117
the fliers were gone,
so was the knife.

617
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:32,063
That is the same morning
that Ed Milner was missing.

618
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,219
You just figured that out.

619
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:42,133
Oh, I found something very interesting.

620
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:46,052
The victim's feet were severed
from the body with remarkable skill.

621
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:49,676
Excellent insight, Zack, but
the polite response is,

622
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:51,553
"Really, Hodgins?
What did you find?"

623
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:55,659
There's a sharp force disarticulation
from the distal tibia

624
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,232
and fibula, passing cleanly
above the talus.

625
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:02,589
No. I wasn't asking you.
I was telling you you should ask me.

626
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,015
Really, Hodgins?
What did you find?

627
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,917
The feet were severed
with the hoof knife.

628
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:10,779
- I know.
- Because I told you.

629
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:14,158
No, because I examined the cuts under
the confocal laser-scanning microscope.

630
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:15,919
How did you find out?

631
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:19,697
Traces of steel left on the skull match
traces of steel left on the feet.

632
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:22,786
- Same weapon.
- Same weapon.

633
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:26,674
Do you suck all the fun at every
moment of a personal triomph?

634
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:34,402
I hate the smell of a butcher shop.

635
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,696
Oh, maggots and rotting faces
and burst guts don't bother you,

636
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,338
but the smell of a butcher shop does?

637
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:43,492
It's a very small step between selling
dead meat and making meat dead.

638
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,878
I'm considering becoming a vegetarian.

639
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:47,081
Not me.

640
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:49,140
Yeah, that's why
I said, "I," not, "we".

641
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:52,018
Zack said that the killer
was adept at cutting through bone.

642
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:53,919
- Like a butcher.
- Yeah.

643
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:55,366
"Horse Meat

644
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:58,941
Sweet, Rich, Lean and Soft."

645
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:00,333
Can I help you?

646
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:03,038
Yeah, we're looking to score
some horse meat.

647
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,985
Unfortunately right now, there's only
two slaughterhouses in the U.S.,

648
00:30:06,032 --> 00:30:07,490
and they don't export to Virginia.

649
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,836
Oh, that's a shame.
You Tom Mularz?

650
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,486
Why?

651
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,692
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
This here...

652
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,493
Go around, cut him off.

653
00:30:19,144 --> 00:30:20,834
Stop, or I'll kick you
in the testicles.

654
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:25,641
You are strong.

655
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,242
Well, you know,
I try to stay in shape.

656
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:29,333
Stop, or I'll kick you
in the testicles?

657
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,378
It worked.

658
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:33,250
I'll tell you what, you and me,
we're going to work on the cop talk.

659
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,223
What did you hit me with?

660
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,253
A building.

661
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,078
You know what? I've been thinking
about the psychology of all this.

662
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:43,053
All right, you know, I know
that you hate that,

663
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,645
but just go with me here, okay?

664
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:46,843
Tom is a butcher.

665
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,159
He advocates the consumption
of horse meat.

666
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,957
Ed Milner was horse meat.

667
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:53,648
I can see that. Symbolically.

668
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,160
- Who's Ed Milner?
- Mr. Ed ring a bell?

669
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:00,124
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

670
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:01,624
Oh, man.

671
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,207
He was a good pony.

672
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:05,794
Okay.

673
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:07,516
Did you ride Mr. Ed?

674
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,738
No. No. I'm a... I'm a rider,

675
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:13,257
but I prefer female horses.
I just...

676
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:16,081
I just admired his... his style.

677
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,811
Why did you throw me into a wall?

678
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,290
Why did you run?
Well, you're FBI.

679
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,979
Oh, I need a little bit more than that.

680
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:27,822
I'm a deserter.

681
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:29,887
They send the FBI after deserters.

682
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,483
A deserter from what?

683
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,362
The National Guard.

684
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:38,180
I signed up to save people from floods
and earthquakes and stuff,

685
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:40,003
but not to kill them.

686
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,082
We found your fingerprints
on Lucky's truck.

687
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,397
Well, I broke into it to get
my fliers back.

688
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:46,618
- They're mine.
- Your horse meat fliers?

689
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,420
Why can't they see that if we revere
horses sexually,

690
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:53,526
then eating their flesh is an act
of holy communion?

691
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,236
You know what?
There's crazy pony players,

692
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:00,425
then there's really whacked out
crazy pony players.

693
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,684
Yeah.

694
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:06,277
What did you do after you got
your fliers back?

695
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,934
I drove straight to my folks in Jersey.

696
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,991
- When did you get there?
- Before midnight.

697
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:13,800
They can vouch for me. And plus, I got
credit card receipts from gas.

698
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:15,411
You deserted the National Guard.

699
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,022
I'm not a killer.

700
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:18,203
You're a butcher.

701
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,674
Well, not a people butcher.

702
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,707
I'm innocent.

703
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:27,319
How am I doing?

704
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,652
Because the pressure of having
to have a low pulse

705
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:32,777
could be driving my pulse up, and I in
no way want to be penalized for that.

706
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,518
58 beats per minute.

707
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,184
Very nice, Angela.

708
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,163
I did some deep breathing.

709
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:43,974
You're not going to make me
cluck like a chicken, are you?

710
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,052
Sorry.

711
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,430
Bombs away.

712
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,870
Let's begin.

713
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:54,493
Angela, close your eyes.

714
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,013
Take a deep, cleansing breath in...

715
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,275
and out.

716
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:06,215
Very good.

717
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:07,999
Take in another breath.

718
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,254
And out.

719
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:16,463
Focus on your arms.
They're very heavy.

720
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:20,382
Imagine them sinking into your chair.

721
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:25,722
Got your page. What's up?

722
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:28,819
Whan you washed the maggots
from the eye sockets,

723
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:31,986
were there any remaining
ocular tissue at all?

724
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:34,661
No. Little buggers ate the eyes
clean through to the bone.

725
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:37,023
I have an alternate explanation.

726
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,431
For the eyes missing?

727
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:43,641
Check out the tiny nicks around
the supraorbital process,

728
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,698
the lacrimal bone, the sphenoid.

729
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:48,303
You think the killer gouged
out the eyeballs?

730
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:51,291
I think "gouged" is a good description,

731
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:53,551
using some kind of curved instrument.

732
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,084
Probably the hoof knife.

733
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:58,057
The murder, cutting off the feet,
gouging out the eyes.

734
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:00,434
This was a bloody, violent killing.

735
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:02,562
Killers are often driven by fury.

736
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:04,776
No, Dr. Brennan.
The feet weren't lopped off.

737
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:07,569
They were removed carefully.
The eyes were gouged out.

738
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:10,729
This was done by someone
who was not squeamish about flesh.

739
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:13,388
The butcher's alibi checked out.

740
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:19,200
Booth said some of those pony people
were lawyers, judges and doctors.

741
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:22,172
- You think a doctor did this?
- Someone who is good with a knife

742
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:24,394
and not afraid of blood.
Sounds like a doctor to me.

743
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:27,396
Annie Oakley is a doctor,
and she was the victim's groom,

744
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,986
but she wasn't the only doctor
at the convention.

745
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:33,787
I found evidence of sperm in
Ed Milner's urogenital track.

746
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,226
Why is that relevant?

747
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:38,559
Annie Oakley claims that she rubbed
down her pony and then went to sleep.

748
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,867
You think she had one last romp
with the decedent?

749
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:45,270
If she lied about that,
what else is she lying about?

750
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,127
Very good.

751
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:53,288
We're ready now to begin the journey.

752
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:57,183
If you can hear me, Angela,
nod your head.

753
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:00,687
Very good.

754
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:04,356
You're on the island
of Vatulolo in Fiji,

755
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,241
in the village of Nakavala.

756
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,028
I'm pretty sure I'm on the Rialto
Bridge in Venice.

757
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,728
No. You're on the beach in Fiji.

758
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:18,835
In front of you is a red door.

759
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:21,502
No. There's not.

760
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,780
I need for you not to fight me, Angela.

761
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,595
Do you see the door?

762
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,488
I see the door.

763
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,396
When you pull the door open,

764
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:33,072
your husband will be standing
in front of you.

765
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:37,460
When you see him, you will
greet him by his proper name.

766
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,658
I'm going to pull it open.

767
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,574
Pull the knob.

768
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,615
Angela, I'm going to count to three,

769
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:55,752
and when I reach three,
you're going to open up your eyes.

770
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:58,928
You're going to feel relaxed
and refreshed.

771
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,620
You're going to remember everything,
but you're not going to be scared.

772
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:05,702
One, two, three.

773
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:15,970
Did it work?

774
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,803
Angela, you need to tell me
your husband's name.

775
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:22,392
I opened the door...

776
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:25,059
and I saw a wasp.

777
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:27,562
A White Anglo-Saxon Protestant?

778
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,356
No, a big, flying, stinging insect.

779
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:33,296
Buzzing around your husband's head?

780
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:36,660
No, it... no, it was the size of a,
of a human being.

781
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:39,281
It was a very large human being.

782
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:40,564
I see.

783
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,325
What does that mean to you?

784
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:45,727
Nothing.

785
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:47,824
- It must.
- I'm sorry.

786
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,482
I have no idea.

787
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,213
Well, you're not what I would call
a compliant personality.

788
00:36:53,283 --> 00:36:54,441
This is my fault?

789
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:57,969
Well, perhaps another session,
we'll explore this wasp.

790
00:36:58,211 --> 00:37:02,685
Yeah, and next time I'll open
the door to what, a giant snake?

791
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,071
I don't think so, Doc.

792
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,893
You're an eye surgeon, Dr. Ostenbach.

793
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,832
Ed Milner's eyes were cut out
of his head.

794
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,992
Whoa. Don't you have to wait
till I call my lawyer?

795
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:16,822
We have the right to execute
the warrant.

796
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:18,492
You have the right to call your lawyer.

797
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,334
Lucky, Sparkles is a litigation lawyer.

798
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:23,689
Oh, a lawyer named Sparkles.
Now I'm, I'm shivering.

799
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:26,959
Look... you're making a mistake.

800
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,938
I did not kill Ed Milner.

801
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,848
She actually killed her pony Mr. Ed.

802
00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:33,615
Look, I loved Mr. Ed.

803
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:37,120
But he didn't love you back.
I mean, not enough to leave his wife.

804
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:40,648
What happened, Annie, did he talk to you
before you slapped him on the forehead

805
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,526
and you turned him into a human being?

806
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:43,887
You don't know anything.

807
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,843
Well, I'm pretty sure that he told you
he was going back to his wife

808
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:50,519
and you convinced him to engage
in one last session of pony play.

809
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:53,663
You took Lucky's truck out to the
pasture, you had sex with him,

810
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:55,220
and you... finished him off.

811
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:56,878
Hiding in plain sight.

812
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,999
Thanks for making this part easy.

813
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,103
Th-That's a hoof knife. So what?

814
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,538
Your DNA will be on the handle
and Ed Milner's blood on the blade.

815
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:07,923
Mr. Ed's blood.

816
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,192
Your pony misbehaved,
so you stabbed him in the forehead.

817
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:13,241
You cut off his feet,
you bound his wrists,

818
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:16,769
but his human eyes were staring back
at you, so you gouged them out.

819
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,069
I left my husband for him.

820
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,699
I left Thor for him...

821
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,687
and he was going to leave me?

822
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:33,185
What was I supposed to do?

823
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,611
- Hey.
- Hey.

824
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:44,385
So... I... I looked up "wasp"
in dream theory.

825
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,560
- I love dream theory.
- I know you do.

826
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:50,753
And guess what I found:
A wasp signifies anger and envy.

827
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:52,989
Bees are good.

828
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,992
- Any chance it was a bee?
- No, Jack.

829
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:02,366
A book about nuclear radiation
creating a giant wasp.

830
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:04,423
I was reading it in Fiji.

831
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:07,021
I mean, between all the snorkeling
and the...

832
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:08,991
- Sight... seeing.
- Let's go with that.

833
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:11,127
- What's it mean?
- Look inside.

834
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,677
That's Birimbau.

835
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,641
His face is turned so there's
still not much to go on.

836
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:23,285
- The guy is a giant.
- Flip the picture.

837
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,805
"Angie and Grayson."

838
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:29,378
His name was Grayson.

839
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,224
Grayson Barasa.

840
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:34,517
Once I say the first name,
the rest of it just flows out.

841
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:37,834
- Grayson Barasa.
- You did it, Angie.

842
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:40,900
You really do want to find him.

843
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:42,973
I really, really do.

844
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,522
To divorce him?

845
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:46,321
I want a divorce.

846
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,403
And then I want a wedding.

847
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,013
There are many health benefits
to being vegetarian.

848
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,641
It's a rational choice in a world
where food supplies...

849
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,208
are affected by global warming issues.

850
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,008
What about global taste issues?

851
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,692
Is that meat sweet, rich,
super lean, and soft?

852
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:30,142
What? Does it taste like horse meat?

853
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:32,496
Maybe you should consider
going vegetarian, too.

854
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:35,114
I didn't lose my appetite because
you mentioned horse meat.

855
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:38,473
I lost my appetite because you made me
think about all those people

856
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,500
parading around pretending
to be something they aren't

857
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:44,144
just so they could have crappy sex.

858
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:45,389
How do you know it's crappy?

859
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:47,375
Gotta be, Bones.
Come on, it's gotta be.

860
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:48,453
Why?

861
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:52,607
Why?

862
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:54,931
I'll tell you why.

863
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:58,138
Here we are, all of us,

864
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:03,167
basically alone, separate creatures,
just circling each other,

865
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:06,484
all searching for that slightest
hint of a real connection.

866
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:10,458
Some look in the wrong places, some--
they just give up hope

867
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:12,499
because, in their mind,
they're thinking,

868
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:14,415
"Oh, there's nobody out there for me,"

869
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,678
but all of us, we keep trying
over and over again.

870
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:21,627
Why? Because
every once in a while...

871
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:24,647
every once in a while, two people meet

872
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:28,128
and there's that spark, and yes, Bones,

873
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,506
he's handsome and she's beautiful,

874
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:32,688
maybe that's all they see at first,

875
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:35,535
but making love...

876
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:39,109
making love...

877
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:43,529
that's when two people become one.

878
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:51,102
It is scientifically impossible for
two objects to occupy the same space.

879
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:53,687
Yeah, but what's important is we try,

880
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:56,910
and when we do it right, we get close.

881
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:00,101
To what?
Breaking the laws of physics?

882
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:02,448
Yeah, Bones... a miracle.

883
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,352
Those people

884
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:10,591
with their role-playing and their
fetishes and their little sex games,

885
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,398
it's crappy sex,

886
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:15,449
well, you know, at least
compared to the real thing.

887
00:42:19,526 --> 00:42:20,675
You're right.

888
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:22,093
Yeah, but...

889
00:42:24,973 --> 00:42:27,376
Wait a second, I just won
that argument?

890
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:28,406
Yep.
