1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,592
These remains from the Iron Age were found
at the bottom of shaft three at the site.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,990
Five sets of remains were found.
This is the only one found whole.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,231
- He's in good shape.
- 1500 years old - he shouldn't look this good.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,348
Which is why we're here. We authenticate
the finest set of Iron Age remains ever found,

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,718
or dash the hopes of a thousand scholars.
Let me know how it turns out.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,679
Dr Goodman, this is prestigious.
Arert you going to be a part of the team?

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,548
- I have an institution to run.
- Didrt you used to be an archaeologist?

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,110
Yes, Mr Addy. Thanks for reminding me.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,952
X-rays, pictures - we'll do this without
touching the skeleton as much as possible.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,430
- Kid gloves?
- Latex should be all right.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,111
- Zack, were you being metaphoric?
- I decided to give it a shot.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,953
Which is also metaphoric.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,711
I need a receptionist.
I can't have just anybody waltzing in here.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,870
Take a look at this.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,919
- A bunch of red circles?
- Each circle is where a body part was found.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,434
- Is it an airport?
- Los Angeles International.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,718
- Pathologist says remains are in bad shape.
- So they punt it to the FBI?

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,270
Airports fall under federal jurisdiction.
Nice use of the word "punt".

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,557
I can't go to LA.
I have an Iron Age warrior to authenticate.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,870
Iron Age warrior? When was the Iron Age?

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,669
- 1500 years ago.
- Fresh body bits are a little bit more urgent.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,639
There are more fresh bodies
than perfect specimens from the Iron Age.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,950
When you say that, it's just to bug me, right?

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,838
- Do we have to go through this every time?
- Exactly.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,310
Booth can'tjust say,
"Pack your bags, we're going to LA."

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,595
Yeah, the whole Ice age warrior thing.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,875
Iron Age. And that's not the only thing.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,509
Homeland Security has asked Dr Brennan
to identify three bodies in...

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,070
- I'm not allowed to say.
- The point is, Dr Brennan is in great demand

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,709
on several pressing cases
and she's needed here at the museum.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,316
- Why should I send her to California?
- Sexy case in Hollywood?

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,632
How much more good press
could the Jeffersonian get?

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,109
But, Dr Goodman, you said the Iron Age
warrior was of the highest priority.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,237
I can step in on that case.
You pack your bags.

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,310
This car doesn't feel very FBl-y.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,871
Bones, this is a 1966 Mustang. It's a classic.
What goes better than that with the FBI?

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,157
How come on the rental agreement,
you made the guy write sedan?

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,310
Come on, we're in California!

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,075
- Look. Palm trees.
- You know, I'd like to drive sometime.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,516
- Our contact is Special Agent Tricia Finn.
- I'm an excellent driver.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,670
- OK, Rain Man.
- I don't know what that means.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,675
I'm always going to drive. Me behind
the wheel and you on the grandma side.

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,629
I'm not above telling Deputy Director Cullen
what kind of car you rented.

44
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,678
Do you want us to do something
orjust stand here and watch?

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,593
- I'm getting a feel for the fella.
- A feel?

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,319
No bugs on him.
Havert been for over 1,000 years.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,392
- There may be spores and pollens, correct?
- Probably not.

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,314
Dozens of pollens have been discovered
from the Cretaceous era. When was that?

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,552
65 million years.
That was a pretty good comeback.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,154
We have to be at the top of our game.

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,949
We all know you'll say,
"I'm unable to authenticate with confidence."

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,474
- Why?
- When you declare something authentic,

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,030
you risk being proven wrong.
That doesn't happen if you equivocate.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,148
As head of the Jeffersonian, he'll place the
reputation of the institution over everything.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,313
I'm an archaeologist.
My findings will be congruent with the facts.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,871
With all due respect,
you used to be an archaeologist.

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,353
I have no idea what's going on
between you two right now.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,993
- Agent Finn, why was the body removed?
- Call me Tricia, Dr Brennan.

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,516
It was removed because
parts were visible to arriving flights.

60
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,991
Here's a map of the crime scene. There's a
marked cone at the location of each body part

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,470
and each photo corresponds to a cone.
That's how they do it in your book.

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,472
- She got that from me.
- This is not a dismemberment.

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,677
Are you sure, Bones?
This is Los Angeles. They're showy.

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,550
Is it possible the parts were ground up
in a landing gear, then dumped on landing?

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,509
The dispersal rate is wrong. It looks to me like
the body was pulled apart by a pack of dogs.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,909
- More likely coyotes.
- Coyotes?

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,195
- We got coyotes everywhere.
- You know that?

68
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,400
- No, I thought coyotes were a cowboy thing.
- I'd like to see the remains now.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,753
<i>(Bones)</i> I need the dirt, silt, pieces collected
with the body parts sent to the Jeffersonian.

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,992
You know what I like? When there's no flesh
on the bones. Just a personal preference.

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,913
- There's not much left anyway.
- You know, Dr Brennan,

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,551
as a screenplay writer myself, I'd be happy
to help in any way I can with your movie.

73
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,519
- Excuse me?
- They're making your book into a movie.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,919
Say something, Bones.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,313
All I know is I'm supposed to meet some big
movie producer while I'm here, if I have time.

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,756
Does the pathologist need any access
to the remaining soft tissue?

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,354
No. He got everything out of it he could.

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,390
So my screenplay is about this FBI agent
who is on the trail of a former boyfriend...

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,359
- Oh... Um... God.
- It's OK if you have to leave.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,955
- This is not good.
- Thanks for that insight.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,238
No. I mean, the architecture of the skull
has been radically altered.

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,393
By rotting and being eaten by coyotes
and having the face ripped off by you?

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,153
No. By surgery.

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,754
Lots of surgery.

85
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,594
I'm not sure I'll be able to tell who this was.

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,028
- Are you getting the feed, Zack?
- Yes, I'm looking at the x-rays.

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,874
I'm going to have the bones cleaned,
but there's still vestiges of flesh.

88
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,839
- Hodgins got the clothing remnants and silt.
- Are you there, Ange?

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,990
Hey!

90
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,355
Is it sunny, sweetie? Tell me it's sunny.

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,829
It's sunny. I sent you the entire skull.

92
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,036
- You want a reconstruction?
- If you can.

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,270
If I can? Have I ever failed you?

94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,511
This one's different.
You'll see what I mean. Zack.

95
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,830
- I'm here.
- I make this a young woman.

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,878
- Early 20s from the look of the x-rays.
- Cause of death?

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,033
I see evidence of stabbing. One hit
to the sternum, two to the costal can'tilages.

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,638
- Estimated time of death?
- Body was in the open for a week to ten days.

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,759
The marks on the bones suggest carnivorous
feeding beyond insects and rodents.

100
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,831
- Coyotes.
- They have coyotes?

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,514
- Yes.
- That'll explain the dispersal of remains.

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,718
A pack of coyotes finds the body, pulls it
apart and spreads out to eat in solitude.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,712
- The teeth are veneered.
- The jaw has been broken and reset.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,314
Same with the right leg.
You seen any movie stars?

105
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,551
- No. Why?
- Apparently it's a contest when you go to LA,

106
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,076
in which the winner is the person
who sees the most celebrities.

107
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,196
- You have a whole skull, right?
- Yes.

108
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,558
- So why is this going to be so difficult?
- You'll see. Ange, on the Iron Age project,

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,110
Goodman does this thing,
Hodgins isn't going to like it.

110
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,873
- What thing?
- He theorises in a way.

111
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,034
It sounds like he's making stuff up. It's hard
to explain, but it's going to irritate Hodgins.

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,193
Honey. You're in California.
Forget the Iron Age.

113
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,912
Say these words: Sky Bar.
Go there tonight. Tell me everything.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,312
Dr Brennan, one of these x-rays
shows two dark clumps near the pelvis.

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,470
Behind what's left of the spleen?

116
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,154
I got a list of missing persons
of women in their 20s.

117
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,994
Oh, do I really have to be here for this part?

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,398
- Think she swallowed that?
- Could be she was a drug mule.

119
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,917
- It's an implant. Breast implant.
- Those come with serial numbers.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,118
We should be able to identify our victim
in a couple of hours.

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,988
Unlike other burials in which the remains
were found in a semi-fetal position,

122
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,030
this fellow was found on his back, arms at
his sides, with a piece of antler on his chest.

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,908
- Do you actually need me here?
- The antler honours him as a hunter,

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,275
although his weapons
tell us he was a warrior.

125
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,876
He was in his mid-30s when he died.
He was 1.8 metres tall.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,317
- There's the Hollywood crime to sift through.
- Six foot one?

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,076
A big man for his time. Feared by his foes,
respected by his neighbours.

128
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,029
- You encourage that much conjecture?
- His bones bear the marks of battle.

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,429
His weapons are of good quality, well used.

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,069
He was old for a warrior,
yet how did he die, Mr Addy?

131
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,390
Looks like tuberculosis.

132
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,632
A proud man.
It's not the ending he would have wanted.

133
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,195
Yet he was surrounded by family and friends.

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,271
- A good death.
- Oh, please.

135
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,794
You're describing a scene
from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

136
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,678
- I liked that movie.
- He was buried with respect.

137
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,675
Weapons, jewellery.
His family did not stint or pilfer.

138
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,513
- Have you found any spores or fungi?
- Yes.

139
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,675
They correspond both with the time he lived
and the geography in which he was found.

140
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,433
- What?
- I'd like details.

141
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,397
- A written report?
- Yes.

142
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,838
Our findings will have to bear
scholarly scrutiny from our peers.

143
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,476
What's his problem?

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,318
- My hotel doesn't even have a pool.
- You're welcome to use mine.

145
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,079
- The breast implant lead went nowhere.
- What about the serial numbers?

146
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,994
They were stolen six months ago. Victim
must have got them off the black market.

147
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,073
- There's a black market in breast implants?
- We have the name of the doctor.

148
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,355
Who uses a black market breast implant?

149
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,910
Back alley plastic surgeons use them.
They're not even real doctors.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,833
- Are you writing the screenplay?
- What screenplay?

151
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,993
- The one based on your book.
- Maybe the producer I'm meeting will tell me.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,359
OK, guys, let's turn our attention back
to the murder victim. I'd like to visit Dr Boobs.

153
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,352
If implants were stolen from him,
he won't know anything.

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,512
Because it's the only lead
that we've got, Finn,

155
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,152
and leads are great for screenplays
or even, say, if you're working a real case.

156
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,278
<i>(Booth whistles)</i>

157
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,829
I have something for you.

158
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,957
- <i>(sighs)</i> Is it chocolate?
- No.

159
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,032
Then I find my interest has flagged.

160
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,830
Nice. Who is it?

161
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,957
It's the Hollywood murder victim.

162
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,110
Oh, my God.

163
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,112
I see what Brennan means.
This womars had a lot of surgery.

164
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,636
- What's with Goodman and Hodgins?
- They're guys.

165
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,029
They should lay 'em out on the table
and measure.

166
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,352
- Lay what out on the table and measure?
- OK, awkward moment.

167
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,036
Let's just say they have different approaches.
And they're guys. OK?

168
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,908
- I'm a guy.
- You're more highly evolved.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,710
This girl didn'tjust change her face, she
changed her skull. This'll make Brennan nuts.

170
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,313
- You know one thing.
- What?

171
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,349
She's gonna be beautiful. Why go through
all this pain and not end up beautiful?

172
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,513
Do the names Michael Jackson
or Joan Rivers mean anything to you?

173
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,114
One of them. The other I'll look up.

174
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,028
Every culture nurtures ideals of beauty
toward which people strive. Fine.

175
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,433
But in the future, people will look back upon
the surgical alterations of the nose or breasts

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,514
with the same horror we regard binding
of feet or bronze coils to extend the neck.

177
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,673
You want to speak up cos it's hard to hear
every word in this quiet waiting room?

178
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,036
It's barbaric. It's painful. It's wrong.

179
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,035
This murder victim may never be identified
cos a glorified barber with a medical degree

180
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,556
had the arrogance to think
he could do better than evolution.

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,474
- Know what producer you're meeting?
- My publisher didn't give me a name.

182
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,917
- I don't know what a producer does.
- Nobody does. But it's really important.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,471
- Dr Kostov will see you now.
- You can remain here, Agent Finn.

184
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,551
Yes, sir.

185
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,398
- You recognise this, Dr Kostov?
- High profile, double lumen, full C saline.

186
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,029
It's from a shipment of implants
you reported stolen six months ago.

187
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,475
You're returning one implant to me?!

188
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,519
- I found it in the remains of a murdered girl.
- Any implants been recovered?

189
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,230
Yeah. Three weeks ago. A faulty one had to
be removed by a surgeon out in the Valley.

190
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,151
- From whom?
- A Heidi.

191
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,708
- What's that mean?
- LA-speak for call girl.

192
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,997
LAPD can tell you what agency
the girl was working for.

193
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,551
- You have the most beautiful bone structure.
- I can't take credit. It's genetic.

194
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,154
- How old are you?
- Why do you want to know?

195
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,075
It's never too early to watch problem areas -
the jaw, the little pouches beneath the eyes.

196
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,311
- Do you mind?
- You touch her, she'll break your arm.

197
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,790
- She thinks what you do is...
- Barbaric.

198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,556
No. Don't look at me.
I like my face the way it is.

199
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,237
- <i>(Angela) I'm having a bad time with the skull.</i>
- Did you fill in the surgical scoring?

200
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,835
I can't be definitive.
All the usual indicators have been modified.

201
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,071
I reconstructed three facial variations.

202
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,234
She had her cheek bones shaved,
her chin changed, herjaw reconstructed.

203
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,949
That's just her bones. We don't know
what she did to the soft tissue -

204
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,792
her nose, her brows, her cheeks.

205
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,599
Start with her basic architecture
and go from there.

206
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,069
<i>The basic architecture is what I can't find.</i>

207
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,789
- Make a best estimate.
- Did you just tell me to guess?

208
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,589
No. I said make a best estimate
based upon your experience and expertise.

209
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,071
OK. Well, dress it up however you want,
but it's still a guess.

210
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,029
Look, my experience
and my expertise don't extend to this.

211
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,475
A facial reconstruction might not be helpful.

212
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,836
Angela, I told you it'd be hard.
Just do what you can.

213
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,357
OK, Bren, you're being
a little edgy and tart with me.

214
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,238
And all I'm trying to do is tell you the truth.

215
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,838
What this young woman did to herself, it's as
if she completely removed her own identity.

216
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,994
<i>Who hates herself so much that she not only</i>
<i>changes her looks, but her core architecture?</i>

217
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,074
If we don't know who she is, then how
will we catch the person who murdered her?

218
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,756
- Is that your way of apologising?
- Yes, Angela.

219
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,515
I accept. I love your guts, sweetie.

220
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,872
<i>(Bones)</i> According to LAPD, a black market
breast implant from the same shipment

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,475
- was in another girl from Aphrodite Escorts.
- <i>(Finn)</i> Missing anyone?

222
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,473
We're not looking into your business.
We're just trying to solve a murder.

223
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,030
- I haven't heard from Rachel in two weeks.
- Is that unusual?

224
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,193
I prefer to ask the questions
my own way, Agent Finn. Thanks.

225
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,635
Rachel booked out at a one-week rate.

226
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,714
She knows to check in if the client wants
to extend the contract. It's time to worry.

227
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,997
Do any of these women resemble Rachel?

228
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,193
If I had to pick one,
this is the closest, but not really.

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,390
- Rachel have a last name?
- Rachel wasrt even her real first name.

230
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,357
She goes by Rachel LaChance.

231
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,557
Rachel went to Vegas
with a long-time customer.

232
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,631
I need his name.

233
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,756
Miss Bardu, it's always the same story.

234
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,991
Beautiful young woman,
somebody wants to meet her,

235
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,833
somebody can't have her, somebody dies.

236
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,275
Dr Anton Kostov.
An assembly line nip-tucker in town.

237
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,676
- If that's all?
- Do you have a card, Miss Bardu?

238
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,351
We provide a law enforcement discount.

239
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,635
Do you have any idea what Rachel
looked like before plastic surgery?

240
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,711
Which time?

241
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,320
The skull is in extremely good shape.

242
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,712
Cranial measurements are congruent
with ancient Saxons, Celts, and pre-Aryans.

243
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,351
- Which matches the location of the find.
- I used Saxon tissue depth for the markers.

244
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,432
However, every skull requires
its own unique demands.

245
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,511
Are you certain of your calculations?

246
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,717
More certain than I am
on Brennars Hollywood hooker case.

247
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,794
This is a Pict. "Picti" actually means
"painted ones" in Latin.

248
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,316
The Romans feared them.
Very little is written about them or by them.

249
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,076
- Fierce warriors falsely reported to be small.
- He's a Pict. So what?

250
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,439
The Picts are from the far, far north
of the British Isles, far above Hadriars Wall.

251
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,435
The remains were found at an archaeological
site in southern England, near Wales.

252
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,195
- A Pict can't go for a walk?
- His remains are an archaeological anomaly.

253
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,239
This is unique in that no Pict
has ever been found this far south before.

254
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,551
If we remove the clothing
and take a closer look at the bones...

255
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,155
- It's a face. Maybe Angela got it wrong.
- Hey!

256
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,554
Or Zack screwed up the measurements. This
Pict business sounds like one of your stories.

257
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,278
Enough.

258
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,030
- Are you trying to get fired?
- Science is no country for storytellers, baby.

259
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,357
Kostov knew Rachel as a patient
and she knew him as a client.

260
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,874
Kostov wasrt the victim's
only plastic surgeon.

261
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,157
These are ten-times magnifications
of the jawbone surgery.

262
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,836
- Kostov doesn't do work this sophisticated.
- So she had more than one plastic surgeon.

263
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,071
Zack Addy. I live to serve.

264
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,152
This facial surgery,
the edges of the bone are almost scalped

265
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,118
as if the blade simultaneously
cut and applied torsion.

266
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,318
You need to know if this is sanctioned
by the American Medical Association.

267
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,198
You think Kostov
is performing illegal surgery?

268
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,068
It won't help us discover her identity,
but it might help us catch her killer.

269
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,037
- That's the point, Bones.
- What?

270
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,157
- To catch the murderer.
- I'm sending you a catalogue.

271
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,789
Soil samples, pollen, particulates, etc,
that were on the body parts.

272
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,633
Nothing too surprising
except for e-glass fibres.

273
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,871
- She didn't pick that up in a field.
- It's marine fibreglass.

274
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,239
The victim was on a boat before she died.
Also, look. It's a fingernail. Probably hers.

275
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,153
I sent it to the FBI crime lab
to run DNA tests.

276
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,950
That's zirconium, not a diamond,
so I guess she wasrt a high-class prostitute.

277
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,316
All the perturbations
are consistent with recent surgeries,

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,599
except for fractures in the right tibia and
fibula, which indicate traumatic compression.

279
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,753
The victim had her leg crushed,
probably in a car accident around age 13.

280
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,434
- That's my cellphone!
- I analysed the molars.

281
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,433
Oxygen and strontium in the enamel
indicate early childhood in New England.

282
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,671
The dentin suggests six to ten years
in Southern California.

283
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,513
Miss Bardu, hi. I reconsidered your offer.

284
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,354
- Can I have one of your ladies?
- You're ordering a prostitute on my phone?!

285
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,034
Did Rachel ever do a two-on-one special?

286
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,112
- The old two-on-one special. Classic.
- What's a classic?

287
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,239
- Just send whoever she worked with most.
- You're ordering a hooker to my hotel?

288
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,153
- Did you say hooker?
- How come I never go on these trips?

289
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,595
You have looser daily allowances than I do.

290
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,956
Well, have fun.
I have to get up early tomorrow.

291
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,510
- Why?
- I'm meeting that producer.

292
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,553
Oh, you're one of those guys.

293
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,712
- What guys?
- Those guys who say they just want to talk.

294
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,268
I do just want to talk.

295
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,989
- I'm an FBI agent.
- OK, I get the drill.

296
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,071
What am I playing?

297
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,070
No, really, Leslie, I...

298
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,594
I really am an FBI agent. I just want
to ask you some questions, that's all.

299
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,070
- About what?
- About your friend Rachel.

300
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,349
I'm sorry, but I think...
I think she's been murdered.

301
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,993
This can't be happening.

302
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,232
God.

303
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,073
Rachel was so nice.

304
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,632
She was really an actress.
You know, the way I'm really a singer.

305
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,837
We all say we're something different
than what we are.

306
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,912
None of us want to be what we are.

307
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,719
- Do you know Rachel's real name?
- Candice. Candice Hayden.

308
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,631
But I doubt that was her real name.

309
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,554
She said she was from Stockton, but I said
I was from Coeur d'Alene and was lying.

310
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,835
Know why anyone
would want Candice dead?

311
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,388
We see things we shouldn't all the time.

312
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,358
We know things about powerful people
they don't want us to.

313
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,034
Did Candice have anyone in her life?

314
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,759
Nick... for a while.

315
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,833
I forget his last name,
but he played some kind of terrorist on <i>24.</i>

316
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,195
He got killed in, like, four seconds.

317
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,875
- Nick know that Candice was a call girl?
- No. Not at first.

318
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,952
And when he found out, he was really mad.

319
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,713
He smashed out all the windows of her car.

320
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,712
I'm sorry, miss,
but you're gonna have to leave.

321
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,951
I don't know what your problem is,
but this is my little sister.

322
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,750
I'm visiting from Coeur d'Alene. I asked her
here for a drink, which is taking a long time.

323
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,994
- I'm sorry, sir. But we have strict rules...
- You might want to have a little respect.

324
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,629
And check on those drinks for us, OK, pal?

325
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,915
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

326
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,871
Thank you.

327
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,196
So we're just gonna sit here and have a drink?

328
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,953
- That's all?
- That's all, Leslie.

329
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,272
Have a drink. Enjoy the view.
Pretend we belong.

330
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,469
And later, catch a murderer.

331
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,835
Agent Booth, can I have a moment, please?

332
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,635
Um, have I done something to offend you?

333
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,554
I'm not really into this West Coast
"in touch with your feelings" thing.

334
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,837
Yeah. I'm really good at my job.

335
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,596
And I've been nothing but cooperative
and helpful to you, but you just freeze me out.

336
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,908
Mm-hm.

337
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,510
I know you've nothing against working with
women cos you're partners with Dr Brennan.

338
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,716
So your problem must be with me.

339
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,157
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I just don't like the way you view the FBI.

340
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,834
- What do you mean?
- This is a proud and noble job,

341
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,070
but you're using it to get to something else.

342
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,314
My advice: Write your script, get an agent.
Hell, have a little plastic surgery.

343
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,474
But quit using my FBI as a stepping stone
into something that you think is better,

344
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,393
because in my book there is nothing better.

345
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,838
I'm here with Penny Marshall, one of the most
prolific "hyphenates" in Hollywood.

346
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,630
Actress, producer, and director of such hits
as <i>A League of Their Own</i> and <i>Big.</i>

347
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,314
Her latest project is <i>Bred in the Bone,</i>

348
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,112
a thriller based on the novel by crime-fighting
anthropologist Dr Temperance Brennan.

349
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,398
- OK, so how did this all come together?
- I have no idea.

350
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,632
Well, my brother Gary
gave me the book and I liked it.

351
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,998
Then this bidding war started. And I usually
don't get into that kind of thing, but...

352
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,074
- That's gotta be a thrill for a first-time author.
- I wasrt actually there.

353
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,709
You must be a big fan of Penny's films.
So which one's your favourite?

354
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,271
Well, I enjoyed her humorous treatment
of the time-space paradox.

355
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,229
<i>Big</i>!

356
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,630
That's very funny. Time-space paradox.

357
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,950
Penny, who is gonna write the script?

358
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,315
Don't I get to do that?

359
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,239
- We'll talk.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

360
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,993
Cut, stop, whatever you say.

361
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,436
Brennan. Well, I want to come with you.

362
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,751
I have to go
cos we have a suspect and I have to go.

363
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,877
Would you look at that... passion!

364
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,315
Pretty good chance one of these
leaping losers is our killer.

365
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,278
- You always think it's the boyfriend.
- He loved her.

366
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,590
He found out that she was a prostitute.

367
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,277
I'd say anyone who plays this stupid game
is capable of murder.

368
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,990
Well, then we've got this case sewed up.
Why don't you just go and arrest them all?

369
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,310
Excuse me, guys. Ladies.

370
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,316
Ladies, gentlemen, excuse me. Please.

371
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,719
- You're excused.
- Anyone who isn't Nick Harvison get the ball.

372
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,871
God, she was so sweet.

373
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,958
I thought about
getting back with her, even though...

374
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,871
You broke all the windows in her car?

375
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,475
What would you do if you found out
your girlfriend was a prostitute?

376
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,836
- When did you last see Rachel?
- Sandra.

377
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,957
Her name was Sandra Cane,
at least as far as I knew.

378
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,034
- When did you last see Sandra?
- About a month ago. I was tending bar.

379
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,908
- Did you speak to her?
- No. No, I was working.

380
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,436
So was she. But I didn't kill her.

381
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,069
How could you not know what she was doing
for money? Did you know her at all?

382
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,153
She said she was modelling.
The thing about Sandra is that,

383
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,869
as pretty as she was,
she was just never pretty enough.

384
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,590
She'd be all black and blue and then she
would heal and she would look beautiful.

385
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,559
I mean, really beautiful. And we'd be sure
something was gonna break for her.

386
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,995
Then, of course, it wouldn't.

387
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,035
And then she would be back
in front of that mirror.

388
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,315
And no matter what I said...

389
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,273
Look, I never knew her.
I never understood her.

390
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,989
I'm probably the last guy
you should be asking about her.

391
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,357
- He's an actor. Of course he's convincing.
- I don't know. He doesn't seem to work much.

392
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,514
He's playing volleyball
in the middle of the day. Just an observation.

393
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,392
- I have an announcement.
- You are unable to authenticate the skeleton?

394
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,517
- That is correct.
- Told you.

395
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,354
Given the inconsistencies between
the specimers geographic location,

396
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,477
physiognomy and artefacts,
I cannot authenticate the find.

397
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,551
Is this because of how I made him look?

398
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,155
Cos there's an amount of subjectivity
involved in recreating a face.

399
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,552
A certain amount, yes.
But the fact is, he displays Pictish features.

400
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,677
For all we know,
this skull doesn't belong to this body.

401
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,309
Even though it looks like the head
is attached to the spinal cord.

402
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,039
We could go in and look.
Confirm the authenticity.

403
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,477
I decline to continue the investigation.
We'll restore the remains in the interim.

404
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,710
I knew this was gonna happen!

405
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,791
<i>(Angela)</i> Hodgins!

406
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,795
Because we have been colleagues on this,
more than superior and subordinate,

407
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,950
I have allowed you to be insubordinate.

408
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,558
But I warn you, Dr Hodgins, that is over.

409
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,111
- Do you want my letter of resignation?
- You know what would be better?

410
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,476
Put them on the table and measure. Right?

411
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,199
OK, look. Everybody just turn and walk away.

412
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,590
If you want me to resign, just say so.

413
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,069
Miss Montenegro is right.

414
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,433
You think you just won something.

415
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,195
I'm telling you,
Goodman was the bigger man.

416
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,118
Isn't it against your ethical code
to have sex with a patient?

417
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,636
- Do you even have an ethical code?
- Sex with patients is frowned upon.

418
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,713
That's why he said the implants were stolen.
No way to prove he installed them.

419
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,155
I did not know Rachel was dead
when you visited.

420
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,312
And I did not kill Rachel. I made her beautiful.

421
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,517
You mean, you took
what was unique about her and destroyed it.

422
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,478
- You have a serious neurosis on this.
- Do you have a boat?

423
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,438
Four boob jobs a day, 20 grand a pop,
of course I have a boat.

424
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,511
That's all you get without a lawyer.

425
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,479
And what do you do, huh?
Pay him in hair plugs?

426
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,236
- Still working on the murder weapon?
- It's not a knife. It may be a screwdriver.

427
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,518
- Why are you being mean to Dr Goodman?
- I'm not mean. I'm critical of his process.

428
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,036
- Why are you being so critical?
- He should be looking at the facts.

429
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,114
Is the skeleton authentic or not? That's all.
Instead it's all a mishmash of conjecture.

430
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,116
I think he's forgotten how to do the science
and won't admit it. Why a screwdriver?

431
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,988
There's more torsion than a flat-bladed knife
could bear without snapping.

432
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,150
It twists without breaking.

433
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,550
The killer would have to be strong,
even then the blade would snap.

434
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,598
- Brennan said that about the jaw surgery.
- What?

435
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,596
I don't know. I do bugs and silt, but she said
the words "torsion" and "twist" and "cut".

436
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,475
This is the type of situation
where people say, "Oh, my God."

437
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,710
Pretend you're a person and say it.

438
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,950
Oh, my God.

439
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,068
Scenario one: Prostitute gets breast
augmentation for sex, threatens to tell on him.

440
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,674
- Plausible.
- Scenario two: Jealous boyfriend.

441
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,593
- You know the rest. Which do you like?
- Neither.

442
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,229
- Cos there's no evidence.
- Unless you counted volleyball.

443
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,790
- Sounds like you're getting ready to quit.
- Quit? No.

444
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,599
The Deputy Director wants me
to hand the case over.

445
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,558
We're supposed to give Agent Finn
what we got and go home.

446
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,598
You don't even like Finn.
You think she's an idiot.

447
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,752
The whole case is a bust. It's a blank.
We don't have anything.

448
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,152
We checked her apartment. No pictures.
We don't know what she looks like.

449
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,279
It's like she lived on the world instead of in it.

450
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,272
Cullen is calling you back
cos he thinks I'm at a dead end.

451
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,954
You have to tell him he's wrong.

452
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,035
Is he wrong?

453
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,750
We're looking for someone who grew up in
New England, moved here eight years ago,

454
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,229
her leg was crushed in an accident
when she was 13,

455
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
she was on a boat
shortly before she was murdered,

456
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,078
we know some of her names
and some of her faces.

457
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,836
That's all your stuff. Usually by now
we know more about my stuff.

458
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,230
- We have separate stuff?
- By now I usually have a feel for the person.

459
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,792
What they wanted, how they felt, what was
going on in their lives. With this girl, nothing.

460
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,193
She thought she was ugly. She did everything
she could to make herself beautiful.

461
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,748
And all she did
was make herself more invisible.

462
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,231
Everybody in this city thinks they're ugly.
And nobody is.

463
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,675
I'm starting to get
why you hate anonymous death.

464
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:31,074
We are born unique. Our experiences
mould and change us. We become someone.

465
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,119
To have that taken away by murder,
erased from existence against our will is...

466
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,713
- Evil?
- Unacceptable.

467
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,954
These bones you bring me, I give them a face.
I say their names out loud.

468
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,998
I return them to their loved ones
and you arrest the bad guy.

469
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,514
- I like that.
- So do I.

470
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,956
I feel like we should be
arresting these doctors,

471
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,397
because whether they killed her or not,
they still erased her.

472
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,119
- Well, maybe I can hold Cullen off for a day.
- It's not good enough.

473
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,556
- You're welcome.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

474
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,550
Brennan.

475
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,474
The murder weapon is a larger version
of the surgical implement used on herjaw.

476
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,758
You compared the wounds to the marks
left on herjaw? That's brilliant, Zack.

477
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,957
It was Hodgins.
Hodgins quoting you, so it was us. Go, team.

478
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,669
But get this. According to
the National Plastic Surgery Association,

479
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,069
only one surgeon does this procedure.

480
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,038
- Tell me he's in LA.
- He's in LA.

481
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,159
Dr Henry Atlas, Rodeo Drive,
Beverly Hills. Go.

482
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,789
I'm ethically bound to ask you for a warrant
before revealing any of my patients.

483
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,670
Let me try this then. The jaw procedure
which Dr Brennan described to you as...

484
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,876
Was my innovation, yes.

485
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,235
There's an adage in my business.

486
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,311
You can't alter the bone.

487
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,358
I've proven it incorrect,
given the right patients.

488
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,113
- How many have you done?
- Perhaps half a dozen.

489
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,272
If you get a warrant,
I will release the names of my patients.

490
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,831
- Do you use special operating instruments?
- Yes. I designed them myself specifically.

491
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,117
- Have you patented them or shared designs?
- Not yet.

492
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,033
He's waiting to have
enough success stories to cash in.

493
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,510
- He's gonna be short one success story.
- Let's see what we got here.

494
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,594
Oh, Sandra Cane, Rachel LaChance, Candice
Hayden. Any of these women ring a bell?

495
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,557
As I have reiterated...

496
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,192
I have a search warrant here
to collect your surgical instruments.

497
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,079
You'II... you'll shut me down.
You will cost me a fortune.

498
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,030
The only ones we require, Dr Atlas,
are the ones you designed yourself.

499
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,316
She told me her name was Susan Shepherd.

500
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,232
Brilliant.

501
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,078
<i>(knocking)</i>

502
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,994
You wanted to see me?

503
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,996
You are a very difficult
and stubborn man, Dr Hodgins.

504
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,390
Right now, I'd like nothing more
than to fire you.

505
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,069
In my position,
very few people tell me the truth any more.

506
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,709
I find I enjoy it in some perverse way.

507
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,588
- You admit you bailed on the authentication?
- Yes.

508
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,638
- Seriously?
- But not for the reasons you think.

509
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,350
True, we might be able to authenticate the
skeleton by taking him apart, destroying him.

510
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,079
If he's a fake, fine. Nothing lost.

511
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,118
But I think he's the real thing.

512
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,431
You do know he's been dead
for 1500 years, right?

513
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,638
I am an archaeologist. This is what we do.

514
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,352
We step outside the facts and tell ourselves
the story of an individual or a culture.

515
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,355
And if the story I tell myself about this man
who lived 1500 years ago is true,

516
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,833
if he was laid to rest
by people who respect and loved him,

517
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,789
don't I owe it to them not to let
the pure scientist desecrate his remains?

518
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,159
Or you could be rational and say you were
waiting for imaging technology to improve

519
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,279
to the point where it wasrt necessary
to disassemble him.

520
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,072
Ah.

521
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,718
Yes.

522
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,954
- I suppose I could say that. It's less...
- Sentimental for the pure scientists.

523
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,435
I've got the murder weapon.

524
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,516
We have the murder weapon.
We have trace evidence from your boat.

525
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,594
We have testimony from your staff that you
argued with Susan Shepherd before she died.

526
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,989
So what you need now is a confession.

527
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,914
Your patient list is
what's known as an A-list, right?

528
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,677
Oscar winners, supermodels,
super agents, moguls.

529
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,228
So how is it that a call girl makes the grade?

530
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,676
- You can answer that, Henry.
- I did Susars procedure pro bono.

531
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,593
- Why?
- Because she volunteered.

532
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,798
- She was a guinea pig.
- How did you meet her?

533
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,476
Oh, come on. Susan just didn't
walk into your office, did she?

534
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,959
Oh, just tell them, Henry.

535
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,474
Through another call girl,
one I used regularly.

536
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,757
Sometimes these girls
from the high-class establishments

537
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,037
start to have expectations
beyond the professional.

538
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,509
She thought you were gonna marry her?

539
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,830
Something along those lines, yes.

540
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,275
So I made a change.
I started requesting Susan.

541
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,672
- Did you trade plastic surgery for sex?
- Obfuscate, Henry.

542
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,513
We did each other favours.
Went fine for a few months.

543
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,830
Until Susan wanted you to marry her too?

544
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,957
No. In my opinion,
Susan became addicted to plastic surgery.

545
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,113
I refused to do any more procedures.
That's what my staff heard us arguing about.

546
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,158
What was Susan like?

547
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,754
She was a girl next door.

548
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,831
Simple, healthy.

549
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,390
The girl before Susan was the opposite.
She was very flashy.

550
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,119
She had diamonds
in her incisors and fingernails.

551
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,113
- Bones, didn't Hodgins find a fingernail?
- Yes. With a fake diamond in it.

552
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,875
- Susan was the girl-next-door type?
- It wasrt her fingernail.

553
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,875
Jealousy, like I said. So what was the name
of the escort before Susan?

554
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,077
The flashy one, the one
who thought you were gonna marry her?

555
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,550
Tell the man what he needs to know, Henry.

556
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,160
She thought Atlas
was gonna take her out of the life.

557
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,596
He wanted the girl next door. You were right.

558
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,671
Jealousy.

559
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,232
Ah, it's an old story. I bet your 1500 year old
friend back home heard a version.

560
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,313
Leslie thought Rachel was stealing her man,
so she killed her.

561
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,436
- What did she ask you?
- What?

562
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,353
She asked you something
after she was arrested. What?

563
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,113
She asked me...

564
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,998
if I thought she was beautiful.

565
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,712
One more thing. The bureau searched for girls
injured in car crashes in the upper Northeast

566
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,870
ten to twelve years ago.

567
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,433
- Daughter's right leg was crushed.
- Allison. Her name was Allison Holmes.

568
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,149
Her father and her brother are still alive.
Somewhere in Bangor, Maine.

569
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,198
- We'll return the remains.
- Thanks, Booth.

570
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,114
Well, Bones, you do your thing

571
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,191
and I do mine.

572
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,511
- Look at her.
- Yeah.

573
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,671
Pretty little thing.
