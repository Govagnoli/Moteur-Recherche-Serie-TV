1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,917
Viewer Discretion Is Advised

2
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,394
So no one touched the body?

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,052
No. We're going to need an ID ASAP.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,884
Could be dealing with a group
that's acquired nuclear material.

5
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:16,759
- It's actually glowing?
- Oh, yes.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,326
I'll need a video link with my lab.

7
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,630
Excuse me, Major. The reactor
at Kensington is secure.

8
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:23,517
All transports carrying radioactive
material have been halted.

9
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:26,649
Dr. Brennan's going to need a
video linkup to the Jeffersonian.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,827
As soon as possible. The
rain's really slowed things up.

11
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:29,723
All right, thanks.

12
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:31,972
See, uh, bodies, they
don't usually glow.

13
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:34,764
Yeah, well, that's why we're
taking all these precautions.

14
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:38,011
All right, this is potassium iodide.

15
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:39,852
These are your suits.

16
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:43,066
- Pills?
- Yeah. It helps so...

17
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,975
the thyroid block the
absorption of radiation.

18
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:52,100
You know...

19
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,439
Angela turned down Hodgins again.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,628
What?

21
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:57,725
Hodgins proposed

22
00:00:58,065 --> 00:00:59,317
and Angela turned him down.

23
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:00,537
You really want to talk about that now?

24
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:03,431
Why not? There's been no
confirmation of danger yet.

25
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:06,337
It's just, you know, weird.
You know, talking about...

26
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:09,584
marriage when we're trying
to avoid radiation poisoning.

27
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,161
What's weird is marriage at all.

28
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:14,633
People fall in love and they get
married, that's what people do.

29
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,008
- You didn't want to talk about it.
- I'm just saying...

30
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,568
you believe in love, don't you?

31
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,206
I believe that dopamine and norepinephrine
stimulate euphoria because of

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,914
certain biological triggers like
scent, symmetrical features...

33
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:27,537
- Symmetrical features?
- Yes,

34
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:29,551
it's an indication of a good breeder.

35
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,148
You appear to be a very good breeder.

36
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:35,097
How long have you two been going out?

37
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:36,443
- We're...
- We're...

38
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,629
- We're partners. That's it.
- Partners.

39
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:41,086
Me and my partner talk baseball.

40
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:45,678
You might not want to admit it, Bones,
but there's some things, like love that

41
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,899
just can't be measured in your lab.

42
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,506
Oh, what's that mean?

43
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,395
300 millirems.

44
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:58,347
Well, that's perfectly normal.

45
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:02,207
If we get a reading of
3,000 or more, then we worry.

46
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,569
- It could be a weapon.
- Nuclear?

47
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,721
The suits would be useless against that.

48
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,238
Oh, great, thanks.

49
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,476
The body's in there.

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,383
- Anybody getting an increase?
- All clear, it doesn't make sense.

51
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,075
Female,

52
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,798
mid-20s, early 30s,

53
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,828
Caucasian.

54
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,588
Looks like she's been there awhile.

55
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:45,655
Probably not that long; rats
and weasels work pretty quicy.

56
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,823
There's no radiation in here.

57
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:50,575
Then why the hell is it glowing?

58
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:51,999
I don't know.

59
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,092
But it's your problem now.

60
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:55,421
Hi, guys. We're out of here.

61
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,800
Multiple stab wounds.

62
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,676
Why is she glowing?

63
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,952
I have no idea.

64
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,266
No idea at all.

<i><b>Bones, Season 02 Episode 20:
"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"</b></i>

69
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,941
Nicks on the ribs and hemorrhaging

70
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:48,774
in the adjacent intercostal muscles
are consistent with stabbing.

71
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:50,899
Repeated stabbing.

72
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,620
Someone was angry.

73
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:56,641
Incised cuts on the left radius and ulna
are congruent with defensive injuries.

74
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:58,839
Still no answer for
the luminescent bones?

75
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:01,636
It's not like we get a human
lightbulb in here every day.

76
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:06,267
I've got mature first instar
Phaenicia sericata about to moult.

77
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:09,235
Indicates she's been dead
approximately 48 hours.

78
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,889
I've got to take more scrapings from
the bones to analyze for luminescence.

79
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:15,228
You can scrape this area.

80
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,613
Okay, squints squad,

81
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,772
why does she look like a glow stick?

82
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:24,103
Why does everyone
think my job is so easy?

83
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,137
Wow, you weren't kidding.

84
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:29,395
If we twirher around, we
can pretend we're at a rave.

85
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,257
What's the good word, Hodgins?

86
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:33,408
Hey, I am not a party trick.

87
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,067
Are you okay?

88
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,618
The bones probably remind
him of Waitomo Cave.

89
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,944
Not... true.

90
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:43,746
I've been there in New Zealand,
it's filled with tiny glowing worms

91
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,961
and in the darkness it looks
like thousands of stars...

92
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,416
very romantic.

93
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,256
Yes, that's where he was going to
take Angela for their honeymoon.

94
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:54,588
If she'd said yes.... which she didn't.

95
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,256
Okay, look, people, Angela
and I are cool. Okay?

96
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:01,973
But she's

97
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:04,273
complicated. I will
figure her out though,

98
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:06,729
just like these electric bones.

99
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:10,975
So let's all just go back to work, okay?

100
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,567
- All right.
- Okay.

101
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,290
Nice bracelet.

102
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,836
- Do you need the left hand?
- No,

103
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:19,948
too fleshy and no stab wounds.

104
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,526
Just how I like 'em.

105
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,137
Oh God... what are you doing?

106
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:31,298
Plugging a dyke or something?

107
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:34,114
The left hand was lodged under the body.

108
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,688
A lack of exposure
preserved some of the dermis.

109
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,925
- We might be able to get a print.
- From that?

110
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,565
It's all... shriveled.

111
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,644
- Can you pour fabric softener.
- Yeah, sure.

112
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,696
My mom used to use this stuff. I
didn't know it was so, uh, scientific.

113
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,019
- Say when.
- That's good.

114
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,881
You think Hodgins is okay?

115
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,891
No, not at all.

116
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,676
Well, they seem to be jumping
each other like rabbits.

117
00:05:57,677 --> 00:06:00,348
- Well, he wants more.
- How sweet.

118
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,988
Oh, you think all a man wants is sex?

119
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,256
No, of course not. Beer, too.

120
00:06:06,113 --> 00:06:08,835
- Chips, salsa...
- Oh, come on, Cam,

121
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,258
I mean, when we were together, you
think that we could, you know...

122
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,615
Get married?

123
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,067
- No.
- Nah, me neither.

124
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:20,385
But wasn't there a moment, just
a moment, where you felt... wow.

125
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,521
Look at that. It's a finger again.

126
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:27,207
You know what I felt, Seeley?

127
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,659
I felt...

128
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,538
satisfied.

129
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,268
Very satisfied.

130
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:40,787
And grateful that I had my
own place, my own single life,

131
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,817
and you were, too.

132
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,322
Why are we even talking about this?

133
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:55,126
Check this out.

134
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,208
One perfect fingerprint.

135
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:04,646
Unbelievable, all from fabric softener?

136
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,674
Rehydrates dried tissue
and fights static cling.

137
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,361
Eh, geez. Puffy soft, huh?

138
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,645
21 loads, look at that.

139
00:07:14,204 --> 00:07:16,676
Okay, Carly Victor, 29...

140
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,961
Carly Victor?!

141
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:22,070
- Do you know her?
- Yeah, she's that

142
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,525
celebrity chef.

143
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,442
Carly's Table over on Calvert.

144
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:28,849
Chef would explain the cuts
to her left hand and the burns.

145
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:31,098
All right, this is her MySpace page.

146
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:33,315
Is that the place with
the famous mac and cheese?

147
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:35,631
Yeah, it's, like,
impossible to get into.

148
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,321
Totally impossible.

149
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,412
You, too?

150
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,895
Mac and cheese, that's
God's best handiwork.

151
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:44,901
She puts leeks in it and little
bits of pancetta; it was delicious.

152
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:46,285
How did you get in?

153
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:49,117
I'm a best-selling author,
Booth; I get in anywhere.

154
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,416
I took Sully.

155
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:53,416
- Did he have...?
- He said it was "the best he ever ate."

156
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,770
Why are all those pictures on her page?

157
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:58,989
That's friends... different
communities she's joined.

158
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,071
blogs, her husband, cooking videos.

159
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:05,584
A lot of knives in the kitchen. Easy grab
for one of these "friends" to stab her.

160
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,026
Why don't you check the pages and
see if anyone had a problem with her.

161
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:12,397
I can't imagine anyone
wanting to kill Carly.

162
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:17,929
She came out to see if
we were enjoying our meal.

163
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,120
We talked for a while, I was...

164
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:25,396
supposed to go back
and see her next week.

165
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,723
Are you okay, honey?

166
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:29,757
Yeah.

167
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:33,129
I'm just used to
victims being strangers.

168
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,192
We should tell her husband, Booth.

169
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,363
Sure.

170
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,437
Welcome to Carly's Table.
Do you have a reservation?

171
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,409
Like that's possible.

172
00:08:57,608 --> 00:09:01,160
Oh, Dr. Brennan. I'm sorry
I didn't see you there.

173
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:04,958
We're very crowded tonight, so you
might have to wait for a few minutes.

174
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,836
You can walk in here
without a reservation?

175
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,979
- We need to talk to Dan.
- Carly's husband.

176
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,524
Oh, just a moment.

177
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,667
She knows he's Carly's husband.

178
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,749
Bones, Bones, Bones, mac
and cheese, mac and cheese.

179
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,403
Booth.

180
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,716
that's amazing.

181
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,105
<i>we'd love to tell Carly.</i>

182
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:26,515
She's a little slammed right now, but I'll
be sure to pass on the compliments, all right?

183
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,158
All right, take care.

184
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,795
Oh, Carly's in the kitchen?

185
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:34,330
Yeah, she's back there 24/7.
You have to drag her out.

186
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:37,706
- Dr. Brennan, right?
- Yes. This is my partner,

187
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,951
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

188
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:40,812
Hi.

189
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,845
We know she's not back there, Dan.

190
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,989
I just can't imagine
she's... she's gone.

191
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,191
I'm so sorry, Dan.

192
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,330
When was the last time you saw her?

193
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:57,550
Friday night.

194
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,071
A lot of the restaurants around
here have been getting robbed, so...

195
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,163
Carly didn't want to
leave the cash here.

196
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,617
She and Abby took the cash
and drove it to the ATM.

197
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:08,537
- Who's Abby?
- Abby Singer.

198
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:12,762
She and her boyfriend, Ben,
are our business partners.

199
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,260
They're friends first.

200
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:17,146
Abby organizes Carly's endorsements...

201
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:18,742
I mean, it's...

202
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,475
It's not Abby as well, is it?

203
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:23,181
No, we only... we only found Carly.

204
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:25,786
Has Ben heard from Abby?

205
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:28,755
Ben's... he's in the Guard.

206
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:32,510
And, um, he's been gone for the weekend.
He should be back in a couple hours.

207
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,301
Help me understand something here, Dan.

208
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,664
Your wife disappears and
you don't report her missing?

209
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,084
She would take these

210
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:42,136
spur-of-the-moment trips to Atlantic
City with Abby to kind of blow off steam.

211
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:43,646
She wouldn't tell you first?

212
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:46,368
No, she wouldn't tell me 'cause
she didn't want me to say "no."

213
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,519
Listen, what kind of
car did they leave in?

214
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:51,758
She, um... she had an old Volvo.

215
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,241
Abby did.

216
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,762
The picture was taken
just before we opened.

217
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,460
I'll get a search team on it.

218
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,278
You find anything?

219
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:08,853
Yeah.

220
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:12,449
jealous chefs, vicious critics,

221
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,077
fans that were a little
too in love with her.

222
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:16,857
Fame is creepy.

223
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,750
They say chefs are the new rock stars.

224
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,114
They do deal with
knives and fire and food.

225
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:23,545
It's pretty sexy.

226
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:24,280
Yeah?

227
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,065
Well, then tonight...

228
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,767
I'll take a knife and fire,

229
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,876
and make you an orgasmic
grilled cheese sandwich.

230
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,131
Oh, suddenly I'm starving.

231
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,329
Oh, good Lord. You have to stop
mounting each other in the office.

232
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:43,579
Doesn't marriage destroy
sex? Please, Angela, say yes.

233
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,627
We were working.

234
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,161
You were working it.

235
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:49,000
A little professionalism
would be nice, people.

236
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,348
I found some organic material
in a cut on her left hand.

237
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:53,752
I need to know what it is.

238
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,395
I'm on it.

239
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,562
And you? Anything?

240
00:11:57,656 --> 00:12:00,065
Yeah, I found out how
to make braised beef.

241
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,623
I found out that Carly loved sushi.

242
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,798
- I found out...
- My God... sushi.

243
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:08,162
Yes, that is it. You are brilliant.

244
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:09,644
You're my muse.

245
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,175
Check out all the sushi
restaurants on her site.

246
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,108
At least he didn't jump you.

247
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:19,278
True.

248
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:22,407
So you were with the
Reserves all weekend?

249
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,410
At Fort Eustis. Survival training.

250
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,170
You're sure Carly was murdered?

251
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:27,468
Yes.

252
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,643
I mean, isn't there
anything I could be doing?

253
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:31,923
Helping you look for Abby. I
mean, I can't just sit here.

254
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:33,988
We're doing everything
we can to find her.

255
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,206
And you're looking for whoever's
been robbing the other restaurants?

256
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,148
We just don't have a
description yet, that's all.

257
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,580
Why didn't Dan report them missing?

258
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,467
He said that they would
take off sometimes.

259
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,033
- Go to Atlantic City.
- Yeah, but still.

260
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,200
The restaurant was booming.

261
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,578
I mean, he should have known
that she wouldn't just leave.

262
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,205
Listen, do you, uh...

263
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,035
You and Dan are you having problems?

264
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:56,451
What? No.

265
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,408
No. He just doesn't think sometimes.

266
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,483
I mean, we're not in school anymore.

267
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,549
I just would have done
something, that's all.

268
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,249
Look,

269
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,644
here's Abby's picture if you need it.

270
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,841
Just find Abby.

271
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:20,811
Please.

272
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:25,235
The sushi got me
thinking. P. phosphoreum.

273
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,051
It's a bacteria that grows in seafood.

274
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:29,815
A luminescent bacterium?

275
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,771
Exactly. Vibrio bacteria,

276
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:33,922
which, when catalyzed by luciferase,

277
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:36,253
causes the bones to glow.

278
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,489
So if the knife that was used to stab Carly contained
P. phosphoreum, it would've entered her bloodstream.

279
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,551
And it would be left on the bones as the
tissue decomposed and was stripped by the rats.

280
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:47,749
Seafood. So that narrows it down...

281
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,049
to every restaurant in the area.

282
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,064
No. The tissue Cam found...

283
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,409
it's Uni,

284
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,736
sea urchin,

285
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:59,894
a specialty in one of Carly's
favorite sushi restaurants.

286
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:03,485
Carly's blog mentions an old friend

287
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:05,675
who's the chef at a sushi restaurant.

288
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,315
SushiGuy23.

289
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,575
How imaginative.

290
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:11,875
Executive chef at Sushi Beat Restaurant.

291
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,893
And when we link to his page...

292
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,395
That's Carly.

293
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,484
With SushiGuy.

294
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,610
Yeah. And his knife.

295
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:39,266
- Can you believe this place?
- Yeah. Fresh toro today.

296
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,327
Cherry-picked the most
marketable elements

297
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,186
of a very complex and
vibrant culture and then

298
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,611
repackage into turn
a profit. It's awful.

299
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:49,208
Yeah, well, so is murder,
okay? So just stay focused.

300
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:52,764
Hey, Ernie,

301
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,547
have a minute?

302
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,261
I guess.

303
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:57,543
Can I get you anything?

304
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:58,920
No. We're just here to ask...

305
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:02,562
Oh, sure. I mean, if you have some of
that fresh toro left, that would be great.

306
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:05,519
What? Might as well eat
lunch while we're here.

307
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,188
You and Carly Victor were
high school sweethearts, right?

308
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,799
Why? What's going on?

309
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,502
Uh, when was the last time you saw her?

310
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,841
Uh, Thursday of last week.

311
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,249
Why? Did something happen to her?

312
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,735
Do you serve sea urchin?

313
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:21,739
Uni, yeah. It's one of my
specialties. You want some?

314
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,065
- Sure.
- No.

315
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,215
Is this about Dan?

316
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:29,045
Did Dan find out she was with me?

317
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:31,048
Why? What's going on
between you and Carly?

318
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:31,998
Nothing.

319
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:33,923
We reconnected on MySpace.

320
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:37,639
She wanted to learn about Japanese cuisine,
so I was teaching her how to make sushi.

321
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,937
Secretly?

322
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,628
Why, because Dan hated Japanese food?

323
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,044
Because he's so jealous.

324
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:44,906
Everybody loved Carly.

325
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,733
It drove him crazy.

326
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,297
Carly even left him once.

327
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:50,233
Why'd she go back?

328
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,869
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

329
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,062
What's going on? Is Carly okay?

330
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,250
Carly's dead.

331
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,202
Dan?

332
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,327
- That son of a bitch.
- We don't know who it was,

333
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,627
but shewasstabbed, Ernie, and

334
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:14,206
we found bacteria associated
with sea urchin in her system.

335
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,805
It can only enter the body
through the bloodstream.

336
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:19,195
What, you think I killed
her? Why would I kill Carly?

337
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,025
Well, that's more his area.

338
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:24,694
You love her, she says that she'll
leave Dan, she doesn't, you get mad.

339
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:27,322
She's got the fishy virus.
You got all these fishy knives.

340
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,119
Wait. Wait, wait. Last time
Carly was here, she cut herself,

341
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,165
and I wanted her to get
stitches, but she wouldn't.

342
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:37,187
I'd like to borrow your knives, Ernie, and
compare them to the injuries we found on Carly.

343
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,992
You know, a lot of people
have knives like mine.

344
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:44,841
Are you saying no? Because that
really wouldn't look too good.

345
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,650
Can I get a spicy tuna roll?

346
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,754
I fed the measurements of
the knives into the computer.

347
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,253
angles of the blades, thickness

348
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,686
and compared it to the
injuries we found on the bones.

349
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:07,677
None of them match the damage evident on the
cortical surface of the ribs or the defensive wounds.

350
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,610
No, but we do have one match.

351
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,889
This knife

352
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,549
and the cut on her left hand.

353
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,861
They knife they used
when preparing the Uni.

354
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,610
That must be how it
entered her bloodstream.

355
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,652
SushiGuy23 was telling the truth.

356
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,404
So he's not a murderer.

357
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:26,591
We can still eat at the restaurant.

358
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,438
What? Booth said the toro was fantastic.

359
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,579
Are you still torturing Hodgins?

360
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:33,827
He loves it.

361
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:36,565
Just tell him no, put
him out of his misery.

362
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:38,294
What if I want to say yes?

363
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:40,656
You? Get married?

364
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,251
Sometimes your brain just
shuts off because you're...

365
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,253
in love.

366
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:51,752
One can't logically base a
decision on momentary happiness.

367
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:55,237
Haven't you ever just looked
at a guy and said, screw it?

368
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:56,998
Maybe not the

369
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,125
best choice of words, okay, but...

370
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,528
Like when you were with Sully.

371
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:05,157
Don't you regret letting him go?

372
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,063
I made a decision.

373
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:10,175
Regrets serve no real purpose.

374
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:13,453
If you want to be impulsive,
why don't you just say yes?

375
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,891
Because I've also got
you in my head telling me

376
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:20,188
that marriage will hobble my
personal and legal freedoms.

377
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,689
You're a very difficult
best friend to have.

378
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,316
Brennan.

379
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:30,549
I'll grab my things.

380
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,123
Ernie's story checked out.

381
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:35,982
Carly took out a
restraining order on Dan,

382
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,486
and Dan took out a $2 million
life insurance policy on her.

383
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,200
See, marriage... it...

384
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:42,686
Oh, just go.

385
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:43,828
I'm going.

386
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,061
You guys had to shut down, huh?

387
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:49,034
Yeah. Carly's without Carly
doesn't make much sense.

388
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,201
Yeah, that's got to be rough.

389
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:55,363
I mean, you know, absorbing
that kind of hit, financially.

390
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,472
Look, man, his wife was murdered,
and my girlfriend's missing.

391
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,780
Money is the last thing on our minds.

392
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:04,144
Yeah, right, right, I... Yeah.
I understand. It's just, I mean...

393
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,612
Here you guys are just, you
know, poring over the books.

394
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:11,301
Most of our staff live paycheck to
paycheck. You know? We have to pay them.

395
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:14,028
- Where is the other knife?
- I don't know.

396
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:18,674
It's been missing for years. Carly actually got it
as a gift from the first chef that she worked for.

397
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:22,703
Maybe it's just been missing since you
found out about, uh, Carly and Ernie Summers.

398
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,799
Ernie Summers? The sushi guy?

399
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,450
I'd like to take this set of knives.

400
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:27,232
Sure.

401
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:29,157
- No!
- Hey, relax, man.

402
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:30,921
- If you just let them take the knives...
- These bastards cannot come in here

403
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:31,734
- and start accusing me...
- Wait,

404
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,625
Carly was meeting up with Ernie
secretly. You assumed the worst?

405
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,471
- That's not true.
- You confronted her,

406
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:37,629
one thing led to another.

407
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,669
Carly was involved with him?

408
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,337
Maybe Abby heard you fighting, she
tried to get in the middle of it.

409
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,070
You son of a bitch!

410
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,217
She got caught up in the middle.

411
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,329
Get off of me!

412
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,631
You know, I'd back down if I
were you. He shot a clown once.

413
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,977
You're good? Yes, I'm good.

414
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,010
We know about the restraining
order and your drinking.

415
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:02,435
- What did you do, Dan?
- Nothing, okay?

416
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,446
We had some problems.

417
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:06,604
- I went into rehab...
- You were drinking last week,

418
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,700
- Dan, before I left.
- A couple glasses of wine, okay?

419
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,218
- The stress of everything.
- And Carly?

420
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:11,345
Yes, and Carly.

421
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,691
Why didn't you tell us
about that insurance policy?

422
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:14,798
It was Ben's idea.

423
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,608
This restaurant would be worth nothing without
Carly. We have investors. We had to protect them.

424
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:21,236
But if you had a problem
with Carly, I mean,

425
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,818
you wouldn't need the
restaurant, still get your payday.

426
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,346
Take the knives.

427
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,378
Take anything you want.

428
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,751
You son of a bitch. You think that...

429
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:30,471
Where's Abby?

430
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,192
For God's sakes, are
you people crazy? I, I...

431
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:33,096
Booth.

432
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:35,345
I loved Abby. I loved Carly. It was

433
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,208
Thanks. Helicopter spotted Abby's car.

434
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:45,827
Bones, stay back.

435
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:49,238
You, you should wait here until we
can determine if she's in the car

436
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:50,583
and if she's alive.

437
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,234
- Did you find her?
- No one's in the vehicle, sir.

438
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,783
- What about the trunk?
- I haven't checked yet.

439
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,269
<i>Give me a crowbar.</i>

440
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,813
Come on!

441
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:05,141
She's alive!

442
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,187
Get an AEREVAC here right away!

443
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,281
Hang on, baby, please.

444
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:15,836
You'll be all right.

445
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:27,301
I don't understand. Why
wasn't Abby killed, too?

446
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,507
Funny, but I haven't found
a written confession yet.

447
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,385
Yeah. But she's a witness.

448
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,291
Blood traces on the dashboard
where the vinyl split.

449
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,351
Lots of blood on the
seat, the floor mats.

450
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,163
Looks like Carly was definitely
killed inside the car.

451
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:45,317
Maybe whoever did this saw what he'd done and
lost the stomach for it when it came to Abby.

452
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:49,087
Hello. Possible semen
and vaginal contributions.

453
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:51,536
'Cause this wasn't nasty enough.

454
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:03,189
Ooh! Smells like a urinal.

455
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,248
She was locked up for 36 hours.

456
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:09,080
I can tell you, all she was
worried about was surviving.

457
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:12,580
Sorry. I forgot you were buried.

458
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,781
Look, if this is too
difficult, Hodgins...

459
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:19,096
If I can help lock up
this bastard that did this,

460
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:21,592
at least someone gets justice, right?

461
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,038
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

462
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,289
What is it?

463
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,950
Unidentified particulates.

464
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:33,399
The two sweetest words I know.

465
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:37,056
I don't even want to think about
your pillow talk with Angela.

466
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:43,341
The missing knife from the set is
an 8-inch hollow edge utility knife.

467
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:47,111
but sharp or dull, it couldn't
have made those injuries you found.

468
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,051
So, the edge was even sharper?

469
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:49,912
Yeah.

470
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,835
How much can you magnify
the cut to that rib?

471
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:57,957
I can go about 600 times
before degrading the image.

472
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,017
Most blades are irregular and
pitted so they show on the bone.

473
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,537
This is a knife without
imperfections on its edge.

474
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,225
Do you really think
her husband killed her?

475
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,000
I mean,

476
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,082
it would make sense he would spare Abby.

477
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,454
I don't think I'm the
person to ask about

478
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:19,552
psychology of relationships.

479
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:23,205
You know, when I said before that

480
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,944
you were the difficult
friend inside my head,

481
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,124
that's not necessarily a bad thing.

482
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:31,861
Yeah, I know

483
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:37,368
that sharing a strong emotional
attachment with another human being can

484
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,141
be a good thing,

485
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:41,565
but

486
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:44,037
there seems to be

487
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,501
a disconnect between my mind and...

488
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:47,737
You know, I...

489
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:50,279
I shouldn't have
brought up Sully before.

490
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:52,736
I'm sorry.

491
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:54,347
It's just...

492
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:58,736
if a relationship seems

493
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:03,539
more than casual, I feel that I
need to posit the potential problems,

494
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:07,208
probabilities of
success and failure or...

495
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:08,271
You get scared.

496
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:14,393
But I miss so much,

497
00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:16,395
don't I?

498
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:20,205
I want to say no, but

499
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,607
yeah...

500
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,063
you do...

501
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,595
and so does whoever you're
keeping yourself from.

502
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:34,271
I compared the hairline fracture on
Carly's skull to the damaged dashboard.

503
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,584
The fracture was the result
of her head smashing into it.

504
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:40,267
Hemorrhaging indicates
it was ante-mortem.

505
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,280
These white shards were found in the
trunk and some were caught on her socks.

506
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:47,110
FBI techs also found similar
shards in the old house.

507
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:51,424
So I'm running a chemical analysis, but
I'd say this is some kind of ceramic.

508
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:52,875
What? Like pottery?

509
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:57,831
Actually, ceramics are used in everything
from semiconductors to medical implants.

510
00:24:58,108 --> 00:24:59,778
This is a very hard ceramic.

511
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,718
It's probably eight mohs.

512
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

513
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:05,215
What's that mean?

514
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:08,751
That it was most likely used
for industrial applications.

515
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,542
Dude...

516
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:12,447
What?

517
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:15,326
No, I'm not going to ask again.

518
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,481
- About the ceramic stuff?
- No.

519
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:19,374
Angela.

520
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,416
No more. I'm done.

521
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:25,010
- You're done with Angela?
- No, but...

522
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:28,343
hey, I fell in love with a free spirit

523
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:31,499
and if getting married
makes her feel trapped or

524
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:34,343
something, then I'm just
going to have to deal with it.

525
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:35,759
Right, so

526
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:37,949
- you don't want to get married anymore?
- Sure I do.

527
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,750
You know what? This whole ceramic
stuff was making more sense to me.

528
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:44,219
But Angela doesn't, and I don't want to
drive her away like you did with Rebecca.

529
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:48,424
I did not drive Rebecca away.

530
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:50,391
We both agreed that it wasn't right.

531
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:52,030
After you asked and she said no.

532
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:54,017
Well, when you say it like that, it's...

533
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:55,734
If it had been right,

534
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,219
it wouldn't matter if you
were married or not, would it?

535
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,765
Because you'd have a life together.

536
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:04,026
Great, then why not get married?

537
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:06,561
Because then we wouldn't
be able to be together.

538
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:09,252
See, this is all coming so clear now.

539
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,419
- Not really.
- You put on that macho front,

540
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,671
- but inside you understand.
- I don't understand.

541
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,545
That which the mind can't grasp.

542
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:19,190
All right, you know, I'm just trying to catch a
murderer, but you seem to have gone way past that.

543
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:21,435
It means a lot, knowing
that you get it, man.

544
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,263
Most guys are not secure
enough to admit that.

545
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,145
I have a headache.

546
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:27,553
Booth.

547
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,224
Yeah, I'm on my way.

548
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:32,348
Abby just... woke up.

549
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,492
I need you to figure
out what that stuff is.

550
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,399
Okay.

551
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:38,915
it's so much easier just
to fight and shoot guns.

552
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,368
Bones, she's awake! We're going!

553
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:50,121
we had a lot of cash.

554
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:54,699
There had been robberies. Carly
wanted to take the money to the ATM.

555
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:58,243
Her and Dan fought about it,

556
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:01,794
but Carly always did what she wanted.

557
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,802
He ran outside yelling.

558
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,618
I didn't want to get
in the middle of it.

559
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,315
You're sure?

560
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:14,288
- She was stabbed?
- Yes.

561
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,729
What happened when you got in the car?

562
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:19,791
We didn't suspect anything.

563
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:23,147
He must have been
hiding in the back seat.

564
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,553
Did you get a look at him?

565
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,270
No.

566
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,616
He was wearing a mask.

567
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,916
I panicked. I, uh...

568
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:34,850
I tried to get out of the car,

569
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:38,480
and he must have hit me, uh...

570
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,348
'cause the next thing I remember...

571
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:48,035
is waking up in the trunk,
and, uh, you know, I...

572
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:53,401
I thought I'd been buried alive.

573
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:56,257
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

574
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,292
Actually, I was buried alive

575
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,726
in a car just a few months
ago with a colleague. We were

576
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:04,697
able to use the airbag cannis...

577
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:05,730
Bones.

578
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:08,288
It's a rhetorical question.

579
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,006
I tried to fight.

580
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,978
That's not your fault.

581
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,320
Was it...

582
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:23,773
Did she suffer?

583
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,944
It was very quick.

584
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:33,270
The, uh...

585
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,380
the four of us were planning
on taking a vacation together

586
00:28:41,362 --> 00:28:43,834
after the cookbook came out.

587
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,693
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:54,054 --> 00:28:56,667
I took a second look at
Carly's cervical vertebrae.

589
00:28:56,781 --> 00:29:00,442
The damage matches an acceleration
flexion-extension neck injury.

590
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:03,352
Whiplash. Abby's car stops suddenly,

591
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,915
Carly doesn't have her seat
belt on, she's propelled forward,

592
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:09,708
slamming her head into the
dashboard and injuring her neck.

593
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,081
Exactly.

594
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:12,723
What about what you
found in the back seat?

595
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:15,852
The vaginal secretions are
consistent with Carly's DNA.

596
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:18,665
So she was raped before she was killed?

597
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:20,253
Any match on the semen?

598
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:24,708
I ran the seminal DNA through
CODIS and the military database.

599
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,350
I found a match.

600
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,117
Ben Michaelson.

601
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,659
Abby's boyfriend?

602
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,709
It would explain why he spared Abby.

603
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:38,597
Carly's husband said Ben was with
the reserves when Carly was killed.

604
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:41,507
Wonder how hard is it to sneak off base?

605
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,208
He wasn't on base.

606
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:46,369
He was alone in the woods
doing survival training.

607
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:50,851
He could go, rape and kill Carly, and
no one would even find out he left.

608
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,211
You spoke to Captain Gerard?

609
00:29:58,665 --> 00:29:59,838
Why didn't you just talk to me?

610
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,905
Your reserve unit spent last
weekend reviewing survival skills?

611
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:05,936
Yeah. We were each dropped
off at isolated locations, and

612
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,821
given rudimentary supply
and navigation kits.

613
00:30:07,822 --> 00:30:12,671
So basically, you were alone for two days.
No one to corroborate your whereabouts.

614
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,855
What are you saying? You
spent two tours in Iraq,

615
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,592
the captain says you
were one of his best men.

616
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:21,307
Someone as well-trained as you would have
easily been able to leave your assigned location

617
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:24,546
and return to your rendezvous
point, with no one the wiser.

618
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:25,774
- But I didn't.
- See,

619
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:27,589
at first, I was wondering,

620
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:31,496
"Why would a carjacker
kill one of his victims and

621
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:34,184
and let the other victim stay alive?

622
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:36,319
That doesn't make sense. Hey, unless...

623
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,880
maybe there's no carjacker.

624
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:39,413
What, do you actually
think that I had...

625
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:42,526
The insurance money would've given
you over a half million dollars.

626
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:44,709
You've killed before.
I've been in the service.

627
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,555
Some guys, they just numb to it.

628
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:48,276
- What? This is insane.
- Then again,

629
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:51,601
killing your meal ticket is one thing,
and then killing your girlfriend,

630
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:54,429
- that's another.
- So, you locked Abby in the trunk.

631
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:56,603
- No!
- See, the one thing I don't understand...

632
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,633
- the rape.
- Yeah.

633
00:30:58,993 --> 00:30:59,869
What?

634
00:30:59,948 --> 00:31:02,420
We have your DNA, from
the back seat of the car.

635
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,805
Yours and Carly's.

636
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,777
So what was it, then?

637
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:09,835
Did you get turned on
thinking about killing her?

638
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,570
I want a lawyer.

639
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,791
I'll bet you do.

640
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:21,898
You know we'll get him,
Bones, all right, don't worry.

641
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:24,836
We do this all the time. You
know, I should be used to it.

642
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:26,478
- It shouldn't bother me.
- No.

643
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,106
It should.

644
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,386
Was she really going to
teach you how to cook?

645
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:34,524
Yeah.

646
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,701
I've always understood the basics
of cooking, the physics of it, but

647
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,804
Carly said she was going to
show me what it was really about.

648
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:46,133
To her, she said that it was a way of...

649
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,168
well, she said "loving," but then

650
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,147
she was prone to hyperbole.

651
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,928
Well, hey, I mean, that's what
family dinner is all about, right?

652
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:58,524
Those are some of my,
uh, my best memories.

653
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:00,918
I'm not as cold as
everyone thinks, Booth.

654
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:02,897
Okay, that was a leap.

655
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,901
Just because I think marriage
is an antiquated ritual

656
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:09,605
doesn't mean that I don't want
Angela and Hodgins to be happy.

657
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,117
I have an appreciation and a need

658
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:16,919
for emotional and physical
intercrse just like you.

659
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,889
Yeah. Sure. I mean, okay.
Good for you with that.

660
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:23,823
- Did I make you uncomfortable?
- No.

661
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:28,774
Not at all. I just want to focus...
Let's just focus on the case.

662
00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:31,481
I did make you uncomfortable.

663
00:32:34,274 --> 00:32:36,886
Listen, Abby, I know it's hard for
you to go through this again, but

664
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:39,198
do you remember hearing
the carjacker's voice?

665
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,678
I must have.

666
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,087
Close your eyes for me, okay?

667
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:53,717
I want you to try and hear that
voice again. Can you do that for me?

668
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,591
Does it sound familiar?

669
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,730
Someone you might know?

670
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,288
What are you saying?

671
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:05,228
We're just asking, Abby.

672
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:06,621
Why?

673
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:10,180
Ben's story that night...
it might not check out.

674
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,100
What are you talking about?

675
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,383
Ben would n...

676
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,055
We're like a family. It's not Ben.

677
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:18,516
Abby, it's just a
question we have to ask.

678
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,969
Do you remember the car
making a sudden stop?

679
00:33:23,264 --> 00:33:24,281
No...

680
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,880
but I was unconscious in the trunk.

681
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,671
Could that be how she broke her wrist?

682
00:33:29,672 --> 00:33:33,426
Possibly. Or when she was
dragged or thrown into the trunk.

683
00:33:34,658 --> 00:33:38,209
Abby, may I have permission
to review your medical records?

684
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:41,159
They could help us
identify Carly's killer.

685
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:43,756
But...

686
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:47,378
do you think it might really be Ben?

687
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:50,415
It's just a possibility we
have to pursue, that's all.

688
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,944
- Okay.
- Thanks.

689
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,897
I did it. I found the murder weapon.

690
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,802
Or what's left of it, anyway.

691
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:10,198
I used the GC Mass Spectrometer to
analyze the ceramic shards from the car.

692
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:12,412
The murder weapon was a ceramic bowl?

693
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:14,880
It's not just the bowl that's
ceramic, the knife is, too.

694
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:18,647
Booth mentioned that companies were
sending her their products to endorse.

695
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:21,111
Wait. A ceramic knife?

696
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:25,613
Brennan.

697
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:27,788
The murder weapon was a ceramic knife.

698
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,505
Hodgins found the murder weapon.

699
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:32,728
Zirconium oxide: super
sharp, but easy to shatter.

700
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:36,272
In this case, you shatter it into a
million pieces, no one knows it's a knife.

701
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,930
Except me, of course.

702
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:41,458
Using Angela's program, I
matched the wounds to the blade.

703
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:46,148
Either that trunk was packed with
invisible pillows, or Abby's lying to us.

704
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,196
Why?

705
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:48,057
Booth?

706
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:50,427
Yeah, Booth. Talk to me, squints.

707
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,817
As close to English as possible.

708
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:54,706
According to the medical report,

709
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:57,178
Abby's got bumps and bruises, yes, but,

710
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,694
they aren't at all consistent with the way she
would have been thrown around in that trunk.

711
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,755
She should have had more broken bones.

712
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,630
Is there any evidence
of Carly being raped?

713
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:07,738
- None that I found.
- Me either.

714
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,584
But...

715
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:12,111
the wounds on the ribs, the,

716
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:15,553
the directionality of
impact was left to right.

717
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:17,098
Of course.

718
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,163
It fits the scenario I was working out.

719
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,783
So obvious.

720
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,582
English, remember? Okay?

721
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,240
How does Ben figure in all this?

722
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:25,347
He doesn't.

723
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:29,024
The injuries fit, if Abby was
driving when the sudden stop occurred.

724
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:30,397
- Abby?
- Yes, Abby.

725
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:31,539
- Why Abby?
- Look,

726
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,021
- I'm Abby.
- You're Carly.

727
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,942
Why am I always the murder victim?

728
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:35,740
Sit.

729
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:37,007
Zack's always the murder victim.

730
00:35:37,008 --> 00:35:40,058
Now, I'm sitting to the left. Just
driving along. I undo Carly's seat belt,

731
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:42,792
slam on the brakes. She
goes flying into the dash.

732
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:45,319
Go. Go, fly into the dash.

733
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,790
The concussion disorients me.

734
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,116
Okay, don't overdo it, sport.

735
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,244
Okay, what are we missing here?

736
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,822
- The Stooges.
- Abby's scaphoid fracture

737
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:57,182
was right to left, which means
she could have received that break

738
00:35:57,287 --> 00:35:59,024
while stabbing Carly.

739
00:35:59,025 --> 00:35:59,943
Yes.

740
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:03,897
I was wearing a punk
bracelet, lots of metal.

741
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:06,495
That could easily fracture the scaphoid.

742
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:08,243
Okay, what, look, we know

743
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,073
that Ben had sex with Carly
in the back seat of that car.

744
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:14,787
But you didn't find evidence of rape.

745
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:17,317
So the sex they had was consensual.

746
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,024
This part will be left
up to the imagination.

747
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:24,197
And, since there's no way to pinpoint
the time the sexual activity took place...

748
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:27,025
Ben and Carly were having an affair.

749
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:29,317
And they did it in Abby's car?

750
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:31,116
No wonder she was pissed.

751
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,225
Abby is in charge of, uh,

752
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,319
of all the equipment Carly
is sent for endorsement, so

753
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,930
she knows about the knife...

754
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:41,525
So, Abby kills Carly.

755
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,613
Yes. Abby kills Carly,

756
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:45,006
pulls her out of the car.

757
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:46,335
- Oh, boy.
- Drags her

758
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:47,489
into the old stone house.

759
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,944
I don't think this is necessary.

760
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:52,523
Destroys the murder weapon, leaving
us little tiny shards to find.

761
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:56,219
Drives the car into the ravine, where
she expects it'll be found quickly...

762
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,443
And locks herself in the trunk.

763
00:36:59,033 --> 00:36:59,784
Wow.

764
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:03,743
But there was no hikers
in the area to find her

765
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,976
because she didn't count on the rain.

766
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,486
Let's go back, Booth.

767
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:37,852
Carly was my best friend.

768
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,974
She was my best friend.

769
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,038
Hey, what are you doing in here?

770
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:11,923
I thought we were going for sushi?

771
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:14,626
It smells like sushi in here.

772
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:15,706
Yeah.

773
00:38:16,488 --> 00:38:19,414
Look, Angela, I've been thinking.

774
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:22,891
You're not like anyone I've ever known.

775
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:25,332
And I don't want that to change.

776
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:27,960
So I'm taking you the way you are.

777
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:29,916
No strings.

778
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:32,830
And the smell?

779
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,457
P. phosphoreum.

780
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,725
Ugh, the fish bacteria?

781
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:38,274
Close your eyes.

782
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:43,906
Be careful.

783
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,080
Yeah.

784
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:48,862
okay, careful.

785
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:50,841
Keep'em closed.

786
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,286
Okay.

787
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:15,972
Yes.

788
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,237
Yes.

789
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,299
- Let's get married.
- No.

790
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:23,783
No, no, no, this is not a proposal.

791
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:24,878
I know.

792
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:28,160
That's why I'm asking you.

793
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:30,283
Huh?

794
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:34,875
What you said here,

795
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,128
that we're enough,

796
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,737
just this,

797
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,675
no pressure for more...

798
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,727
that's all that I ever wanted.

799
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,679
Hodgins.

800
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,283
Say something.

801
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:56,924
You're insane.

802
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:59,251
Is that a yes?

803
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:01,113
Absolutely.

804
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,414
Okay, okay, um...

805
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:09,010
All right, how, how about, uh...

806
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:10,762
Italy, Italy in, in the spring.

807
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,307
- Um... Umbria.
- No.

808
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:14,419
Right away. Next week.

809
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:16,465
We cannot get a wedding
together in a week.

810
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:17,717
We have to.

811
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:19,324
One week.

812
00:40:19,574 --> 00:40:21,640
I could change my mind.

813
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,275
- It's up to you.
- Okay, yeah,

814
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:25,152
just a small little thing, then.

815
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:26,873
No big.

816
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:30,065
I want a big one.

817
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:32,560
Totally

818
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,156
insane.

819
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,251
You know, you should let me help.

820
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,262
No.

821
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:55,199
Cleaning up.

822
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:57,468
- You can do that.
- Great. Wow!

823
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:02,263
Mac and cheese.

824
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,104
Bones, this...

825
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,715
this looks fantastic.

826
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,874
Yeah? Really?

827
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:11,994
Wow, I mean...

828
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:17,059
you shouldn't have. I mean,
all this work just for me.

829
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,327
What?

830
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:20,048
No, I mean...

831
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:22,332
It wasn't that much.

832
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:36,252
This is unbelievable.

833
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,498
You like it?

834
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,142
I'd like to be alone with it.

835
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:47,642
She said I could go with my
instincts, so I put in a little

836
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,438
fresh ground nutmeg.

837
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,127
Well, she taught you well.

838
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:55,567
Thanks, Bones.

839
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:58,391
Yeah, well, you know,

840
00:41:58,392 --> 00:41:59,783
we have to eat, right?

841
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,116
Yeah. I get to eat...
