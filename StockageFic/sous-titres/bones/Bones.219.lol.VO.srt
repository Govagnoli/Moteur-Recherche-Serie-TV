1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,400
Can you make anything out?

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Yes

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,700
It's a crater

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
We know it's a crater, Bones

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
The question is, what caused it?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
You should ask
a geologist

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
I can tell you for sure
it's not a meteor

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,700
You get a look what's inside?

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Not for long. State Troopers
didn't want anyone getting near it
until you people got here

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,200
That's very nice of them

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,500
But what did it look like?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm pretty sure it was meat

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,200
Meat wearing clothes

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,700
What do you want to do?

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,800
Let's take a look

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
So what do you think?
Dead?

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
Just saying
if he fell out of a plane that
plane is long gone by now

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,100
No sign of a parachute

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,900
What do those shoes
look like to you?

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,900
Loafers

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,800
He hit the ground
at approximately 200
kilometers per hour

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,800
How can you tell that
by his shoes?

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,600
124 miles per hour
is terminal velocity
for a falling human

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,800
So we're going to go
with the theory that this
was once human?

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,000
I've never read about
an alien encounter in which
the aliens wore loafers

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,900
How much you want to bet
Hodgins has?

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,600
The crows and critters
sure made quick work of him

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,600
Yeah, But these
Calliphora vicina eggs
will confirm time of landing

29
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,900
Blowflies on aliens
Who knew?

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,300
You're taking
a shot at me

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,900
because I happen to believe
that we are not all alone

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
and in an infinity
of space?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,900
It's not the believing

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,900
in extraterrestrial life
that's odd

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,700
It's the believing
that they're visiting us

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,300
This guy is wearing loafers
Aliens don't wear loafers, people

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,700
Even if they want
to pass unnoticed amongst us?

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,200
no before taking us over?

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,900
Oh. Oh, this is harassment

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,800
You know, it's illegal
to mock people for
their fundamental beliefs

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,700
Is the tissue damage
consistent with a long fall?

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,100
Definitely

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
You've seen something
like this before?

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Suicide off the Chrysler Building

45
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,800
At least this one
didn't hit pavement

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
A human being reaches
terminal velocity after falling
200 to 220 meters

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,300
depending upon
air resistance

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,900
Velocity would be achieved
between five and eight seconds

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
depending upon
atmospheric conditions

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,900
body position
and clothing

51
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,900
He fell from a minimum
of 1,200 feet

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
I can run through the math
if you'd like

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
- Send me an e-mail
- This is

54
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,100
I want to say anomalous
but I'm going to go with weird

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,900
- What's weird?
- These areas of radiolucency
here and here

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,100
- Extremely porous bones
- What's that mean?

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,300
That means he was ill

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,400
His right, femoral head shows
significant demineralization

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
- Zack?
- I'd put him at 130

60
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,800
130 what?

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
- Years
- Old?

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
There's an alternate
explanation

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,300
Then that's the one
we should go with

64
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
He was in outer space

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,300
So he fell from outer space
in a pair of loafers

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,100
Hodgins left too soon

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Bones 219

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,400
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,300
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM@mzinfo</font>

70
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,900
The FAA reports
no recent accidents

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,700
involving anyone falling
from a plane, balloon or blimp

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,000
commercial or otherwise

73
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,000
The FAA doesn't have
jurisdiction over the entire
universe my friend

74
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,600
Little green men?

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,500
Gray, They're gray
Not green, Gray

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
Being as you're
half alien yourself
you should know that

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,700
If they dropped him from orbit
he'd have burned up

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,700
and his loafers
would have fallen off

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,300
If he wasn't
an abductee

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
tossed out of an
interplanetary spacecraft

81
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,100
why do his bones show
that he has spent an extended
time in outer space?

82
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,200
The only rational explanation
is that he was an astronaut

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Astronauts lose two percent
of their bone mass

84
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
for each month
spent in space

85
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Our victim's legs
hips and lower vertebrae

86
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,800
have demineralized
over 20%

87
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,100
indicating
ten months in space

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,100
Do we do that?

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,900
The longest shuttle
flight was STS-80

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
17.66 days, in 1996

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
The longest we know of

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
The man who's spent
the most time in space

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,500
was a Russian cosmonaut

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,400
That we know of

95
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Why do you know that?

96
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,600
My knowledge is vast

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Why did I ask?

98
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,900
Anyway, there can't
be all that many people

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
who have accumulated
ten months in space

100
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,400
That we know of

101
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,200
Call Booth
Tell him to see if anyone's
missing an astronaut

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,600
Meet Colonel Calvin Howard

103
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,600
Senior Training Specialist
and Crew Liaison
in the shuttle program

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,900
currently working in
the National Space Agency

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
in Bristol, Maryland

106
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Angela just sent me her
work in progress off the partial
skull reconstruction

107
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,100
She says we expected
too much too soon

108
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,300
but the shape of the head
the cheekbones...

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,200
Close enough for jazz

110
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,600
Oh. Six months in
the International Space Station

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,100
plus a number
of servicing missions

112
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
to both the Hubble
and Lansing telescopes

113
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,100
Wait. Does that add up to
the right amount of bone rot?

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,900
Loss.Bone loss
And... yes

115
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,500
Has anyone
reported him missing?

116
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,900
No. Not exactly

117
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,200
Not exactly?

118
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,100
We know astronauts
are regarded as
viable terror targets

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Their whereabouts?
Extremely confidential

120
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
Bet if you told the Agency
you were going

121
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,600
to identify Colonel Howard
to the press

122
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
they would be
a little more cooperative

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,400
Yeah. You know, I have been
a wonderful influence on you

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Actually
I learned that move from Cam

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,600
Yeah, well, I went
the other way with it, okay?

126
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,200
Looked up his wife
in the phone book

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,300
Did my husband die in some kind
of training accident?

128
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,300
We don't believe so
ma'am. No

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,500
It couldn't have been

130
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
How do you know that?

131
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,600
Because the Space Agency
would be all over this

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
You're probably right

133
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,400
They wouldn't let anybody
else take the lead
not even us

134
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,800
You say your husband left
the day before yesterday?

135
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,100
On what airline?

136
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
Cal flies himself

137
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
What kind of plane?

138
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,700
He has a turboprop Cessna
out at McNichol

139
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,500
What exactly does a
Senior Training Specialist

140
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
and Crew Liaison do?

141
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,500
We're not supposed
to discuss these things

142
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,100
For the past three years
Cal's been training others to go up

143
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Because he lost
his medical clearance?

144
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,100
How did you know that?

145
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
His X-rays show
that he was suffering from

146
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
a dramatic loss
of bone density

147
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,000
Must have been hard
on the colonel

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,100
training others to do
what he'd love to do

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
No, Cal was a team player

150
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,900
He was training her husband
James for almost a year

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,300
Actually
it was very hard on him

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,500
It would be hard on any of them

153
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
All they ever do is think
about going back into space

154
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,900
and all we ever
think about

155
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,400
is getting them
back home

156
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,700
Is there some
kind of rule

157
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
that astronaut's wives
travel in packs?

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,300
When you marry an astronaut
no one really understands, except...

159
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,100
Except other people
who are in the same situation

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,300
This is Cal's itinerary

161
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,500
Mainly when he intended
to call me and...

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,300
when he'd be back

163
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,800
You expected your husband
home today?

164
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,100
Yeah

165
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Yeah. I just need to know
if it's still in the hangar or not

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,400
It's a Cessna turboprop plane

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,300
registered
to Colonel Calvin Howard

168
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,800
Thanks

169
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,500
It just seemed so odd
Those women
stick together like a harem

170
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
What? They support
each other, you know?

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
A lot of service
wives are like that

172
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
What about astronauts' husbands?

173
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Look, their husbands
train for years, Bones

174
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
Their families invest
their entire lives

175
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Yeah

176
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
Are you sure?

177
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,600
Okay. Great. Thanks

178
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Well, plane's still
in the hangar

179
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200
Well, if that's the plane
he got tossed out of

180
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,400
then it didn't fly itself back

181
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,400
If someone simply pushed him
out of the plane

182
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,900
there might not be any evidence

183
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,300
We have to hope
there was a struggle

184
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,500
Excuse me

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,100
Could I see
some I.D., please?

186
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,900
Yeah. Sure. I'll show you mine
if you show me yours

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
Right. Here you go

188
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,000
That airplane belongs
to the Agency

189
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Our information
is that it belongs
to Colonel Calvin Howard

190
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,100
- The Agency leased it to him
- Well, it's being investigated
as a possible crime scene

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,900
You're Colonel Howard's boss?

192
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes. Nina Sanborn

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,200
I carry a rank equivalent
to an Air Force general

194
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,700
Hmm. Why didn't you report him
missing, General Sanborn?

195
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
Equivalent, I said

196
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm a civilian

197
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Cal was...
Colonel Howard wasn't missing

198
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,800
He was barely
gone a day

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,500
General Sanborn

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,900
I know you people
are really tight-lipped

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,700
but I'm really good friends
with a very aggressive
federal prosecutor who is great

202
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,500
at getting warrants

203
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
Agent Booth?

204
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,100
We got the usual fibers
hair, particulates

205
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
No blood?
No sign of a struggle?

206
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Nothing. You'll have my full
report by the end of the day

207
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,300
Great. Okay, I need to know what
Colonel Howard was working on

208
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,800
at the time of his death

209
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,900
Get your warrant
Agent Booth

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Dr. Brennan

211
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,400
Hey, excuse me, Equivalent-
to-a-General Sanborn

212
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,200
I got that warrant

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
Why didn't you just
tell her that right away?

214
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,300
I was hoping
we could all be friends

215
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
Let me see that

216
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
These are the documents you
subpoenaed from the Agency?

217
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,200
Yeah, but all the info
is blacked out

218
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,400
Want me to see if
I can get anything out of this?

219
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,200
Can you?

220
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,100
No. I'd need originals

221
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,700
These are photocopies

222
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
Then why did you offer?

223
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,300
Well, why else
would you ask me here?

224
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,700
You're a conspiracy nut
and I thought you'd enjoy
filling in the blanks

225
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,100
With paranoid ravings?

226
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,100
Better than nothing

227
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Lansing Telescope

228
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
- That mean anything to you?
- Yeah

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A multi-gazillion-dollar
deep space, multifrequency

230
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,500
telescope that keeps
needing repairs

231
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
Why did you say it like that?

232
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
It doesn't need repairs

233
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
There's no rust in space

234
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
The so-called "repair crews"
are up there retrieving
classified information

235
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,700
What classified
information?

236
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,700
The telescope is pointed
up at the planet Pluto

237
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,500
Pluto's no longer a planet

238
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
It was demoted

239
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,700
And if the Lansing was
pointed away from the Earth

240
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,700
why would they need
to black out all this material?

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,900
Can I ask you a question?

242
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,900
Yeah

243
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,200
What's the deal on proposing

244
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,600
to--- you know a woman?

245
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,500
I mean, what is the
absolute proper way to do it?

246
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,300
I don't know. The one time
I did it, I got shot down flat

247
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Did you do it by the book?

248
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,600
Mm-hmm
No...

249
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
We were waiting for
the stick to turn blue
or not to turn blue

250
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,000
and I realized
I wanted to marry her if the

251
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,200
stick was
blue or not

252
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah, that's sort of what I did

253
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
only without the sticks

254
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,600
You asked Angela to marry you?

255
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,700
Apparently I didn't do it right

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Do it again

257
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Go all out this time, right?

258
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,600
With the dinner and the getting
down on one knee, the violin

259
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Forget the violin

260
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,300
Hey, hey
with his bone density

261
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,200
Colonel Howard sure as hell
wasn't going back into space again

262
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,700
Yeah, I know, that's why he was
training his replacement

263
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,100
His replacement? For what?

264
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,400
To repair the Lansing Telescope

265
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh, brothers-in-arms
my brother

266
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,500
That replacement's the guy
who can tell you things

267
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
the Agency doesn't
want you to know

268
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Ah

269
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Makes you feel small
doesn't it?

270
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,000
Because the picture's so big?

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,900
No, because the universe
is so big

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
You're not looking
at the universe

273
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,500
You're looking at
an enlarged photograph of Earth

274
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,800
You see one thing
and I see another thing

275
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,800
Personally, I like what I see

276
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Agent Booth
Dr. Brennan

277
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,500
I'm afraid Commander Adams
is scheduled for time
on the A300 Zero-G

278
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
You're welcome
to talk to him there

279
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,200
The Zero-G?

280
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
The Vomit Comet

281
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,800
Makes no sense

282
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,300
Man flies eight missions into space
and he falls out of a plane?

283
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,500
I don't think so

284
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,100
Look, you don't know anyone
who would want to throw
him out of a plane?

285
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,400
Look, I don't mean
to tell you your work

286
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,700
but shouldn't you
be tracking down

287
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
everyone who flew over that
particular piece of real estate?

288
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
We are, but not everyone
filed flight plans

289
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,300
And not everyone
sticks to flight plans

290
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
And you didn't
answer the question

291
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,800
I don't know anyone who didn't
like and respect Cal Howard

292
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,100
All these itineraries--
people keeping secrets
even from their spouses

293
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,600
Look, sir, I understand you
have to ask questions like these

294
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,000
but Cal Howard and Jean Marie
were a very solid couple

295
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,500
Did you ever get drunk together?

296
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
What?

297
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
What my partner
is trying to ask

298
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,300
is if you two were buddies

299
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
Go out and
have drinks

300
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,100
and exchange confidences?

301
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,500
Yes, that's what I asked

302
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,800
Yeah, sure
of course, at times

303
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,100
So you would have known
if his marriage was in trouble?

304
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,500
Yes, sir, I would

305
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,700
How can you be sure?

306
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,300
Because Cal knew when I was
unfaithful to my wife

307
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,600
Colleen?

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
Right. You guys met her
at Cal's place

309
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,200
Look...

310
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
that has to stay between us

311
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,500
Strictly between us

312
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Cal Howard was my friend,
my colleague and my teacher

313
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
If somebody tossed him
from an airplane

314
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,100
I'll do whatever
I can to help

315
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,900
Why do I get the feeling
you want to tell us something?

316
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,200
Commander Adams
prepare to go weightless

317
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,700
We're about to go weightless

318
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,300
As the plane reaches the apogee
of a climb and then falls

319
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,700
we will have 15 to 20 seconds
of weightlessness

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
That was great

321
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,500
Oh, man, you're not kidding

322
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,900
I would like very much
to do that again

323
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
I believe you were about
to tell us something

324
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,000
Cal was talking to the STC

325
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,100
The what?

326
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,500
Space Travel Coalition

327
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,400
It's a privately funded
space exploration
and tourism group

328
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,300
And... did you?

329
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,900
Did we what?
Did we what?

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Vomit in the Comet?

331
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
No, I didn't vomit

332
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm sure they were trying

333
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,100
They can try me any time

334
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,500
It was truly amazing

335
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,700
She had a little bit
too much fun, okay?

336
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,800
So what's with this
whole thing about
space tourism?

337
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,600
Oh, celestial joy rides
for gazillionaires

338
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,000
Selling seats on a spaceship
that don't even exist yet

339
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,400
And won't be viable for
at least another few years

340
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,400
That's what they want
you to think

341
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,700
but these guys are
swimming in dough

342
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,900
I already bought my ticket

343
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,200
I want to see what's
going on up there
with my own eyes

344
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,200
What?

345
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,100
These are the
victim's clothes?

346
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,700
Yes

347
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,500
You'd like me to do
what with them?

348
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Construct a three-dimensional
hypothesis of what caused
this damage to the clothing

349
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,500
Falling from an
airplane isn't enough?

350
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,800
That would explain the burst
seams and pressure tears

351
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,600
but this seems to be...

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Slashes

353
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,000
yeah, When Zack gets ahold
of the bones

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,200
maybe you two can figure out
if something catastrophic
happened to this man

355
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,000
You mean before
he fell to Earth?

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
Yes

357
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,900
Go do your magic

358
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Now?

359
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,300
Are you certain you can't
do what needs to be done
with X-rays alone?

360
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,200
Do you need continued access
to the soft tissue?

361
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Why would the body burst
vertically when all the forces
are horizontal?

362
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,900
Ah, so you need more time with
the soft tissue to answer that?

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,300
Not really

364
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,100
Please explain to me
your reluctance to remove
the flesh from the bones

365
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm all right with it, Zack
if it's absolutely necessary

366
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,800
even the boiling part...

367
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
but perhaps you could at least
acknowledge

368
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,200
that this is a person

369
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,600
Was, you mean

370
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,300
Was someone's husband, Zack

371
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,900
What does that have
to do with removing the flesh
from his bones?

372
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,500
Fine. Do what you have to do

373
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
Thank you

374
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,400
Igor

375
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,800
I beg your pardon
Dr. Saroyan?

376
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,300
Nothing

377
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,700
Hey, Bones
I ran a check on STC

378
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
They're part of the
tin-foil hat squad

379
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,400
What's that?

380
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
They wear tin
little hats

381
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,800
Probably to keep aliens
from controlling their minds

382
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Oh, schizophrenics

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
It's hard to believe
that Colonel Howard

384
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,500
was part of an organization
like that

385
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,100
Do they have
access to planes?

386
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,100
Access? You kidding me?

387
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,500
They actually have a
"border patrol division"

388
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,500
Members fly
their own private planes

389
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,300
and do bimonthly sky patrols
in search of UFOs

390
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,900
Do they file flight plans?

391
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,500
Bones, you're a genius

392
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Look, two nights ago they
had planes on UFO patrol

393
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,000
within spitting distance
of where Colonel Howard's
body was found

394
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,100
Look, we're not
a collection of kooks

395
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,500
Just ordinary people
with a mission

396
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,800
to promote a friendly
liaison with the Visitors

397
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
That's quite a
manifesto

398
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
Until you've had an encounter
you couldn't possibly
understand

399
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You've been abducted?

400
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,100
Multiple times

401
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,600
Mm-hmm
Through hypnosis I've discovered
that medical testing was done

402
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,200
and follow-ups were required

403
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Are there any side effects
from these medical
procedures?

404
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,000
You mean like tin hats?

405
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,300
Paranoia
outbursts of anger

406
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,800
loss of connection
with reality?

407
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,700
You asked me to come
I'm here

408
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
I run a very successful
aeronautics engineering company

409
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm richer than God

410
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,800
Do I appear to have lost
contact with reality?

411
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Well, what about post
abduction syndrome?

412
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,100
Similar to post traumatic
stress disorder

413
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,900
P.A.S. is very real

414
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,300
I admit to bouts with it

415
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Frankly, it's one
of my main motivators

416
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
When we meet the Visitors
face-to-face

417
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
they will explain
so many things to us

418
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Including why you were taken

419
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,200
And why they put
an implant in me

420
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,400
Only then to remove it

421
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,100
Great

422
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,600
- Do you, uh... know this guy?
- Colonel Howard, Of course

423
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,800
- So it's true that you offered him
a position with the STC?
- Yes

424
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,000
As a method of bringing credibility
to your organization?

425
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,200
Yes, but you have to
understand it was Colonel Howard
who came to us

426
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,600
Why?

427
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,500
He wanted to pilot
our suborbital flights

428
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,300
Till your spaceships were ready

429
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
he was going to help
you look for the UFOs

430
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,100
Laugh if you must, but Cal
didn't think we were crazy

431
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,600
He'd seen something
himself up there, you know

432
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,500
And he's hardly
the first

433
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,600
Quite a few astronauts and
military pilots have reported

434
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
seeing evidence
of the Visitors

435
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
- Colonel Howard told you this?
- Yes, he did

436
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,400
So trust me, I'd have been proud
to be the one who sent
Cal Howard back into space

437
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,300
Would have been?

438
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
He changed his mind

439
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,900
Six weeks ago

440
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,800
That didn't make you
a little angry?

441
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
No, not angry

442
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,000
Disappointed

443
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Great, Then you wouldn't
object to my partner and I
taking a look at your fleet of planes?

444
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,300
No, not at all

445
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,400
Why do you think
Colonel Howard changed his mind?

446
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,800
They got to him

447
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,400
Through his wife
I believe

448
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,600
They?

449
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
The Agency

450
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
They can be
very persuasive

451
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,200
Persuasive?

452
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,000
In my opinion, the Agency would
rather have Cal die

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
than have him announce to the
world he'd seen a Visitor

454
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,500
That's not true
The Agency loved Cal

455
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,600
They valued him

456
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Why didn't you tell
us about STC?

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Because it's embarrassing

458
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,800
Cal wanted to get back into
space so badly

459
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,600
he would even listen
to those crazy people

460
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,600
Did you husband see
something up there?

461
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,100
Yes, something that made him
sympathetic

462
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,200
with Mr. Bahr's
organization?

463
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,100
Well, obviously
you know that he did...

464
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
or he said he did

465
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,600
And you doubted him?

466
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,100
It doesn't really
matter now

467
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,000
You know, that was
three years ago

468
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,600
It was his last mission

469
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
And the Agency
explained it in such a way
that Cal was satisfied

470
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,200
Look, it's important that we
know the truth, Mrs. Howard

471
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,400
Why?

472
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,800
Because from
what I've seen your husband
was a man of principle

473
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,600
and if he saw something
he wouldn't just back down to
save his career with the Agency

474
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,000
Even if his wife
begged him to

475
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,500
He insisted on filing
an official report

476
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
He wouldn't withdraw it

477
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,400
- They asked him to?
- Yes

478
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,800
But he stuck by his story

479
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,200
They weren't happy with him

480
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,500
but like I said
that's ancient history

481
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,600
Cal's friend knew about the STC
his wife knew

482
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,100
Maybe the Agency did as well

483
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
What, so they killed him
by tossing him out
of an airplane?

484
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,700
That field is less than a mile
from the coastline

485
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
Obviously they were aiming
at the ocean and they missed

486
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,100
Well, the question is why?

487
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,800
It's a big ocean, right?

488
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,200
- There has to be a reason
- Maybe it wasn't a UFO
that Cal saw

489
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,400
- Ah...
- He could have seen
something else

490
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Oh, yeah, like--
a death beam or a space baby

491
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
I was thinking more
along the lines

492
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,700
of a spy satellite
or experimental technology

493
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,100
No, Maybe the Agency
was afraid

494
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,300
that Cal was sharing sensitive
information with the SCT

495
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Well, regardless
our government does not kill people
okay, Bones?

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
You were a sniper

497
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,100
Wasn't it our government
who sent you to kill people?

498
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
Just saying

499
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,900
Mmm
something smells good

500
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,400
Help yourself

501
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,500
Ho!

502
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,700
These definitely human bones?

503
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,000
'Cause apparently
there are a few types
of aliens

504
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,700
races, if you will
One is quite reptilian
widely known as "Grays"

505
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Definitely human

506
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,800
Another's bone structure's
more amphibian

507
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,000
These bones are as human
as you are

508
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,600
Oh, if you only knew
how irony-packed that is

509
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a joke

510
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,900
Don't you be coming around
to boil me in the middle
of the night

511
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
There's a strange callous
formation on his right
femoral head

512
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Also bone marrow edema
in the same spot

513
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Healing from a fracture?

514
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,300
No. Some kind of tuberous
cortical defect

515
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I've never seen anything
like this before

516
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,700
Now you're freaking me out

517
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,300
I have to get Dr. Brennan
to take a look at this

518
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,300
It looks like he was
in the initial stages
of osteonecrosis

519
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,700
What did you get
from the tox screen?

520
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,500
Excess levels of vitamins D
K, E, A and C

521
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,700
along with glutamine peptides
and creatine monohydrate

522
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,500
All the supplements
he was taking before his
last space mission

523
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,300
There's something odd
about the texture of this bone

524
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Leucine
isoleucine and valine

525
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,900
He foresaw going back
into space

526
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,200
This is not bone

527
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,900
What is it?

528
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
A callous has formed
over some kind of thick
porous substance

529
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,900
Careful

530
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,200
It's an implant of some kind

531
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,700
I never saw anything
on the X rays

532
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,600
How could that not show up
on X rays?

533
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,600
What the hell is this?

534
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,300
Zoantharia of the order
scleractinia

535
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Scleractinia has a calcium-
carbonate exoskeleton

536
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,000
with a porosity similar
to human bone

537
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,500
Which would make it
biocompatible

538
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,300
So it wouldn't
show up on X rays

539
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,100
Wait. So this is coral
like from a reef?

540
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,900
Suspended in a biphasic
hydroxyapatite-tricalcium-
phosphate coating

541
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,400
Theoretically, the calcium
from the exoskeleton would grow

542
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,200
hopefully overcoming the loss
of his degenerating bone

543
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,500
Then this attachment
would be...?

544
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,500
An electromagnetic device
implanted to accelerate growth

545
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,700
So it's a combination
of human and alien technology

546
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
Don't say that to Booth

547
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
But if that's the case
then all the vitamins
and amino acids

548
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,900
he was loaded up with
work mainly to ward
off infection

549
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
And he'd need them, too

550
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,900
Bone marrow's highly
susceptible

551
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,500
This is a very risky procedure

552
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,300
I got to say it-- Frank Olson

553
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,800
He was a U.S. Army scientist
in the '50s

554
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,700
and an unwitting participant
in Project MK Ultra

555
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,300
They said
he committed suicide

556
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,300
but an exhumation
45 years later
proved he was murdered

557
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,700
You need more
Project Paperclip
MK Artichoke

558
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,200
and who could forget
Tuskegee?

559
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,000
The government experiments
on people and then
abandons them or worse

560
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,400
What's the point
of this experiment?

561
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,500
The main obstacle
to long-term space travel
is bone demineralization

562
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,600
If the space program
could overcome this one effect

563
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,700
their funding would triple
overnight

564
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,800
Well, there you go

565
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,500
Experimental program
for deep space fails

566
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,400
and the evidence has
to be gotten rid of

567
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,800
By tossing it
from a plane?

568
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,200
Why not just have
the visitors toss him
into the sun?

569
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,100
That is a good question

570
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,400
No, it's not

571
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,400
Sometimes when people try
to cover things up

572
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,900
it goes wrong, that's all

573
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,200
First thing
we should do

574
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,000
is find out
the source of this technology

575
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,200
Colonel Reid
was Cal's commanding officer
on three missions

576
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,900
So you were the person to whom
he reported the UFO sighting?

577
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,900
Oh, for God's sake

578
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,500
You see what happens?
You people get all secretive
about things and...

579
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,400
What Cal saw was space junk

580
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,800
It was satellite parts
a discarded hatch
a screwdriver

581
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,400
That information isn't cleared

582
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,100
Sounded like more
than a screwdriver

583
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,300
Well, it wasn't

584
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,000
Cal just thought
we should be able to explain

585
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,100
why it was whizzing around
space at 25,000 miles an hour
and that's all

586
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,400
Was Colonel Howard in a cast
recently?

587
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Last winter
said he broke his leg
parasailing in the Caribbean

588
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,900
All of our astronauts
suffer from brittle bones

589
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,300
I stepped off a ladder once
and my tibia snapped
like a twig

590
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,400
Why do you ask?

591
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,700
Because of this

592
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,400
We found it
in Colonel Howard's leg

593
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,200
We think it's designed
to counteract the effects
of osteonecrosis

594
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
Experimental surgery
on one of our astronauts?

595
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,400
Absolutely not

596
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,100
Our efforts to counter
bone loss are limited
to strength-and-resistance

597
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,400
training and supplements

598
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,100
I trust you have documentation

599
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
Follow me

600
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Thank you

601
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,800
Colonel

602
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
have you ever
seen anything

603
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,100
any screwdrivers up there?

604
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,600
There's an awful lot up there
to see, Doctor

605
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,000
Trick is not to let it
cloud your judgment

606
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,300
Did it ever cloud Cal's?

607
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Never, not once

608
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,900
And yet he wanted to go back
into space so badly

609
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
in spite of the physical
damage it had caused him

610
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,200
the pain he was in

611
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,200
Let me show you something

612
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,400
You see this?
That's me

613
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,100
And that there, that's Cal

614
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,600
20 minutes I spent out there
that day

615
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,500
and it is the last thing
I think about every night

616
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
I can imagine...

617
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,000
No. All due respect
you really can't

618
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,100
This was the best moment
of my life, counting marriage

619
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
kids, everything

620
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm not saying
that's good or right

621
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,300
but I do know
it was the same for Cal

622
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
for all of us who went up there

623
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,900
And we would do anything
we could to get back

624
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,000
This coral's growth
was aided artificially

625
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,300
It was seeded
with resin beads
on glass plates

626
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,700
Which makes it rare
enough to trace to a
pharmaceutical supply house

627
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
based in Geneva, Switzerland

628
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
I searched the literature

629
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,600
There's a number of clinics
and researchers working on
bone replacement

630
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,100
The doctor most likely to
have performed this procedure
on our victim

631
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,600
is Dr. Henry Pascal

632
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
In Switzerland?

633
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,400
Based in Bethesda
with a clinic in Haiti

634
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,000
plus he worked
for the space agency
until 1998

635
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,600
What happened?

636
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,100
He lost his funding and turned
to the private sector

637
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,800
namely the Space Travel Coalition

638
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,200
The foil hat squad
funds this guy?

639
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
Booth is going to love that

640
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,400
- Why?
- Because he doesn't believe
in coincidences

641
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,500
Cal wasn't on vacation
when he hurt his leg

642
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,800
He was in Haiti
for a convention

643
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,200
Can you think of any
reason Colonel Reid would tell us
a different story?

644
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
No

645
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
Please, what
what's going on?

646
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,300
We found evidence
in your husband's remains

647
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,300
that he underwent
an experimental surgery in Haiti

648
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
What kind
of experimental surgery?

649
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
To replace his bone loss

650
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,600
That sound like him?

651
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,600
Yes

652
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,400
Was it like your husband
to keep it a secret from you?

653
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,200
Yes

654
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,400
Cal wouldn't want me to worry

655
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,300
Cal Howard's skeleton
before...

656
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,100
and after
he fell to Earth

657
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Every bone showed trauma

658
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,100
His clothing before...

659
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,600
and after he fell to Earth

660
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,100
Ripped
every seam pulled apart

661
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,600
If I make the clothing
translucent...

662
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,500
we can see that some
of the clothing damage

663
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
lines up with the trauma
to his skeleton

664
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,400
And if you isolate the bone
damage caused by a device

665
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,200
capable of making robust cuts
in a linear path...

666
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
The guy was chopped

667
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,100
he chopped?

668
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
Yeah. Clothing damage
flesh wounds

669
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,800
Bone damage

670
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,900
He was chopped

671
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,900
Ange, tonight
you and me 

672
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,200
reservations at
Les Deux Copains 8:00

673
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Wow, fancy

674
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,100
Suit-and-gown fancy, baby

675
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
So leave your mukluks at home

676
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,600
What's the occasion?

677
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
An ax or hatchet
or machete makes sharp
well-defined cuts

678
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,300
These edges are abraded

679
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,700
This our guy?

680
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,600
Hey, do aliens use any weapons
resembling a...?

681
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,800
A broadsword?

682
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,100
How about a light saber?

683
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,600
No, those can cut through
any known substance

684
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
The victim would have
been completely
dismembered

685
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,100
If they existed, Zack

686
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,300
Makeup hair done
high heels
the whole enchilada

687
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,000
Only whatever's French
for "enchilada"

688
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,300
No mukluks. Got it

689
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,800
Dr. Pascal
Colonel Calvin Howard is dead

690
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Not because of anything I did

691
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,700
Wow, didn't even blink

692
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,500
Colonel Howard
sought me out

693
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
I know how he died?

694
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,200
Let's just say it was
a really bad fall

695
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,900
And what's this got
to do with me?

696
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,700
Was your procedure a success?

697
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,100
How do you define success?

698
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,300
Just answer the question

699
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
That's actually a fair question

700
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,100
The results were heartening

701
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,300
There were extremely painful
calluses growing over your implant

702
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
I'd very much like to see that

703
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,200
And there was no indication
of an actual reversal of necrosis

704
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,500
The calluses were part
of the healing process

705
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,700
See, coral resorption is slow
but effective as a scaffold
for osteoprogenitor cells

706
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,400
Incorporating
the electrode was
speeding the process

707
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,900
In my opinion
Cal was only months away
from having mature lamellar bone

708
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,700
No way to know for sure now
right?

709
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
- Correct
- Probably to your benefit
to terminate your experiment

710
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,700
before it went wrong

711
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Keep those venture capitalists
on the edge of their seats

712
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,100
You think I pushed
Colonel Howard off a ladder

713
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,200
Or out of an airplane

714
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,300
Look, you can have all my data

715
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,300
my projections
everything

716
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,100
Colonel Howard goes
on the next shuttle mission
to repair the Lansing Telescope

717
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,400
I'm in every medical
journal in the country

718
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
That mission's a month away

719
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,600
Would his body have been ready?

720
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,500
At the rate Cal was healing
I believe so

721
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,800
Did anyone at the Agency
know about this?

722
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,800
We were going to petition them
officially next month

723
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,100
Look, you may not like me

724
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,800
but I was his savior
and he was mine

725
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,100
I didn't kill Colonel Howard

726
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,800
Somebody's lying
to us, right?

727
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,400
Yeah, maybe everybody

728
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,900
Well, this is
your strength

729
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,300
reading people's minds
telling them they're lying

730
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,800
My strength?
Wait a sec
The trouble is-- no, no,--

731
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,400
you haven't given me anything
that I can spring on the suspect
to see how he reacts

732
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
- Like what?
- Oh, like a murder weapon

733
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,700
or whether or not the poor
bastard was dead
before he hit the ground

734
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
Zack and Angela say he was

735
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,500
Okay, well, that's something
Dead how?

736
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,500
Best guess right now
a broadsword

737
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,400
A broadsword?

738
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Like King Arthur?

739
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,100
Yes

740
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,200
Broadsword

741
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,200
You know what, Bones
I like the whole alien thing
much better. Broadsword?

742
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,000
Where do you people come up
with this stuff?

743
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,900
I didn't say
an actual broadsword

744
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,500
I said,
"Like a broadsword"

745
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,000
It was the closest analog
I could access

746
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,000
No traces from the weapon
left on the bone?

747
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,900
Traces are left
when the weapon cuts deeply
into the bone

748
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,800
Whatever this was
wasn't very sharp
Left nothing behind

749
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
How about shape?

750
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,100
The pattern is consistent with
sharp-force trauma

751
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,900
from a curved blade
approximately
65 millimeters thick

752
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,000
And if I am late for dinner
I will find whatever it is

753
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,300
and I will hit
you with it

754
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,400
Wow, you...

755
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,000
you look incredible

756
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
- You really do
- You know what else?

757
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,400
I can tell just by
looking at you--
you smell great

758
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,000
You cannot see smell

759
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,000
The victim was struck
four times

760
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,500
A glancing blow to the head
right humerus

761
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,400
thoracic, and left femur

762
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
We couldn't figure out
in what order

763
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,300
It's almost as though
it were simultaneous

764
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,100
The blow to the head is
what killed him

765
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,500
Come on, four hits
simultaneously with a broadsword

766
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,400
What was he
attacked by the knights
of the roundtable?

767
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,000
65 millimeters
is too thick for a sword

768
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,300
Did you estimate
a velocity?

769
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,700
It was moving at a velocity
of approximately
116 meters per second

770
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,100
What's that in American?

771
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,900
About 260 miles per hour

772
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
All right, look
I'm no expert in broadswords

773
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,800
- but I do know...
- I know what happened

774
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,700
How fast does a propeller turn?

775
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,300
At full speed, the tips approach
the speed of sound

776
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,500
But Howard exits the airplane
in flight

777
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,800
The propeller
is ahead of him
and pulling away

778
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,600
How could he come
into contact with it?

779
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,900
There are pusher propellers

780
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,200
It didn't happen in the air

781
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,500
He was pushed into a propeller?

782
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,100
He would've turned
into steak tartare

783
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,600
Scratch one item
off the menu tonight

784
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Not if the plane was idling

785
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Propeller speeds would decrease
to a thousand or so RPMs

786
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
- Let's go
- Where?

787
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,500
We'll look for
a dented propeller

788
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,400
Come on
Which you do
not need me for

789
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,700
Hey
You're right, here they come

790
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,200
I hope you have
another warrant

791
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,100
This is for the hangar
not the individual planes

792
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Then why are your people
looking at propellers?

793
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,700
Because the warrant
includes anything
that is in plain sight

794
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,700
Plane sight

795
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,400
Get it?

796
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,500
It's a pun

797
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,500
Yeah, and this is
not the only hangar
we'll be checking out

798
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,200
What plane are you
looking for specifically?

799
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,200
Well, we'll know it
when we see it

800
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,900
We believe that Colonel Howard
was struck by a propeller

801
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,100
We're looking for
blood stains using
alternate light sources

802
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,800
You think Cal walked
into a propeller?

803
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,100
No way he makes
a bonehead move like that

804
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,900
We surmise
he was pushed

805
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,700
But why?

806
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,500
Here he was
this great guy

807
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,400
but he was liability
to one of you

808
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,000
One of us?

809
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Somebody wanted him dead

810
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,700
That's ridiculous

811
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,600
If it turned out that Cal
was able to reverse his bone loss

812
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,900
would you put him
on the next shuttle?

813
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,500
The one to repair the
Lansing Telescope again

814
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
Colonel Adams is slated
for that mission

815
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,000
Colonel Reid?

816
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,500
Well, Cal would be
my first choice, yes

817
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,700
All due respect, James

818
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,300
But why send the student
when the teacher can go?

819
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
Look, I take no offense

820
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
Cal was the best

821
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,700
Dr. Brennan
Agent Booth

822
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,500
Blood
A lot of it

823
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,200
It was washed
down this drain here
High-pressure hose

824
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Can you tell which plane's
propeller may have done this?

825
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,600
Not within the parameters
of the current warrant

826
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Some of these planes
have covers on the propellers

827
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,300
so we can't
see if they're damaged

828
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,900
That is your plane
isn't it, James?

829
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,600
Take it off

830
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,500
Take off the cover, James

831
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,600
I respectfully decline

832
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,200
It's not his plane
it's the Agency's

833
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,100
Propeller like that
wouldn't get you very far

834
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,300
Certainly not
over the water

835
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Which is why you had
to dump Cal's body
short of the ocean

836
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,800
Booth

837
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,900
Booth

838
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,400
It doesn't make sense

839
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
The whole thing would take
at least two people--

840
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
putting the body in the plane

841
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,800
cleaning up the blood
shoving the body
out of the plane

842
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Who are you protecting?

843
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,200
Mrs. Howard...

844
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,800
Is Colleen here?

845
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,800
Colleen came to see me off

846
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,000
Saw me talking to Cal

847
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,900
He was telling me that
he was going to be okay
in time for the mission

848
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,300
He was sharing good news

849
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,200
But it wasn't good
not to me

850
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,900
She slapped him
that's all

851
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,600
Because she loves me

852
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
She knew what it meant to me
not to go up

853
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,200
Cal took a step back
just one

854
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,200
He fell back into the propeller

855
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,500
Why didn't you just say
it was an accident?

856
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,100
I don't know
we panicked

857
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
Would they believe us?
Would they understand?

858
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,300
Would you ever get into space?

859
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,800
It happened because my friend
shared good news with me

860
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
and because my wife loves me

861
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,900
I'm a blessed man

862
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,200
How-how are you feeling?

863
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,400
What do you mean?

864
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Good meal
nice bottle of wine

865
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,900
You feeling loving?

866
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,200
You didn't need to
do all of this to get me
in a loving mood

867
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,600
I don't mean in that way

868
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,700
I am madly in love
with you, Angela

869
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,200
And you are the
most amazing woman
that I have ever met

870
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,300
My life is so much
better since we...

871
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,100
Oh, my God

872
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,400
What?

873
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
Are you breaking up with me?

874
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,000
Why would I get you
all dressed up for dinner
just to break up?

875
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,900
I don't know

876
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,700
Because you're...

877
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,600
I'm not thinking straight
Go ahead

878
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,200
You know, I had this
all laid out in my mind

879
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,700
You are an upsetting woman

880
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm sorry

881
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,600
Please go ahead

882
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,600
I believe that if two people
care enough for each other

883
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,800
the rest of the world
disappears to them

884
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,200
I feel that when I'm with you

885
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,900
I'm prepared to put you ahead of
me for the rest of my life

886
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Angela Montenegro...

887
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,900
will you marry me?

888
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,800
Dear man

889
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,300
good heart...

890
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
No

891
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,700
Why?

892
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,400
I didn't do it
right again?

893
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,100
But...
How?

894
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,200
Oh, you're not
going to tell me

895
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,500
I don't know
Hodgins

896
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,600
If I knew
I would tell you

897
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,200
But when you ask me
I have to have this...

898
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
this feeling

899
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,800
It has to be...

900
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,400
I'll know it when it happens

901
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
and I hope you
won't stop trying

902
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
I don't know whether
I should laugh

903
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,800
cry or punch out the sommelier

904
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,600
I'm sorry

905
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
I hope that you choose laugh

906
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,200
I don't understand

907
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,500
I don't either

908
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,000
Look, let's just
finish the dessert and
go back to your place

909
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,000
and make love and
maybe it'll come to me

910
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,400
While we make love?

911
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,600
I said maybe

912
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,000
But you love me

913
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,400
More than you know

914
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,300
You eat yet?

915
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,800
I said I'd wait

916
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,300
How did you know that
James would tell me?

917
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,200
Well, man loves his wife

918
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,700
He may not be strong
but he has a conscience

919
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
See, I...
I can't tell that stuff

920
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,700
And I can't tell the difference
between coral and bone

921
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
so guess we make a great pair

922
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,900
Hey, speaking of marriage
Hodgins is going to
propose to Angela tonight

923
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,800
What?

924
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,200
I guess right now it looks
to me like marriage

925
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,700
is having someone
who'll slap your enemies

926
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,100
and then toss their dead
bodies out of airplanes

927
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,100
Try not to mention
that to Angela

928
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,300
