1
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,883
Traffic?

2
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:21,007
Dr. Brennan looked a little
hurt when I told her

3
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:23,383
you asked me to come out
here instead of her.

4
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:25,441
No, Bones' feelings,
they don't get hurt.

5
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,140
- She's not like you.
- Like me?

6
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,343
A girl.

7
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,764
Yeah, the word you're looking
for would be "woman,"

8
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:32,674
who, incidentally, makes
more money than you.

9
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:34,087
- Touchy.
- What can I say?

10
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:36,528
- I'm just a girl with feelings.
- Listen, construction crew

11
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:39,430
they found the body this afternoon.
Key word here is "body."

12
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:40,844
As in still meaty.

13
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,772
Male, middle-aged.

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,794
Bones, she usually...
kneels next to the remains.

15
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,352
These are designer pants.

16
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,415
And my bodies are always so
much gushier than Dr. Brennan's.

17
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,863
I'm just saying.

18
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:00,668
Looks like a stab wound
to the middle of the chest.

19
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:02,803
Naked, wrapped in plastic.

20
00:01:02,908 --> 00:01:05,886
Bite marks to the face and extremities.

21
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,002
Looks like rats.

22
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,280
Rats.

23
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:13,918
Looks like he might have been
kneecapped. Mob thing, maybe?

24
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:17,913
What's that?

25
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,193
Some kind of gem stone.

26
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:27,471
This blow through the sternum
would have been fatal.

27
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,229
Dealt by a double-edged blade.

28
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:31,005
So we know our killer is strong.

29
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,794
Based on the rate of decomp,
I'd say he's been dead three days.

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,542
- Probably dumped Friday night.
- The gem stone is jade.

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,800
- I'm narrowing down the exact type now.
- Grit from the wounds.

32
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:42,071
Hey, grit to you, open book to me.

33
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,908
The injuries to the knees aren't
from baseball bats or bullets.

34
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:47,014
Zack is right.

35
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,788
The victim's patellas were
removed surgically.

36
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,111
King of the Lab.

37
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:12,884
Dr. Brennan?

38
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:14,230
Yes?

39
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,629
Amy Hollister.

40
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:18,127
I'm your brother's girlfriend?

41
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,571
Of course. Please come in.

42
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,078
Would you like something to drink?

43
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,868
No, no, I-I'm sorry, I...

44
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:30,153
I don't have a lot of time.

45
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:31,747
Do you know where Russ is?

46
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,958
Amy, I haven't seen Russ in months.

47
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:44,022
I have two little girls, well,
you know, and...

48
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:48,461
The youngest one,
that's Hayley, she's not doing too good.

49
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,776
Cystic fibrosis.

50
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,433
Russ mentioned that
she had lung problems.

51
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:57,250
Well, her breathing's real bad

52
00:02:57,984 --> 00:03:00,282
and... now her liver.

53
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,315
And... she keeps asking for Russ.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,965
I'm...

55
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:07,419
going to give you the...

56
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,981
phone number of Dr. Leo Goetz.

57
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,796
He's the premiere authority on
cystic fibrosis in the country.

58
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:17,379
I can't afford that.

59
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:21,833
Oh, no, Amy... Leo and I are friends.

60
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:25,427
He'd do it for me as a favor, no charge.

61
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,972
I'm going to give him a call,
tell him to expect you.

62
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,495
I... I don't know what to say.

63
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,760
- Thank you.
- And as for Russ...

64
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:35,462
I think you're be better off
talking to Dad.

65
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,387
I understand.

66
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,555
Thank you for your time.

67
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,855
The knees.

68
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:32,488
Bones S03E07 "The Knight on the Grid"

--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

72
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,486
Somebody sent you human
kneecaps in the mail?

73
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:59,361
That is like ugh.

74
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,985
Zack says they match our victim.

75
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,910
Look, we're dusting
the envelope for prints.

76
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,745
It was sent somewhere
from the D.C. area.

77
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,971
- These patellas are unusually worn.
- Worn from what?

78
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:09,956
It's hard to say definitively, but I'd
say the man did a lot of kneeling.

79
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,152
Wait a minute, I've seen that before.

80
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,709
That symbol looks familiar.

81
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:15,264
Like it's from some kind of seal.

82
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,812
Hey, look, Bones, you are gonna,
you know, stay with a friend,

83
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:20,022
- check into a hotel, right?
- She can stay with me.

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,356
- Great.
- Thank you. No. Why?

85
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:24,095
Mr. Kneecaps has your home address.

86
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,215
I can't freak out every time
somebody Googles me.

87
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,584
Cam? She goes nowhere alone.

88
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,277
- Cam? Don't listen to him.
- Who are you more afraid of, me or her?

89
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:36,111
So this is what it's like to be
a kindergarten teacher.

90
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,623
Fascinating interpersonal interaction.

91
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:39,850
Dr. Sweets.

92
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,161
I...

93
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:42,847
Oh, my...

94
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,146
that is gross.
Yeah, it's an autopsy room.

95
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,504
It's no place for therapists.
What do you want?

96
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:50,954
You and Dr. Brennan missed
our session this morning.

97
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,601
Maybe because somebody sent
body parts to Bones in the mail.

98
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,608
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,927
I've identified the murder weapon.

100
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,070
Oh, that was quick.

101
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,852
Tapered inch and a half wide
with both a hilt and a quillon.

102
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:05,873
The cannelure is also quite distinctive.

103
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:08,083
That's the Gormogon knife.

104
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,789
The serial killer?

105
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,466
Which is why the symbol
looked so familiar.

106
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,443
I've seen it on a tapestry in the vault.

107
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:20,138
So this is the famous bank vault where
the violinist was murdered and eaten?

108
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:23,811
We transported everything from the
bank here to the Jeffersonian.

109
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:27,650
So, if you touch anything, Sweets, you
put it back exactly the way it was.

110
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,001
Oh, awesome.

111
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:30,703
The Widow's Son sculpture.

112
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:34,106
It's complete silver skeleton which
is replaced piece by piece

113
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,512
with the bones from murder victims.

114
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,403
Then all of the relics,
including that skeleton,

115
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,569
can be traced to the Gormogons.

116
00:06:41,682 --> 00:06:46,620
A 17th century anti-Masonic group.
Supposed to be extinct.

117
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,384
How many victims?

118
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,851
Oh, the statue contains
the bones of at least five

119
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:54,370
five unidentified victims
plus the violinist.

120
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,182
That is the actual violinist's pinky.

121
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,955
Well, obviously Gormogon sent you
his kneecaps to continue his work.

122
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,895
We are not fitting those
kneecaps onto this skeleton.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,218
Mark my words: you'll find something
special about those kneecaps.

124
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:11,113
Okay, this tapestry here is off somehow.

125
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,098
Off?

126
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:16,830
Don't look at me. My idea of art is
a half-naked woman on the side of a van.

127
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,740
That's interesting.

128
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:22,943
No, it's not interesting, Sweets,
because it was a joke.

129
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,878
Okay, what's the matter?

130
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:33,214
Russ's girlfriend, Amy, came to see me.

131
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:36,144
Her daughter's sick.
She's looking for Russ.

132
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,084
I told her that my dad might
know where he is.

133
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,846
Your brother is a wanted fugitive,
he's a material witness in your

134
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,761
- Dad's murder trial.
- Amy knows that.

135
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,307
He's not gonna come back just because
your niece has a cough.

136
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,473
Technically, she's not my niece
and it's not a cough.

137
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,721
It's cystic fibrosis.

138
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:52,731
Missing persons sent over dental
records from middle-aged men.

139
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,293
I checked them against the victim.

140
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,716
- You get a hit?
- Father Douglas Cooper.

141
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,902
Vicar General to the Archbishop
of Washington D. C.

142
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:02,413
Okay, Sweets was right
about the kneecaps.

143
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:04,753
This guy would have been
a world-class kneeler.

144
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:07,587
Saying that someone is a whiz at
psychology is like saying they're

145
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:10,087
good at mind reading.
It's a series of lucky guesses.

146
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,741
I'm bringing Sweets in on the case.

147
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:14,984
- You make fun of him all the time.
- Only when he messes with our heads.

148
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,398
He was right about the knees.

149
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:19,698
Zack, shouldn't you be figuring out what
was used to excise the kneecaps?

150
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:20,976
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

151
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,127
What?

152
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:24,555
You just dismissed Zack.

153
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,059
No, I didn't.

154
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:29,127
Oh, don't get me wrong, I, I liked it.

155
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,044
Thank you for coming in,
Archbishop Wallace.

156
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,014
You found my Vicar General?

157
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,460
Yes, your Holiness.

158
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:36,946
Monsignor.

159
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,338
Or Steve.

160
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,761
So, how did Doug die?

161
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,456
- Well, Steve...
- Bones!

162
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:44,927
- He said to call him Steve.
- Monsignor.

163
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,356
Father Cooper was stabbed to death.

164
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,123
As a part of a series of
cannibalistic murders.

165
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,552
A series of cannibalistic murders?

166
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:58,207
We're still trying to find out
what they have in common.

167
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,718
Doug Cooper was a, a quiet man.

168
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:04,992
He'd been on sabbatical for
the past six months.

169
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,665
- He was writing a book.
- About?

170
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,207
The history of early Christianity.

171
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,774
Its ties to paganism.

172
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:11,154
Esoteric stuff.

173
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,706
Somebody ate Doug?

174
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,282
Just a part of him.

175
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,232
A lovely, decent man,

176
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:24,232
humble, dedicated to serving others.

177
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,620
Unfortunate choice of words,
given that someone ate him.

178
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,216
Just a part of him.

179
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,951
There's too much evil in the world.

180
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,605
God forgive me, but...

181
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,669
sometimes I wonder if I'm little
more than a Band-Aid.

182
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,540
Amen, Monsignor. Amen.

183
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:41,969
Thanks, Steve.

184
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:48,322
Angela identified the red-haired
figure on the tapestry.

185
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:49,382
Barabbas.

186
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:53,036
A murder and rapist who was condemned to
death in New Testament Jerusalem.

187
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,728
The Gormogons believed that the
descendents of Barabbas

188
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,735
started the first secret societies.

189
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:01,976
To the Gormogons, Barabbas is an
enduring symbol of all that is backwards

190
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:03,878
upside-down, or inside out.

191
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,931
So if you find his figure on
a Gormogon relic...

192
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:10,454
It's a sign to interpret it backwards
or in a mirror or upside-down.

193
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:14,066
The numbers on the tapestry
are a simple alpha-numeric code.

194
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,269
Each number corresponds with a letter.

195
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,450
Civitas capitolium.

196
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,014
Which means "Capitol City."

197
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:23,281
D. C. was laid out
according to Masonic symbols.

198
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,581
Now, notice the Pentagram here
over the White House?

199
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,454
And you see the compass and the square.

200
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:30,750
The point of the compass is over
the U. S. Capitol building.

201
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,367
But here's where Angela's Barabbas
thing really kicks in.

202
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:37,652
The presence of Barabbas on this means
backwards and upside-down.

203
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,457
When the compass is inverted, it points
to some very interesting landmarks.

204
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,785
The bank... where we found the vault.

205
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,492
The place where Father Cooper's
body was dumped.

206
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:51,169
The highway overpass off of which
Gavin Nichols's head was thrown.

207
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,493
What's there?

208
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:54,805
It's an old mansion that's
now a nursing home.

209
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,737
And this... falls very precisely...

210
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,579
- What's that?
- A mausoleum at Silver Hill Cemetery.

211
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,903
You want to look inside?

212
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,286
Hell, yeah, I do.

213
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,301
This mausoleum is abandonned
here since the 1800.

214
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,512
It's paid for by a trust.

215
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,707
As far as the Director of
the Cemetery knows,

216
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:15,370
- no one's been out here for a century.
- This better be good.

217
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,075
Look, "Pater Mortvvs."

218
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:18,489
That means dead father.

219
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:19,790
You know Latin?

220
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,978
Dude.

221
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,331
Alter boy.

222
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:27,557
You got a key?

223
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:29,166
Yeah, brought my own.

224
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,745
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

225
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:32,707
What?

226
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:34,022
- Can I do it?
- No.

227
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,593
You don't let me play with your bugs.

228
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,873
Ah, great.

229
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:49,622
Another one.

230
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,248
this one's completely made of bone.

231
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,095
Hi.

232
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:14,486
How's Hayley doing?

233
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,622
Dr. Goetz is a Godsend.

234
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,464
I don't know how to thank you.

235
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,261
Oh, Hayley, sweetie, that's Dr. Brennan.

236
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,757
Temperance.

237
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,381
Another doctor?

238
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:26,072
Oh, not that kind.

239
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,944
Temperance is Russ's sister.

240
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,267
Couldn't you call him and tell
him to come home?

241
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:33,786
It's complicated.

242
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:35,944
Here, eat your Jell-O, sweetie.

243
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,763
I tried to get into
the jail to see your father.

244
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,628
They wouldn't let me in.
They said I'm not a relative.

245
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,357
Amy, Russ is a fugitive.

246
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,976
The minute he comes back to D. C.,
they'll toss him in jail.

247
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,525
Well, how would anyone know?

248
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:51,999
Well, I work with the FBI.

249
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,743
You don't have to be in this.

250
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:57,676
All you have to do is ask your father
to get a message to Russ.

251
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,450
You look my baby in the face

252
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:05,737
and tell her she can't see her father
because you're mad at yours.

253
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,448
What have we got?

254
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:19,975
So far, I've identified 18 different
victims, and I'm not done.

255
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,475
All bones show cannibalism indicators.

256
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,888
This tibia appears
to be over 50 years old.

257
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,798
You mean the victim's over 50?

258
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,049
What I mean is, the victim was
killed over 50 years ago.

259
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:36,116
That would suggest that Gormogon's,
what, a- a minimum of 70 years old?

260
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,600
The teeth marks on this bone
do not match Gormogon's teeth.

261
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,307
My God.

262
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:45,152
We have another cannibal out there?
An old one?

263
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,950
The gemstone you found in Father
Cooper's chest is violet jade.

264
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:50,640
The dirt contains sepiolite.

265
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,551
And we're happy about this because?

266
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:56,416
Both violet jade and sepiolite are found
only in a certain region of Turkey.

267
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,867
The Anatolia region, to be exact.

268
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,356
Legendary site of the Garden of Eden.

269
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,371
And this comes from the vault.

270
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:04,446
Guess what?

271
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:05,800
It's the same stuff.

272
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:08,980
Run the new dentals against
the NCIC database.

273
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,370
What do you want me to do?

274
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:14,627
Be on the lookout for a face-eating
cannibal who uses a walker?

275
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:23,063
There's my girl.

276
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:26,694
I... I brought you a
coffee cake, but they...

277
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,972
they took it from me.

278
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:29,654
Oh, well, I'm not into coffee cake.

279
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,941
These days, all my... meals are
prepared by men in hairnets.

280
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,364
I'm glad you came.

281
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,317
While I was waiting, I was thinking
about all the places

282
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:45,392
that I've been that
were worse than prison.

283
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:49,624
El Salvador, for example, and that two
weeks I spent in a shipping container.

284
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:50,808
Disney World.

285
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,147
You hated Disney World.

286
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:55,237
I thought I was always able to keep
that from you kids.

287
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:57,523
No. I was six, Russ was ten.

288
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:58,929
It was pouring rain.

289
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,184
Mickey sneezed so hard,
his head popped off.

290
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,086
I think I like prison better.

291
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:13,930
Dad, I'm here about Russ.

292
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,011
He's fine. You don't have
to worry about Russ.

293
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:20,756
The woman he lived with, the-the kids
he was raising... they need him home.

294
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:23,468
Russ sends Amy and the girls
money every month.

295
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,308
The younger child, Hayley, is...

296
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,308
really sick.

297
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,608
She's asking for him. How sick?

298
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,541
I'm here, Dad.

299
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:35,751
I am asking you to tell Russ.

300
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:38,571
Let him make up his own mind what to do.

301
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:42,279
If he comes back to D. C., Russ is
going to end up in here with me.

302
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:45,135
He won't do that.
He's scared to death of jail.

303
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:47,586
He'll come if you ask him to.

304
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:52,230
You look more like your
mother every day.

305
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,682
I've got to go.

306
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,097
Well, come back soon.

307
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,542
And thanks for the coffee cake.

308
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:14,697
I found the same symbol that
was mailed to Dr. Brennan

309
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:18,321
- on this tapestry.
- It looks like a bunch of Tarot cards.

310
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:22,787
The Architect, The Martyr, The Orator,

311
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:27,253
The Musician, The Bishop,
The Corruptor...

312
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,239
- That's it.
- What?

313
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:30,517
Gavin Nichols.

314
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:31,743
The musician.

315
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,186
Father Cooper was a bishop.

316
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:34,871
He's doing it in order?

317
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:38,194
- What's next?
- The Corruptor.

318
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,615
So, the next victim is a corruptor.

319
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:44,551
So, let's call up every porn kingpin
and drug dealer in the country.

320
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,369
Tell them to look out for a lunatic with

321
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,933
a napkin in his collar holding
a knife and fork.

322
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:53,054
Dude, you're being way too literal.
These icons extend from the 1600s.

323
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:57,869
A corruptor would mean a heretic, like,
say, a pretender to the throne.

324
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,206
What are you doing here?

325
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,161
You left a message that
you wanted to see me.

326
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,410
Not see. Talk.

327
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,074
On the telephone.

328
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:06,209
Interesting what people say unwittingly.

329
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,030
I'm totally into the Gormogon file,
and it's my opinion,

330
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,336
you're looking for a duo.

331
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,731
How did you get the file?

332
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:14,648
You gave him the case file?

333
00:17:14,753 --> 00:17:17,896
Time out, okay? He came up with
the whole duo thing.

334
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:20,369
We found another Widow's Son skeleton.

335
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,813
This one's complete.

336
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:25,465
The teeth marks suggest two cannibals.

337
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,638
Really?

338
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,820
That's awesome!
It's like the Sith Lords, man.

339
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,429
There's always only two of them.

340
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,354
Did you justStar Warsus?

341
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:36,820
In the parlance of the 17th century,
it's a master and apprentice situation.

342
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,793
Each master must create one of these
sculptures while training an apprentice.

343
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:44,537
When it's complete, the master retires,
the apprentice becomes a master,

344
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:45,875
starts his own project.

345
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,319
So, Gormogon used to be the apprentice?

346
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:50,071
Now he's the master.

347
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:53,808
How does me saying no translate
to bringing Sweets in?

348
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:54,988
All right, get this.

349
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:57,033
Both victims lost their
fathers at a young age.

350
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:59,494
Widow's sons. Coincidence? I think not.

351
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,787
Also, two months ago, we arrested
Gormogon's apprentice.

352
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:04,253
Yeah. He killed himself.

353
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,100
Point of investigation. How do
masters find their apprentices?

354
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,682
Not on Craig's List. I checked.

355
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:15,238
I bet you two free sessions that the
master has access to at-risk children.

356
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,779
Kid's got chops.

357
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:19,088
Well, anything else?

358
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,351
Yeah. It must be killing him
that you have this.

359
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,802
This is like his whole
reason for living.

360
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:27,268
You might be able to find
some way to use that.

361
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,561
Wait till you hear this.

362
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:31,419
Father Cooper took
a trip to Turkey last year.

363
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:33,373
The Anatolian region?

364
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:35,829
Gavin Nichols was on the same trip.

365
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,251
The bishop and the musician.

366
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,814
What about a corruptor?

367
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,589
Trip was arranged by a lobbyist.

368
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:43,782
- Is that too literal?
- A lobbyist?

369
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:46,835
Oh, that's a total pretender
to the throne.

370
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,091
This is how we roll, right, guys?

371
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,302
Bones, you got time
to talk to a lobbyist?

372
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:55,692
You think my life is in danger
because I went to Turkey?

373
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,632
Two of the men you
traveled with are dead.

374
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,437
Their faces were eaten off.

375
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,196
This is Washington D. C.

376
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,195
People have their faces
eaten off all the time.

377
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:06,113
Mr. Porter, are you a member of
any fraternal order?

378
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,248
We know you're a member of
the Knights of Columbus.

379
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:09,916
Says so right here on your resume.

380
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,780
We know you went to Turkey
with the Knights

381
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,924
to visit the mythical site of
the Garden of Eden.

382
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:15,923
And you think that there's a
cannibal out there

383
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,398
who has something against a
group of civic-minded men

384
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,203
who do good works in their community?

385
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,762
Look, the guy we're after...

386
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:24,980
He thinks that the Knights of Columbus
is an evil secret society.

387
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,307
That's crazy.

388
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:29,179
- I think he's finally catching on.
- Your life is in danger.

389
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:31,363
Why me? I mean, there were
40 guys on that trip.

390
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,754
How old were you when your father died?

391
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:36,837
Six. What does that
have to do with anything?

392
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,424
You lost your father, and
you're a corrupter.

393
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,408
Okay.

394
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:44,570
You want to talk to me,
you do it through my lawyer.

395
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:47,927
All right, listen, Mr. Porter,
we are just trying to help here.

396
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,672
The FBI is investigating
influence peddling.

397
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,870
I am one of your targets.

398
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:55,246
Someone eating the faces off
the Knights of Columbus...

399
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:58,958
- How stupid do you think I am?
- Right now? Very, very stupid.

400
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:01,537
Okay.

401
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,534
Bones, you didn't have to
call him corrupt.

402
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:06,571
- Why?
- Why, because, obviously, he is.

403
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:08,586
Agent Booth?

404
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:11,176
There's someone here to see you.

405
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,740
Where's Hayley?

406
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,146
Russ. You came to the FBI?

407
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:16,424
That was the deal.

408
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,616
This just keeps getting better.
All right.

409
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:20,240
Russ Brennan, you're under arrest.

410
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,134
- Come on. You know the drill.
- You lied?

411
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:24,828
- You told Dad Booth wouldn't arrest me.
- No, I never said that.

412
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,489
I should have known better than
to trust anyone in this family.

413
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,799
- I swear.
- I want to see my step daughter.

414
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,216
Hi, honey.

415
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,952
Russ, I knew you'd come!

416
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,020
Here, come here, look who's here.

417
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,261
Making funny faces?

418
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,028
Thank you for coming, Russ.

419
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,637
Thank you, Booth.

420
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:09,080
Oh, this never happened.

421
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:10,184
Don't thank me.

422
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:14,148
As far as the Bureau is concerned,
I caught him here 15 minutes from now.

423
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,298
Thank you, Booth.

424
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,945
Just don't tell anyone.

425
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:31,224
You told Russ I said Booth
wouldn't arrest him.

426
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:32,967
Look, I couldn't turn him over to you.

427
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,148
That just puts you in a
quandary with Booth.

428
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,333
- I did it this way for you.
- Dad!

429
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:40,457
What, Booth busted him? That hard ass.

430
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:43,097
Brennan.

431
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,453
Dr. Brennan, it's me, Zack.

432
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:47,119
I found something in the Gormogon
vault I think you should see.

433
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,638
What are you being such a
hard ass on my kid for, Booth?

434
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,698
- Who's that?
- Nobody. It's not Booth.

435
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,412
You know, it's-it's bad enough
that nobody can trust you,

436
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:59,405
but now you're making it so Russ and
I can't trust each other, either.

437
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,683
He came back!

438
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:02,975
He hugged his little girl, okay?

439
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,349
So far, things are working out great!

440
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:09,675
I'm here foryou,
and a lot of dads aren't.

441
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:23,854
That's true, Dad.

442
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,952
What's going on, Zack?

443
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,515
Why don't you turn the light on?

444
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,460
I was down here helping Angela decode
when I noticed the mirrors.

445
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:40,622
What mirrors?

446
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,576
Put these on so you can see
where you're going.

447
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,847
This better be good.

448
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,854
I'm surprised no one noticed
the mirrors before.

449
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:46,982
They're everywhere.

450
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:50,855
Different kinds, different sizes, placed
seemingly at random around the vault.

451
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:54,072
But I have an overdeveloped
sense of spatial reasoning.

452
00:22:54,147 --> 00:22:57,726
As a result, things that appear random
to some people appear deliberate to me.

453
00:22:57,847 --> 00:22:59,504
Zack, just get on with it.

454
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,127
Watch this.

455
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,262
Want to see where it ends?

456
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:11,513
- Yeah.
- Yes.

457
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:24,674
From that spot, you'd be able
to see every corner of the vault.

458
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,126
I don't get it.

459
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:28,560
What does it mean?

460
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:32,396
Gormogon has been watching
us this whole time.

461
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,078
Bones, Tech guys,
they did a sensor sweep.

462
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,424
That eye is broadcasting a signal
both audio and video.

463
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:49,507
It's white light activated, it probably
wasn't triggered by Zack's laser.

464
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,767
- What do we do?
- Exactly what Sweets said.

465
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:53,384
Use it against Gormogon.

466
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,560
- How?
- Haven't got a clue.

467
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,558
If we fooled him into thinking

468
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:01,092
that we're transferring the sculpture,
he might try to grab it.

469
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,498
No.

470
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,408
No, if he wants it as much as Sweets
says, then he'll try to steal it.

471
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:06,385
No.

472
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,543
Why not?

473
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,746
Because I didn't think of it.

474
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:12,633
Look, it's a great idea,
but if you're gonna sell it,

475
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:17,396
you're gonna have to put Father Cooper's
kneecaps in the silver skeleton.

476
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,949
I do this under extreme protest.

477
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:23,321
The truck will be here any minute.

478
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:25,363
Who knows about this?

479
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,182
Just you and me, Bones.

480
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:30,824
Not even the driver knows
what we're transporting.

481
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:35,455
The MRI at Bethesda will tell us if
Gormogon hid anything within the bones.

482
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,523
Like what?

483
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,613
I don't know.

484
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:40,117
That's why we need the MRI at Bethesda.

485
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,807
What?

486
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,708
You don't have to scream,
I'm right here.

487
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:44,942
Right.

488
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:46,476
Okay.

489
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,614
Are you done?
We're kind of on a schedule.

490
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,780
Yes. I'm done.

491
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:54,866
Now we can load it onto a truck
and take it to Bethesda.

492
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,009
All right, everybody keep
their distance.

493
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:07,903
I don't want to spook this guy.

494
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:11,547
- I have a question.
- No, you can't drive.

495
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:13,352
We're undercover,
and I'm the taxi driver.

496
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:15,066
Passengers don't sit in the front seat.

497
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,358
You're not a passenger, okay.
You're a trainee.

498
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:20,124
And I'm training you
how to drive a taxicab.

499
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:26,967
All units be advised.

500
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,997
I got a motorcycle with no plates.

501
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:34,545
Easy.

502
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,474
- Get down!
- What? Why?

503
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:07,705
Don't move.

504
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,723
Put your arm underneath my shoulder.

505
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:22,196
Come on, you ready? On three.

506
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:23,971
One, two, three.

507
00:26:25,948 --> 00:26:27,907
I'm okay, I'm okay.

508
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,697
You just get over here.

509
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:32,545
Paramedics are on their way.

510
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,741
He knew who we were because
I was sitting up front.

511
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:37,143
No, it was because of your bad acting,
that's what it was.

512
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:39,639
- What, back at the vault? I was good.
- No, you were loud.

513
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,428
- That's what they call overacting.
- You shouldn't have shushed me,

514
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:43,573
that's how he knew.

515
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:46,158
- Who's got the motorcycle?
- Nobody. We lost the follow car.

516
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:47,273
Damn it!

517
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:49,596
- Wait, what about the truck?
- It's fine.

518
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,024
Wait a second, he knew
the truck was a decoy.

519
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:55,540
He wasn't trying to get the skeleton
back. He was trying to kill us. What?

520
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:57,668
Oh, all right, easy.

521
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:58,931
I got it.

522
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:02,495
What is that?

523
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:06,495
It's a human tooth.

524
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:09,743
He put human teeth in
his bomb for shrapnel.

525
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:12,578
Bones, he was trying
to kill us because...

526
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:16,804
we know his next target,
the Corruptor, that lobbyist.

527
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:19,602
- Wait... Wait, I want to come.
- Stay right there!

528
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:29,932
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

529
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,526
It's just a flesh wound.

530
00:27:41,322 --> 00:27:42,660
You believe me now?

531
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:44,104
He ran downstairs.

532
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,615
He had a knife. He had a knife.

533
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,152
It's over.

534
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:21,606
Drop him!

535
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,623
- Put the kid down.
- Put me down!

536
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:23,032
Put him down.

537
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:55,017
It's okay, it's all right.

538
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:57,212
It's all right, it's over, okay?

539
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:09,105
The Gormogons started out
as good guys, you know.

540
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:13,766
In the 1600, the malignant manipulations
of secret societies like the Illuminati,

541
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,699
the Carbonari, the Masons, the Tong,
were starting to be felt.

542
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:20,375
The Gormogons championed the ideal

543
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,082
that humanity should be free of
these pernicious influences.

544
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:24,105
Good guys.

545
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,614
So, you feel sympathy for Gormogon?

546
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,977
There are secret societies
working today.

547
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:32,865
It's naive to think otherwise.

548
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:36,605
You think I'm paranoid.

549
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,748
Yeah.

550
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,981
The question is: How paranoid?

551
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:45,495
Zack says that there are over 30 victims

552
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,397
represented by the skeleton created
by Gormogon and his master,

553
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:51,344
and his master, who
has got to be in his 80s.

554
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:54,397
And we know that there are
seven in the one

555
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:57,976
created by Gormogon and
his dead apprentice,

556
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:02,758
including the violinist and the priest.

557
00:30:02,864 --> 00:30:07,038
Now, my point of view. he's going
after the Knights of Columbus.

558
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,444
Gormogon is nuts.

559
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:12,368
Dr. Sweets?

560
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,994
Dead apprentice.

561
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,950
Gormogon needs a new apprentice.

562
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,995
He may have already found one.

563
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,469
We're looking for a kid in his teens.

564
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,566
Tempe, what happened to you?

565
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:26,935
I got blown up.

566
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,061
Russ, I never told Dad that you should
turn yourself in to Booth.

567
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,542
If I'd come to you, you would've
told Booth anyway.

568
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:34,983
- What do you mean, blown up?
- It's a case, Russ.

569
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,234
It's my job.

570
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,040
We're trying to put a bad guy away.

571
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:39,393
You mean in here.

572
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,318
With other bad guys like me.

573
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:43,760
And Dad. There are
levels of bad guy, Russ.

574
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,589
And you're not even on the first level.

575
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:48,286
Why do I feel like you just
called me a sissy?

576
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:51,920
I wanted you to hear it from me, Russ.
Dad lied.

577
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:54,115
I never told him it was safe
to come back.

578
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:56,085
I had to come back, Tempe.

579
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,535
- For Hayley.
- Yes.

580
00:30:57,595 --> 00:31:00,001
But they are gonna put
me away after my parole hearing.

581
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,309
It's not just that you violated parole.

582
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,775
They think you know something
about Dad's murder case.

583
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,048
I don't!

584
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:09,610
Nobody believes anybody in this family.

585
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,347
What... maybe I'm just like him, right?

586
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,730
- A liar? Not worthy of trust.
- No, don't say that.

587
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:17,635
I am just like him.

588
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:18,842
I am.

589
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,785
I had a family, I left them.

590
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:22,271
You haven't killed anyone.

591
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:24,602
That's the most reassuring
that you can be?

592
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:27,775
"Hey, Russ, congratulations on
never killing anyone."

593
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:33,241
Being reassuring has
never been my strong suit.

594
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,339
Levels of bad, right?

595
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,023
And I'm a sissy.

596
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,752
It's a good thing, Russ.

597
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,524
Thanks for helping Hayley.

598
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:49,425
I love that little girl like
she was my own.

599
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,152
You believe that, don't you?

600
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:53,726
Yeah, Russ.

601
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,475
I believe that.

602
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:06,185
Normal person gets blown to hell, they
go home, pour a glass of wine, watch TV.

603
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,357
Caroline, it think it should be worth
something that Russ turned himself in.

604
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:12,302
Bumping into Booth at the hospital is
not the same as turning himself in.

605
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,046
That's not what happened.

606
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:15,565
It's what Booth says happened.

607
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,586
No, Russ turned himself in,
but I convinced Booth

608
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,377
to let him go see Hayley
at the hospital.

609
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,926
I did not hear that.

610
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:23,257
Russ turned himself in,

611
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:27,151
but I convinced Booth to let him
go see Hayley at the hospital.

612
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:28,801
Do I have this straight?

613
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:30,527
You're a genius?

614
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:33,450
An honest to goodness,
dyed-in-the-wool genius?

615
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:34,732
Yes.

616
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:37,905
Dr. Brennan, I like you, on and off,

617
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:41,063
but your brother is a material
witness in my murder case.

618
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:43,529
I cannot recommend that he be set free.

619
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:45,183
Please?

620
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:46,611
Oh, well.

621
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,559
Now that you said please.

622
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:50,825
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Yes!

623
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:56,555
Best I can do is arrange for you to
speak at your brother's parole hearing.

624
00:32:56,705 --> 00:33:01,088
Looking the way you do, maybe the
judge will feel sorry and let him go.

625
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,509
These are the marks
left by Gormogon's teeth.

626
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,660
I reverse engineered a dental set.

627
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,646
So this is what the front plate of
Gormogon's teeth looks like

628
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:16,060
top and bottom, from incisor to incisor.

629
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,977
Okay.

630
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,436
These are the teeth from the bomb.

631
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:27,031
It's a match.

632
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,015
It was Gormogon's tooth
lodged in my shoulder.

633
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:32,000
The tooth found in your
shoulder was chipped.

634
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,676
In fact, all of the teeth we found,
almost a full set, were chipped.

635
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:36,879
Due to the explosion?

636
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:41,789
No, these marks here were made by
common, hardware store pliers.

637
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,624
He pulled out his own teeth?

638
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:46,498
I don't know. Certainly they were
removed with pliers.

639
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:48,017
That's what happened, Zack.

640
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,738
Gormogon pulled out all
his teeth, one by one,

641
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:52,949
with pliers, and put them in a bomb.

642
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:55,250
Booth was right.

643
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:58,333
He meant to kill us.

644
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:05,216
I was photographing the skeleton in
preparation for taking it apart,

645
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:08,524
when I noticed this on a rib.

646
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:12,313
"1026." What is it?

647
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:13,599
It's a number.

648
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:16,730
- No, Zack, Cam meant what does it mean?
- Is it code?

649
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:19,172
It could be an ordinal indexed automata.

650
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:22,167
I could start a solution, but it would
extend into infinity.

651
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,685
And how long would that take?

652
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,460
Forever. Obviously.

653
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,348
How's about that alpha-numeric business?

654
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,844
"J. B.F."

655
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:30,979
Meaningless.

656
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,292
No, wait a minute.

657
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,599
- I got it.
- What?

658
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:34,952
He's an artist.

659
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,426
He's finished something.

660
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:39,742
I mean, it's terrible, but, to him,
this is a piece of art.

661
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:40,895
It's a signature.

662
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,181
1026 is a number, not a name.

663
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:45,339
No, I'm telling you,
this is a signature.

664
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,756
The vault is like a museum of
the Gormogons, right?

665
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:48,873
An archive.

666
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:52,418
Then why don't we just look in
Safety Deposit Box 1026?

667
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,820
'Cause they're all rigged to
blow up when you open them.

668
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,142
Oh, I solved that one.

669
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:58,624
In my head, while having my Cuppa Soup.

670
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,009
What I'm doing is smothering
the phosphorus with argon,

671
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,039
thus giving Booth time to
reach in with tongs

672
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,761
to remove whatever's inside
the box before it ignites.

673
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:10,693
Why me?

674
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:12,666
Obviously because you have
the fastest reflexes.

675
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:14,673
- Fine, you can pull the tray.
- Fine.

676
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,124
Exactly how far back
should I be standing?

677
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:18,543
Ready?

678
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,230
Door! Tray!

679
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:22,106
Lid! Tongs!

680
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,522
Did Booth get it?

681
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:28,845
Yes, Zack, can't you see?

682
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:30,935
Not for another three to five minutes.

683
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:33,492
It's a key with a bar code on it.

684
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:39,332
You called me to the FBI because
you found a key to my office?

685
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:41,995
We accessed the information
contained in the bar code.

686
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:45,439
It came up as the key to your office
in the Social Services building.

687
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:47,033
That's not the key to my office.

688
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:50,334
Room 1026, Municipal Department
of Social Services.

689
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:53,108
Nobody's used a key like
that since the 70s.

690
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,582
It was before my time.

691
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:57,858
Wait a second, has that office always
belonged to Social Services?

692
00:35:57,998 --> 00:36:00,916
Yes, back then, it was dealing with
foster care and group homes.

693
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,585
Booth, Sweets is right.

694
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:05,224
That would be a great place
to recruit disturbed boys.

695
00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:06,485
Recruit for what?

696
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:13,419
It's just that that man that was
in that office is a bit of a legend.

697
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,475
He helped a lot of kids find their way.

698
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:16,672
What was his name?

699
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:18,047
Arthur Graves.

700
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:19,733
He's retired now.

701
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:24,098
He wouldn't happen to live in a nursing
home that used to be a mansion?

702
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:28,421
Mr. Graves has been here for five years.

703
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,581
In a wheelchair for the last four.

704
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,482
Sweet guy, a little particular
about what he eats.

705
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:35,233
You have no idea.

706
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:36,693
I beg your pardon?

707
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,559
What's wrong with Mr. Graves?

708
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,739
Alzheimer's.

709
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,685
The last few months,
he's gotten pretty bad.

710
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:42,781
Is he lucid?

711
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,174
He comes and goes.

712
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:48,074
Hey, Arthur, some nice people
are here to see you.

713
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,733
Hey, Mr. Graves.

714
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,736
FBI Special Agent Seely Booth.

715
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,583
Listen, we got a court order here to
get a dental imprint from you.

716
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:58,609
Mr. Graves, I'm not going to hurt you.

717
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:01,472
I just need you to bite down
on this for me.

718
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:07,350
Sorry. He's not like that usually.

719
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,057
- I think you may have frightened him.
- How'd he lose his teeth?

720
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:11,801
They'd all been pulled when he got here.

721
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:14,377
- Does he have any regular visitors?
- There used to be a man.

722
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:15,661
He drove a motorcycle.

723
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:18,361
- I believe he may have been a nephew.
- We know who you are.

724
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:22,807
- We know what you did.
- All right, Bones, it's okay. Let's go.

725
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:25,620
We'll check out his case files.
See what kids he could've recruited.

726
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,747
Come on.

727
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,222
Let's go.

728
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:34,017
While I'm here, I'm gonna
get a court order

729
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:35,882
to monitor Arthur Graves' visitors.

730
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:37,686
Just in case "Gargonzola"

731
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:40,025
decides to come back and
visit his old master.

732
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,423
You're doing that Gorgonzola thing
on purpose, aren't you?

733
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:43,675
Hi, Temperance.

734
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,002
Hi.

735
00:37:45,303 --> 00:37:47,592
If that's who I think it is, I can't
really be friendly.

736
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,301
I understand, I'll just wait over here.

737
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:52,524
Here.

738
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:55,177
That's for you.

739
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:02,573
Hayley's feeling better.

740
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,708
She even wanted to come.

741
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,351
Please tell her thank you.

742
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,238
Agent Booth?

743
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,029
- The Judge will see you now.
- Great.

744
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,119
In chambers.

745
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,487
Why in chambers?

746
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:21,316
Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan has
already proven himself a flight risk.

747
00:38:21,394 --> 00:38:22,778
He is attached to his family.

748
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,184
- The same family he abandoned?
- Temporarily.

749
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:29,221
When his little girl needed him, he
returned without any regard for himself.

750
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,710
You're his parole officer.

751
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:33,064
We're all here because you're
the one who violated him.

752
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:35,364
Only because it's the law, Ms. Julian.

753
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:37,680
I have a lot of faith in Russ Brennan.

754
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:42,146
Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan not only
broke his parole by fleeing the region,

755
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,064
he is a material witness in an
upcoming murder trial.

756
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:48,253
That is a totally different issue that
has nothing to do with this hearing.

757
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,442
This isn't a hearing.

758
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:52,177
It's an informal meeting to decide
whether there will be a hearing.

759
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:53,503
Can I say something?

760
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:55,783
That is a slippery slope, Judge Watkins.

761
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,911
- Can I?
- No.

762
00:38:56,987 --> 00:38:58,384
But you said this was informal.

763
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,362
I'm still the Judge and I get
to make those decisions.

764
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:04,118
Agent Booth, what are your thoughts?

765
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,943
- I got nothing to say, Judge.
- Booth, please!

766
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:12,286
I got a phone call from the Archbishop
of D. C. 15 minutes ago.

767
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:16,357
He promises to take a personal interest
in Mr. Brennan's rehabilitation.

768
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:18,158
For God's sake, why?

769
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:21,685
Also a psychiatrist, Dr. Lance Sweets,

770
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:26,045
who says he believes Mr. Brennan
will not flee the jurisdiction again.

771
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:31,087
Plus, a parole officer who is
recommending against revoking parole.

772
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,211
Why should I ignore all that?

773
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,793
Because Ms. Davis will simply
send Russ Brennan home.

774
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:39,567
That is not my intention.

775
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:40,875
It's not?

776
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:42,755
Mr. Brennan should be punished.

777
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,193
Punished how?

778
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:45,782
30 days in county jail.

779
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,304
- What?
- That's nothing.

780
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:49,003
Seems pretty harsh from where I sit.

781
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,785
Also 18 months should be
added to his parole,

782
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,643
and he should be forced to wear
electronic monitoring.

783
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:57,793
That is slightly more than nothing,
but only slightly.

784
00:39:57,883 --> 00:40:01,815
I will register your opinion,
Ms. Julian, but that's my ruling.

785
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:05,018
If I had a gavel, I'd bang it, but

786
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:07,650
how about the last one out
just slams the door?

787
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,267
I want you to consider
what side you're on.

788
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:18,178
Bishops and psychiatrists and
bleeding heart parole officers,

789
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:21,669
that's what's wrong with
the justice system in this country.

790
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:28,698
Russ, you've got to go
with the marshals.

791
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:29,946
Thank you again.

792
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,390
I didn't do anything again.

793
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,111
- You should thank him, too.
- Why?

794
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:36,160
- He saved Russ.
- I didn't do anything, okay.

795
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,942
Russ... time to go.

796
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:44,578
Okay, here's the thing, Russ.

797
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:47,811
All right, you run again, you disappoint
that woman and her kids,

798
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:49,780
and you break your
sister's heart, I will...

799
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:51,255
Do something terrible.

800
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:52,841
I got it.

801
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:54,345
Yeah, I hope you do.

802
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:56,011
All yours, boys.

803
00:40:58,608 --> 00:41:00,009
Hey, Booth.

804
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:02,199
Thanks.

805
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,262
Yeah, clean nose, buddy.

806
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:06,240
Clean nose, clean heart.

807
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,585
"'Why was I forgotten?
Mary said, stamping her foot.

808
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:15,458
'Why does nobody come?'

809
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:19,841
"A young man whose name was Barney
looked at her very sadly.

810
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:23,746
