1
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:08,422
Our time capsule was buried in 1987.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,670
The year the DOW closed
above 2000 for the first time.

3
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:14,536
Reagan told Gorbachev
to tear down the Berlin Wall.

4
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,414
You had a huge crush on LaToya Jackson.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,033
I did.

6
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,871
You can't complain, Stinson.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,432
You married the head cheerleader.

8
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:23,740
Lucky I did.

9
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:26,861
And now we have a wonderful kid
who's a senior, right here at Foothill.

10
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:28,584
Alex, take a bow.

11
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:32,043
Anyhow, we're here today

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,217
to open the time capsule that we buried

13
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:37,165
20 years ago, so we can see who we were

14
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,762
and how the heck we all got to
where we are today.

15
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:40,863
Found it!

16
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,628
Twenty years... Do you even remember
what you put in there?

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,085
No. A bad perm and pink leg
warmers, probably.

18
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,840
Here we go!

19
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:58,475
God! That is vile!

20
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,747
Oh, what the hell, Bill?

21
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,653
I thought you said the thing
was watertight?

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,804
It should've been,
and it's Gil, not Bill.

23
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,128
Let's see what we've got here.

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,032
What is it?!

25
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:20,054
Wow! Now this is a sweet field.

26
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:21,566
This is what I'm talking about.

27
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,133
Right? I mean, it's nothing
like ours, but, hey,

28
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:26,501
that didn't stop me from being
MVP my senior year.

29
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:28,108
Got the trophy, touchdown!

30
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,975
In certain tribes, in the
African subcontinent,

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,056
piercings serve as a reminder, like your
trophy, of the power and agility,

32
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,912
which has since faded away.

33
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,319
What do you mean, fade away?

34
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,330
Time out.
Can we just concentrate on the case?

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,047
- What do we got here?
- We were all gathered for the opening.

36
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,354
We had no idea that
that thing was in there.

37
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,320
That is rank.

38
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,407
I was just expecting to see
my 10,000 Maniacs album.

39
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:53,898
That was not there.

40
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,771
- Who are you?
- I'm Gil Bates.

41
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:57,101
I sealed it myself.

42
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,333
I used a propylene seal and
industrial bolt lags.

43
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,898
Adolescent, Caucasian male,

44
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,003
late teens, early 20s.

45
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,970
What do you say we just pack it all up
and ship it back to the Jeffersonian?

46
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,956
Oh, I'm sorry. That's not a good idea.

47
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:13,629
You see, the water has compromised the
structural integrity of the case, so...

48
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,351
Will you look at this, Bones.

49
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:17,178
Another nerd for your squint squad.

50
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:18,368
- Drill.
- Drill.

51
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,809
Drill? Wait a second.
You're going to drill it right here?

52
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,779
What about taking it all back
to Jeffersonian?

53
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,718
Tub.

<i>A 1987 Foothill High School

55
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:56,347
<i>How about th-the ghetto blaster?</i>

56
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,350
<i>Rubik's Cube?</i>

57
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:03,488
<i>How about this?

58
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:07,575
<i>In 20 years, they'll be able to put

59
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:10,269
Victim had several ante-mortem
fractures to his sternum,

60
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,211
as well as several antemortem fractures
to the lateral sections of his ribs.

61
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,572
All healed?

62
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,572
All healed at different times.

63
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,773
I had a Michael Jackson glove.

64
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,371
- I've never mentioned that before.
- I loved to Chevy Chase.

65
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,433
We all have our crosses to bear.

66
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:27,800
The fracture on the right
clavicle is fresh.

67
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,343
Well, was, 20 years ago.

68
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:32,621
Mullet alert!

69
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,697
That's a nasty one.

70
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:38,105
Booth got a list of all the students who
didn't make it to the capsule opening,

71
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,134
and he's pulling the names of anyone
connected to the school in 1987

72
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:42,357
who had a record.

73
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,411
Oh, my God, I'm getting
flashbacks to braces and

74
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:50,241
stirrup pants and a
really, really bad side ponytail.

75
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,670
You certainly grew out of it.

76
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:54,094
I wore Doc Marten's that weighed
more than I did.

77
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,736
Apparently Booth was fine.

78
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,079
He was a football player.

79
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:59,763
Right. He was one ofthoseguys.

80
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:03,516
Well, this guy certainly wasn't hanging
out with the cheerleaders, but

81
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:07,533
I bet he had some love notes stashed
away in his Spaceballs binder.

82
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:10,892
- I think I saw him in the video.
- Roger Dillon.

83
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,291
Class of 1987.

84
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:15,417
Here he is.

85
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,059
The comet will be around in 76 years.

86
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:19,510
We'll still be around, don't worry.

87
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:24,308
How did Roger Dillon get from there...

88
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,730
to here?

89
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,882

--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

93
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,194
I ran a sample of the sludge.

94
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,296
Organic matter.

95
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,919
Or you could call him "Roger."

96
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,977
Oh, come on, when you can ladle someone,

97
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:17,161
he's a little less than a
person, don't you think?

98
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:21,011
Fine. I took a sample of Roger, ran it
through the mass spectrometer.

99
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,584
You'll never guess what I found.

100
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:24,837
Traces of an unidentified
organophosphate.

101
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:26,229
- Nerve gas?
- Very good.

102
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:28,242
I'll break down the rest of the
chemicals now.

103
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,777
The victim also had a peri-mortem
fracture in his wrist.

104
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:34,876
There are indications of a grade-two
acromioclavicular joint separation.

105
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,443
- But it was certainly not lethal.
- I've seen it before.

106
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:40,522
Someone twisted the victim's arm
behind his back, forcefully.

107
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,535
So, what, he got beat up
for his lunch money?

108
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,167
Violent students are the hallmark
of a schoolyard.

109
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,144
I speak from experience.

110
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:52,150
However, these fractures on his ribs
might predate high school.

111
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:55,308
So... he might've had some
trouble at home.

112
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,545
I don't understand, Mr. Dillon, why you
never reported your son missing.

113
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:08,680
His mother told me that Roger ran away.

114
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:11,790
You weren't concerned that your
son never contacted you again?

115
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:13,639
He didn't live with me,
he didn't want to.

116
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,223
Because of the physical abuse?

117
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,542
Yeah, I was a drinker in those days.

118
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,796
And I understood why he wanted
to just write me off.

119
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,258
But I cared about him. I was sick.

120
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,378
When was the last time you saw Roger?

121
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:29,118
It was night of his high
school graduation.

122
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:32,794
He came over here, afterwards, asking
me for money, a lot.

123
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:35,718
You threw him out of the house with
his arm twisted behind his back.

124
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:39,014
I swear, he... he got up and
he walked away.

125
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,193
Now this was 20 years ago.

126
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,066
What's this all about?

127
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,730
Roger is dead, Mr. Dillon.

128
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:48,083
His remains were found yesterday.

129
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:51,465
Oh... God...

130
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,007
Found him at the high school.

131
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,228
He had been in a time
capsule for 20 years.

132
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,489
Any idea why he needed the money?

133
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:02,945
Wouldn't say.

134
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:04,997
Guess it was so he could run away.

135
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,338
You should talk to Gil.

136
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,210
He was Roger's best friend.

137
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:11,197
Gil Bates?

138
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:12,198
Yeah.

139
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,563
That's the Tech Town guy?

140
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,412
They did everything together.

141
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,141
We'll be in touch.

142
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,568
I'm different now.

143
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:23,927
I'm sober.

144
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,198
I never...

145
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:28,009
I never wanted to hurt him.
I loved Roger.

146
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:32,197
Right.

147
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,987
The kid basically melted
into all of this.

148
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,455
I should be able to pull more chemical
traces off the artifacts to I. D.

149
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,086
the organophosphate on him.

150
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,363
Beta... St. Elmo's Fire.

151
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,091
It's on the list.

152
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,976
One yearbook.

153
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,963

154
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:53,771
Check.

155
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,995
- Dehydrate and scan.
- "Have a great summer."

156
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,206
"Don't ever change."
Remember those days?

157
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:00,241
I remember getting grounded
every weekend.

158
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,168
So many rules to break,
so little time...

159
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:03,629
You were the nerd fantasy.

160
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:04,993
I was all about Barbie.

161
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,066
She was my first anatomy lesson.
I was confused for years.

162
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,828
What about Ken? I felt so sorry for him.

163
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,212
Floppy disk the size of a dinner plate.

164
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,336
Bingo, baby.

165
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,242
The disk is not on the list.

166
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,572
Wow, what are you?

167
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:19,762
A term paper? Launch codes?

168
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:22,292
We need to pull the data.
Do you think you're up to it?

169
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:23,448
I can try.

170
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,518
A hockey skate.

171
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,714
And it looks like it's signed.

172
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:28,848
Check on the skate.

173
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,393
It belonged to some jock
named John Adamson.

174
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,219
A can of New Coke.

175
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,875
Definitely an'80's plot to
destabilize the country.

176
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,375
Another check.

177
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,555
And a pocket watch.

178
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,393
The watch is not on the list.

179
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,919
It's a Wallingham, It's nice.

180
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,625
A computer disk and a pocket watch?

181
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:50,523
What was our little geek into?

182
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,648
It's dry.

183
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:53,971
This is a good watch.

184
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,006
Some kind of residue.

185
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,717
Could it help I. D. the poison?

186
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:58,925
Let me at it.

187
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,584
Roger's father had no trouble
getting physical.

188
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:09,002
So why would he resort to poisoning
his son with a nerve agent?

189
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,836
What sort of teenager were you, Bones?

190
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,257
He did have a series of odd jobs.

191
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:15,586
Perhaps he procured the poison
from one of them.

192
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,257
Come on, you have to have at
least one good story

193
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:19,887
before you pasted on a lab coat.

194
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:21,320
I was busy, studying.

195
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,228
And in all those hours of studying,
you never came across one hormone?

196
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,314
Fine, there was one boy.

197
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,077
Andy Pfleuger.

198
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:34,332
He was the varsity lacrosse captain.

199
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:35,933
Did you...

200
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,661
kiss the varsity lacrosse captain?

201
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,939
I was weighing the pros and cons...

202
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,436
when he became my Secret Santa.

203
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,016
I thought you hated Secret Santa.

204
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,825
Yes, because he taped
the gift to my locker.

205
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,652
Everyone saw it.

206
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,813
Teenagers can be cruel.

207
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,132
What was it?

208
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:54,251
It doesn't matter.

209
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,712
Come on, Bones.

210
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:59,198
- You promise not to laugh?
- Listen, I'm your partner.

211
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:01,475
It was a Brainy Smurf.

212
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:03,481
You said you wouldn't laugh.

213
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,845
I'm not laughing.

214
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:05,925
Brainy Smurf, huh?

215
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,828
Well, it was deliberate.
He knew I wanted Smurfette.

216
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,865
- It's clear you find this amusing.
- I'm not laughing.

217
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:14,852
I'm not.

218
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:16,898
What?

219
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:21,198
You know, Angel was right...
You were one of those guys.

220
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,557
What?

221
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,083
One of what guys?

222
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:28,198
That was Roger in the time capsule?

223
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:30,794
I saw his skull.

224
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:32,936
Oh, my God, I saw his skull.

225
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,858
He's been there since 1987.

226
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,738
No, Roger took off. He left a note.

227
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:38,567
A note?

228
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,382
Graduation night, he left
his mom a note,

229
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,683
saying that he hated it here and
he was running away.

230
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,822
And he went to his
father's house to ask for money.

231
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:45,915
Do you know why?

232
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:48,611
All I knew was what his mom said
was in the note he left, so...

233
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:51,221
His mother was dead, and his father
never saw it, so...

234
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,134
So, you're the only connection
we have to the note.

235
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,408
It said, uh,

236
00:10:58,414 --> 00:10:59,559
you know that

237
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,402
he couldn't be around his dad anymore.

238
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,033
Or the kids at school.

239
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:05,917
They picked on him.

240
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:08,668
They used to pick on me, too.

241
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:11,894
I guess, he just couldn't take it.

242
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,362
Why wouldn't he have just
asked for help?

243
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,570
He was my best friend.

244
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:23,264
I always thought that I'd see him again.

245
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,749
I can't believe I'll never
see him again.

246
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:38,027
All right, I found several
denim cotton fibers

247
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,267
on both the gold watch and the floppy,

248
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:44,339
matching what's left of the victim's
classic acid wash'80s jeans.

249
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,320
That places the watch and the disk

250
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,631
inside the victim's pocket at the
time of his murder.

251
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,805
I tested the residue inside
the watch casing.

252
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,141
Pure crystalline tropane alkaloid.

253
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,491
Roger Dillon had a pocket
watch full of cocaine?

254
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,384
It's so Miami Vice, I could
roll up my sleeves.

255
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,513
The FBI sent us the files
of everyone connected

256
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:03,871
to the school who had a record.

257
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:06,726
Mostly petty theft, D. U. I. s,
that sort of thing.

258
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,363
Darwin Banks.

259
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:11,290
Teacher at Foothill High.

260
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:15,565
Arrested in a schoolwide drug bust,
June 12, 1987.

261
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,033
That's two days after Roger disappeared.

262
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,615
And Roger need money.

263
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,630
Looks like our young geek might've
been killed over a drug deal.

264
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:36,795
Do you rember Roger Dillon?

265
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,552
Foothill High, right?

266
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,841
I was his science teacher.

267
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:41,968
Smart kid.

268
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,835
- He could've taught the class.
- Now he's dead.

269
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,965
We found him stuffed into
Foothill's time capsule.

270
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:50,139
Been there since 1987.

271
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:51,364
God...

272
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,509
And it says here in the yearbook
that you were the faculty advisor

273
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,890
to the time capsule committee.

274
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,855
You gotta be kidding.

275
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:02,832
I usually don't joke around when
a 17 year-old boy's been murdered.

276
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,370
Found evidence of cocaine on him.

277
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,433
Roger?

278
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:09,214
No. That kid was clean.

279
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:12,900
The only way he got high was sitting
in front of his computer writing code.

280
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:14,865
Right, so help me out here, because

281
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,374
in'87 you were arrested at the
high school for dealing.

282
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,649
I wasn't dealing.
I was just out of college.

283
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:21,048
I had two joints on me.

284
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:22,863
And four ounces in your apartment.

285
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:24,089
I was 23.

286
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,468
We all do crazy stuff when we're kids.

287
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:27,890
Exactly.

288
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,422
I have my own business now,
a wife and two kids.

289
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:35,057
I'm in the Rotary Club for God's sake.

290
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,424
Well, we know that Roger needed money.

291
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,834
Maybe he started dealing for you,
and he wanted a bigger payout,

292
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:44,268
threatened to turn you in if
he didn't get it, so you killed him?

293
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,379
I didn't kill him and Roger
didn't rat me out.

294
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:50,516
It was Adamson, John Adamson,

295
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,025
an entitled ass even at 17.

296
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,869
I caught him cheating and
the next thing I know,

297
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,829
the cops are knocking on
my classroom door.

298
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,779
He just wanted to discredit me,
so he could retake the test.

299
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:05,201
Right, so you're the victim with
four ounces of weed?

300
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,218
Can you confirm your
whereabouts on June 14, 1987?

301
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:13,874
If I'm such a big drug-dealing liar,

302
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,736
why would I tell you the truth?

303
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,099
Because you don't want to go
to jail for killing Roger Dillon.

304
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,424
Come on, Sweets, just come on, you've
done a lot of psychological profiling.

305
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:28,506
The case is 20 years old,
we just need some help.

306
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:30,757
That's not why we're here
today, Agent Booth.

307
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,666
This hour is for you and Dr. Brennan.

308
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:36,483
Oh, she's not gonna mind, it's only
gonna take five minutes, okay? 1987.

309
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,542
Suburban kid is killed and
stuffed into a time capsule.

310
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,161
Fascinating, right?

311
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,936
What kind of person would do that?

312
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,659
So have any conflicts or issues
arisen since our last session?

313
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:50,672
Well...

314
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,811
Bones and I are doing just great.

315
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,169
You look angry, Dr. Brennan.

316
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,106
I told Agent Booth

317
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:02,146
a private story about
my childhood and he laughed.

318
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:04,759
What?

319
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,068
No, I...

320
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:10,072
I was appreciating it.
Don't get him involved.

321
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,681
Snorting does not suggest appreciation.

322
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:17,300
It was about a cartoon
character from the 1980s.

323
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,944
I didn't think you'd be so sensitive.

324
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:21,868
Well, childhood icons have great
significance to us, Agent Booth?

325
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,337
I myself was very attached to Voltron.

326
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:28,828
Cartoon.

327
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:30,570
Voltron.

328
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,881
You're hurt, Dr. Brennan, because
you feel you opened yourself up

329
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,881
to Agent Booth and he
betrayed that trust.

330
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,758
- We're talking about a Smurf.
- Smurfette.

331
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:42,077
Perhaps a way to bring this
relationship back into symmetry is

332
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:44,254
if you reveal a childhood
story about yourself.

333
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:46,475
Show your vulnerability to Dr. Brennan.

334
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,441
No, you know what? This is crazy.
It's... it's not right.

335
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,960
Tell him that it's not right.

336
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:51,764
Is it?

337
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:54,465
Oh, you're on his side. Why don't you go
play Voltron with him.

338
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,407
You were that guy, weren't you,
Agent Booth?

339
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:57,622
You were the golden boy

340
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,305
who could get away with anything
just by turning on the charm.

341
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,421
That's ridiculous.
You don't even know who I am.

342
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:05,488
Could it be that you're still
holding on to that persona,

343
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,230
that you're afraid to reveal yourself?

344
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,823
I'm an FBI agent.
I get shot at everyday, all right?

345
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:11,221
I'm not afraid of anything.

346
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,546
Okay, this is obviously
very difficult for you.

347
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:16,979
But you shouldn't be
ashamed to ask for help.

348
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:19,511
You shouldn't.

349
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,268
Okay.

350
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:28,956
Okay.

351
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,761
I apologize. I do need help.

352
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:37,043
With this case.

353
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,829
So, while you review this,

354
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:43,020
I will reveal myself to Bones.

355
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,291
I know that sounded weird,
but you know what I mean.

356
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:49,667
So you will share an emotionally

357
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,703
humiliating episode from
your youth with me?

358
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,719
Yeah. I-I have them. Here.

359
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,603
All right. Excellent.

360
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:01,239
Now, for the remainder of our time,
let's role play.

361
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:08,337
Now I know why I'm not allowed
to bring my gun in here.

362
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,753
I tested the goop,

363
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,984
found traces of cocaine consistent with
the leakage from the gold watch.

364
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:20,955
But when I checked the results
against samples of his hair and bones,

365
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:22,944
it came out negative,
Roger didn't do drugs.

366
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,476
So his old teacher was
telling the truth?

367
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,526
I also discovered what he was
dosed with and how much.

368
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,539
- What?
- Malaoxon.

369
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,343
Malaoxon?

370
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,586
Is neurotoxic in high doses.

371
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,073
Yeah, but there was barely enough
to make a mouse cough.

372
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:40,927
So our theory about poisoning
is incorrect as well.

373
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:44,164
Dr. Saroyan, I found an anomaly
on the victim's skull.

374
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,482
When I was cleaning the skull,
I found a tiny irregularity

375
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,863
on the undersurface of
the victim's mandible.

376
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,626
Magnified, it proved to be a tiny,
but sharply defined fracture.

377
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:57,492
Judging by its location, it appears that
a weapon was thrust into the neck,

378
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,497
cutting through the sterno
cleidomastoid,

379
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:01,888
and severing both the carotid
artery and jugular vein.

380
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,429
Which means Roger must have bled out.

381
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,852
Have you determined a weapon?

382
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,233
Judging by the microscopic
crushing of the bone,

383
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:10,597
the weapon was neither too
sharp nor too blunt.

384
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:12,197
It certainly wasn't an edged weapon.

385
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,446
So it wasn't a knife?

386
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:17,435
Correct. However, it left an odd
textural stain in the crevice.

387
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:21,267
I've taken a sample and will hand
it over to Hodgins for testing.

388
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,591
This little darling is a
Commodore Amiga,

389
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,883
with a Motorola 6800 chipset

390
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:33,128
using a homemade operating system.

391
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,640
I got it from the computer exhibit
on the third floor.

392
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,280
I used to have this exact computer.

393
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:39,906
My geek princess.

394
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:43,177
I knew the mall couldn't
suck out your soul.

395
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,692
Hey, look at that.

396
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,501
Oh, this is incredible!

397
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:56,328
This is like a primitive Doom.

398
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:58,343
You don't see anything wrong with that?

399
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:00,206
Doom came out in 1993.

400
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:03,706
All of this stuff... the 3-D rendering,
the first person shooting...

401
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,677
was barely a glint in a
geek's eye in 1987!

402
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,874
So Roger was way ahead of his time.

403
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,989
If this game had come out in 1987,

404
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,099
Roger Dillon would have been a
billionaire several times over.

405
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:17,353
Money is always a good
motive for murder.

406
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:24,377
I'm pretty sure that Sweets would
say a lost baseball game

407
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:26,352
is not personal or revealing.

408
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:27,555
Football, Bones, okay.

409
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:29,746
It's football. Oh, okay, I got one.

410
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:33,066
All right, personally between two
people or revealing, like, uh...

411
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,143
Naked?

412
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:35,277
That's very literal.

413
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:39,286
There was this girl, Karen Isley, and
we were under the bleachers one night.

414
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:41,263
Personally.

415
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,348
You with me?

416
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,350
Got it. You were having sex
in the dirt under the bleachers.

417
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,658
Excuse me, I'm a gentleman.
I brought my sleeping bag.

418
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,847
- Did you fail to perform sexually?
- What?

419
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:52,808
'Cause that might actually
count as a humiliation.

420
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,878
Will you just wait?
Will you just allow me to tell my story?

421
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,516
- Fine.
- Thank you.

422
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,648
So this girl, she had this game
where she would ask me a question...

423
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,965
What kind of a question?

424
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:06,792
It doesn't matter, okay? So, if I got
the question wrong, I'd have to...

425
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:08,493
take off a piece of my clothing.

426
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:11,636
Of course I knew all the answers,
but I pretended that I didn't.

427
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,801
- So you could take off your clothes?
- Exactly.

428
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:15,954
No, the point is, I'm standing there,
you know,

429
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,246
in my socks, and my
St. Christopher medal...

430
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:20,896
she runs off.

431
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,382
She runs off with the sleeping bag
and all of my clothes.

432
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,266
And I'm standing there stark-o.

433
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:27,492
Why'd she do that?

434
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,014
I suppose she heard
I was under the bleachers

435
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,656
with another girl the week before.

436
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:34,048
Okay, this is a story about
sexual prowess, Booth.

437
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:35,153
You're bragging.

438
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,286
I had to run across
the campus buck naked.

439
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,309
You're laughing about it now.

440
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:42,364
You enjoyed displaying your penis.
It showed alpha male mastery.

441
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:46,377
Only one other person knew about
Brainy Smurf, was my mother.

442
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,804
Cold, okay, it was cold.

443
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,902
Do you know what happens
to a guy when it is cold...

444
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,714
outside?

445
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,861
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,851
Can we make this quick? My boss doesn't
understand why I keep leaving.

447
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,254
And he's kind of a jerk, so.

448
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:01,092
What do you know about, uh...

449
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,352
"WarStrike"?

450
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,173
I, I haven't heard
that name in a long time.

451
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,098
We found it on a disk
in the time capsule.

452
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,115
It was on Roger when he was killed.

453
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:10,317
Oh, my God.

454
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,005
So you knew about it?

455
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:14,803
Yeah, but only as a
drawing in his notebook.

456
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:16,710
I- I didn't know he'd written the code.

457
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:18,895
According to an
expert at the Jeffersonian,

458
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,841
someone could make a lot
of money off of it.

459
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,843
We planned to. We were gonna start
a gaming business after graduation.

460
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:26,353
Roger was the brain,
and I was the business guy.

461
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,669
Wait... you saw the game? It worked?

462
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:30,923
If you were partners, why wouldn't
he tell you that?

463
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,022
He was perfectionist.

464
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:34,785
He would never show me anything
unless he thought it was perfect.

465
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:37,105
Maybe he was trying to make a
deal with someone else.

466
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:38,297
No. No way.

467
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,951
We were partners, okay.
Best friends our whole lives.

468
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:43,415
Roger would never sell me out like that.

469
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:49,115
We were saving up to buy new computers
to create a 3-D rendering farm.

470
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,184
Computers were expensive back then.

471
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:53,527
- Where were you gonna get the money?
- We both worked.

472
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:54,810
I paved driveways and...

473
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,601
Roger worked a shift at a roller rink.

474
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,794
Yeah, I scraped grills at a
burger shack for $3.55 an hour.

475
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,551
That's humiliating.

476
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:02,600
Nice try.

477
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,673
Roger, he made extra money tutoring
that cheerleader, Janelle, in math.

478
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,540
And he got paid to take the SATs for
some cokehead hockey player.

479
00:22:10,684 --> 00:22:13,228
The kid got into Harvard
off Roger's scores.

480
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:14,141
Cokehead?

481
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:16,748
- What's his name?
- John Adamson.

482
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,037
He's a real nasty piece of work.

483
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,452
Great, thanks.

484
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,852
John Adamson was the star hockey
player at Foothill.

485
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,717
He barely graduated from Harvard.

486
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,625
- Took five years.
- He got in by cheating.

487
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,127
He didn't deserve to be there.

488
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,179
Maybe Roger was blackmailing
Adamson about the SAT scam.

489
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,717
So Adamson killed him?

490
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,603
Could a hockey skate have
killed the kid?

491
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,902
I mean, Adamson's
was in the time capsule.

492
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:43,740
A metal skate blade could easily cut
right through the jugular.

493
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,231
And the edge could create
a sharply defined fracture.

494
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:48,399
Well, there you go.

495
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,023
He had a motive and a weapon.

496
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:54,515
The back table, waiting...

497
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,003
John Adamson?

498
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,250
FBI Agent Seely Booth.

499
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,051
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

500
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,393
Have a seat, Bones.

501
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,960
Senator expects me to concentrate on
running his campaign, Agent Booth.

502
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:15,767
I hope this isn't going to be
a waste of my time.

503
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,599
Take a look at that.

504
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:20,536
Do you rember Gilbert Bates or
Roger Dillon from high school?

505
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:21,807
No, I'm sorry.

506
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:25,651
Neither the name Gilbert Bates nor
Roger Dillon means anything to me.

507
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:29,903
This boy was found inside
the time capsule dead.

508
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,911
You might've heard about that.

509
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:34,755
Like I said, I've been busy with
the senator's campaign.

510
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:37,715
Oh, because this kid said that this guy

511
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:39,645
took the SAT for you.

512
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,172
Got you into Harvard.

513
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,680
SATs didn't get me into
Harvard, Agent Booth.

514
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:47,056
My slap shot did that.

515
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,154
So you don't deny that Roger Dillon
took the test for you?

516
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,981
Total cooperation.

517
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:57,825
We keep my sordid academic
past in the past?

518
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:02,426
I paid Roger 200 bucks to take
the test for me.

519
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,963
It was a done deal.

520
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:05,958
Two weeks later, he comes
knocking at my door,

521
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:09,889
saying if I don't cough up another $500,
he'll rat me out.

522
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,770
Roger tell you why he needed the money?

523
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:15,143
Just that a guy like me
wouldn't understand.

524
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:17,051
I gave him all the cash I had.

525
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,311
Maybe 90 bucks and my watch.

526
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:22,340
The watch with the hidden
compartment for cocaine?

527
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:27,814
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:38,311
Uh, you're a very slow reader,
Dr. Sweets.

529
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,730
I'm afraid Agent Booth's
report on Mr. Adamson

530
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:43,574
is more revealing of Agent Booth
than it is of Adamson.

531
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,019
Really? Why?

532
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:47,268
That's for Agent Booth to share.

533
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:49,690
But I've seen John Adamson
on TV enough to know

534
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,389
that while he's harmful to the
political process, he's not homicidal.

535
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,591
He's too sensitive.

536
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:58,406
A horny, cocaine-snorting,
jock, party boy is sensitive?

537
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,481
Yes, definitely.

538
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:03,135
And emotionally immature, totally
dependent upon external validation.

539
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:05,734
Cheap and greedy, too.
They're always cheap and greedy.

540
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:07,084
You got all this off TV?

541
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,945
The point is, at the age of 17,

542
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:11,939
John Adamson gave Roger Dillon
money and a watch.

543
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:15,049
If he had killed Roger, he would
have taken his watch back.

544
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,650
Very convincing. The watch part anyway.

545
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:21,148
All that insight into the intangible
enigma of human behavior,

546
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:23,217
and you zone in on the
banal and tangible.

547
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:25,349
I bring more banal and
tangible evidence.

548
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:28,508
Wow. With you people,
it's really go, go, go, isn't it?

549
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,861
We're catching murderers.

550
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,549
And that is so dope, all right?

551
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:33,965
I'm running up a profile
right now to help.

552
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,503
I love being in the field.

553
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,115
Uh, you're in a secure lab.

554
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:40,924
Dude, for eight hours a day,
I'm surrounded by neurotics.

555
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:43,537
Okay, to me, this is field work.

556
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:47,936
Uh, no offense, Dr. Brennan.

557
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,439
I'll finish the profile.

558
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:54,114
Anyhoo, we've determined that
the Malaoxon in the Roger stew

559
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:56,553
was originally the common
organophosphate pesticide,

560
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,202
malathion, before it broke down.

561
00:25:58,328 --> 00:25:59,376
How common?

562
00:25:59,447 --> 00:26:03,160
There was this 1980s mosquito panic,
and malathion was sprayed everywhere.

563
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,971
Virginia Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services says

564
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:08,780
there was a quadrant bordering
Foothill High School

565
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:13,740
that was sprayed at 7:45 p. m.
on Thursday, June 14, 1987.

566
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:17,497
Why'd they keep such detailed records?

567
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:20,399
Spraying aerial neurotoxins
in an attempt to kill creatures

568
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,353
that outlive atomic bombs

569
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:25,879
tends to make bureaucrats consider
possible lawsuits, I guess.

570
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:27,671
It's a housing development.

571
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,561
Yes, but in 1987, it was mostly a swamp.

572
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,855
The development was under construction.
There were only a few finished homes.

573
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,180
Could the wind have blown
the insecticide onto Roger?

574
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:37,381
In this concentration,

575
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,028
Roger had to have been wading
right through the middle of it.

576
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:42,273
- Why would he do that?
- There's only one reason.

577
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:43,288
A girl.

578
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,987
- What are you basing that on?
- I was a boy.

579
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:49,386
And I searched the
1987 real estate records.

580
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,037
Guess who lived in one of
the only finished houses.

581
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,592
Janelle Brown, head cheerleader.

582
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:56,163
He was tutoring her in math.

583
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:56,994
Exactly.

584
00:26:57,053 --> 00:27:00,138
Why would he wade through
a swamp to get to the house?

585
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:01,435
There had to be roads.

586
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:03,402
It was quicker. She was a cheerleader.

587
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:05,143
She was hot.

588
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,311
He couldn't wait.

589
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:08,701
The boy thing again.

590
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:11,615
Or maybe he was peeping
through her window.

591
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:13,094
Could have been a peeper.

592
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,586
Do boys change after high school?

593
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:19,886
Only on the outside.

594
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:33,371
Whoever thought hair
like that looked good?

595
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,816
Hey, check this out.

596
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:36,902
This is weird, right?

597
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:40,595
It's a yearbook. It's supposed to be
weird and humiliating.

598
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,300
Yeah, but this is the
"Hall of Fame" section.

599
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:45,843
It's usually, "Best Smile"

600
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:47,612
and "Most Likely to Succeed."

601
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,964
This is "Most Likely
to Get Head Stuck Up Own Ass"

602
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:52,804
and "Best Rack"

603
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,964
and "Most Likely to die of VD."

604
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,594
Wait. Somebody put a prank
version of the yearbook

605
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,531
in the capsule to embarrass
everyone 20 years later?

606
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,357
Yup. Look at this.

607
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:05,294
"Brought to you by Gruff & Grim."

608
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:07,433
So, we're looking for two kids who put

609
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:09,789
a yearbook and a body
into the time capsule?

610
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,222
Okay, Bones, so there
was this girl, okay?

611
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:16,365
Sherai Bellapenni.

612
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,469
Sherai, Sherai.

613
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:20,198
She was the coolest,
hottest girl in high school.

614
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,562
I wanted to ask her to my junior prom,
so what I did was, I bribed the suck-up

615
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,630
- who did the morning announcements.
- Suck-up?

616
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,758
The kids who did anything
to please the teachers.

617
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:30,718
So I get on the loudspeaker,
and I ask her to prom.

618
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:34,192
On the loudspeaker.

619
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,527
This is your embarrassing story?

620
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:37,874
On the loudspeaker.

621
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,400
I got laughed at for weeks.

622
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:43,132
- Did she go with you to the prom?
- Sure.

623
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:47,340
Okay, this is merely another story
of victory and sexual conquest.

624
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:49,363
Look, Bones, they laughed at me.

625
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,396
Okay, laughing has got to
count for something.

626
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:54,103
There's no public humiliation
in that story, Booth.

627
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,524
You don't even know what
public humiliation is.

628
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,773
Ms. Stinson, Special Agent Booth,

629
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,097
Was your name Janelle Brown
in high school?

630
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:03,934
Yes.

631
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:06,466
Mind if we come in and ask
you a few questions?

632
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,269
Of course, yeah. Come in.

633
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,194
Look at her.

634
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:14,495
I wish I was Janelle Brown again.

635
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,391
Or at least parts of me do.

636
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:20,079
- You know what I mean?
- You lived at 224 Green Gates Crescent?

637
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,987
Yeah, just a few blocks from here.

638
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,854
It backed onto a swamp.

639
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,779
Yeah. I was scared of that
swamp as a little girl.

640
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,548
How well did you know Roger Dillon?

641
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,193
Oh, I don't know. He was my math tutor.

642
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:35,152
And, well, math wasn't really my thing,
so I needed a lot of help, and, well...

643
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:39,086
he kind of developed a crush on me.

644
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,027
He was actually kind of cute in
a non-jock way, you know?

645
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,239
Sweet.

646
00:29:43,612 --> 00:29:45,204
Oh, he loved The Cure.

647
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,037
For what? What did he have?

648
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,925
It's a band, Bones.
It's... It's... It's a band.

649
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:53,142
Um, did he tutor you at your place?

650
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:54,920
My place or the library.

651
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:57,646
Usually my place.
I think he liked it there.

652
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,652
You know, his own place
wasn't very nice.

653
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,375
Do you rember seeing him on,
June 14, 1987?

654
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:04,432
<i>Mom?</i>

655
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,010
Uh, I'm in here, honey.

656
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:08,080
It would have been
the last day of school.

657
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,299
I'm going to Pete's. Okay.

658
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:11,513
What's going on?

659
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,086
Um, these people are with the FBI.

660
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,617
They're investigating
the time capsule murder.

661
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:19,085
Nothing to worry about. Your parents
were just friends of the victim.

662
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:21,154
Well, that sucks.

663
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:23,559
Yeah. Honey, why don't you go to Pete's?

664
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,505
If you're going to be late,

665
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,771
just give me a call, 'cause you have
your cell phone?

666
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:33,610
I have it.

667
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:34,643
Okay.

668
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:35,864
What are you doing?

669
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,616
- See you later, Mom.
- Okay.

670
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,874
You know, I-I think I actually did see
Roger on the last day of school.

671
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:45,001
- Why?
- Like I said, he was my tutor.

672
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,439
Why would he come to your house
on the last day of school?

673
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,492
Honestly?

674
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:52,489
He brought me my graded final,
but he'd have used any excuse.

675
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:54,640
I didn't encourage him, but...

676
00:30:56,536 --> 00:31:00,125
High school was so long ago, and
none of us is the same person.

677
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:03,588
I'm sorry Roger ended up that way,

678
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:07,564
but after he dropped off my final,
I never saw him again, so...

679
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:11,755
- Thank you, Ms. Stinson.
- Oh, yes.

680
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:13,027
Uh-huh, of course.

681
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:18,692
Could you please call up Terry Stinson
from the Foothill yearbook?

682
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:23,815
Track team, Vice President of the
Student Council,

683
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:25,616
runner up for Mr. Popularity.

684
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:26,936
Where does it say that?

685
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,358
It's the type, sweetie.

686
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,474
He's Mr. Second Best.

687
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,712
It's kind of like when you
want Brad Pitt and

688
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:34,226
you get Matthew McConnaghey.

689
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:36,527
And pull up the photo of his son, Alex.

690
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:41,151
Alex Stinson shows three classic
examples of Mendelian inheritance.

691
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:46,024
A cheek dimple on the left side,
cleft chin and detached earlobes.

692
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:47,562
Distinct facial features.

693
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:50,539
Wide set eyes, asymmetrical nostrils.

694
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,562
Just like his dad.

695
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,261
It's nothing like his dad.

696
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:58,510
Oh, boy.

697
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:03,267
Could you please replace
Terry Stinson with Roger Dillon?

698
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,935
Oh, boy.

699
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:11,967
20 years ago, Terry Stinson
finds out that

700
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,516
that Roger Dillon has sex
with his girlfriend.

701
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:16,152
And he kills him.

702
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:25,175
Of course we'll take a DNA test.

703
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:28,530
You realize in a murder investigation,
we can't rule anything out.

704
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:32,290
Did you know that it was possible that
Alex was not your biological son?

705
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:33,928
What?

706
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,535
Is it possible?

707
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:40,854
Is it?

708
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:45,633
Can I answer that after the DNA test?

709
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:50,610
I guess I just did.

710
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:52,090
So you didn't know?

711
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:53,373
Terry didn't know.

712
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:57,864
Alex was born on January 7, 1988.

713
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:00,384
I don't believe this.

714
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,749
That means you were pregnant
in the spring already.

715
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,558
You just wanted me to believe
that the baby was mine?

716
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:10,512
No, no.

717
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:15,009
I wanted... the baby inside me
to be yours.

718
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,384
I don't get this.

719
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,373
Roger... what... but he was...

720
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:21,981
Why did you sleep with Roger?

721
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,935
He was sweet. He was...

722
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:25,888
I knew he was nuts about me.

723
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,738
I liked feeling special.

724
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:30,582
Let's face it, Terry, back then,
you were that guy.

725
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,784
What guy?

726
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,524
The guy who did anything he wanted.

727
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,848
You didn't need me.

728
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,515
Roger, he came over that day.
He came through the swamp.

729
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:42,740
He was filthy.

730
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,462
His father had just beaten him up...

731
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:47,336
Ms. Stinson, did you tell Roger that
he had gotten you pregnant?

732
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:50,018
Yes.

733
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,388
He wanted to marry me.

734
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,885
He said he could get the money for us

735
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,532
to go away together,
but I told him I didn't want to.

736
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,763
I was back with you by then.

737
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,394
Only you.

738
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:05,000
Why didn't you tell me?

739
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,197
When I told you I was pregnant,
you were so happy.

740
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,480
That's when I knew that you loved me.
That you weren't "that guy."

741
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,024
We could have a great life
together and we did.

742
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,226
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:17,503
I had to borrow one of your pictures.

744
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:18,585
You stole that.

745
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,873
- What did you think happened to Roger?
- I don't know.

746
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:23,884
He had the money.
He was never happy here.

747
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:27,272
I figured that he
just took off by himself.

748
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,676
I am so sorry.

749
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:36,624
I always wanted to tell you
the truth, but I just...

750
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:41,516
I just couldn't figure out how
to tell you that Alex wasn't yours.

751
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:48,104
Alex is my son.

752
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,231
We are a family.

753
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:05,468
Well, the murder happened at night
on a high school playing field,

754
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:07,676
not a likely place to find adults.

755
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:11,960
Plus, teenagers are dominated by their
ids, which make them act irrationally.

756
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:16,271
Physiologically, their judgment's
impaired by an incomplete frontal lobe.

757
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,459
You're what, 22, right?

758
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:20,389
How's your frontal lobe?

759
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:22,332
Almost there?

760
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,288
Again, a hectoring tone.

761
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,241
All right, look, I'm sorry,
just keep going.

762
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:28,403
All right, there was no
sexual assault, no theft.

763
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,413
The watch and other effects
were still on him.

764
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:33,141
Further indications that this was just
a rash and youthful act.

765
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,823
Right, right. That's good for a kid.
This is guess work, Booth.

766
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:38,953
It's a logical interpretation
of subjective analysis by a

767
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:41,681
highly intelligent expert
in his field, actually.

768
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:43,736
The killer knew the exact date

769
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:46,544
the time capsule would be opened
when he put the victim in there.

770
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:48,241
He's been waiting 20 years

771
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,046
for that body to be found so he could
reconcile himself with his past,

772
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:53,564
and finally pay for his crime.

773
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:56,245
- Like Terry Stinson?
- No.

774
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,385
I think you're looking for someone
who's been punishing himself for years.

775
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:04,264
Someone self-destructive, working
far below his potential.

776
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:05,847
Then why doesn't he just confess?

777
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,472
Most likely he has in some way,
Agent Booth.

778
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,565
The question is, were you listening?

779
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:13,096
Agent Booth is an
incredibly good listener.

780
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:14,979
Yeah, I really am. It's my strength.

781
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:21,623
Then perhaps the time capsule was just
a convenient place to stash a body.

782
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,121
You know,
profiling's not an exact science.

783
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:26,144
But I hope I'm right.

784
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,380
I really want to tell my girlfriend
I helped catch a murderer.

785
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,866
It'd be a good night for me.

786
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,504
The textural stain on the undersurface
of Roger's mandible

787
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,842
was liquid petroleum.

788
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,590
- An oil product?
- I know. I know.

789
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:43,862
Dead common, right?

790
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,665
But I did some further analysis.

791
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:48,162
I found that there were microscopic
particles of granite

792
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:49,529
embedded in the petroleum.

793
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,080
Also, all over the broken seal
to the time capsule.

794
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:54,290
Definitely not John Adamson's ice skate.

795
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,382
Yeah, not unless he skated on asphalt.

796
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:59,891
20 years ago what I'm seeing
as petroleum was asphalt.

797
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:03,255
It was driven into Roger's bone
with a flat, metal...

798
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:04,480
An asphalt shovel?

799
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,567
Yeah.

800
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:08,180
Gil Bates worked paving driveways.

801
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,411
Roger was my best friend.

802
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,191
Gruff and Grim, right?

803
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,318
Who was who?

804
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,507
I was Gruff. Roger was Grim.

805
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:21,759
So you went out to the field that night

806
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:23,805
to plant the yearbook in
the time capsule.

807
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:26,282
Right, surprise everyone
20 years down the line.

808
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:29,882
You dug up the capsule and you broke
the seal with the asphalt shovel.

809
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:33,747
Your amigo, Grim, wanted his money back?

810
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:36,376
The money that you earmarked
for your business.

811
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:38,676
All those computers that were
going to make you rich.

812
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:41,929
And you couldn't do that, Gruff. You
just couldn't give Grim back the money.

813
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,501
Could you stop using those names?

814
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,512
Did he tell you that it was
for Janelle Brown?

815
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:46,633
I bet he did.

816
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:49,518
I bet old Grim said, "I'm sorry,
Gruff, but there's this girl.

817
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:52,348
- Our plans, they're dust."
- I asked you to stop using the names.

818
00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:54,625
You know, but then Grim said,
"My dream has changed.

819
00:37:54,695 --> 00:37:56,586
"You and me, Gruff and Grim,
we're finished."

820
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,718
Stop it!

821
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,504
You don't know what
you're talking about!

822
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:00,649
We don't know what?

823
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,430
Did he tell you it was because
she was pregnant?

824
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,493
He should've told you.

825
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:13,222
You would have understood.

826
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:14,645
Understood what?

827
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,424
Janelle was pregnant with Roger's son.

828
00:38:18,822 --> 00:38:20,117
Oh, my God.

829
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:23,580
He didn't say.

830
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,395
He just said that he loved her.

831
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:29,129
I told him...
I told him how stupid that was.

832
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,823
I said that she'd never look
at someone like him and...

833
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,152
he got all pissed and then he hit me.

834
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,759
And I just, I went and I picked up
the shovel and I just...

835
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,823
I just jabbed.

836
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,551
It was an accident.

837
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:50,100
It was just a jab.

838
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:52,748
He held his neck.

839
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,459
And he went all white.

840
00:38:56,744 --> 00:39:00,366
The wound severed both
his jugular and his carotid.

841
00:39:00,435 --> 00:39:02,378
He would have died quickly.

842
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:03,615
He did.

843
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:07,788
I... I held him and
I told him I was sorry.

844
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:10,112
He knew that I didn't mean it.

845
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,164
I loved the guy.

846
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,886
He has a kid?

847
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:22,748
Yes.

848
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:26,563
I hope I get the chance to
tell him about his father.

849
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:42,875
All right, there was this
kid, uh, junior year.

850
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:45,811
Okay, is this going to be
another story where you

851
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:48,155
think you were humiliated,
but you actually were not?

852
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,228
Just listen to me.

853
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:51,480
This kid, junior year, Harlan Kinney.

854
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:56,626
He was one of those real weird,
you know, looking kids.

855
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:59,771
He had this big Adam's
apple sticking out.

856
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,748
And he wore his dad's clothes to school.

857
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:04,188
You know, with the whole stretchy
belt around his waist.

858
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:05,928
What's wrong with that? It's practical.

859
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:07,124
You're not listening.

860
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:10,552
He was one of those real superior type,

861
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,668
always talking out of a thesaurus.

862
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:16,122
And one day he came up to me
and a bunch of my buddies

863
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:17,822
he called us a bunch of Philistines.

864
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:19,186
You know what that means?

865
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:21,770
Yeah. A Philistine is a smug,
ignorant person

866
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:24,920
who is antagonistic toward
higher thought and intelligence.

867
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,339
Well, I didn't know what that
meant till I looked it up.

868
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:31,244
I told Kinney, "Look, I'm not
Philistine, I'm Catholic."

869
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,216
That's pretty close to humiliation.

870
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,067
- No, that's embarrassing.
- That's not the humiliating part.

871
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:43,814
My buddy, picked Kinney up and

872
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,276
dangled him over the stairway.

873
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:50,276
You know, he begged and cried,
and everyone laughed.

874
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,415
How is this about you?

875
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:54,485
I laughed.

876
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:57,623
I don't understand.

877
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,907
I could've stopped it.

878
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,929
I could've stepped in and
helped the kid out.

879
00:41:00,987 --> 00:41:02,860
Instead I... I didn't.

880
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,941
I chose my side,
and it was the wrong side.

881
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:12,583
So you were humiliated because
you didn't act like a hero?

882
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,872
Fine, fine, you know what?

883
00:41:14,953 --> 00:41:16,819
I'm perfect. My life was perfect.

884
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:18,622
It's a good story, okay?

885
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:20,241
But it's a bad one.

886
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,201
I mean, it's both, I guess.

887
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:23,373
I mean, I get it.

888
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,842
Yeah?

889
00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:27,582
What is that?

890
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:29,397
Nothing.

891
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:33,015
Well, you evolved.

892
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,385
And evolution is very impressive.

893
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,431
And that is definitely not nothing.

894
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:38,969
This?

895
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,946
Did you bring that for me?

896
00:41:41,038 --> 00:41:43,131
No. Good, because it's the wrong Smurf.

897
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:46,050
I liked Smurfette, that's Brainy Smurf.

898
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:50,212
Smurfette was stupid, shallow
Smurf who only had her looks.

899
00:41:51,738 --> 00:41:53,819
Look, you're better than Smurfette.

900
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:56,425
You have your looks and
a whole lot more.

901
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:04,304
You did bring that
for me to charm me in case

902
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,911
I didn't find your humiliation
story impressive, but I did, so...

903
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:11,587
So I did impressed you.

904
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:14,339
That's what "impressive" means, dummy.

905
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:16,015
You're such a Philistine.

906
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:17,829
I'll tell you what.

907
00:42:17,923 --> 00:42:21,183
You can hold on to this, and it will
remind you how far I've come.

908
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:29,056
I forgive you for snorting, Booth.

909
00:42:29,148 --> 00:42:32,281
Evolution is a long, long process.

910
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,281
It takes hundreds of years.

911
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:36,564
Thousands.

912
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,547
Why do you have to always correct me?

913
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:42,472
To help you evolve.
