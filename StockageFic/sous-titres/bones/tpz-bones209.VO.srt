Hey, guys, come on.
Just stay where you are, okay?

00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:36,126
My superiors say to let you
look at the flying saucer.

24
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,255
It's not a flying saucer.

25
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,663
It sure looks like one.

26
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,497
Local kids dirt-biking.
Something shiny poking from the dirt.

27
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,733
They dig it out, look in the window
and see aliens.

28
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,674
- Did you look?
- Yes, ma'am. Then called for backup.

29
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,712
- <i>[Booth] Uh, why?</i>
- On account of, well, they are aliens.

<i>Are those what I think they are?</i>

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,828
Yes. As long as you think
they're two adolescent human males.

00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,169
Mmm, how long?

36
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,699
The amount of dehydrated
tissue suggests...

37
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,211
<i>the tank is sealed and intact.</i>

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,807
- <i>Years.</i>
- Man. Two kids, huh?

39
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,682
I liked it better when they were aliens.

40
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,688
One set of remains shows trauma
to the legs... compound fractures.

41
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,690
And his pelvis
is broken in three places.

42
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,692
The other is virtually untouched.

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,888
- Cause of death?
- The amount of blood suggests
at least one of them bled out.

44
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,557
Probably the one with the injuries.

45
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:51,935
I've also noted a constellation of identical
non-metric variants. Extra foramina.

46
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,031
<i>Does that mean they were twins?</i>

- Matthew and Ryan Kent.

Kidnapped October 31, 2001.

49
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,983
No one has seen 'em since.

Oh, God.

Come on, Peter.
It's better than never knowing.

54
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,756
Agent Sanders, you were assigned
to the Kent kidnapping?

55
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,925
Uh, Mr. Sanders.

56
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,026
I, uh, retired from the F.B. I...

57
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,936
to pursue a career
in general contracting...

58
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,940
uh, when I'm sober.

59
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,774
Uh, Kim here was the assistant United States
attorney attached to the case.

60
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,779
Still attached. The file's still open.

61
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,111
<i>[Kim] The boys were snatched</i>
<i>after a drinking party.</i>

62
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,310
Was the ransom paid?

63
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:16,617
As the duly sworn representative
of the F.B. I...

64
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,680
I advised Mr. Kent not to pay the ransom.

65
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,989
Unfortunately, the Kents listened to me
and not the K & R guy...

66
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,121
and, uh, now their sons are dead.

67
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,964
- K & R?
- That's "kidnap and ransom" experts.

68
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,663
The Kent boys were the Grave Digger's
third victims.

69
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,400
Third of the six we know of.

70
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,705
Uh, altogether,
four paid the ransom and lived.

71
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,711
And the other one that didn't?

72
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,044
- Never found him.
- That's why they call him the Grave Digger.

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,313
He takes people, and he buries them.

74
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,651
<i>You pay the ransom,</i>
<i>and he tells you how to dig 'em up.</i>

75
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,158
You don't and, uh,
you never see 'em again.

76
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,859
You won't catch him.

77
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,363
With all due respect,
uh, Agent Sanders...

78
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,162
we have the beer vat and human remains.

79
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,033
What are two dead bodies gonna tell you
that four live victims couldn't?

80
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,200
Dr. Brennan... she's pretty good at, uh,
making dead people tell her things.

81
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,675
Look, my advice...
talk to the K & R guy.

82
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,840
"Kidnap and ransom" expert,
Thomas Vega. Former F.B.I.

83
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,042
<i>[Kim]</i>
<i>He literally wrote the book on the Grave Digger.</i>

84
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,614
<i>I became a "kidnap and ransom" specialist...</i>

85
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,657
after I realized that the Bureau's policy
on nonpayment to kidnappers...

86
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,352
is antiquated and dangerous.

87
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,554
You've dealt with
the Grave Digger how many times?

88
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,325
- In total? Five.
- Janine is a journalist.

89
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,525
She helped me write the book
on the Grave Digger.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,626
Next to me, she's the ranking
expert on that son of a bitch.

91
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,695
Journalist, huh?

92
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,899
Oh, don't be like that, Agent Booth.

93
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,976
The Grave Digger is totally consistent.

94
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,978
<i>No one ever sees the victim taken.</i>

95
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,480
<i>The ransom demand is made using</i>
<i>a digitally altered voice.</i>

96
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,882
<i>A time limit is given.</i>
<i>There's never a second call.</i>

97
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,045
As soon as the ransom is paid...

98
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,919
to a numbered untraceable account
in Bahrain, the Caribbean, et cetera...

99
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,720
G.P.S. coordinates are provided
leading to the victim.

100
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,227
None of the surviving victims
remembers anything before being taken?

101
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,924
<i>Nothing. Burn marks</i>
<i>on the back of the neck...</i>

102
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,126
suggests the use
of a stun gun or cattle prod.

103
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,136
That'll scramble your brains pretty good.

104
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,866
Also, when you try to trace whatever
container the boys were found in...

105
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,771
well, you'll reach a dead end.

106
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,333
He gets everything from
landfills or cash auctions.

107
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,345
No last chance to pay up?

108
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,347
Never.

109
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,349
You know, most kidnappers are caught...

110
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,681
because they start negotiating the ransom.

111
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,584
The Grave Digger simply won't play.

112
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,588
Really not looking to help you
write another book.

113
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,920
You know, <i>Capturing the Grave Digger.</i>

114
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,621
<i>Agent Booth, I have seen what this guy</i>
<i>does to families, up close.</i>

115
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,831
You know what?
Dislike me as much as you want.

116
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,862
But I'm still gonna help you
because I want this bastard caught.

117
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,314
You were kind of mean to them.

118
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,475
Yeah, thanks.

119
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,643
Zack, did you catalog this anomaly
between C1 and C2 on Matthew?

120
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,691
Yes. If you increase magnification
on the atlanto-axial joint...

121
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,784
you'll see calcining
on the articular process.

122
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,528
[Beeping]

123
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,897
Bone burn.

124
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,061
Yes. Over 300 degrees.

125
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,071
Stun gun.

126
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,300
Does the same mark
appear on Ryan?

127
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,900
- No.
- Okay.

128
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,914
Get the F.B.I. to send you photos and medical
exam results of the Grave Digger's victims.

129
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,145
See if he uses
the same stun gun every time.

130
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,187
Aluminum.

131
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:40,021
- Aluminum?
- The Brits say aluminium,
but it sounds, well, British.

132
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,652
Manganese alloy,
strain-hardened and stabilized.

133
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,253
Traces on both sets of clothing.

134
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,232
- From the vat?
- No. The inside of the vat is pure copper.

135
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,599
Both boys' clothing was stained
with a sooty residue...

136
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,266
- made up of lead and carbon,
benzene and aldehydes.
- Engine exhaust.

137
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,037
Yeah. Particulates from lots of engines,
both gasoline and diesel.

138
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,545
- Parking lot?
- <i>Underground probably.</i>

139
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,946
Think that's where the Digger
grabs his victims?

140
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,143
Compare your findings with the results...

141
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,847
found on the clothing
of the surviving victims.

142
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,889
See if they share anything in common.

143
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,016
<i>And measure oxygen volume in the vat.</i>

144
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,357
- <i>Find out how long the twins survived.</i>
- I'll get right on it.

145
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,420
Mr. Kent, I'd like to start...

146
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,592
by expressing theJustice Department's
sincere condolences...

147
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,227
for the death of your sons,
Matthew and Ryan.

148
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,430
If I'd ignored theJustice Department...

149
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,474
and listened to Mr. Vega here...

150
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,305
paid the two million...
my boys would still be alive today.

151
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:36,405
- Sir, I understand your feelings towards the F.B.I.
- I doubt that.

152
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,814
<i>[Vega]Jim, Agent Booth here</i>
<i>is investigating your sons' murder.</i>

153
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,911
You know my problems with
the F.B.I.'s approach to kidnapping...

154
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,821
but when it comes to finding killers...

155
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,519
you want these people on your side.

156
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,830
Ryan and Matty were spoiled.
[Chuckles]

157
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,996
I know. They, uh, partied.

158
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,767
- <i>They chased girls. They,</i> uh...
- <i>[Cell Phone Chimes]</i>

159
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,832
<i>They got expelled from school.</i>

160
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,311
<i>But they weren't bad kids.</i>

161
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:13,341
<i>And there's no way that</i>
<i>they deserved suffocation.</i>

162
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,287
<i>Is it painful?</i>

163
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,688
Like falling asleep.

164
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,796
Mr. Kent, the Grave Digger
lied to you and the F.B.I.

165
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,096
<i>That's unlikely.</i>
<i>He doesn't play games.</i>

166
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,968
Mr. Kent, is there any way you could've put
together the ransom in 12 hours?

167
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,939
No way in the world.

168
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,942
Which is exactly why the Grave Digger
provided Mr. Kent with 24 hours.

169
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,537
His sons only had enough air for 12 hours.

170
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,515
- Oh, my God.
- Even if you had ignored the F.B. I...

171
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,145
and listened to Mr. Vega, you still wouldn't
have been able to save your sons.

172
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,847
You're backstopping for the Bureau.

173
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:54,552
<i>There were two of them in that vat.</i>
<i>They used up their oxygen twice as fast.</i>

174
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,222
- The Grave Digger miscalculated.
- No, he doesn't do that.

175
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,891
Then it was never his intention
that these boys survive.

176
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,128
He just didn't care, Mr. Kent.

177
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:07,866
So my decision to listen to the F.B.I.,
to not pay the ransom...

178
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,172
If you had paid the ransom, your sons would
still have been dead by the time you got to them.

179
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,235
There was nothing you could
have done, Mr. Kent.

180
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,749
You are in no way responsible
for the death of your sons.

181
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,091
[Tires Screeching]

182
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,253
Had it occurred to you that God
is a lot like the Grave Digger?

183
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,423
What?
What? What?

184
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,094
He lays down the rules,
no way to question him or negotiate.

185
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,933
Then it's almost as though
he doesn't care how it works out.

186
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,567
Either you do as he says...
make some sacrifices, and they're delivered...

187
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,441
or you don't,
and you end up in hell.

188
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,946
You know what? I'd appreciate
if you didn't say things like that...

189
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,040
because I really don't want
to get struck by lightning.

190
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,709
Do you go to church every Sunday?

191
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,446
- Yes, I do.
- Can I come with you?

192
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,511
- No, you can't.
- Why? It might help me to understand.

193
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,422
I am not gonna help you disrespect God
in his own house, okay?

194
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,428
If you wanna do some kind of,
you know, anthropological study,
turn on the religious channel.

195
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,433
Each of these contained one
of the Grave Digger's victims.

196
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,401
Cozy.

197
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,029
We also provided your people
with the clothes each victim was wearing.

198
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:17,565
<i>Regarding the clothing, every one of them</i>
<i>shows traces of aluminum and sooty residue.</i>

199
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,271
We know each victim was taken
from an underground garage...

200
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,712
beyond the reach of security cameras.

201
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,411
The typical kidnap-for-ransom profile
is middle-aged, in a job that's beneath him.

202
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:30,683
<i>Smart guy who's an underachiever and someone</i>
<i>who enjoys control over somebody else's life.</i>

203
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,384
- There's just one problem.
- What's that?

204
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,155
See, there's nothing typical
about this guy.

205
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,992
Don't expect him to fit the profile.

206
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,999
Okay, the dimensions of the vat...

207
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,661
six feet wide by eight feet tall...

208
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,638
make it impossible for Matthew Kent
to have fractured his brother's pelvis.

209
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,938
Even if Matthew knocked Ryan down
and, you know, stomped on him?

210
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,911
Cam and I agree the fracture
was the result of one hard blow.

211
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,106
<i>[Console Beeps]</i>

212
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,674
A break like that would require a lot more
force than Matthew could have generated.

213
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,347
<i>All right. So you're saying that Ryan</i>
<i>was injured before he went into that vat.</i>

214
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:09,019
Yes. But the amount of blood on the floor
can't be explained by his injuries alone.

215
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,689
- What?
- It was a mistake.

216
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:16,428
- What was?
- Look, he intended to take one boy,
but he ended up with two.

217
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,630
Oh. That's why they died
12 hours ahead of schedule.

218
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,106
If he intended to take two boys, he would've
put 'em in a container twice as big.

219
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,836
All right?
The Grave Digger... he messed up.

220
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,209
He snuck up on Matthew, knocked him
unconscious, whatever, and Ryan was there.

221
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,214
He shows up, and he fought the guy.

222
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,182
No, Booth. Not fight.

223
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,651
The leg damage, the fractured pelvis.

224
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,018
These injuries are classic
human-versus-car.

225
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,354
Ryan interrupts the kidnapping
of his brother.

226
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,691
- And the Grave Digger runs him down.
- It was a mistake.

227
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,027
The Grave Digger is not God, Bones...

228
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,123
because God does not make mistakes.

229
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,134
Mmm, I don't know.

230
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,000
Putting testicles on the outside
didn't seem like such a good idea.

231
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,935
Commercial stun gun, 625,000 volts...

232
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,877
- still not enough.
- Well, it sounds like a lot of volts.

233
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,676
Actually, it's the amperage
that does the real damage.

234
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,809
But still, I've checked every
commercial stun gun I can find...

235
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,252
and none of them generate
the right amount of power...

236
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,346
to make those distinctive marks
on the bone.

237
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,823
Well, what about a cattle prod?

238
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,726
<i>Stun guns generate a lot more</i>
<i>power than cattle prods.</i>

239
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,890
You haven't figured out the stun gun?
Then I am this week's king of the lab...

240
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,024
- because I found something huge.
- [Sighs]

241
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,935
You compete to be king of the lab?

242
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,372
No.
[Scoffs]

243
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,569
Hey, Angela.
I didn't know that you were...

244
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,351
This sucks. [Clears Throat] I'm gonna
go catch Brennan, then bolt for the night.

245
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,944
She just left. Hey.

246
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,458
Could you stop being
so weird, please?

247
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,518
It's making me very uncomfortable.

248
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,368
You should give him a chance.

249
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,404
Excuse me?

250
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,567

We're not cheating.
We're not hurting anybody, Seeley.

261
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,469
Then why are we keeping our relationship
such a secret, Camille?

262
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,003
Because we work together,
and we're professionals,

<i>What? What happened?</i>

274
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,347
[Distorted Voice] Temperance Brennan

<i>Wire transfer eight million dollars...</i>

or they will suffocate to death.

279
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,725
I will provide you with Brennan
and Hodgins's G.P.S. coordinates.

280
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,129
This will be my last communication.

281
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,793
It will be his last communication too.
He's never varied.

282
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,963
He learned from the Kent boys.
He got two of them. He cut the deadline in half.

283
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,372
Why is the Grave Digger demanding
so much money? It doesn't make any sense.

284
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,967
He's always been reasonable at knowing
how much money people could raise...

285
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,482
- within the time limit.
- Has, uh, Dr. Brennan made
that much money from her books?

286
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,007
It's Hodgins. He's the sole heir to this thing
called the Cantilever Group.

287
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,280
And what's that?

288
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,318
Just the third largest privately owned
corporation in the country.

289
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,518
Make sense now, Tom?

290
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,429
[Grunts] I was on my way to karate class,
so we have lots of bottled water.

291
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,471

<i>The last thing I remember</i>
<i>is being at the lab.</i>

- I'm really confused.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

294
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,279
What happened to my legs?

295
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:27,112
- Where are we?
- Underground. Buried.

296
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,086
I have a burn.

297
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,856
Zack was trying to figure out
what kind of stun gun.

298
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,192
It has to be the Grave Digger.

299
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,721
<i>I think he ran you down</i>
<i>with his car and then...</i>

300
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,564
pumped you full of drugs
to ruin your short-term memory.

301
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,934
- Same as Ryan Kent.
- How long have we been down here?

302
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,806
Um, maybe two hours, I think.

303
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,810
Okay.

304
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,575
So this vehicle has, I'd say,
60... 60 cubic feet of air.

305
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:01,108
Uh, it's 20 percent just oxygen.
Two people.

00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,120
My brain is not working.

307
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,021
The Grave Digger is very consistent.

308
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,219
If we started with 12 hours of air...

309
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,387
we'll be unconscious in 10.

310
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,988
<i>After that,</i> if...

311
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,194
if no one pays the ransom...

312
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,728
We're dead.

313
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,040
<i>How are we gonna get our hands</i>
<i>on eight million dollars?</i>

314
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,045
- Hodgins is rich.
- He is?

315
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,946
Rich squared to the power of 10
times four is how he describes it.

316
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,950
You're gonna
pay the ransom, right?

317
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,249
Yes. F.B.I. standard ops... they won't work.
Grave Digger operates outside statistics.

318
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,017
- They'll fire you.
- Oh, that's cool. One less reason to wear a suit.

319
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,788
- <i>How did the Grave Digger catch</i>
<i>Brennan and Hodgins together?</i>
- Bones was on her way to karate.

320
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,295
And Hodgins said that
he'd found something huge.

321
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,355
He tried to catch Dr. Brennan.

322
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,802
Here!

323
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,870
Oh, my God.

324
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,973
Oh, that's blood, isn't it?

325
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,884
- It'll turn out to be Hodgins's.
- Dr. Brennan doesn't like it
when we jump to conclusions.

326
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,444
She'll appreciate we're on a deadline.

327
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,888
Look, Hodgins interrupted the kidnapping
just like Ryan and Matthew.

328
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,359
- <i>[Booth] The Grave Digger must've run him over.</i>
- God, what are we gonna do?

329
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,362
It's a crime scene.
They'll look for tire tracks.

330
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,864
They'll check the security cameras.
I need you to be Dr. Brennan.

331
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,367
- I don't know what that means.
- It means keep working the case.

332
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:28,065
- <i>I need to know why Hodgins</i>
<i>was chasing after Bones.</i>
- I'll look at his notes.

333
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,768
- Well, what about me?
- Call Bones's brother Russ.
Tell him what's going on.

334
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,141
I'm gonna go talk to the chairman
of the Cantilever Group.

335
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,203
[Dialing]

336
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,515
We have water, towels...

337
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,714
a mini-kit, ibuprofen...

338
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,723
two cell phones
with no batteries...

339
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,759
a digital camera
with a backup battery...

340
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,852
and a handful of pens.

341
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,159
That one's a laser pointer.

342
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,666
And a copy of my novel.

343
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,862
Hey, we can read it
to each other if we get bored.

344
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:03,533
- Deep Rhapsody.
- <i>Careful.</i>

345
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,510
That's three grand a quarter ounce.
[Winces]

346
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:11,447
Yeah, I'd make that face too
if I spent $3,000 on perfume.

347
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,008
Oh, man. Something...

348
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,852
- My leg.
- Okay, here. Here.

349
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,789
I'm worried you have
compartment syndrome.

350
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,921
[Grunts]
Is that terminal?

351
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,932
I mean, within the next few hours?

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,595
- No.
- But?

353
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,230
It's gonna get painful.

354
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,798
- More painful than now?
- Yeah.

355
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,810
Slip-into-shock-and-die painful.

356
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,869
Wow.

357
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,315
There's nothing we can do about that?

358
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,046
Actually, there is.

359
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,487
Oh, I'm not gonna like this, am I?

360
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,761
What are you doing?

361
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,595
The Grave Digger modified
a commercial stun gun to knock out his victims.

362
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,601
I've figured out
the voltage and amperage...

363
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,069
but not how he modified it
to boost the current.

364
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,743
Which will not help us find
Dr. Brennan and Hodgins.

365
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,112
- I did figure out how Ryan Kent died.
- Let's hear it.

366
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,812
He killed himself. Punctured his carotid artery,
which explains the amount of blood we found.

367
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,345
He used a pen. There's a nick
on the inferior angle of the mandible.

368
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,860
I don't know why he did it.
I don't really do "why." I just do "how."

369
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:33,421
He did it to give his brother more air.
So his twin would survive.

370
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,797
- That's why we found them holding each other.
- How does that help?

371
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,769
When we tell Mr. Kent that one
of his sons gave his own life...

372
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,432
in an effort to save his brother,
it'll mean something, Zack.

373
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,144
Just keep searching, okay?

374
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,392
Okay, I'm ready.

375
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,726
Is that a note to Angela?

376
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,028
Yes. Just in case.

377
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,468
<i>If whatever you're gonna</i>
<i>do to me sends me into shock...</i>

378
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,528
I might die.

379
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,634
Upside? Me not breathing
doubles your survival time.

380
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,407
I'm not interested
in surviving that way.

381
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,047
What I'm going to do is make
a long incision in the fascia...

382
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,986
to release the pressure inside.

383
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,990
And how... how long is a "long incision"?

384
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,424
Wait. You know what?
Don't tell me.

385
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,520
It's best if I do it very fast
and without empathy.

386
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,861
Here.

387
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,425
Hang on to something.

388
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,665
And don't fight passing out.

389
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,743
You ready?

390
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,051
Wait.

391
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,714
<i>What is that?</i>

392
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,022
Evidence of what happened to you.

393
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,187
Let's... Let's worry about it later.

394
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,791
Here. Just put it
in the pages of your book.

395
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,529
<i>I'll take a look at it later.</i>

396
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,907
[Mumbling]

397
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,544
It's best if you don't talk right now.

398
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,307
I am nuts about Angela.

399
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,045
<i>Over the moon.</i>

400
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,553
Stupid in love with her.

401
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:43,058
That's why I bought her that...
that crazy expensive perfume.

402
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,627
A man gives you a bottle
of perfume like that, it says...

403
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,902
It says, "I love you."

404
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,841
There.
I said it out loud.

405
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,657
[Muffled Screaming]

406
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,136
Did you find Russ?

407
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,764
He's on a fishing trip with friends
in the White Mountains.

408
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,774
No phone, no cell service.

409
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,869
- You?
- Hodgins seems to write everything
in some kind of code.

410
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,643
I might have to get Zack
over here to break it.

411
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,743
It says that the traces of aluminum
found on the clothing...

412
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,119
were almost certainly
from the kidnapper's vehicle...

413
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,627
like a box in the back
of a trunk or a van.

414
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,685
You can read that?

415
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,358
Yeah. Hodgins sends me a lot of notes.

416
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,133
Why bother with all of this?

417
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,800
We don't need evidence.
We need millions of dollars.

418
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,945
I can't get the ransom together,
not in time.

419
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,010
The Cantilever Group
has got this policy.

420
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:20,148
No proof of life from the kidnapper,
no ransom.

421
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,194
- Not even for the boss?
- It's his rule. It's no exceptions.

422
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:28,324
They say they need more time.
Except the Grave Digger
doesn't give us that or proof of life.

423
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,426
Booth, I don't think it's a coincidence
that he took Brennan when he did.

424
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,404
Yeah. I was kinda thinking the same thing.

425
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,274
- <i>[Horn Honks]</i>
- [Gasps]

426
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,110
Oh, thank God I didn't kill you.

427
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,172
- How long was I unconscious?
- <i>For a while.</i>

428
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,912
- How's your leg?
- Better.

429
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,887
Lots better.
What are you doing?

430
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,084
Hot-wiring the phone to the
horn so we can send a message.

431
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,390
- From underground?
- We get radio reception.

432
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,896
Direct current 12-volt
will burn out the circuits...

433
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,195
in a 4.2- volt cell phone
in a microsecond.

434
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,792
- <i>Betterjury-rig a resistor.</i>
- Smart.

435
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,532
Might work long enough to send
a single burst transmission.

436
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,565
A very short text message.
Booth can trace it to a cell phone relay tower.

437
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,908
And what message shall we send?
"Good-bye"?

438
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,278
- <i>"Nice to know you"?</i>
- What are we surrounded by?

439
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,408
Pain...

440

despair...

441
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,646
and a subsoil accumulation
of agglutinate aridisols.

442
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,988
- Dirt.
- I don't like the term "dirt."

443
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,323
All right. Then...

444
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,667
tell me something I don't know.

445
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,105
Ash.
[Sniffs]

446
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,841
Hints of nitrogen and sulfur.

447
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,408
- So where are we?
- We're in coal country.

448
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,545
Bituminous coal country.

449
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,488
Basically, Virginia.

450
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,958
We need more than that.

451
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,052
The laser.

452
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,723
And we need benzophenone.

453
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,825
Benzophenone... it's in soaps
and plastic packaging...

454
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,029
sunscreen.

455
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,800
We don't have any sunscreen.

456
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,865
Angela's perfume.

457
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,344
Three grand that cost.

458
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,541
Hodgins, I will split the cost
when we get out of here.

459
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,779
There's something
you don't know about me.

460
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,278
I'm rich.

461
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,347
Me too.

462
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:38,226
No. No, you're... well-off.

463
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,493
My family owns the Cantilever Group.

464
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,626
And there's not many of us left alive.

465
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,898
One, to be exact.

466
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,806
- Me.
- Okay, I won't split it with you.

467
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,850
It smells nice.

468
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,822

469
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,793
Okay.

470
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,852
Okay.

[Camera Whirring]

472
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,676
I know where we are.

473
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,947
There's no negotiating
with the Grave Digger.

474
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,784
[Exhales] You've been through this,
what, uh, five times with this guy?

475
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,416
Exactly. So I know him.
And he does not negotiate.

476
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,460
Aw, what?
What, no chat room action with him?

477
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,087
Are you nuts?
I hate the son of a bitch.

478
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,757
Why? He's made you rich.

479
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,460
You know what?
You just need to deal with the facts.

480
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:55,404
That if you can't put the ransom together
in the time he gave you, your partner is dead.

481
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,604
Here's the deal, all right?
You have a relationship with this guy.

482
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,944
What they call symbiotic.
You benefit from each other. Hmm?

483
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,609
So know this, huh?

484
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,883
That deadline comes around and my partner
is still underground, I will end you.

- [Gasping]
- Yeah?

487
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,956
Three hours to live.

I think it's a bumper sticker.

You mean like,
"If you can read this, you're too close"?

493
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,257
No. Like a prepaid toll road pass.

494
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,355
Someone ran me down with a car.

00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,422
We knew that already.

00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,526
Yeah, but now we've proved it,
and I find I'm really annoyed.

497
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,834
Four to six seconds to enter a message
and hit speed dial.

498
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:06,138

using eight key strikes.
- How's your text messaging?

499

00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,975
Okay.

Hypoxia leads to mental confusion.

- Did you try dialing the number?

512
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,653
I tried all the dumb-guy
normal stuff, okay?

513
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,391
That's why I'm here talking
to the brain trust, all right?

514
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,093

515
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,762
- Booth, they're not cops.
- Yeah. We're running out of time.

516
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,433
Minor correction. Dr. Brennan and Hodgins
will run out of air in four seconds.

521
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:42,837
A little. Four other tires,
but we can't get to 'em.

522
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,898
Is there anything else?

523
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,240
If the ransom was paid,
we'd be out by now.

524
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,748
- Why prolong the inevitable?
- Booth will find us.

525
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,807
You have a lot of faith in Booth.

526
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,819
No.

527
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,981
Faith is an irrational belief in something
that is logically impossible.

528
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,493
Over time, I've seen what Booth can do.
It's not faith.

529
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,551
No offense.

530
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,496
And I'm not just saying this
because you filleted me with a knife.

much less if anyone understood it.

What you have is faith, baby.

535
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,742
- [Chuckles]
- Sorry.

536
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,443
The "baby" thing is a reflex.

537
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,351
You shouldn't talk right now,
to conserve air.

538
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,251
I need the camera batteries
and the preservative powder from your kit.

539
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,523
Soda ash and lithium?

540
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,193
You're going to make
a carbon dioxide scrubber?

541
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,705
If you can perform surgery
out of thin air...

542
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,435
then I can pull a little
thin air out of thin air.

[Chuckling]

544
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,040
Okay. Zack figured out what stun gun
the Grave Digger uses and how it's modified.

545
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,049
Thanks to Angela, we know
that the Grave Digger...

546
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,449
has a customized aluminum case
in the back of his vehicle.

547
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,453
I got about a hundred agents
working that angle.

548
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,682
What does this mean?
Right here. What does that mean?

549
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,817
You're forgetting something!
Brennan and Hodgins are out of air.

550
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:12,192
Great. You wanna give up, huh? This is Bones
we're talking about, and Hodgins.

551
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,322
<i>You think they didn't find a way</i>
<i>to extend their air?</i>

552
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,200
<i>They found a way to send us a message, ask</i>
<i>for help. And you want to give up because of math?</i>

553
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,701
Soda ash. Lithium reacts with high
concentrations of carbon dioxide...

554
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,007
produces oxygen.

555
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,070
- Oh.
- [Laughing]

556
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,554

00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,227
Air bags.

560
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,229
They aren't actually bags of air.

561
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,323
I'm not looking to extend
our survival underground.

562
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,391
I'm looking to blow our way
out of here.

563
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,165
Using the explosives
from the air bags?

564
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,770
That could definitely kill us.

00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,957
- Who was it meant to get to?
- Easy. Brennan's cell to mine.

576
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,723
Right? The message was for me.
We have an understanding. We work together.

577
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,560
We all work together.
She's my best friend.

578

579
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,496
- Hodgins...
- She's right.

580
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,937
- We should assume the message
is from Hodgins, not Brennan.
- Why?

581
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,101
- Because they're buried alive.
- <i>[Angela] And Hodgins is all about dirt.</i>

582
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,805
Okay, great.
The message is about dirt. But who is it to?

583
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,680
Angela. Hodgins is all about
dirt and Angela.

584
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,617
But it's numbers, Zack.
It's for you.

585
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,280
Hodgins would've written me
a line of poetry or something.

586
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,190
Agent Booth. Janine used all her contacts
and got me on all the local news shows.

587
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,093
And I explained that we needed more time.
I asked him to call.

- The mineral components in coal are all the same.

594
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:47,382
It's the organic components that provide
a unique fingerprint. They're called macerals.

595

<i>A reflectance of 1.4 is quite rare...</i>

597
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:56,287
suggesting a high concentration of inertinite.

598
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,454
- Zack, tell me what that means.
- It means he knows where they are.

- [Beeping]

600
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,668
I know where they are.

- <i>Can this possibly work?</i>
- I'm not really an explosives expert...

602
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,306
but the dash might shape the charge
enough to blow out the windshield.

603

If we're less than four feet
beneath the surface...

604

this charge could blow us to freedom.

If we're buried more than four feet deep?

606
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,354
Then the concussion
will turn our brains into jelly.

Yeah.

664
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,204
Okay.

665
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,650
You know I'm good
for that crutch money.

666
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,917
[Both Chuckling]

667
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,988
[Sniffles]

668
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,759
<i># [Soft Rock]</i>

669
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,171
<i># [Continues]</i>

670
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,404
What'd you ask for?

671
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,040
That's between me and a certain saint.

672
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:29,609
- Although I did ask for a little help
finding the Grave Digger.
- Good move.

673
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,086
What's that smell?

674
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,820
The candles.

675
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,919
And I said thanks.

676
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,931
- You should try it sometime.
- If I were going to pray...

677
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,559
I would have done it just before
we set off the explosion.

678
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,297
- And you didn't?
- No.

679
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,532
See, if there was a God,
which there isn't...

680
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:54,977
Shh.
Do you see where we are?

681
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:59,277
- And if I were someone
who believed he had a plan...
- Which I do.

682
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,083
then I'd be tempted to think he wanted me
to go through something like I went through...

683
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:09,490
because it might make me more
open to the whole... concept.

684
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,552
Hmm. And it obviously hasn't.

685
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,327
I'm okay with you thanking God
for saving me and Hodgins.

686
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,666
That's not what I thanked him for.

687
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:25,641
I thanked him for saving all of us.

688
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,644
<i>It was all of us.</i>

689
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,273
Every single one.

690
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,977
You take one of us away...

691
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,953
and you and Hodgins
are in that hole forever.

692
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:44,088
And I'm thankful for that.

693
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,131
I knew you wouldn't give up.

694
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,136
I knew you wouldn't give up.

695
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:04,340
<i># [Ends]</i>

696
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,516
What's that mean?
