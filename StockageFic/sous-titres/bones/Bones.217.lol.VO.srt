1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,500
<i>This cemetery has been</i>
 <i>connected to our parish</i>

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 <i>for almost 200 years.</i>

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,700
3:00 am...

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,800
the water main broke;
felt like an earthquake.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Coffins were bursting
out of the ground.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,900
Are you all right?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,100
I've had some stomach
problems lately.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,600
This isn't helping.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,000
Last person was buried
here over 50 years ago.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,700
I don't know how you're gonna
figure out who's who.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
With burial records,

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,800
identification should be
pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,500
All right, let's see.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
Female...

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,600
40 to 50 years old,

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,700
severe osteoporosis,

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,700
dress and jewelry place burial
around the late 19th century.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,500
This one's in pieces.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's going on here?

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,000
Lorraine said you're
giving them church records.

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,400
The burial records, Father,
so they can identify

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
and reinter the remains.

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,000
Those records are
my responsibility,
Father Sands.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,200
You're to go through me before
allowing their release.

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm sorry, Father.
I saw no harm in it.

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,800
I still run this parish.

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,900
I understand.

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm Father William Donlan.

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
This is Dr. Brennan
from the Jeffersonian and...

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,300
They can't speak
for themselves?

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm Dr. Addy.

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Are you one
of those priests

33
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,300
who smacks schoolchildren
with rulers?

34
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,400
That's not allowed anymore.

35
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,900
We do need those
burial records, Father.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,300
And since this is a federally
protected historic site--

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,800
Fine.
But I'll

38
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,800
to show some respect
for where you are.

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,400
This is
consecrated ground.

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,300
When did you say the last person
was buried here?

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
1951.

42
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,000
This is a male,

43
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,900
buried no more than five
years ago without a casket.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's impossible.

45
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,300
There's evidence of trauma
to the frontal bone.

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
Looks like a fatal assault.

47
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,300
Arrange for a
forensic team.

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,900
Hodgins will want
to collect soil

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,700
for bugs and particulates.
I'll call Booth.

50
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm afraid your ground
was consecrated

51
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
as a crime scene, Father.

52
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,700
You know, the priest
made a complaint.pl

53
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,600
He said that you made fun

54
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
of consecrated grounds?
No, I didn't.

55
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,700
Perhaps I was
a bit colorful.
Colorful?

56
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,800
Writerly.

57
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,300
I am a best-selling author,
Booth.


58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,100
Victim is 30 to 40 years old.

59
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,700
He's an old school priest,
Bones.

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,300
So I'm supposed to walk
on eggshells

61
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
because someone believes
that a plot  earth

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,800
has supernatural properties

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
because they waved
a wand over it?

64
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,300
There's no wand.
The church doesn't use wands.

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Fine. Magic water.
Magic...

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,700
Holy water.

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,300
The terminology makes it real?

68
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,100
Okay, you know, I can't work
with you on this case.

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,900
What do you mean?

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
The victim
was clearly murdered.

71
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,900
We investigate murders--

72
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,800
together.
There's evidence of
blood pooling

73
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,000
on the frontal bone,
and an absence of

74
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
concentric fractures.

75
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,600
That requires investigation.

76
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,900
I'm not working
a whole case

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,100
with you attacking my beliefs.

78
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
You should've just sailed
off with your boyfriend.

79
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,000
Funny. A man who believes
in an invisible super-being

80
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,700
wants to run my
personal life.

81
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Death would have followed
quickly, caused by

82
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,100
craniocerebral trauma.
By the way,

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
90% of the world
believes in God.

84
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,300
And, at one time, most
people were certain

85
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
that the sun revolved
around the earth.

86
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,500
You see what I mean?

87
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't think that this
is about religion at all.

88
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,000
We obviously have issues, oksu,

89
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,700
that are affecting
our working relationship.

90
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
And you're afraid
to deal with them,

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
so you just lash out
at my religion.

92
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,700
Can't you just be satisfied

93
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,400
that if I'm wrong about God,
I'll burn in hell?

94
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,200
That's tempting.

95
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,400
Good. Now how about
we get back to work.

96
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,200
You know, I think
we both still want

97
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
to find out who
killed this man.

98

100
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,400
217 - The Priest in the Churchyard

101
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:39,100
 

102
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,500


103
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,800
The shovel was found a few feet
from where the water main burst,

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,100
buried in a colony of worms.
And they say

105
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Christmas only comes once
a year.

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,000
The metal shavings here
 match the shovel.

107
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,600
Someone was digging
in the cemetery,

108
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,600
broke the water main,
resurrecting the dead.

109
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
And why was someone
digging up the cemetery

110
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,200
at 3:00 in the morning?

111
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,800
Maybe he came back
to dig up the victim?

112
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Move him to another location.

113
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Yeah, or bury someone else.

114
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,700
Dark.

115
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,700
Yeah, and this place
is always so sunny.

116
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Here's our victim.

117
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,200
Found casings from
eastern tent caterpillars

118
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,100
in his eye sockets--
means he was buried
about three years ago.

119
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
He has kind eyes.

120
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,800
How do you know
he had kind eyes?

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,700
I had to make a choice,

122
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
so I chose kind.
And you wonder why I love you.

123
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,600
Is she not fantastic?

124
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
You aren't seriously asking me
to be a part of this.

125
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,300
Get your rendering
over to Booth

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
so they can show the priests.

127
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,900
I am going to go resaturate
the dried blood,

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
see if it's of any value.

129
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,100
Murder?

130
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
I don't believe
it was murder.

131
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,300
It's not a matter of faith,
Father.

132
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
The injuries are definitive.

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,200
You ever hear of the sin
of pride, young woman?

134
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,400
You could be wrong.

135
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Dr. Brennan here, she's
the best in her field.

136
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,700
He would have been buried
about three years ago.

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
I've been here for 41 years,

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
I would know if
someone had killed

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
and buried a man
in my cemetery.

140
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
You seem quite proud yourself.

141
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,300
I don't need to be insulted.

142
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Knock it off.

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
What?
The rules don't apply to him?

144
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Have you offered your guests

145
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,900
any tea or
snacks, Father?

146
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,300
Isn't that why
you're here?

147
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,300
I see someone wants his roast

148
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,100
dry and
overcooked tonight.

149
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Hi, I'm Lorraine.
I'm the parish administrator.

150
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
I have some
refreshments inside.

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,500
And Father Matt is there,
if you need to talk to him.

152
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Nicknames for priests.

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,100
Last Sunday,

154
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,600
he had the whole congregation
holding hands.

155
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,600
No wonder there's
no respect anymore.

156
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Would you mind
just taking a look

157
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,300
at this sketch
we have here, please?

158
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,200
So, do you, uh,
recognize him?

159
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
No... no, I do not.

160
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,200
You're sure?

161
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,700
I'm not senile.

162
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,400
I can name every child
I baptized,

163
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,200
every person I gave
the last rites to,

164
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
every plant on these
grounds-- over 200.

165
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,100
That's aconite.

166
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,100
And this is
 <i>Origanum vulgare,</i>

167
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,700
and over there
are yew trees.

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,300
You know, it was the
Druids who first thought

169
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
of the yew tree as sacred.

170
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
The Christians
adopted the belief,

171
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
claiming it as their own.

172
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,900
Stop...

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
If there's nothing else,

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,100
I'd like to finish pruning.

175
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,100
You go have tea with
the hippie priest.

176
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
<i>I've been here three years.</i>

177
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,200
The archdiocese was thinking of
closing the parish;

178
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,200
sent me here to try and breath
some life into it.

179
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,200
I started a sports
program for the boys,

180
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,700
organized singles' dances.

181
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,300
None of this is easy
for Father Donlan to accept.

182
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
So you don't believe
in all the...

183
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,200
supernatural mythology he does.

184
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,400
Well, if you're talking
about the Holy Trinity,
the transubstantiation

185
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,100
of the host, and the
resurrection...I certainly do.

186
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,100
But you seem like such
an intelligent man.

187
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,700
You have to excuse her, Father.

188
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,200
No need-- God has a soft spot,
even for the atheists.

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm telling you,
this is fantastic.

190
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,300
What is it?

191
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
She's trying to concentrate,
Booth.

192
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
It's an orange-berry pound cake.

193
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm sorry.

194
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't think
I recognize him.

195
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
???

196
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Uh, I've been here...

197
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,800
23 years next month.

198
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,800
My mother died when I was 12;
the parish took me in.

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,100
I've been the administrator
for seven years now.

200
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
Father Donlan basically
raised Lorraine.

201
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,800
Hey, um... you're not going to
eat that, are you, Father?

202
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
No, it's okay, my stomach hasn't
been too fond of me lately.

203
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Then let's get out of your way.

204
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Perhaps a nap

205
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
wouldn't be a bad idea.

206
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,100
Is there anyone
else that we can

207
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,700
show the sketch to?
Why don't you bring it

208
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
to mass on Sunday--
we could pass it around.

209
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,700
Some of the parishioners

210
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
have been there a long time;
you might have some luck.

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,100
Are you sure?
Agent Booth,

212
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm trying to build
a community here.

213
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,000
If we can't work
together to help

214
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
solve a crime like this,
then I'm not doing my job.

215
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,200
<i>It doesn't help the case for</i>
 <i>you to insult the priests.</i>

216
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,600
We're supposed to be gaining
their trust, so they'll help us.

217
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
Matt wasn't threatened;
you were.

218
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
We're definitely not working
well together.

219
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
Because you are bossy
and judgmental.

220
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Problems between people,

221
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
it's never just
one person's fault.

222
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
What about Hitler?
He did pretty well on his own.

223
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Bones, just...

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
come with me to go see
Dr. Wyatt.

225
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,700
Just once.

226
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
No! Therapy is a vague
and inexact process.

227
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,300
The man shouldn't even
be called a doctor.

228
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,700
Well, he helped me.

229
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,400
I mean, are you so threatened
that, uh...

230
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
you can't even do a favor
for someone

231
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
that you call a friend?

232
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I will speak my mind, Booth.

233
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,400
I will speak my mind.
Okay.

234
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,200
It's 7:30, Hodgins.

235
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, maybe the same shovel
was used as the murder weapon.

236
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,000
The metal residue on the skull
is some sort of silver alloy.

237
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,200
You said you were gonna
be finished in a minute.

238
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,900
That was an hour ago.

239
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,900
If I can narrow down the
smelting process of the silver,

240
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,100
I might be able
to figure out

241
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,100
what kind of weapon
we're looking for.

242
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,300
I love it when you
talk about smelting.

243
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,300
Oh, yeah?

244
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Mmm-hmm.

245
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Move in with me.

246
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
What?

247
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,200
We already live together;
just... just move in.

248
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,900
No, we don't.

249
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
You've taken over my closet.

250
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
It's over half-full.

251
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
And over half...

252
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,500
is the common law definition
of living together.

253
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,300
I have my own place, Jack.

254
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
I need my place.

255
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I need you.

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do I have to throw
cold water on you two?

257
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
We were, um, just...

258
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,200
I know. Just try and keep
it off the Internet, okay?

259
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,300
So, I have bad news.

260
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,700
We've all been exposed to
coccidioidomycosis.

261
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
A fungal infection

262
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,600
from the graveyard dirt
we've been breathing.

263
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Symptoms include nausea,

264
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,000
weakness, fever...
I feel fine.

265
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,600
Yeah, me too.

266
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,000
...decreased libido.

267
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,300
I'm listening.

268
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,300
We're all gonna get shots.

269
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah, that sounds good.
Very good. Yeah.

270
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
Thought so.

271
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
She refers to God
as my invisible friend.

272
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
You're talking to
somebody who isn't there.
I'm sure the doctor

273
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,500
questions your
little fantasy.

274
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,500
My beliefs aren't at issue here,
Dr. Brennan.

275
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Clearly, she's intolerant
and it's affecting her
working relationship.

276
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes, he's very
difficult to work with.

277
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,800
Booth said that you could
fix this.

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,900
So...?

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,600
"What now is proved
was once only imagined.

280
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
"The rat, the mouse,

281
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
"the fox, the rabbit--
watch the roots--

282
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,100
"the lion the tiger,
the horse, the elephant--

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
"watch the fruits.

284
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,900
"The cistern contains,

285
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,000
the fountain... overflows."

286
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,300
What?

287
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,500
Oh, come now.
Surely you get the reference.

288
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,900
William Blake.

289
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes. Blake is telling us
that we are all at the mercy

290
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
of our fundamental natures.

291
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,000
Which is nonsense,
of course, but...

292
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,100
when we understand our natures,

293
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
we understand the
resulting conflicts.

294
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,600
What?

295
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
I hate psychology.

296
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,400
As do I!

297
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
It applies a patina of science

298
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
over what is essentially
a dark and complex

299
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,200
set of roiling unknowables.

300
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,700
You see? What?

301
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,900
You weren't fighting
about religion.

302
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
But, that's what Booth said.

303
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,600
Religion provided
the flash point you needed

304
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,100
to expose an
underlying issue.

305
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I will find out
what that issue is,

306
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
help you to resolve it,

307
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,500
and set right the balance

308
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,200
of dark and light
in the universe.

309
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,900
Isn't he great?

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,900
O God,
the Creator and Preserver

311
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,700
of all mankind, we humbly
beseech Thee for all...

312
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Well, shouldn't Brennan

313
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,200
be here with you...
Shh.

314
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,000
...instead of me?

315
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,000
We're dealing
with a few work issues.

316
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,500
Trouble in paradise?

317
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,800
We're just spending
some time apart.

318
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,900
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to pray.

319
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,300
Thank you.

320
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,600
Did you two
sleep together?

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you see

322
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,800
where we are?

323
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
You don't talk
like that in church.

324
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,900
What does that lab do
to you people?

325
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,400
It's just...

326
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,900
this feels like
a couples thing,

327
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,200
and now that
Sully is gone...

328
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
It's not.

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
It's a work thing.

330
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
And so is us being here,
so stay focused.

331
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,100
We ask all these things
through Christ our Lord.

332
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Amen.

333
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,500
I have a unusual request
before I dismiss you today.

334
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,000
We have Special Agent Booth
and Ms. Montenegro

335
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,300
from the Jeffersonian with us,

336
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,600
and they need our help
identifying the victim found

337
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,300
in our cemetery. Now,

338
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,400
I know none of us want to get
involved in something so ugly,

339
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,400
but as Jesus said,
"Whatever you do

340
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,400
for the least
of these brothers of mine,

341
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,600
you do for me," so please,

342
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,300
if you recognize the sketch,

343
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,100
let them know.

344
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,800
How about you, Enzo?

345
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,400
Enzo never misses Mass.

346
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,400
Right, Enzo?

347
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,500
Sorry, Father,

348
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,500
I can't help you.

349
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,400
Um, excuse me.

350
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,300
Could you give him a beard?

351
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,300
Make him heavier?

352
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah,

353
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
I can manage that.

354
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,300
James was an altar boy here
when he was younger.

355
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,400
Um...

356
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
I, I think...

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Does this look like
Father McCourt to anyone else?

358
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, that could be him.

359
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
Someone killed a priest?

360
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,200
Thank you, James.

361
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Father McCourt was
here before me.

362
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
I replaced him
three years ago.

363
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,800
I was told
he left the priesthood.

364
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Well, I suppose it might
resemble Father McCourt.

365
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
So much for that
sharp memory.

366
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,800
Father McCourt wasn't
here for long.

367
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,300
And the eyes are wrong.

368
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,100
That's how you recognize
someone.

369
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,100
Father McCourt's eyes were
hollow, cold.

370
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,600
I take it
you two didn't get along.

371
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,500
I was his confessor.
You know I can't say anything.

372
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
Can <i>you</i> tell me anything?

373
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,100
Just... he was
very secretive.

374
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
He'd disappear
for hours at a time.

375
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Some nights he wouldn't even
come back to the rectory.

376
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,400
One day he was gone.

377
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Left a note saying
he was leaving the priesthood.

378
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,600
All right, thanks.

379
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,300
I've identified
some odd postmortem injuries

380
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,500
on the old bodies.

381
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,900
Snapped fingers,
fractured wrists,

382
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
abrasions on the
ligamenta flava.

383
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,900
And I found traces of gold
in some of the fractures.

384
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,100
I don't get it.

385
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
The person who ruptured
the water main that night

386
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
was a grave robber.

387
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,600
Dr. Brennan told me she saw
injuries like this in Tibet:

388
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
broken bones and
bone markings

389
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,500
from yanking jewelry and
valuables off the remains.

390
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,100
Yeah, which means McCourt
cotd have been struck

391
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,500
by a shovel, but also
he could have been struck

392
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
by one of the valuables
the grave robber found.

393
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,100
So our grave robber comes
to a nice, quiet graveyard,

394
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
next to a nice,
quiet church

395
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,500
whenever he's in need
of some extra cash.

396
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
Only to be surprised one night
by Father McCourt,

397
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,100
???

398
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,700
During the 19th century,
it was customary

399
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Wu yduntiviudto photograph the
txese0two0puople:before burya?

400
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,900
???

401
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,800
Gertrude Watters,
died 1873,

402
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,700
and Horace Rutledge,
died 1901.

403
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
And their valuables
were missing?

404
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,400
Yes. Dr. Hodgins believes
the grave robber is working

405
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,100
in sections, focusing
on the oldest first

406
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,400
where the artifacts
would have the most value.

407
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,600
Who takes care

408
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,500
of the cemetery?

409
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,400
Uh, a landscaper? Janitor?

410
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,000
Father Donlan does
all the gardening.

411
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800
It's, you know,
sort of his obsession.

412
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,100
Other than that, the
occasional parishioner

413
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,700
will rake leaves
or, uh, shovel snow.

414
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,000
You all right?

415
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,100
You know,
I can't quite shake this bug.

416
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,100
And I've got

417
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,500
a wrestling team to coach.

418
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,900
Um, do you mind?

419
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,700
You were in close proximity
with remains.

420
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
You were probably exposed
to a fungal infection.

421
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
What? Is... is that bad?

422
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,700
No.
Yeah.

423
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,400
It's nothing to worry about.

424
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,200
I'll have my office arrange
for treatment.

425
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,200
Thank you.

426
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,300
???

427
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,400
FBI is trying to track
the jewelry to
pawnshops and fences.

428
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,700
I'm checking online
auction sites.

429
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This stuff could net
a fortune.

430
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,400
Enough to kill a priest?

431
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Apparently.

432
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Hey, have you noticed
anything going on between

433
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,800
Brennan and Booth?

434
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
This sounds good.

435
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,100
There is tension.

436
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,500
Ever since Brennan
let Sully sail off

437
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
into the sunset
without her.

438
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,300
No, I didn't notice.

439
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Hmm.
But then again,
I didn't notice

440
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,600
that you didn't want
to live with me either.

441
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,200
Hodgins.

442
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
If you're getting
cold feet...

443
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,900
You're the only one
that would feel them.

444
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,400
Angela.

445
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,800
We'll discuss it at lunch.

446
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,600
The Egyptian place?

447
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,500
Mm-hmm.

448
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,200
Just got off the phone
with the CDC.

449
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,900
The fungal infection we were
exposed to from the graveyard

450
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,300
is rare enough
that they'd have records

451
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,300
of anyone
who was infected, but

452
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
I need your samples
for the strain.

453
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
You got it.
 <i>Yeah.</i>

454
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,900
You know, I got no problem
with this place.

455
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,500
It's where, uh, Bones and
the squints get their answers.

456
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,300
See?

457
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,000
Thumbs in the belt.

458
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,800
That's a very
aggressive stance,

459
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,300
very male.

460
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,300
Crossed arms...
defensive.

461
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,300
Disdain.

462
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,500
But let's not worry about
what you do with your hands.

463
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What you must do is recognize
your negative feelings

464
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,600
for what is, after all,
Dr. Brennan's domain

465
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
and verbalize them.

466
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,600
Verbalize them.
What, now?

467
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,900
This place is too, uh...
it's too shiny,

468
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,500
you know, too bright.

469
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
It's clean.

470
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,400
And clean is bad?

471
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,200
Death isn't clean,

472
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,500
especially murder, which is
our business, all right?

473
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
This place is completely fake.

474
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,800
It's bogus.

475
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,200
You'd like to destroy
the entire edifice.

476
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, I'd like to rip
the whole edifice down

477
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,000
with my bare hands,
or set it on fire

478
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,700
except, you know, there's
nothing in this place to burn.

479
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
All the plastic and the metal
and the flashing lights,

480
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,800
you know, and arithmetic.

481
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
I mean, where's a guy--

482
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,300
a normal guy
who believes

483
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,100
in intuition and the soul
and good and evil...

484
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,900
And God?
Yes, and God, too.
Where is a guy

485
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,900
who doesn't believe in all this
arithmetic supposed to stand?

486
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,200
So your problem with Dr.
Brennan is that you don't know

487
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,700
what will or will not catch
fire or where you stand.

488
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,200
What?
That's good.

489
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,300
You know, that's,
that's very good.

490
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,000
The CDC shows that you
contracted coccidioidomycosis

491
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,200
three years ago.

492
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,000
The only case
in the area.

493
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,100
Well, you know, I,
I, I used to do a lot

494
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,700
of odd jobs
around the parish.

495
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,900
I'd help Father
Donlan in the garden.

496
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm sure that's how
I contracted it.

497
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,700
Nice try, Enzo,
but your name also came up

498
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,000
on the auction site
that was selling jewelry

499
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,800
from the graves.
Which you might have gotten
away with if you hadn't hit

500
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,800
the water main.

501
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I want a lawyer.

502
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,600
Yeah, nice way to get him

503
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,400
to clam up,
thanks.

504
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
So why'd you kill
Father McCourt?

505
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,100
Did he catch you?
I didn't kill anybody.

506
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,600
Ah, there you go.
He's talking again.
What the hell is

507
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
wrong with you people?
You think that I'd
kill a priest?

508
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
Your record also shows
that you were assigned

509
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
to court-appointed
drug counseling.

510
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,500
Okay, look, I had
a drug problem

511
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,900
and, and I needed money.

512
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
I saw these pictures
in the rectory.

513
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,300
Jewelry just buried.

514
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,100
You know.

515
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,500
I figured no one
would miss it.

516
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,300
I didn't kill anybody, okay?

517
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,800
Father McCourt and me, we
never had that problem.

518
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,500
I wasn't his type--
too old.

519
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,300
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

520
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm pretty sure it's
an implication of pedophilia.

521
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
I know, Bones, okay...
But you just said...

522
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,500
Who, Enzo?

523
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,700
Who was his type?

524
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,800
Talk to James, okay?

525
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,400
The kid who I.D.'d him.

526
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,700
Is this really
Cleopatra's bed?

527
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Mm, it's a perfect replica
for the new exhibit.

528
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
We're just making it a
little bit more authentic.

529
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,000
Your feet aren't
cold anymore.

530
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Nice try.

531
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Hey, I thought I
was successful,

532
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,700
but if you want me
to try harder...

533
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
We can't keep our hands
off each other.

534
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,200
I think about you
all the time.

535
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,300
Moving in is
the next logical step.

536
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I have a lease.

537
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
I have an estate.

538
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,800
I'll buy out your lease.

539
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
Shh...

540
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,700
We only have 15
more minutes.

541
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
You said
that we would talk.

542
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Yeah, well,
guess what?

543
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,400
Hmm?

544
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,300
I got distracted.

545
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't believe
Father McCourt's dead.

546
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,300
I mean, I, I thought
he just took off.

547
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,400
You two were pretty close.

548
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah.

549
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,700
I w-- I was an altar boy.

550
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Yeah, so was I.

551
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,200
I liked our priest,
too, but, um...

552
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,700
What?

553
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,600
You think what everyone
else does, don't you?

554
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,200
I don't know; what does
everybody else think?

555
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,400
Because we spent so much
time together, he was...

556
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,000
touching me and stuff.

557
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,900
Really?

558
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,400
Because, you know, if he did
and you got mad one day and...

559
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,400
And killed him?

560
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,100
You think I killed
Father McCourt?

561
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
He never touched
me, not once.

562
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,700
He was my best friend.

563
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,500
My dad bailed on us
when I was three.

564
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
Father McCourt came to
my ball games, he yelled

565
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,800
at me about my grades.

566
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,800
He was the only one
who actually cared.

567
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,900
It doesn't matter
what you think.

568
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,800
Father Donlan didn't
even believe me.

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Father Donlan?

570
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Yeah.

571
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
About a month before
Father McCourt disappeared,

572
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,900
Father Donlan
came to my house

573
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,100
and said he knew what Father
McCourt was doing to me.

574
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
He wouldn't listen.

575
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,700
He was screaming
that Father McCourt

576
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
was going to pay
for his sins.

577
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm telling you,
it was scary.

578
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,600
That old priest was crazy.

579
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
???

580
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,300
???

581
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,400
I'm strict with all the priests
who are assigned to my parish.

582
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
How strict, Father?

583
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm not a New Age priest
like Father Matt.

584
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,500
The Church should be
firm and act as an immovable

585
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
bulwark in the face of change.

586
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,600
Actually,
organized belief systems

587
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,600
which fail to adapt
to changing mores

588
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,300
are demoted
from religions

589
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,100
to acknowledged
metaphoric myth systems.

590
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
I mean, no one
worships Odin anymore

591
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,600
or Zeus.

592
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,800
Thanks, Bones, I can
take it from here.

593
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,800
You're kicking me out?
Yes.

594
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,700
All he can think about now
is giving you catechism.
I need him to answer

595
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,300
some questions.
Wyatt's psychology
isn't working.

596
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,700
Father, I

597
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,500
contacted the archdiocese
about St. Agatha's

598
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,200
and they said

599
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,900
quite a few priests
have come and gone

600
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,900
during your tenure.

601
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,300
Given who they send me,
I've done well.

602
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
Who do they send you?

603
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
Priests who need firm guidance,
for the most part.

604
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,300
In 1997, a complaint was sworn
against you for assault.

605
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,400
Is that your idea
of "firm guidance"?

606
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,600
It was not assault,
it was corporal punishment.

607
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,900
I found an altar boy
drinking sacramental wine

608
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
from the chalice.
And you caned him.

609
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,800
The charges were dropped.

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,700
I learned my lesson, and I have

611
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
never struck anyone since.

612
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
Father Donlan, in your opinion,

613
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,700
did Father McCourt pay too much
attention to James LeVay?

614
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,100
You should ask James.
I did.

615
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,600
James told us that
you suspected the worst.

616
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,600
He was frightened
at how angry you were.

617
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
I regret scaring him.

618
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,700
???

619
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,900
There are greenstick
fractures

620
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,100
on the victim's left ulna

621
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,300
as well as his fibula
and some ribs.

622
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,500
Probably defensive wounds
received in the struggle.

623
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
There's no evidence
of a struggle.

624
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,700
These seem to have
occurred postmortem,

625
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,900
when he was dragged--
probably for burial.

626
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
But even getting
dragged over rocks

627
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,400
shouldn't have caused
those fractures.

628
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,400
The matrix of the bone
was weakened.

629
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,100
The cause could be genetic.

630
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
Or it could be some chemical

631
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
or medicine that compromised
the tissue.

632
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,500
I'll need samples
to run some tox screens.

633
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,300
All right, see these

634
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
tiny metallic fragments embedded

635
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,800
in the victim's skull?
It's silver.

636
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Then I'll assume he wasn't
struck by a shovel.

637
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,000
The silver was smelted
using the led reduction method.

638
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,600
The fluxes used indicate
it's from the early 1800s,

639
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,900
probably during
the Napoleonic Wars.

640
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,700
One of our old skeletons
was I.D.'d as a bishop.

641
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,100
Bishop Jursik,

642
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,100
died 1889.

643
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,900
His robes were
worth a fortune.

644
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,100
Let's find out if he was buried
with something silver.

645
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,400
A scepter or a shepherd's crook

646
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,000
or something else suitable
for skull cracking.

647
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
Booth kicked me out of here.

648
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,100
For you to say "kicked out"
means that you've acquiesced

649
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,700
to the idea that
this is his domain.

650
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,200
Domain, yes.

651
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,600
He's good at questioning people.

652
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,400
He can... he can tell
when they're lying.

653
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,400
Can you?

654
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,400
I've learned a lot

655
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,700
from him about people.

656
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,000
But...?

657
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,900
It's not that Booth
has a sixth sense.

658
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,600
There is demonstrably
no sixth sense to have.

659
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
Obviously, he reads

660
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,900
minutiae of body language...

661
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
pupil dilation...

662
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,100
Yes, you... you don't sound

663
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
very satisfied with your
own argument there.

664
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,300
Booth likes to say,

665
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,000
"There are more things
in heaven and earth, Bones,

666
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,000
than are dreamt of
in your science."

667
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
That's, um...
a bastardization

668
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,600
of a writer named
Shakespeare,

669
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,200
from a play called <i>Hamlet.</i>

670
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes, yes. I-I was, um...

671
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,000
I was aware of that.

672
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,200
So if you're so
uncomfortable here, why come?

673
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Because...

674
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
something goes on in here.

675
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
He does something.

676
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,000
And you want
to find out what it is.

677
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Dissect it so that you can
do it yourself.

678
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Yes.
So that

679
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,800
you can do it without Booth.

680
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
So that you won't
need him anymore.
No.

681
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
No?
No,

682
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,000
I just want to observe.

683
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,100
Surely if you want to
observe, you can do that

684
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
the other side of the
mirror there, instead of

685
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,300
insisting on being
in this room with him,

686
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,100
out of your element.

687
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,500
Observation isn't just seeing,
Dr. Wyatt.

688
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,000
It's experiencing.

689
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,700
Ideally, I'd prefer being

690
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,300
inside Booth's head...
you know, seeing

691
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,500
and feeling things
the way he does.

692
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,100
Then maybe I... I'd understand.

693
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
Be one with him?

694
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,100
In a scientific sense.

695
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Booth needs me.

696
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,900
Hodgins has a line
on the murder weapon.

697
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,900
Ta-ta, then.

698
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,300
We're done here.

699
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,300
Thanks.

700
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,300
<i>We need to know what artifacts</i>

701
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,600
were buried with Bishop Jursik.

702
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,200
You see, there was no
photograph of his burial

703
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,700
in the paperwork
that we received.

704
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Well, I'm not
allowed to pull

705
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,500
internment records
without

706
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
Father Donlan's
permission.

707
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,100
Where is she going?

708
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,200
Bones, Bones,
Bones, Bones.

709
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,900
You are approaching the altar.

710
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Very sensitive area.

711
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,300
Okay.

712
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
All right, listen,
you must have known 

713
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Father McCourt pretty well.
Did him and Father Matt

714
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,100
similar tastes?

715
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,400
Look, the only
similarity I know of was

716
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,700
that they were
from the same seminary.

717
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Same seminary?

718
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Look, Agent Booth,

719
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,300
there's so much suspicion
and innuendo these days.

720
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
This is a good parish.

721
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,100
The Father makes sure of that.
What's that?

722
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
It's the chalice.
Oh, no, it's,

723
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
it's the vessel
in which the wine

724
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,100
is transformed
into the blood of Christ.

725
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,000
Don't touch it! No.
It is going to be touched,

726
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,300
Booth, it's silver and
these little eagles

727
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
are a common Napoleonic motif.

728
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,400
You're saying
that it's, uh...

729
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,600
possible that
this could be

730
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,800
a murder weapon?
Yeah.

731
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,300
Can we take this with us
or do we need to serve

732
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,500
a warrant on God?

733
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,300
It's a match.

734
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
The silver fragments in
Father McCourt's skull

735
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,100
came from that chalice.

736
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,900
That officially
looks the least

737
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,300
like a murder weapon than
any murder weapon I've seen.

738
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
The green bone

739
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
response indicated the injury

740
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,300
was inflicted perimortem.

741
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,300
That means he might've already

742
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,900
been dead when he was struck.

743
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,200
So we have no cause of death?
Yes, we do.

744
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,600
McCourt was poisoned.

745
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,100
An alkaloid called taxin.

746
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,600
Could it have been accidental?

747
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,100
Not at these concentrations.

748
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,300
Well, I'll go compile a list
of possible sources

749
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,500
of the poison at the church.

750
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,900
So what if they went
to the same seminary?

751
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,600
Well, then why didn't
Father Matt mention it, huh?

752
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
What else is he not saying?
This is intuition, right?

753
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,700
You're subconsciously
recalling pupil dilation

754
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,100
or some pheromones?

755
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,600
You know what?
We're not talking
the same language here.

756
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,800
No, no, no.

757
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,700
That's not a Butcher.
Come here, Tony.

758
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,400
Why'd you always pick me,
Father? Take Sam.

759
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Let's go. Watch.

760
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,300
Now from here,
Tony can reach around

761
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,300
to my right arm.
He uses his left knee

762
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,700
against my left hip and...

763
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,900
Okay? Tony's in control.

764
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,500
I'm helpless. And he can score
some back points.

765
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,900
Good job, Tony.

766
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,500
Let me up.

767
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
That's the Butcher.

768
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,300
Learn it, love it.

769
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,900
Use it to smite your enemies

770
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,700
in the name of our loving Lord.

771
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Pair up. Get it right.

772
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,200
Kid took me down for real.

773
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,200
That shot must not
be working, Doc.

774
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,600
So... what can I
do for you today?

775
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,800
Yeah, Father, I...
You and Father McCourt

776
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,500
were in seminary
at the same time.
Right.

777
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,100
But I told you, I never
met Father McCourt.

778
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
What, you guys
never got together,

779
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,200
compared wrestling moves?

780
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,600
I didn't know him there.

781
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,600
Did you know everyone
who went to your college?

782
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,400
You do know why
Father McCourt was sent here.

783
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,800
Yeah, I've heard the rumors.

784
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,600
That's all.

785
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,600
Do you base all your
investigations on rumors,

786
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Agent Booth?

787
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,400
He has a point, Booth.

788
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,900
You know,
St. Agatha's has been

789
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,700
a dumping ground
for troubled priests

790
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,300
for some time, so it's
reasonable to suggest

791
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,300
that you're one of them.

792
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I told you why I was sent here.

793
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,700
I got work to do.

794
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,300
So you still think that
Father Donlan is the killer?

795
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,800
I mean, Matt...

796
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,800
could have killed McCourt
and taken his post.

797
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Why?
Because McCourt
was going to come

798
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,800
clean about being a pedophile.

799
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,800
Maybe accuse Matt, if
they knew each other.

800
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,600
Of course... there's
no evidence of that.

801
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,600
I have no intuition.

802
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
None. Zilch.
And you have no

803
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,500
analytical skills.
I mean, you're all about

804
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,200
emotion and feeling.
Well...

805
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,300
They say that means you
have a well developed
feminine side.

806
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Who? Who says that?

807
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,300
Psychologists.
Oh...

808
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,900
What? You're the one
who believes in them.

809
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,300
Let's just stick to the case.

810
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,000
We know that Father Donlan
is this harsh, judgmental guy.

811
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,700
He keeps being sent these,
uh, problematic priests.

812
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,000
There's McCourt,
there's Father Matt...
No proof.

813
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,400
Yeah, but Bones, it happens.
All right? So, anyways...

814
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,200
Father Donlan,
he's getting old,

815
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,900
he can't deal, so he
takes action.
Old Testament action?

816
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,900
All right, there you go again.
You're attacking God.

817
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,100
I'm not attacking God.
He doesn't exist.
He's not scandals, okay?

818
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Quarreling?

819
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Yes, of course you are.

820
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,600
Uh, cup of coffee,

821
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
please, Vera darling.

822
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,000
I am here to put right

823
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,500
what has been rent asunder.

824
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,900
Great. You've figured
out our problem.

825
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,500
Yes.
From three meetings?

826
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,000
I knew what your problem
was right off the bat,

827
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,200
if you'll forgive
a cricket metaphor.

828
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,200
The meetings were for fun.

829
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,900
Booth never knows where to stand

830
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,300
when he's in the lab.
Feels like

831
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
teats on a bull
whenever he's there.

832
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,600
Ditto Dr. Brennan
in the interrogation room.

833
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,000
Simple geography,
sense of belonging,

834
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
et cetera.
But that's not the main problem.

835
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,400
He can't possibly know.

836
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,500
Yes, I do.

837
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,600
You're both afraid

838
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,800
that the reason Dr. Brennan

839
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,500
with her boyfriend Sully

840
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,700
might have been because of her
ties to Agent Booth.

841
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
You are both...

842
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,000
quite wrong.

843
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,600
Why didn't I go with Sully?

844
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,900
How's he supposed to know?

845
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,100
Sully is perfect.

846
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,400
We communicated well.
The sex was incredible.

847
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,500
He invited me

848
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
to sail around
the South Seas

849
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,600
in a beautiful yac for a year.

850
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,400
I mean, why would
anyone turn that down?

851
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,200
In my opinion, you are unable

852
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,000
to lead a purposeless life

853
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,000
at this stage in your

854
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,100
psycho-social development.
Which, by the way,

855
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
is a issue you should address,

856
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
because a certain amount
of purposelessness

857
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,800
is necessary to lead
a full life.
I hate psychology.

858
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,600
You don't like it because he's
saying that all these tension

859
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,900
between me and you
is <i>your</i> fault.

860
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,300
On the contrary.

861
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,500
If anything, your issues
are more pronounced

862
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,100
given that your
behavior has been

863
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,400
affected by what turns out
to be a quite irrational

864
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,900
fear of being responsible
for somebody else's destiny.

865
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,700
That makes sense.

866
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,500
Oh, <i>now</i> you like psychology?

867
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,700
I think you'll both

868
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,100
be able to work together
just fine

869
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,500
now that your minds
have been set at ease.

870
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,900
Thank you, Vera.

871
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,600
Ta-ta.

872
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,500
You, uh... feel anything?

873
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Feel?

874
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
Yeah. You must...

875
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,600
feel something.

876
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,200
I do.

877
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,700
You know what I feel?

878
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,600
Father Matt has been
sick a long time.

879
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,200
He got treated for the fungus.

880
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,100
But he hasn't shown
any signs of recovery.

881
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,500
So?
I <i>feel</i> that's weird.

882
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,700
I mean, his symptoms
should've cleared up by now.

883
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,400
I feel that since Father
McCourt was poisoned...

884
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,300
We should have
Father Matt checked

885
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
for the same poison.

886
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,000
What?
We're back.

887
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
We're back.

888
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,800
Poisoned?

889
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,900
Yes, Father.

890
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,100
By something
called taxin.

891
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,300
Father McCourt
was poisoned?

892
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,400
Poison's easily derived from
boiling yew tree needles.

893
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,400
We have yew trees
at St. Agatha's.

894
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,100
Symptoms include
nausea, vomiting,

895
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,800
increased salivation,
stomach ache, diarrhea,

896
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,700
spasms and death.

897
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Well, I have all those,
except for death.

898
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,600
So far.

899
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We suspect the poison
weakened him,

900
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,700
made him unable
to defend himself.

901
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,100
Defend himself from whom?

902
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,700
Someone much weaker
than himself.

903
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,300
Say, an old man.

904
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,900
Yellow.

905
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yellow?
What does that mean?

906
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,300
The good news is we know how

907
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,500
to make you feel a lot better.

908
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,300
Bad news is someone's
trying to kill you.

909
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,600
So things are
all right?

910
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,300
According to the psychiatrist,
we were both concerned

911
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
that Booth was the reason
I didn't run off with Sully.

912
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,800
It wasn't?

913
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,900
No. It's because
I'm currently

914
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,700
unable to live a life
without tangible focus.

915
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,300
So, you know, sailing around
paradise with a man I adore...

916
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,600
You believe that?

917
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,100
Well, if I expect
people to defer to me

918
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
as an anthropologist,
I have to concede

919
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,200
to their fields
of expertise.

920
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,100
Right.

921
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,100
And our working relationship
has definitely improved, so...

922
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,200
Maybe I should
talk to this guy.

923
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,900
Why?

924
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,800
Hodgins asked me to move in
with him, but I'm not sure.

925
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,500
I mean, what's
the problem?

926
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,000
Hodgins is perfect.

927
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm nuts about him.

928
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,500
I'll call the doctor.

929
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,100
I'm certain that I am innocent
of whatever it is

930
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,400
you think I did this time.

931
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Can you identify

932
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
this clipping, sir?

933
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,000
 <i>Taxus baccata--</i>

934
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,500
the European or common yew.

935
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Then you're aware
that it's poisonous.

936
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Did you bring me here
to test my botanical knowledge?

937
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,700
Both Father McCourt and Father
Matt suffered yew poisoning.

938
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,900
The hell you say.

939
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,200
Is he allowed to say that?

940
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Dr. Brennan's people can prove

941
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
that the poison
from the yew tree

942
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,500
came from
your own yard.

943
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,400
Both Fathers McCourt and Sands?

944
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,300
It's why Father Matt
has been so sick.

945
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,500
Can you think of
anyone else who'd want

946
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
to poison these two priests,

947
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,500
aside from you?

948
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,100
No.

949
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,000
No one.

950
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
I'm going to need a lawyer.

951
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,500
A damn Jesuit
would be best.

952
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
Are you confessing, Father?

953
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,300
Yes. I did it.

954
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,700
What?

955
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,900
When this goes to trial,
Father...

956
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,500
you'reonna have
to place your hand

957
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,900
on the Holy Bible

958
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
and swear to God
to tell the truth.

959
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
You gonna be
able to do that?

960
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
What's going on?

961
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,500
Get me my lawyer.

962
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
See, I don't think
you will.

963
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,300
Why?

964
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,600
You didn't do it.

965
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,200
See, it's time
to render unto Caesar.

966
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,900
On one condition:

967
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
I take the confession.

968
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,200
I never set out
to kill Father McCourt.

969
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,300
You poisoned him.

970
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,400
I saw the way he looked
at James LeVay.

971
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,000
I tried to give him
just enough poison

972
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,000
to make him too sick
to want to...

973
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
But he fell
and hit his head.

974
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,900
He wasn't breathing.

975
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,800
I had to make
sure he was dead.

976
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,600
I couldn't bury him
without making sure.

977
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,100
And the heaviest thing
she could find was the chalice.

978
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,800
And Father Matt?

979
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,500
Wrestling.

980
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,700
Boys were all over him.

981
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,300
And I knew better
this time.

982
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,600
Less poison.

983
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,200
Father McCourt was
a mistake, Father. I...

984
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,900
Lorraine, there was no proof

985
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,200
that Father McCourt
touched anyone.

986
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Only rumors.

987
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,900
And Father Matt...

988
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,600
You were so angry
at Father Matt.

989
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
I see the way you look at him.

990
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Because he was sent here
to replace me.

991
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,700
What you saw was my own pride,

992
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,500
my own weakness.

993
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,800
Father Matt is a good man.

994
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,400
I was trying to help.

995
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,700
I was just trying to help.

996
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,700
Do you absolve me, Father?

997
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,000
We're not alone

998
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,300
with God, Lorraine.

999
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,000
This is not that kind
of confession.

1000
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,100
Excuse us.

1001
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,500
Dr. Wyatt.

1002
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,100
We need you to
do it with her.

1003
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,600
W-Would that I could,

1004
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,800
but unfortunately,
my heart belongs to another.

1005
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,300
No, it's actually
my... boyfriend

1006
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
asked me to move in
with him,

1007
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,400
and I need to know
if I should or not.

1008
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,400
I told her to
talk with you.

1009
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Look, I absolutely refuse
to be relegated to the role

1010
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,200
of some sort of advice columnist
or daytime television shrink.

1011
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,400
Well, Brennan says

1012
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,400
that you're the only
psychological type

1013
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,900
who's ever made
any sense to her.

1014
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,900
Yes, well, now, of course
you're flattering me,

1015
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
so obviously I'm helpless.

1016
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,900
All right,
so what made you think

1017
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,100
you should move in with him
in the first place?

1018
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,400
The closet test.

1019
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Over half of his closet
is filled with my things.

1020
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,200
I see. And what about
your own closet?

1021
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
It overfloweth
with his things, does it?

1022
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
Uh, no.

1023
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,200
It doth not.

1024
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,100
Well, then I suggest
you wait until it does,

1025
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,100
thus rendering you
manifest equals,

1026
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,100
tabling until that day
the vexed question of

1027
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,500
who should move in with whom.

1028
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,800
He is good.

1029
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,500
I told you.

1030
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,100
As a stopgap, you should remove

1031
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
enough clothing from his closet

1032
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,800
so as to occupy less than
30 percent of the space.

1033
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,500
You know, the accent makes

1034
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
everything that you say
sound really smart.

1035
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,500
"Stopgap."

1036
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
No, you're not leaving,
are you, Dr. Brennan?

1037
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,300
Booth and I have to put

1038
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,400
our notes together
for the prosecutor.

1039
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,300
So...

1040
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,500
So you and Booth, um...

1041
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,000
you making any further
assumptions about each other?

1042
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,500
No.

1043
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,800
No assumptions.

1044
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,800
Thanks.

1045
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,900
Good.

1046
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,900
Well, look at that.

1047
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,800
You fixed them, too.

1048
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,700
All right, listen up,

1049
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Monty Python.

1050
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,000
You got it right with
Hodgins and I, that's fine.

1051
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,200
But we both know that you are
full of it on the other thing.

1052
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,800
I have no idea
to what you refer.

1053
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Brennan didn't run off
with Sully

1054
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
because she cannot
live a life without focus.

1055
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,100
She stayed because of Booth.

1056
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,000
Ah, now you're projecting,
Ms. Montenegro.

1057
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,500
Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan
are not you and Dr. Hodgins.

1058
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,100
I stand by
my diagnosis.

1059
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,900
You stand by the FBI.

1060
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,500
Your first priority
is to get agents

1061
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,600
back into the field,

1062
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,000

Your romanticism is endearing,
but as the Bard says,

1064
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,500
"Lovers and madmen have such
seething brains,

1065
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
"such shaping fantasies,

1066
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,000
that apprehend more than cool
reason ever comprehends."

1067
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,400
He also says, "Journeys end
in lovers meeting,

1068
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,500
every wise man's
son doth know."

1069
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,300
Hm. Excellent.

1070
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,600
You betcha... Monty.
