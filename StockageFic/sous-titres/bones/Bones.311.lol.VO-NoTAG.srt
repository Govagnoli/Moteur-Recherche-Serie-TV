1
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:06,216
I guess there's life
on this campus after all.

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:07,682
You've been here before?

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:11,137
I guest-lectured last year,
Forensic Science Majors.

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,794
Four students showed up, just four.

5
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:15,289
Four? What was your topic?

6
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:18,224
"Dimorphic distinctions within
the human thoracic cavity."

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,504
Right, and, just four whole
people showed up?

8
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:25,761
The Dean blamed it on some game
halfway across the country.

9
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,518
This is Atlantic State University.
Home of the Jaguars.

10
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:30,773
Other than sex and beer,
nothing is more important

11
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:32,629
to these kids than
their basketball team.

12
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,311
- Yeah, what about academics?
- Tell you what, you bring your little,

13
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,771
didactic thoracic,
speech here any other time of

14
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,485
year and you'll draw maybe five,
five and a half easy.

15
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,443
"Dimorphic," not "didactic."

16
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:46,997
Student employee named Justine Berry
opened up the practice gym.

17
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:50,131
Campus Police called us, they didn't
know what to make of what they found.

18
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,172
Yeah, I got it.
FBI, Special Agent Seeley Booth.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,104
That here's, that's Dr. Brennan.

20
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:56,208
Chief Jack Cutler, Campus Police.

21
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,757
Justine was opening the gym up
after the four-day week-end.

22
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:00,106
You work here, Ms. Berry?

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,102
What the hell, you know what I mean?

24
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:03,253
Not at all.

25
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:06,279
The second I unlocked the door,
the smell just...

26
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:08,774
Right?

27
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,269
The bleachers fold down.
You need a key to open or shut them.

28
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:15,312
Whatever got caught back here,
sure as hell ain't an animal.

29
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:16,769
Whoa, whoa, "It"?

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,787
Sounds interesting.

31
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:21,155
Oh.

32
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:22,774
Hey...

33
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,546
You know, last time
I was under bleachers, I was,

34
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,384
getting ready to smoke a cigarette
and make out with Vanessa Taylor.

35
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,688
I didn't know you smoked.
Eighth grade, Bones.

36
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:33,596
Come on, didn't you ever get naughty
with a jock under the bleachers?

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,525
You were a jock?

38
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,821
You know, you had to be one if you
wanted to make out with Vanessa Taylor.

39
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,362
What is it?

40
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,493
Male.

41
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:54,697
- You smell that?
- You're kidding.

42
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:56,350
Well, I don't mean decomp.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
Alcohol.

44
00:01:57,354 --> 00:02:00,575
Vagrant passes out by the heating grate,
and somebody closes up the bleachers?

45
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,097
That would account for
the accelerated decomp.

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,794
And the babies.

47
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,268
- Baby rats?
- Yeah, we'll need them.

48
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:13,653
Okay.

49
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:16,269
Yeah, Chief Cutler
you got a rat carrier?

50
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,911
Yeah, I'll find something.

51
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:19,336
We'll need the floor.

52
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,475
The floor?

53
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:22,581
And whatever got pushed
through that grate.

54
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,719
- Here you go. This do?
- That'll be great, put

55
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:26,836
that rat in the rat motel
and we're good to go.

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,732
We need to take the pinkies
or they'll die.

57
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,849
Yeah, 'cause the world needs more rats.

58
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,819
'82 Champs?'82 Champs.
Let me see that ring.

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,444
Wait a minute.

60
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,032
Chief Cutler, as in...

61
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:40,802
Jack "Cutter" Cutler?

62
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,157
Yeah, haven't heard that one in a while.

63
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:46,662
Bones, you're looking
at the star point guardfrom

64
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,308
one of the best college
basketball teams, ever.

65
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,095
Drafted by the Detroit Pistons?

66
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,633
Knees blew out, ended my career.

67
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:56,613
- Booth?
- Yeah.

68
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,201
Eleven?

69
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,284
Oh, my God, no.

70
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:02,537
What?

71
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:05,075
- Did he wear one of these?
- He never took it off.

72
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:06,398
- Who?
- R.J. Manning,

73
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,915
he's one of the best college
forwards in the conference,

74
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,880
he was destined to be
the number one pick.

75
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:12,946
I don't know what that means,

76
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,897
but if this is Manning,
that's not going to happen.

81
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,279
Eight seconds for
the bleachers to close?

82
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,578
According to the Chief
of Campus Police.

83
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,105
I don't think the victim
was killed by the bleachers.

84
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,236
What do you mean? Dude's an accordion.

85
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,384
What killed him if it wasn't
the bleachers closing?

86
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,146
The skull shows evidence of powdering.

87
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:09,982
Crushing would snap the bone.

88
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,089
Multiple strikes lead to powdering.

89
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:14,174
But it is possible that
the skull being forced

90
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,026
through that grate caused the powdering.

91
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,100
We'll know more after
the skull is reconstructed.

92
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:21,377
Man, the Jaguars will not be the same
without R.J. Manning.

93
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,472
30 plus points in his last five games,

94
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,033
40 plus in the last three.

95
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:26,599
Oh, not you guys, too.

96
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,695
R.J. Manning was going to be
the next Kobe Bryant.

97
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:32,237
That explains why every news source
in town wants to confirm his death.

98
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,227
The ancient Greeks chased a ball made
of animal skin wrapped around seeds.

99
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,122
But that was a fertility rite
played in the nude.

100
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,774
Nude? Count me in.

101
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,642
I tend to look better fully clothed.

102
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:46,552
Both central and lateral
maxillary incisors are implants.

103
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,985
That's a match.

104
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:52,044
It's Manning.

105
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:53,731
I'll inform the press.

106
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:58,208
Zack, your priority is
to classify the skull fractures.

107
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,117
Dude, you are not going home for days.

108
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,353
The victim's clothing and
the chunk of floor

109
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,730
should keep you pretty busy,
too, Dr. Hodgins.

110
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,184
You're sure it's R.J., not just somebody
wearing his medallion?

111
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,679
We matched
your brother's dental records.

112
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,936
That means it's definitely
R.J., Kamaria.

113
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,438
Are you R.J.'s lawyer?

114
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:20,722
No, well, you could probably say that.

115
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,498
I'm... I'm, alumnus of Atlantic State.

116
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:26,623
What I do now is I volunteer my time
to help the team with their finances,

117
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,826
and their scholarships,
living arrangements.

118
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,499
Did you all live together?

119
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:34,647
No, R.J. lived on campus, but he still
takes care of me and my little sister.

120
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,548
Their parents passed away two years ago.

121
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:40,228
We lived on R.J.'s scholarship and
Mr. Francis got me a good job downtown.

122
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,163
Yeah.

123
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,655
R.J. mention any trouble
in his life lately?

124
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:44,736
Arguments?

125
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,281
Only...

126
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,419
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

127
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:50,601
He had a fight with Mr. Francis.

128
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:52,345
Why did R.J. strike you?

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,726
I don't know, he was an exhausted
20-year-old man

130
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:56,347
and I was treating him like a kid.

131
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,431
R.J. loved Mr. Francis.

132
00:05:58,712 --> 00:05:59,684
We all do.

133
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,742
You can ask R.J.'s girlfriend.

134
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,215
That's Dallas Verona,
she's a cheerleader.

135
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:06,591
Also, you know,
you should talk to Coach Morse.

136
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:09,669
Those were the two people closest
to him, other than his family.

137
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:12,882
Damn it!

138
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,923
I should have gotten a bigger turkey.

139
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,191
You have a smaller skull?

140
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:19,696
Do I have a smaller skull than whom?

141
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:24,304
I meant is there a smaller skull
we can wrap in this turkey carcass.

142
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,847
Boys, this better be good.

143
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:29,684
It's going to take me a very long time
to reconstruct R.J. Manning's skull

144
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:32,714
in order to discover whether
he died from multiple blows...

145
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:34,079
Which suggest murder.

146
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,429
... or if his skull

147
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:38,378
was crushed through the heating grate,
just like this one.

148
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,734
We covered a skull with turkey meat.

149
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:44,362
I calibrated the pounds per square inch
from the closing bleachers.

150
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,827
And we filled the skull cavity
with a gelatinous matrix.

151
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:49,288
Okay.

152
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:50,904
Turn it on.

153
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,332
By "gelatinous matrix"

154
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,660
you meant... ambrosia salad?

155
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,894
Gelatinous matrix sounded better.

156
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,904
There's absolutely no sign
of powdering here.

157
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,177
Then R.J. Manning was killed
by multiple strikes to the head.

158
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,745
I'm telling you, Gege Francis
does not care about that family.

159
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,543
- Kamaria seemed to like him.
- Sure, I mean, he paid the rent,

160
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,502
made her brother a star, bu you know,
he's got a whole nother agenda.

161
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,159
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I was a college athlete.

162
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:44,567
Guys like that, they're always
buzzing around campus.

163
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:45,658
Why?

164
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,818
Why? 'Cause there's millions
of dollars at stake.

165
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,059
- What, for bouncing a ball?
- Well, yeah.

166
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,656
All that bouncing, you know,
it translates into dollars,

167
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:55,897
from TV rights, revenue shares,
tournament fees.

168
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,649
I don't understand
what's interesting about it.

169
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,852
You know, unlike you, most people enjoy

170
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:04,283
a pastime that takes
them out of their head.

171
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,496
Takes them out of their head,
like drugs and alcohol.

172
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:11,494
Brennan.

173
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,048
Hodgins and Zack proved
that R.J. was murdered.

174
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:18,312
Murdered.

175
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:19,931
We have suffered a loss, gentlemen.

176
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:21,810
One of our brothers is gone.

177
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,423
As a team, we grieve for him.

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,777
I tell you what you do not
weep for, though.

179
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,871
Losing the best damn power
forward in this entire country.

180
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:34,600
Colby Page is not shedding tears
because we lost a power forward, is he?

181
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,652
- No, sir.
- How do I know that?

182
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,670
Because Colby Page is going to step
right up and take R.J.'s position.

183
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:43,526
This is his opportunity and it's good
that he sees it as such.

184
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:45,114
Colby.

185
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,009
Father, God,

186
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:52,305
accept our brother R.J. Manning
into your loving arms.

187
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,053
Give us the faith and
the strength to carry on.

188
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:58,894
Amen.

189
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,018
Amen.

190
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:02,453
Now, you boys go be together,
talk about R.J.

191
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:05,760
Come right back here and be ready
to carry on, and do what needs doing.

192
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,899
- Yes, Coach.
- All right, let's go!

193
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:11,830
Move it, Harris!

194
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:16,805
- Very impressive, Coach.
- You the FBI?

195
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,815
Yes, sir.

196
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,483
If you're going to talk to the boys,
I prefer you do it soon,

197
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,802
let us move on from the tragedy, okay?

198
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,017
What now?

199
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:32,659
Well,

200
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:37,045
find out which one of these pretty girls
over here is R.J.'s girlfriend.

201
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:44,018
I went home for the long weekend.

202
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:45,994
R.J. stayed on campus.

203
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,061
Why?

204
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,283
Whatever. Team stuff.

205
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,091
Did you call R.J.? Talk to him?

206
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:54,596
Yeah, and texted him.

207
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,260
But he didn't answer.

208
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,455
That's not weird, or anything.

209
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,350
R.J.'s the face-to-face kind, right?

210
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,812
Everything okay between you?

211
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,858
Were you sexually active?

212
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,468
He was my boyfriend.

213
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:09,973
He was in great shape,
so pretty active, yeah.

214
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:13,161
There're any noticeable changes
in your sex life?

215
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,073
Frequency, duration.

216
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,979
Every day became day.

217
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,420
That was RJ's modo.

218
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,790
No jealous boyfriend from the past,
angry dad, nothing?

219
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:26,015
Oh my God.

220
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,294
Mr francis is right.

221
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,483
You people think R. J was murdered.

222
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,923
Was he under any kind of stress?

223
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:37,094
Of course.

224
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:39,146
Mid-Term Exams?

225
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,906
R. J was a star.

226
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,533
They made sure he could
pass his Mid-Term.

227
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:48,205
R. J was stressed because
he always wanted to win.

228
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:50,376
Stressed enough to hit Mr Francis.

229
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,808
R. J never told me why he did that,

230
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:55,007
but he feel bad about it.

231
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:04,250
You don't find enough
tissu for a tox screen

232
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,627
cause these is this little scams
eated what's left

233
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:08,553
Yeah.

234
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,401
Hodgins is that my own personnal blender

235
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:15,718
from the kitchen?

236
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:18,723
I tossed these babies
into the au-tomatograph.

237
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,907
- Did you get it from the kitchen?
- Yes.

238
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:27,620
Any foreign substances in RJ body
should show up in the mega juice.

239
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,498
Is it labeled personnal property
of CS on the bottom?

240
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:36,273
Yes.

241
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:41,791
Don't worry I'll rince it out.

242
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:48,444
I can give you a few points Bones,

243
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,583
we doesn't get out of the
class for a few minutes.

244
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:53,082
You got sort of flip your rist, you see.

245
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,941
The sport should not have such
priority in the university.

246
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:59,144
You know what, that's crazy?

247
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,180
Anthropology speaking,

248
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:05,791
sports are way for boys
to practice their battle skills.

249
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,110
Yeah, OK.

250
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:10,742
You don't want just focus your head up,
get up on your toes, just let...

251
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:12,692
The truth is

252
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:15,865
athletes are basically,
emotionally resting in boyhood

253
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,634
acting out childish games as
they have don't importance

254
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:22,043
the only could more juvenile are

255
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:24,257
grown adult and watch sports.

256
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,171
- Why you got say stuff like that?
- Why?

257
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,577
What, you mean the truth.
All right, you know I am a jock.

258
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,990
So when you say those you know things

259
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,988
that you say, what are
you saying about me?

260
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:35,629
- Nothing, you go out of it.
- No I did not.

261
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:37,776
My shoulder crapped out on me.

262
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:40,374
Otherwise I would be gone
all away from this.

263
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,328
- What?

264
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:45,799
And another thing allright,
I fought in a war,

265
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,385
so sports is a

266
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,392
childish substitute,
I can live with that.

267
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,223
- Yo, Colby!
- Yo.

268
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,665
Yeah, yo.
I'm a little irritated with you.

269
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,318
Just leave me alone long
enough so I can get over it.

270
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,510
- Why are-you irrited?
- Because i love sports,

271
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:30,469
I watch sports, you know.
I'm all about sports.

272
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,759
Agent Seeley Booth, this is Dr. Brennan

273
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:34,801
Yeah, Mr. Francis says you talk to me.

274
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,239
Georges Francis?

275
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,511
Really? Looks up to you guys.

276
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:40,839
You must be happy
to be a stringer again.

277
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:42,281
- Starter.
- Starter.

278
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,686
Our coach said I'll be happy starting,
but unhappy by how it happen.

279
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,414
Colby didn't ask for this.

280
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:48,756
It's okay Celeste.

281
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,723
Colby is a team player,
he's stepping up.

282
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:52,700
<i>She's my fiancée, Celeste Cutler.</i>

283
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:55,281
You're engaged, you're so young.

284
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:58,264
Cutler, isn't Cutter Cutler?

285
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,249
Yeah, he's my father.

286
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,869
Your father is in law enforcement you
understand I have to ask this question.

287
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,138
Plus your boyfriend

288
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,425
and a few people
benefit directly for R. J Manning death.

289
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:10,564
I don't like you.

290
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,772
- I hate her.
- I can handle this.

291
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,514
Just go on Celeste, okay.

292
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:22,207
I'm sorry about Celeste,
she's just really...

293
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,129
Really loyal.

294
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,966
I have to ask you.

295
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,743
Where are you all along week-end?

296
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,039
I was home.

297
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,879
I hate to disagree with the coatch but

298
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,830
I don't really have
benefits from RJ's death.

299
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:35,672
It sure seems like you did.

300
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,799
Starting powerful,
that's a pretty big around here.

301
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,109
I'm not gonna replace R.J.
because I take over his position.

302
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,965
At every game people are gonna say
"Good game, son",

303
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:46,888
but in their head they're thinking,

304
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:48,924
he's not R. J Manning.

305
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,098
That's sounds like something
that I would kill to achieve.

306
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,388
Look I was happy were I was,

307
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:56,918
I'm a teen player,

308
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
not a star.

309
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:03,307
You said you were home, can anyone
verify that, your parents?

310
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:07,190
I'm not gonna answer any more
questions until I talk to Mr Francis.

311
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,479
Sorry.

312
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:15,918
Francis again.

313
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:26,444
Is Hodgins here?

314
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,256
- Nope.
- Do you know where he is?

315
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:30,326
Nope.

316
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,888
Can I leave a message for him with you?

317
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,333
- Why me?
- Are you serious?

318
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,180
Fine.

319
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,063
- I mean, you live together, right?
- No.

320
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,715
I mean, not officially.

321
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,729
We have our own places.

322
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:52,986
But you spend all your time together.

323
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:54,347
What's the message?

324
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:55,989
Tox results for R.J. Manning.

325
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,351
Negative for alcohol and sedatives.

326
00:15:58,492 --> 00:15:59,766
He reeked of Bourbon.

327
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,845
Somebody emptied a bottle on him.
More interestingly, he was on steroids.

328
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:06,517
I still haven't found an explanation for
the extra synovial fluid in the joints.

329
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:09,676
I'm not sure I can remember all this.

330
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,538
Steroids, Bourbon, synovial fluid,
what's the problem?

331
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:13,964
I draw stuff.

332
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:14,941
OK?

333
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:17,441
Fluids are not my actual
area of expertise.

334
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,037
It's Hodgins' actual area of expertise

335
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,694
and Hodgins is your area of expertise,

336
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,193
so, by my calculations,

337
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:27,301
all the areas of expertise
are overlapping perfectly.

338
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,055
It's not a problem.

339
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:30,595
I'll give it to him.

340
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,414
Thank you.

341
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,916
You know, I read your contract, Coach.

342
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,020
You get a million dollar conduct bonus
for keeping your kids here in line.

343
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:46,401
I oversee 30 healthy,
rambunctious, type-A boys.

344
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,777
I earn every penny of it.

345
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,564
Guess you'd kiss that million dollars
good-bye if R.J. Manning

346
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,529
tested positive for steroids.

347
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:54,491
R.J.?

348
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:56,659
No way.

349
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,408
Tox screen came back positive.

350
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,223
No, it doesn't make sense.

351
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,874
The better he plays,
he's worth more to the pros.

352
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:04,532
Better chance you have to,

353
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:05,947
move up to the NBA.

354
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,602
You see this?

355
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:12,001
You see this scar?

356
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,457
Brain cancer from steroids.

357
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,713
When it comes to my team,
I have zero tolerance and they know it.

358
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,336
- What do you do if you catch them?
- I sure as hell don't kill them.

359
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,939
Million dollar bonus.

360
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,478
Free ride to the NBA.

361
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:30,124
Listen, I'll tell you what.
You call my doctor.

362
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,295
I'm terminal.

363
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,831
I've got two years, tops.
The money, the career...

364
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,288
not big incentives.

365
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:46,265
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anybody about my condition.

366
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,917
I don't want sympathy.

367
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,839
I just want my boys to win this season.

368
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,145
You understand I've got
to pursue the steroid thing.

369
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:53,726
You don't need a warrant.

370
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,118
Any boy that does not submit
a urine sample is off this team.

371
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:03,642
- Not one sample shows steroid use?
- Not one.

372
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:06,377
The coach's confidence
in his boys was justified

373
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:07,867
at least as far as steroids.

374
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,207
Something else showed up?

375
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:12,350
Two of the samples came back
positive for Cefixime.

376
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:13,877
The antibiotic?

377
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,617
Most commonly used to treat gonorrhea.

378
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,062
Gonorrhea would explain the
extra synovial fluid in R.J.'s joints.

379
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,556
So R.J. plus two members
of the team had gonorrhea?

380
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:27,747
Nope, two of the urine samples
came back with not only identical

381
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,437
levels of antibiotic,

382
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:32,764
but the exact same specific gravity.

383
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:35,572
Two samples from the same player.

384
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:39,325
Yes, my guess is that
someone with gonorrhea

385
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,613
is trying to protect
someone using steroids.

386
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,892
Nice bunch of boys.

387
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,266
One of you is taking steroids and the
other one is being treated for the clap.

388
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:55,291
- Somebody tested positive for steroids?
- Thank you for your candor. Thank you.

389
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:57,263
I didn't admit anything,
I asked a question.

390
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,931
Great, the guy on steroids
would be worried about steroids,

391
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:02,610
the guy with the clap, that'd be you
Eddie, wouldn't worry.

392
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,712
Well, why worry?
It's just a shot in the ass.

393
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,067
He was guessing until
you admitted that, douche bag.

394
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:10,497
Thank you, Ed, I appreciate it.
You can leave now.

395
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,714
- Why can he leave?
- I really don't care about where

396
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,206
he's been dipping his... wick.

397
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:17,608
All right, I care about illegal
steroids. Get lost, Ed. Leave.

398
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,441
What's steroids got to do
with what happened?

399
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,904
I don't know, maybe R.J.
is just worried about the,

400
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:30,028
the side effects, you know, all the,
all the yelling and screaming,

401
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:31,876
the zits on his pretty face.

402
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:34,495
His manhood shrinking.

403
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:37,088
Maybe he just gets nervous, and
wants to confess to Coach Morse.

404
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:38,806
What, so I kill him?

405
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:40,144
That's crazy!

406
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,489
R.J. made me look good enough
to go to Europe leagues,

407
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,947
maybe even the NBA.

408
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,117
You can't even prove I'm on steroids.

409
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,396
Nah, see, I execute this warrant
to check you for steroids,

410
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:52,107
it's a paper trail, and it becomes

411
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,582
public knowledge, my friend.

412
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,075
I'd lose my eligibility.

413
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,123
Bingo.

414
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:02,079
So you tell me who provided
you with the steroids,

415
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,747
it stays between you and me.

416
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:04,987
Or, uh...

417
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:08,710
you got to pee in the cup.

418
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:10,963
Come on, man.

419
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:14,655
Oh, and this time, I'm going to have
to watch you pee in the cup.

420
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,612
I hope you don't have a bashful bladder.

421
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,740
Dr. Saroyan?

422
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,795
Yes... Angela?

423
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,228
I've been thinking about it and...

424
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:30,399
I don't think it was professional of
you to leave this file with me.

425
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,733
Really? Why is that?

426
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:34,069
I'm not Hodgins' assistant.

427
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:35,787
But you are his girlfriend.

428
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:38,615
The problem is that being
his girlfriend is a personal,

429
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,659
private thing, and this is work.

430
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:44,079
I don't think it's good to mix
the personal and work.

431
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,165
Hodgins and I are completely
separate human beings with

432
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:48,709
completely separate careers.

433
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,493
In your opinion, I crossed a line.

434
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,183
It's my opinion.

435
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:56,174
I apologize, Angela.

436
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:57,202
Thank you.

437
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:01,930
But you might be able to understand
why I was a little confused

438
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,140
because apparently

439
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,684
you're not always against bringing
your personal life to work.

440
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:10,522
Oh, my God.

441
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:13,734
'Cause what you're doing there
is extremely personal.

442
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:16,194
Extremely... personal.

443
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:19,489
I'm seeing parts of you and Hodgins
I'd rather leave to the imagination.

444
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:24,494
When did they put security cameras
in the storage area?

445
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:27,319
Who else has seen this?

446
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:30,251
So far, just me and a very
appreciative security guard.

447
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,171
My God.

448
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:32,711
Well, you've made your point.

449
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:35,047
Good. This is the only copy.

450
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,551
Do we get any points for this occurring
during lunch hour?

451
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,346
Which is, as you know, personal time.

452
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:43,680
- No.
- Fair enough.

453
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,321
I had to ask.

454
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:52,877
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

455
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:55,263
No, I know what I'm talking about.
You got to know...

456
00:21:55,383 --> 00:21:57,177
George Francis, you're under arrest

457
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,693
for providing restricted substances.

458
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,257
You said you were just going to talk.

459
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,257
Yeah, and then I saw his face,
and I got mad.

460
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:06,549
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can

461
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,581
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

462
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:11,147
So this is a pretty good time
to probably tell us

463
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:14,120
that you killed R.J. Manning, save us
all a whole hell of a lot of time.

464
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,381
Why would I kill R.J.?
Why would I kill the golden goose?

465
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,371
But he wasn't a goose, he was a man.

466
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:21,980
He give you steroids, too, Colby?

467
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,945
No! He was just trying to get me
into free student housing.

468
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:28,025
Hey, Colby, tell Cutler, okay?
Just tell him what's going on.

469
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:35,528
He was with Colby?

470
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,085
Colby's like a son to me.

471
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,114
Well, he's about
to become my son-in-law.

472
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:45,283
You don't care that Colby's
not a star like R.J.?

473
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,567
As a man, sure, I'd rather
be R.J. Manning, but as a father,

474
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,665
Colby will make a much better
husband to my daughter.

475
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,208
Was it worth it?

476
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:54,668
You walk like a man

477
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:57,796
decades older than you are.
You never got to play in the pros.

478
00:22:58,238 --> 00:23:01,299
Your wife left you because you didn't
turn out to be the star she married.

479
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,052
It's not like I was a lot of fun
to be around when the cheering stopped.

480
00:23:04,212 --> 00:23:06,128
You two don't pull any punches, do you?

481
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,349
I'll tell you what else I know?
You'd do it all again, bud.

482
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,601
That doesn't make any sense.

483
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:14,490
Jocks.

484
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,753
You understand each other,

485
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,443
but your priorities
are completely skewed.

486
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:21,065
Ignore Dr. Brennan, okay?

487
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,072
She's unreasonable on the subject.

488
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,823
He won't admit to the steroid thing.

489
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,533
- Plan B?
- Plan B.

490
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:28,341
- What's Plan B?
- Convince him

491
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:31,371
if he doesn't admit to the steroid
thing, then he's confessing the murder.

492
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,917
We, uh, jocks...
we'll take care of this one.

493
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,178
I'm looking at a cockroach's leg?

494
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:46,636
Technical term is tarsus.

495
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,548
Are they usually blue like that?

496
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,969
No. He stepped
in an amalgam of fats,

497
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:54,561
waxes, oil and calcium dye.

498
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:57,384
Lipstick.

499
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,300
R.J. Manning wore blue...

500
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:03,396
lipstick?

501
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:06,246
The lipstick wasn't
found on his... lips.

502
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:09,451
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, thank you.

503
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:11,828
- Are you certain?
- Yes, Dr. Hodgins.

504
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,722
- Angela?
- Yeah?

505
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:35,602
You know... this is pretty good.

506
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:38,188
I mean, usually with these
things you think, "God...

507
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:41,178
more yoga, less carbs,"
you know, but...

508
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,859
this ain't bad.

509
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:45,378
You might want to...

510
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,358
turn the volume down.

511
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:49,605
Yeah. Thanks.

512
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:54,538
You're going to believe some kid
taking steroids over the best

513
00:24:54,699 --> 00:24:56,505
- friend this college ever had?
- Of course.

514
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,616
Why?

515
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:59,985
Because, George, if you and R.J.
argued about steroids

516
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:03,964
say he wanted more and you were saying
no, that would explain why he hit you.

517
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:06,341
Yeah, you know, 'roid rage.

518
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:09,481
I never provided steroids to anybody.

519
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:11,361
You know what I gotta do here, right?

520
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,026
Let me reason with him more time.

521
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,864
Here's what's going to happen, George.

522
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,349
If you don't admit to
providing the steroids,

523
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:20,377
Agent Booth is going to arrest you

524
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:22,054
for murder.

525
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,687
- That's ridicous.
- Really?

526
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:26,748
- 'Cause you got a great motive.
- What motive?

527
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,369
R.J. Manning admitted to you
that he was going to fess up

528
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,681
to Coach Morse that he was on 'roids.

529
00:25:32,373 --> 00:25:33,690
You panicked and killed him.

530
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:35,731
Now, who's going to fall for this?

531
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:36,895
The grand jury.

532
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,670
R.J. hitting me had nothing
to do with steroids.

533
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:46,136
Agent Booth needs more than
your assurance on that, George.

534
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:51,378
All right.

535
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:55,445
R.J. and I had a deal,
and he wanted to break that deal.

536
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,712
You signed him up, didn't you?

537
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,618
Illegal as hell,
but George had R.J. sign

538
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:03,037
with him for representation
into the NBA.

539
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,829
NBA salary, merchandising rights,
signature shoe...

540
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:09,269
and R.J. wanted out, right?

541
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,580
Cars, apartment,
providing for his family!

542
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,819
I deserve a little return
on my investment.

543
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,850
Was R.J. the only one that
you had a deal with?

544
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:17,966
Who else? Colby?

545
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,726
Colby's a nice kid,
but he's never going pro, Cutter.

546
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:23,426
Now, I didn't kill R.J. Manning.

547
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:25,186
There's no point to it.

548
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:27,087
I had a legally binding
contract with him.

549
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,373
You rat bastard!

550
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:31,447
If you don't arrest him
for that 'roid thing, I will, okay?

551
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,336
All right, I got him, I got him,
I will, I will, I got it.

552
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:46,669
This is saliva I found
in Manning's shorts.

553
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,676
I also found pre-seminal fluid.

554
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,177
Well, what does that mean?

555
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:52,916
Are you serious?

556
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:57,502
I know it means he had an erection,
but what does the erection mean?

557
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,456
That he was sexually stimulated.

558
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,979
Well, I know that.

559
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:03,712
Healthy post adolescent males
experience 11

560
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:05,942
to 20 erections every day.

561
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:09,161
Any number of which produce
pre-seminal fluid.

562
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,451
Yes, but do those erections
produce saliva?

563
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:12,725
No.

564
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,032
Cam's a doctor, honey.

565
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:16,100
That was an amusing
rhetorical question.

566
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:19,753
Zack also found this
in the victim's hair.

567
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:21,671
- What? Semen?
- No.

568
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,529
Esophageal mucus,
commonly known as a loogie.

569
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,119
Someone spat at the victim?

570
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:28,327
Should I paint you a picture?

571
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:29,289
No.

572
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:32,736
Traces of pre-seminal fluid
and saliva

573
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:34,266
inside the basketball shorts

574
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,336
suggest...

575
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:38,404
oral sex during which
the victim did not ejaculate.

576
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:41,113
Or perhaps he was killed
before ejaculation.

577
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:44,512
I don't want to get graphic or anything,
but wouldn't it be difficult

578
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:48,469
to simultaneously bash someone's
head in while servicing them?

579
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,162
Talk about multitasking.

580
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:53,269
Which means there might have
been a witness to this murder.

581
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:55,091
According to a cockroach I know,

582
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:57,219
she might have been
wearing blue lipstick.

583
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:03,373
We have been assuming that the victim
was conked on the head and

584
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,192
then dragged under
the bleachers and compressed.

585
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:07,208
I see.

586
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:09,091
Two people involved,
victim and murderer.

587
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:10,173
I see.

588
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:13,235
But now, we could have
a three-person situation.

589
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:14,333
I see.

590
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:16,131
Victim, murderer and...

591
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,372
victim's special friend.

592
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:20,800
And you need what from me?

593
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:23,560
Any information you might have
that could lead us to either

594
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:25,650
the special friend or the murderer.

595
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:29,498
You might be interested in
these crystalline deposits.

596
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:32,546
What is that?

597
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:35,109
Bacteria crystallized postmortem.

598
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:37,023
Gonorrhea bacteria?

599
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:40,732
And we're back to R.J.'s special friend.

600
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,804
If only we could figure out who she is.

601
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:45,521
You might want to ask Edward Dekker.

602
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,628
This is from R.J. Manning.

603
00:28:48,564 --> 00:28:49,569
And this...

604
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:51,431
is from Edward Dekker.

605
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:52,615
Same strain.

606
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,152
The members of this team are very close.

607
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:00,691
You know, you could wait
outside, Bones, you know that.

608
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,996
Are you still angry with me for saying

609
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:05,163
that athletes are emotionally stunted?

610
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:07,111
No, of course not.

611
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:08,267
Where is he? Hey.

612
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:09,537
Hey. Hey.

613
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,332
Can I talk to you, Ed, for a second?

614
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,755
All I did was pee in a
cup for Jimmy Fields.

615
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:19,055
All of a sudden, it's a federal case?

616
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:20,481
Turns out, he has the clap.

617
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:21,874
Exact same strain as you.

618
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:22,836
Wait.

619
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:24,763
You think I had sex with R.J.?

620
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:28,998
- I don't know. Did you?
- No!

621
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:30,996
Then why did you bring it up?

622
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,299
You brought it up.

623
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,284
All I did was pee in a cup.

624
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,442
Why?

625
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:38,121
Because Jimmy's a teammate,
and he asked me to.

626
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:40,039
I would have done it for any of my bros.

627
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,799
How did this boy get into college?

628
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,941
Basketball.

629
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,875
You know, I don't think
I can be discussing

630
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,776
sexual topics with her looking at me.

631
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,630
- Why?
- Because...

632
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:50,604
you're hot, and I'm naked.

633
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,911
Maybe you should
just go stand over there.

634
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:56,323
What, because he's shy?

635
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,479
Look, maybe you didn't notice,
but, I got no reason to be shy.

636
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,731
Obviously, he can't concentrate,
so either cover your eyes,

637
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:05,264
or stand over there.

638
00:30:11,023 --> 00:30:12,070
I'll just...

639
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,389
I'll be right here.

640
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,114
Man, she's smokin'.

641
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:21,376
All right, now Ed, I need to know

642
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:23,337
if you and R.J. had sex
with the same girl.

643
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:24,969
Definitely.

644
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,740
Okay. Who?

645
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,612
I don't know.

646
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,030
You don't know?

647
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:34,838
Look, there are girls who like to
have sex with basketball players.

648
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,253
B-Bunnies.

649
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:38,353
B-Bunnies, right, yeah.

650
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,568
Yeah.

651
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:43,587
Look, I'm not saying me and R.J.
ever crossed swords or anything, but...

652
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:47,192
we were definitely
taking shots at the same hoops.

653
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:48,887
Right.

654
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:51,201
You wear condoms?

655
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,892
- Always, yeah.
- You got the clap.

656
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,789
Right.

657
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:58,564
So who didn't you wear a condom with?

658
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,742
Attaboy.

659
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,675
Now you're using your whole brain.

660
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:05,090
Come on.

661
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,670
All right, look, look, I got
a name in my head, okay?

662
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:11,129
But there is no way
R.J. Manning ever tapped that.

663
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,571
The name, Ed. I need the name.

664
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:17,956
My poli-sci tutor, Justine.

665
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,587
Hot not.

666
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:25,609
All the bad decisions you made,
and the one thing you're ashamed of

667
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,578
is having sex with a not-hot girl?

668
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,825
What are you doing?

669
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:32,271
What?

670
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:36,409
I know I have gonorrhea.

671
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:38,330
I'm being treated for it.

672
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:40,723
Okay, well, where'd you get it?

673
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:43,824
They asked me the same
thing in Health Services.

674
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,958
Could have been a couple of places.

675
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:48,677
You are a smart girl.
Why didn't you wear a condom?

676
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,064
I do... most of the time.

677
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,935
You know what? I made a mistake.

678
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,952
She's not a smart girl.

679
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,482
This is a terrible university.

680
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,829
Do you ever wear bright blue lipstick?

681
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:03,923
Why? Is there some kind of link
between the clap and blue lipstick?

682
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,764
Let's discuss Ed Dekker.

683
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:09,882
Okay, yes.

684
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:12,230
I gave gonorrhea to Dekker.

685
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:14,066
Are you going to arrest me?

686
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:17,125
We know that R.J. Manning
had the exact same strain.

687
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:19,122
Did you give it to him, too?

688
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:23,194
I mean, do you have some sort of
hate-on for the entire basketball team?

689
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:27,055
R.J. gave it to me.

690
00:32:28,566 --> 00:32:30,056
Then, he wouldn't even talk to me.

691
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:34,305
So I gave it to Ed Dekker for revenge.

692
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:36,313
Poetic, you know?

693
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:39,051
Let R.J. know I was still alive.

694
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:45,338
Those guys all talk,
compare their conquests.

695
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,304
You have a key to the bleachers.

696
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,451
I didn't kill R.J. I'm not that nuts.

697
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,331
We need a sample of your DNA.

698
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:57,861
Why?

699
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:02,080
Because just before he was killed,
R.J. was having sex with someone

700
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:04,230
who may have seen his murderer.

701
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:10,906
You've got my snot, my tears...

702
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:12,904
and my hair...

703
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:14,491
knock yourself out.

704
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:20,151
I don't understand.

705
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,952
R.J. Manning broke her heart
but even brain, this bastard.

706
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:35,394
Justine Berry is not the one who
left her saliva or her lipstick

707
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:37,328
on the victim's privates.

708
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,872
Okay, I'll help, but I do not want to be
known as the makeup expert around here.

709
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:42,384
You found blue lipstick.

710
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:44,965
<i>Shock-Rah by Zensual.</i>

711
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:46,975
"Zen" plus "sensual."

712
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,319
Chakra.

713
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,799
<i>Shock-Rah.</i>

714
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:51,453
Rah as in "rah-rah,"

715
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:52,974
as in "rah-rah, sis-boom-bah."

716
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,661
You started off in English,
but I have no idea where you ended up.

717
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:59,071
This is a promotional line marketed
specifically to high school and college

718
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,944
cheering squads, tailored
to their team colors.

719
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,699
Ah, Atlantic State Jaguars.

720
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,911
R.J. Manning was under
those bleachers getting lipsticked

721
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,220
by a cheerleader.

722
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:52,135
- Do you know why we're doing this?
- I can guess.

723
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,629
We found evidence
that one of the cheerleaders

724
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:57,204
might have been with R.J.

725
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,759
before he died.

726
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,720
Sexually.

727
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,775
I know what "been with" means.

728
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,315
You know, the DNA will,
uh, tell us if it was you.

729
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:07,567
It wasn't.

730
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,236
Why isn't she upset?

731
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,342
Oh, please.

732
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:14,260
Oh, I get it.

733
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,535
You think because R.J.

734
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,995
compulsively played around, I might have
lured him to his death or something?

735
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,080
She's smart.

736
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,708
Do you want to pick out anyone
in particular here?

737
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:26,974
Did you see R.J.?

738
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,202
Before he was dead, I mean?

739
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,459
He was a very good-looking guy.

740
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,258
You factor in his sex drive
and how he played,

741
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:36,220
half these girls have done him.

742
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,456
Hell, he even did the towel girl.

743
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:40,714
Do you know about Justine Berry?

744
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,510
R.J. liked girls.

745
00:35:43,993 --> 00:35:45,530
All kinds of girls.

746
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,315
I'm just one kind.

747
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:50,409
Which kind is that?

748
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:52,027
The permanent kind.

749
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,113
You planned to live like that?

750
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,261
R.J. came home to me.

751
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:59,176
That's the way it would have stayed.

752
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:01,543
From his crappy student apartment

753
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:04,165
to the giant mansion
he would have gotten.

754
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:12,770
Is she crying because she loved him
or because she lost a mansion?

755
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:21,040
She made the decision
to hang on to him by

756
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:24,020
letting him have sex
with any other woman he wanted.

757
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,409
That sounds extremely rational.

758
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:28,110
That's what's confusing.

759
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:30,911
Well done.

760
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:33,898
The idea that one person can
be all things to another person,

761
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:36,782
satisfy every need
or even more than one,

762
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:39,820
is sentimental and mawkish.

763
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,453
There are indentations here.

764
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,159
Alphanumeric.

765
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:49,919
"Z" and "S"?

766
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:52,629
It's an imprint, it's backwards.

767
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:55,591
The numerals two and five?

768
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:56,968
Twenty-five.

769
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:00,638
25 pounds.

770
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,724
An imprint from free weights.

771
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:10,528
Our unknown female either meets
or lures R.J.

772
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:12,119
- under the bleachers.
- Lures?

773
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,079
We're pretty sure the girl didn't
actually kill R.J., but that...

774
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,712
doesn't mean that she wasn't bait.

775
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:18,981
I got something.

776
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:20,241
Blood splatter.

777
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:22,660
It was wiped, but it's definite.

778
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,371
Looks like we have our murder weapon.

779
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:31,173
DNA evidence is in. The blood
on the weight is definitely R.J.'s.

780
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:33,546
What about the saliva and the sputum?

781
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,923
- The loogie.
- Oh, I know about loogies.

782
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:37,380
Two things about the saliva:

783
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,219
one, is that it did not come from the
same person who provided the loogie.

784
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:42,733
So the person who serviced R.J.

785
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:44,519
is not the same person who spat on him.

786
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,325
Two: we got a partial match on the
saliva from one of the cheerleaders.

787
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,286
Celeste Cutler.

788
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,008
You think Colby and I plotted
to kill R.J. Manning?

789
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:56,745
Celeste, you lured R.J.

790
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:00,128
Manning under the bleachers
and you kept him busy.

791
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:01,728
Kept him busy how?

792
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,327
Evidence shows she was performing
oral sex on him.

793
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:06,954
Which gave you time to bash his head in.

794
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,722
But you made one mistake.

795
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:09,696
One.

796
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,626
I haven't done anything.

797
00:38:11,786 --> 00:38:15,338
We will match this DNA
to the sputum found at the scene.

798
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,801
- What?
- You hawked a loogie on him, kid.

799
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,592
You killed him and you spat on his face.

800
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,596
Look, God as my witness,
that never happened.

801
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:28,017
Sorry to interrupt, but you really
need to see this.

802
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:35,066
- Complete profile?
- All 13 STRs.

803
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:36,554
Thanks.

804
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:40,314
We got a hit on CODIS
from the DNA on the...

805
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:42,928
hawked loogie.

806
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:02,708
Hey, Chief.

807
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:06,889
If I hadn't spat on that son of a bitch,
you never would have caught me, right?

808
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:08,933
Celeste might have told us.

809
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:11,310
She doesn't know.

810
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:14,106
I came in and...

811
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:17,190
... saw my little girl...

812
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:19,777
saw her with R.J.,

813
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:22,815
doing what she was doing.

814
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,117
She heard me and took off.

815
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:29,084
None of the girls could resist R.J.

816
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:32,228
Kid had it all.

817
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,231
Magic boy.

818
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:39,130
You know what else he had?

819
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:40,965
The clap.

820
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:45,238
And he knew that when he took
my daughter underneath those...

821
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,038
He's got a gun, Bones.

822
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:51,600
I need you to leave now.

823
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:54,062
Don't worry.

824
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:56,314
It's not you I intend to shoot.

825
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:02,570
There's no way Cutter
Cutler kills himself.

826
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,794
No way Cutter Cutler goes
down without a fight.

827
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:07,020
What are you doing?
Do you want him to shoot at you?

828
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,940
Go.

829
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,449
I was just like him, you know?

830
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,173
Under these same bleachers, in fact.

831
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:25,221
I was as bad as him.

832
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:28,714
You wouldn't understand.

833
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,141
We were all like that.

834
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:34,426
It changes your life view.

835
00:40:34,546 --> 00:40:35,916
You see your little girl...

836
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,441
It's a different perspective.

837
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:42,748
People are going to understand

838
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,778
the action that you took, okay?

839
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,834
I do.

840
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:47,773
Man, you're Cutter Cutler.

841
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:50,632
Lowest assist and turnover ratios.

842
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,940
12 triple doubles in your last season.

843
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,001
Nobody could change direction in the
open court like you, man, nobody.

844
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:00,311
No.

845
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:05,286
Do it now.
Just change direction again.

846
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:17,391
Cutter Cutler died...

847
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:19,696
a long time ago.

848
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,426
I'm just putting him away.

849
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,577
Your hand hurt?

850
00:42:06,697 --> 00:42:07,649
A little.

851
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:11,125
So, jock mentality, teams,

852
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,545
not all bad, huh?

853
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:14,410
Why are you telling me this?

854
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,466
'Cause you said we're all
stunted adolescents

855
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:18,487
who take children's games too seriously.

856
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,562
I never meant you.

857
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:24,253
What?

858
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:26,024
I'm one of those guys.

859
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:27,965
No, you aren't.

860
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,860
You don't play at being a warrior.

861
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,879
You are a warrior, every day.

862
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:34,344
You're definitely...

863
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:37,222
a fully developed man.

864
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:44,899
Okay, okay. You leave the tip.

865
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:49,487
Even Cutler knew you were lying when
you said you treated women like that

866
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,614
- beneath the bleachers.
- And you believe him?

867
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:55,299
Yes, because you still remember
that first girl's name.

868
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:04,938
Let's go.
