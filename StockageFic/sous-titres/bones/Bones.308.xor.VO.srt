1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,544
Traffic?

2
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,668
Dr. Brennan looked a little
hurt when I told her

3
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,044
you asked me to come out
here instead of her.

4
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,102
No, Bones' feelings,
they don't get hurt.

5
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:22,801
- She's not like you.
- Like me?

6
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:24,004
A girl.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,425
Yeah, the word you're looking
for would be "woman,"

8
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:28,335
who, incidentally, makes
more money than you.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,748
- Touchy.
- What can I say?

10
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:32,259
- I'm just a girl with feelings.
- Listen, construction crew

11
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:35,091
they found the body this afternoon.
Key word here is "body."

12
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,505
As in still meaty.

13
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:42,433
Male, middle-aged.

14
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:45,455
Bones, she usually...
kneels next to the remains.

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,013
These are designer pants.

16
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:50,076
And my bodies are always so
much gushier than Dr. Brennan's.

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,524
I'm just saying.

18
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,329
Looks like a stab wound
to the middle of the chest.

19
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,464
Naked, wrapped in plastic.

20
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:01,547
Bite marks to the face and extremities.

21
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:02,663
Looks like rats.

22
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:03,941
Rats.

23
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:09,583
Looks like he might have been
kneecapped? Mob thing, maybe?

24
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,574
What's that?

25
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,854
Some kind of gem stone.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,132
This blow through the sternum
would have been fatal.

27
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:24,890
Dealt by a double-edged blade.

28
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,666
So we know our killer is strong.

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,455
Based on the rate of decomp,
I'd say he's been dead three days.

30
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,203
- Probably dumped Friday night.
- The gem stone is jade.

31
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:35,461
- I'm narrowing down the exact type now.
- Grit from the wounds.

32
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:37,732
Hey, grit to you, open book to me.

33
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:41,569
The injuries to the knees aren't
from baseball bats or bullets.

34
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:42,675
Zack is right.

35
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:45,449
The victim's patellas were
removed surgically.

36
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:46,772
King of the Lab.

37
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:08,545
Dr. Brennan?

38
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:09,891
Yes?

39
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,290
Amy Hollister.

40
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,788
I'm your brother's girlfriend?

41
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:16,232
Of course. Please come in.

42
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,739
Would you like something to drink?

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,529
No, no, I-I'm sorry, I...

44
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,814
I don't have a lot of time.

45
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,408
Do you know where Russ is?

46
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:30,619
Amy, I haven't seen Russ in months.

47
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:39,683
I have two little girls, well,
you know, and...

48
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:44,122
The youngest one,
that's Hayley, she's not doing too good.

49
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:46,437
Cystic fibrosis.

50
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:50,094
Russ mentioned that
she had lung problems.

51
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:52,911
Well, her breathing's real bad

52
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,786
and... now her liver.

53
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:57,976
And... she keeps asking for Russ.

54
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,626
I'm...

55
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,080
going to give you the...

56
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,642
phone number of Dr. Leo Goetz.

57
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:11,457
He's the premiere authority on
cystic fibrosis in the country.

58
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,040
I can't afford that.

59
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,494
Oh, no, Amy... Leo and I are friends.

60
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,088
He'd do it for me as a favor, no charge.

61
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:24,633
I'm going to give him a call,
tell him to expect you.

62
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:26,156
I... I don't know what to say.

63
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,421
- Thank you.
- And as for Russ...

64
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:31,123
I think you're be better off
talking to Dad.

65
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:33,048
I understand.

66
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,216
Thank you for your time.

67
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:17,516
The knees.

68

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,556
You human kneecaps in the mail?

73
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:53,421
That is like ugh.

74
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,045
Zack says they match our victim.

75
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,970
Look, we're dusting
the envelope for prints.

76
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,805
It was sent somewhere
from the D.C. area.

77
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:01,031
- These patellas are unusually worn.
- Worn from what?

78
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:04,016
It's hard to say definitively, but I'd
say the man did a lot of kneeling.

79
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,212
Wait a minute, I've seen that before.

80
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:07,769
That symbol looks familiar.

81
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,324
Like it's from some kind of seal.

82
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,872
Hey, look, Bones, you are gonna,
you know, stay with a friend,

83
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:14,082
- check into a hotel, right?
- She can stay with me.

84
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,416
Great. Thank you. No. Why?

85
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:18,155
Mr. Kneecaps has your home address.

86
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,275
I can't freak out every time
somebody Googles me.

87
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:21,644
Cam? She goes nowhere alone.

88
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:25,337
- Cam? Don't listen to him.
- Who are you more afraid of, me or her?

89
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:30,171
So this is what it's like to be
a kindergarten teacher.

90
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,683
Fascinating interpersonal interaction.

91
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:33,910
Dr. Sweets.

92
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,221
I...

93
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,907
Oh, my...

94
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:39,206
that is gross.
Yeah, it's an autopsy room.

95
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,559
It's no place for therapists.
What do you want?

96
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:44,326
You and Dr. Brennan missed
our session this morning.

97
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:47,973
Maybe because somebody sent
body parts to Bones in the mail.

98
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,980
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,299
I've identified the murder weapon.

100
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,442
Oh, that was quick.

101
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,224
Tapered inch and a half wide
with both a hilt and a quillon.

102
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,284
The cannelure is also quite distinctive.

103
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:00,494
That's the Gormogon knife.

104
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
The serial killer?

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,877
Which is why the symbol
looked so familiar.

106
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:07,854
I've seen it on a tapestry in the vault.

107
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,549
So this is the famous bank vault where
the violinist was murdered and eaten?

108
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:16,222
We transported everything from the
bank here to the Jeffersonian.

109
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:20,061
So, if you touch anything, Sweets, you
put it back exactly the way it was.

110
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,412
Oh, awesome.

111
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,114
The Widow's Son sculpture.

112
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:26,517
It's complete silver skeleton which
is replaced piece by piece

113
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,923
with the bones from murder victims.

114
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,814
Then all of the relics,
including that skeleton,

115
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,980
can be traced to the Gormogons.

116
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:39,031
A 17th century anti-Masonic group.
Supposed to be extinct.

117
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:40,795
How many victims?

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,262
Oh, the statue contains
the bones of at least five

119
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:46,781
five unidentified victims
plus the violinist.

120
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,593
That is the actual violinist's pinky.

121
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:53,366
Well, obviously Gormogon sent you
his kneecaps to continue his work.

122
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:56,306
We are not fitting those
kneecaps onto this skeleton.

123
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:59,629
Mark my words: you'll find something
special about those kneecaps.

124
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,524
Okay, this tapestry here is off somehow.

125
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:04,509
Off?

126
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:09,241
Don't look at me. My idea of art is
a half-naked woman on the side of a van.

127
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,151
That's interesting.

128
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:15,354
No, it's not interesting, Sweets,
because it was a joke.

129
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,289
Okay, what's the matter?

130
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,625
Russ's girlfriend, Amy, came to see me.

131
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,555
Her daughter's sick.
She's looking for Russ.

132
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,495
I told her that my dad might
know where he is.

133
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:33,257
Your brother is a wanted fugitive,
he's a material witness in your

134
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:35,172
- Dad's murder trial.
- Amy knows that.

135
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,718
He's not gonna come back just because
your niece has a cough.

136
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,884
Technically, she's not my niece
and it's not a cough.

137
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,132
It's cystic fibrosis.

138
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:45,142
Missing persons sent over dental
records from middle-aged men.

139
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:46,704
I checked them against the victim.

140
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,127
- You get a hit?
- Father Douglas Cooper.

141
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:52,313
Vicar General to the Archbishop
of Washington D. C.

142
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,824
Okay, Sweets was right
about the kneecaps.

143
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,164
This guy would have been
a world-class kneeler.

144
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:59,998
Saying that someone is a whiz at
psychology is like saying they're

145
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,498
good at mind reading.
It's a series of lucky guesses.

146
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,152
I'm bringing Sweets in on the case.

147
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:07,395
- You make fun of him all the time.
- Only when he messes with our heads.

148
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,809
He was right about the knees.

149
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,109
Zack, shouldn't you be figuring out what
was used to excise the kneecaps?

150
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,387
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

151
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,538
What?

152
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:16,966
You just dismissed Zack.

153
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:18,470
No, I didn't.

154
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:21,538
Oh, don't get me wrong, I, I liked it.

155
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,455
Thank you for coming in,
Archbishop Wallace.

156
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,425
You found my Vicar General?

157
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:27,871
Yes, your Holiness.

158
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,357
Monsignor.

159
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:30,749
Or Steve.

160
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,172
So, how did Doug die?

161
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,867
- Well, Steve...
- Bones!

162
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,338
- He said to call him Steve.
- Monsignor.

163
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,767
Father Cooper was stabbed to death.

164
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:43,534
As a part of a series of
cannibalistic murders.

165
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,963
A series of cannibalistic murders?

166
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,618
We're still trying to find out
what they have in common.

167
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:55,129
Doug Cooper was a, a quiet man.

168
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,403
He'd been on sabbatical for
the past six months.

169
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,076
- He was writing a book.
- About?

170
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,618
The history of early Christianity.

171
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:02,185
Its ties to paganism.

172
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,565
Esoteric stuff.

173
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,117
Somebody ate Doug?

174
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,693
Just a part of him.

175
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:12,643
A lovely, decent man,

176
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:16,643
humble, dedicated to serving others.

177
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:21,031
Unfortunate choice of words,
given that someone ate him.

178
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,627
Just a part of him.

179
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,362
There's too much evil in the world.

180
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,016
God forgive me, but...

181
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:31,080
sometimes I wonder if I'm little
more than a Band-Aid.

182
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,951
Amen, Monsignor. Amen.

183
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:34,380
Thanks, Steve.

184
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:40,733
Angela identified the red-haired
figure on the tapestry.

185
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:41,793
Barabbas.

186
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:45,447
A murder and rapist who was condemned to
death in New Testament Jerusalem.

187
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:48,139
The Gormogons believed that the
descendents of Barabbas

188
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,146
started the first secret societies.

189
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:54,387
To the Gormogons, Barabbas is an
enduring symbol of all that is backwards

190
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:56,289
upside-down, or inside out.

191
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:59,342
So if you find his figure on
a Gormogon relic...

192
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,865
It's a sign to interpret it backwards
or in a mirror or upside-down.

193
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,477
The numbers on the tapestry
are a simple alpha-numeric code.

194
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,680
Each number corresponds with a letter.

195
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,861
Civitas capitolium.

196
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,425
Which means "Capitol City."

197
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:15,692
D. C. was laid out
according to Masonic symbols.

198
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,992
Now, notice the Pentagram here
over the White House?

199
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,865
And you see the compass and the square.

200
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:23,161
The point of the compass is over
the U. S. Capitol building.

201
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,778
But here's where Angela's Barabbas
thing really kicks in.

202
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:30,063
The presence of Barabbas on this means
backwards and upside-down.

203
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:34,868
When the compass is inverted, it points
to some very interesting landmarks.

204
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:37,196
The bank... where we found the vault.

205
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:39,903
The place where Father Cooper's
body was dumped.

206
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:43,580
The highway overpass off of which
Gavin Nichols's head was thrown.

207
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:44,904
What's there?

208
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,216
It's an old mansion that's
now a nursing home.

209
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,148
And this... falls very precisely...

210
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:53,990
- What's that?
- A mausoleum at Silver Hill Cemetery.

211
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:55,314
You want to look inside?

212
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:56,697
Hell, yeah, I do.

213
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,712
This mausoleum is abandonned
here since the 1800.

214
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,923
It's paid for by a trust.

215
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,118
As far as the Director of
the Cemetery knows,

216
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:07,781
- no one's been out here for a century.
- This better be good.

217
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:09,486
Look, "Pater Mortvvs."

218
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:10,900
That means dead father.

219
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,201
You know Latin?

220
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,389
Dude.

221
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:14,742
Alter boy.

222
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:19,968
You got a key?

223
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:21,577
Yeah, brought my own.

224
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,156
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

225
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,118
What?

226
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:26,433
- Can I do it?
- No.

227
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,004
You don't let me play with your bugs.

228
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,284
Ah, great.

229
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,033
Another one.

230
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,659
this one's completely made of bone.

231
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:01,458
Hi.

232
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,849
How's Hayley doing?

233
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,985
Dr. Goetz is a Godsend.

234
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,827
I don't know how to thank you.

235
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,624
Oh, Hayley, sweetie, that's Dr. Brennan.

236
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,120
Temperance.

237
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,744
Another doctor?

238
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,435
Oh, not that kind.

239
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,307
Temperance is Russ's sister.

240
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:23,630
Couldn't you call him and tell
him to come home?

241
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,149
It's complicated.

242
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:27,307
Here, eat your Jell-O, sweetie.

243
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,126
I tried to get into
the jail to see your father.

244
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,991
They wouldn't let me in.
They said I'm not a relative.

245
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,720
Amy, Russ is a fugitive.

246
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,339
The minute he comes back to D. C.,
they'll toss him in jail.

247
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,888
Well, how would anyone know?

248
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,362
Well, I work with the FBI.

249
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:45,106
You don't have to be in this.

250
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,039
All you have to do is ask your father
to get a message to Russ.

251
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,813
You look my baby in the face

252
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:57,100
and tell her she can't see her father
because you're mad at yours.

253
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:06,811
What have we got?

254
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:11,338
So far, I've identified 18 different
victims, and I'm not done.

255
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,838
All bones show cannibalism indicators.

256
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:17,251
This tibia appears
to be over 50 years old.

257
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,161
You mean the victim's over 50?

258
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,412
What I mean is, the victim was
killed over 50 years ago.

259
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,479
That would suggest that Gormogon's,
what, a- a minimum of 70 years old?

260
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:31,963
The teeth marks on this bone
do not match Gormogon's teeth.

261
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,670
My God.

262
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:36,515
We have another cannibal out there?
An old one?

263
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:40,313
The gemstone you found in Father
Cooper's chest is violet jade.

264
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:42,003
The dirt contains sepiolite.

265
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:43,914
And we're happy about this because?

266
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,779
Both violet jade and sepiolite are found
only in a certain region of Turkey.

267
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,230
The Anatolia region, to be exact.

268
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,719
Legendary site of the Garden of Eden.

269
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,734
And this comes from the vault.

270
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:55,809
Guess what?

271
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,163
It's the same stuff.

272
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,343
Run the new dentals against
the NCIC database.

273
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,733
What do you want me to do?

274
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:05,885
Be on the lookout for a face-eating
cannibal who uses a walker?

275
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,426
There's my girl.

276
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,057
I... I brought you
a coffee cake, but they...

277
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:19,335
they took it from me.

278
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,017
Oh, well, I'm not into coffee cake.

279
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:25,304
These days, all my... meals are
prepared by men in hairnets.

280
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,727
I'm glad you came.

281
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,680
While I was waiting, I was thinking
about all the places

282
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,755
that I've been that
were worse than prison.

283
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,987
El Salvador, for example, and that two
weeks I spent in a shipping container.

284
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,171
Disney World.

285
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,510
You hated Disney World.

286
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I thought I was always able to keep
that from you kids.

287
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:48,886
No. I was six, Russ was ten.

288
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,292
It was pouring rain.

289
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:53,547
Mickey sneezed so hard,
his head popped off.

290
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:55,449
I think I like prison better.

291
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,293
Dad, I'm here about Russ.

292
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,374
He's fine. You don't have
to worry about Russ.

293
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:12,119
The woman he lived with, the-the kids
he was raising... they need him home.

294
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,831
Russ sends Amy and the girls
money every month.

295
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,671
The younger child, Hayley, is...

296
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:19,671
really sick.

297
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,971
She's asking for him. How sick?

298
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,904
I'm here, Dad.

299
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:27,114
I am asking you to tell Russ.

300
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,934
Let him make up his own mind what to do.

301
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,642
If he comes back to D. C., Russ is
going to end up in here with me.

302
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:36,498
He won't do that.
He's scared to death of jail.

303
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,949
He'll come if you ask him to.

304
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:43,593
You look more like your
mother every day.

305
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,045
I've got to go.

306
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,460
Well, come back soon.

307
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,905
And thanks for the coffee cake.

308
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:06,060
I found the same symbol that
was mailed to Dr. Brennan

309
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,684
- on this tapestry.
- It looks like a bunch of Tarot cards.

310
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,150
The Architect, The Martyr, The Orator,

311
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:18,616
The Musician, The Bishop,
The Corruptor...

312
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:20,602
- That's it.
- What?

313
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:21,880
Gavin Nichols.

314
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,106
The musician.

315
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,549
Father Cooper was a bishop.

316
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,234
He's doing it in order?

317
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,557
- What's next?
- The Corruptor.

318
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,978
So, the next victim is a corruptor.

319
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:35,914
So, let's call up every porn kingpin
and drug dealer in the country.

320
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,732
Tell them to look out for a lunatic with

321
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:40,296
a napkin in his collar holding
a knife and fork.

322
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:44,417
Dude, you're being way too literal.
These icons extend from the 1600s.

323
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:49,232
A corruptor would mean a heretic, like,
say, a pretender to the throne.

324
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:50,569
What are you doing here?

325
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,524
You left a message that
you wanted to see me.

326
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,773
Not see. Talk.

327
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:55,437
On the telephone.

328
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,572
Interesting what people say unwittingly.

329
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,393
I'm totally into the Gormogon file,
and it's my opinion,

330
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:01,699
you're looking for a duo.

331
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:03,094
How did you get the file?

332
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,011
You gave him the case file?

333
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:09,259
Time out, okay? He came up with
the whole duo thing.

334
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,732
We found another Widow's Son skeleton.

335
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,176
This one's complete.

336
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:16,828
The teeth marks suggest two cannibals.

337
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,001
Really?

338
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:20,183
That's awesome!
It's like the Sith Lords, man.

339
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,792
There's always only two of them.

340
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,717
Did you justStar Warsus?

341
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,183
In the parlance of the 17th century,
it's a master and apprentice situation.

342
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:32,156
Each master must create one of these
sculptures while training an apprentice.

343
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:35,900
When it's complete, the master retires,
the apprentice becomes a master,

344
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,238
starts his own project.

345
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:39,682
So, Gormogon used to be the apprentice?

346
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,434
Now he's the master.

347
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:45,171
How does me saying no translate
to bringing Sweets in?

348
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,351
All right, get this.

349
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,396
Both victims lost their
fathers at a young age.

350
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,857
Widow's sons. Coincidence? I think not.

351
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:54,150
Also, two months ago, we arrested
Gormogon's apprentice.

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,616
Yeah. He killed himself.

353
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:59,463
Point of investigation. hHw do
masters find their apprentices?

354
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,045
Not on Craig's List. I checked.

355
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:06,601
I bet you two free sessions that the
master has access to at-risk children.

356
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,142
Kid's got chops.

357
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,451
Well, anything else?

358
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,714
Yeah. It must be killing him
that you have this.

359
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,165
This is like his whole
reason for living.

360
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,631
You might be able to find
some way to use that.

361
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,924
Wait till you hear this.

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,782
Father Cooper took
a trip to Turkey last year.

363
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,736
The Anatolian region?

364
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:27,192
Gavin Nichols was on the same trip.

365
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,614
The bishop and the musician.

366
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,177
What about a corruptor?

367
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:32,952
Trip was arranged by a lobbyist.

368
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,145
- Is that too literal?
- A lobbyist?

369
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:38,198
Oh, that's a total pretender
to the throne.

370
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:41,454
This is how we roll, right, guys?

371
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:44,665
Bones, you got time
to talk to a lobbyist?

372
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:47,055
You think my life is in danger
because I went to Turkey?

373
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,995
Two of the men you
traveled with are dead.

374
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,800
Their faces were eaten off.

375
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,559
This is Washington D. C.

376
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,558
People have their faces
eaten off all the time.

377
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:57,476
Mr. Porter, are you a member of
any fraternal order?

378
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,611
We know you're a member of
the Knights of Columbus.

379
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,279
Says so right here on your resume.

380
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,143
We know you went to Turkey
with the Knights

381
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,287
to visit the mythical site of
the Garden of Eden.

382
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:07,286
And you think that there's a
cannibal out there

383
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,761
who has something against a
group of civic-minded men

384
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,566
who do good works in their community?

385
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,125
Look, the guy we're after...

386
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:16,343
He thinks that the Knights of Columbus
is an evil secret society.

387
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,670
That's crazy.

388
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,542
- I think he's finally catching on.
- Your life is in danger.

389
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,726
Why me? I mean, there were
40 guys on that trip.

390
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,117
How old were you when your father died?

391
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,200
Six. What does that
have to do with anything?

392
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,787
You lost your father, and
you're a corrupter.

393
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:31,771
Okay.

394
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:35,933
You want to talk to me,
you do it through my lawyer.

395
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,290
All right, listen, Mr. Porter,
we are just trying to help here.

396
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:42,035
The FBI is investigating
influence peddling.

397
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,233
I am one of your targets.

398
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,609
Someone eating the faces off
the Knights of Columbus...

399
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,321
- How stupid do you think I am?
- Right now? Very, very stupid.

400
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:52,900
Okay.

401
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:54,897
Bones, you didn't have to
call him corrupt.

402
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,934
- Why?
- Why, because, obviously, he is.

403
00:19:58,551 --> 00:19:59,949
Agent Booth?

404
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,539
There's someone here to see you.

405
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,103
Where's Hayley?

406
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,509
Russ. You came to the FBI?

407
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,787
That was the deal.

408
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,979
This just keeps getting better.
All right.

409
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,603
Russ Brennan, you're under arrest.

410
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,497
- Come on. You know the drill.
- You lied?

411
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:16,191
- You told Dad Booth wouldn't arrest me.
- No, I never said that.

412
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,852
I should have known better than
to trust anyone in this family.

413
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,162
- I swear.
- I want to see my step daughter.

414
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,579
Hi, honey.

415
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,315
Russ, I knew you'd come!

416
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:46,383
Here, come here, look who's here.

417
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,624
Making funny faces?

418
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:56,391
Thank you for coming, Russ.

419
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,000
Thank you, Booth.

420
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,443
Oh, this never happened.

421
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,547
Don't thank me.

422
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:05,511
As far as the Bureau is concerned,
I caught him here 15 minutes from now.

423
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,661
Thank you, Booth.

424
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,308
Just don't tell anyone.

425
00:21:19,774 --> 00:21:22,587
You told Russ I said Booth
wouldn't arrest him.

426
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,330
Look, I couldn't turn him over to you.

427
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:26,511
That just puts you in a
quandary with Booth.

428
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,696
- I did it this way for you.
- Dad!

429
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,820
What, Booth busted him? That hard ass.

430
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:34,460
Brennan.

431
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:35,816
Dr. Brennan, it's me, Zack.

432
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,482
I found something in the Gormogon
vault I think you should see.

433
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:41,001
What are you being such a
hard ass on my kid for, Booth?

434
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:44,061
- Who's that?
- Nobody. It's not Booth.

435
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,775
You know, it's-it's bad enough
that nobody can trust you,

436
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:50,768
but now you're making it so Russ and
I can't trust each other, either.

437
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,046
He came back!

438
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,338
He hugged his little girl, okay?

439
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,712
So far, things are working out great!

440
00:21:57,745 --> 00:22:01,038
I'm here foryou,
and a lot of dads aren't.

441
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,217
That's true, Dad.

442
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:26,315
What's going on, Zack?

443
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,878
Why don't you turn the light on?

444
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:30,823
I was down here helping Angela decode
when I noticed the mirrors.

445
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,985
What mirrors?

446
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,939
Put these on so you can see
where you're going.

447
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,210
This better be good.

448
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,217
I'm surprised no one noticed
the mirrors before.

449
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:38,345
They're everywhere.

450
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,218
Different kinds, different sizes, placed
seemingly at random around the vault.

451
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,435
But I have an overdeveloped
sense of spatial reasoning.

452
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,089
As a result, things that appear random
to some people appear deliberate to me.

453
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,867
Zack, just get on with it.

454
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:52,490
Watch this.

455
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,625
Want to see where it ends?

456
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:02,876
- Yeah.
- Yes.

457
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:16,037
From that spot, you'd be able
to see every corner of the vault.

458
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:18,489
I don't get it.

459
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,923
What does it mean?

460
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:23,759
Gormogon has been watching
us this whole time.

461
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:31,571
Bones, Tech guys,
they did a sensor sweep.

462
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:34,917
That eye is broadcasting a signal
both audio and video.

463
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:39,000
It's white light activated, it probably
wasn't triggered by Zack's laser.

464
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:41,260
- What do we do?
- Exactly what Sweets said.

465
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:42,877
Use it against Gormogon.

466
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,053
- How?
- Haven't got a clue.

467
00:23:45,262 --> 00:23:47,051
If we fooled him into thinking

468
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:50,585
that we're transferring the sculpture,
he might try to grab it.

469
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:51,991
No.

470
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,901
No, if he wants it as much as Sweets
says, then he'll try to steal it.

471
00:23:54,991 --> 00:23:55,878
No.

472
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:57,036
Why not?

473
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,239
Because I didn't think of it.

474
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,126
Look, it's a great idea,
but if you're gonna sell it,

475
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:06,889
you're gonna have to put Father Cooper's
kneecaps in the silver skeleton.

476
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:10,442
I do this under extreme protest.

477
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,814
The truck will be here any minute.

478
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:14,856
Who knows about this?

479
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:17,675
Just you and me, Bones.

480
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,317
Not even the driver knows
what we're transporting.

481
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:24,948
The MRI at Bethesda will tell us if
Gormogon hid anything within the bones.

482
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:26,016
Like what?

483
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:27,106
I don't know.

484
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,610
That's why we need the MRI at Bethesda.

485
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:31,300
What?

486
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,201
You don't have to scream,
I'm right here.

487
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:34,435
Right.

488
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:35,969
Okay.

489
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:38,107
Are you done?
We're kind of on a schedule.

490
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:40,273
Yes. I'm done.

491
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:44,359
Now we can load it onto a truck
and take it to Bethesda.

492
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,502
All right, everybody keep
their distance.

493
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,396
I don't want to spook this guy.

494
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,040
- I have a question.
- No, you can't drive.

495
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,845
We're undercover,
and I'm the taxi driver.

496
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:04,559
Passengers don't sit in the front seat.

497
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:06,851
You're not a passenger, okay.
You're a trainee.

498
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:09,617
And I'm training you
how to drive a taxicab.

499
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,460
All units be advised.

500
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,490
I got a motorcycle with no plates.

501
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,038
Easy.

502
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,967
- Get down!
- What? Why?

503
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,198
Don't move.

504
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:10,216
Put your arm underneath my shoulder.

505
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,689
Come on, you ready? On three.

506
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,464
One, two, three.

507
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm okay, I'm okay.

508
00:26:17,461 --> 00:26:19,190
You just get over here.

509
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,038
Paramedics are on their way.

510
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,234
He knew who we were because
I was sitting up front.

511
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,636
No, it was because of your bad acting,
that's what it was.

512
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,132
- What, back at the vault? I was good.
- No, you were loud.

513
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,921
- That's what they call overacting.
- You shouldn't have shushed me,

514
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:33,066
that's how he knew.

515
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,651
- Who's got the motorcycle?
- Nobody. We lost the follow car.

516
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:36,766
Damn it!

517
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,089
- Wait, what about the truck?
- It's fine.

518
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,517
Wait a second, he knew
the truck was a decoy.

519
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:45,033
He wasn't trying to get the skeleton
back. He was trying to kill us. What?

520
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,161
Oh, all right, easy.

521
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:48,424
I got it.

522
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,988
What is that?

523
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:55,988
It's a human tooth.

524
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,236
He put human teeth in
his bomb for shrapnel.

525
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:02,071
Bones, he was trying
to kill us because...

526
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:06,297
we know his next target,
the Corruptor, that lobbyist.

527
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:09,095
- Wait... Wait, I want to come.
- Stay right there!

528
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:19,425
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

529
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,019
It's just a flesh wound.

530
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,153
You believe me now?

531
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:33,597
He ran downstairs.

532
00:27:33,657 --> 00:27:36,108
He had a knife. He had a knife.

533
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:09,645
It's over.

534
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:11,099
Drop him!

535
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:13,116
- Put the kid down.
- Put me down!

536
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,395
Put him down.

537
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,380
It's okay, it's all right.

538
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,575
It's all right, it's over, okay?

539
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,592
The Gormogons started out
as good guys, you know.

540
00:28:56,682 --> 00:29:01,253
In the 1600, the malignant manipulations
of secret societies like the Illuminati,

541
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:05,186
the Carbonari, the Masons, the Tong,
were starting to be felt.

542
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:07,862
The Gormogons championed the ideal

543
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:10,569
that humanity should be free of
these pernicious influences.

544
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:11,592
Good guys.

545
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:14,101
So, you feel sympathy for Gormogon?

546
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:18,464
There are secret societies
working today.

547
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:20,352
It's naive to think otherwise.

548
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:24,092
You think I'm paranoid.

549
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,235
Yeah.

550
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:28,468
The question is: How paranoid?

551
00:29:30,513 --> 00:29:32,982
Zack says that there are over 30 victims

552
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:35,884
represented by the skeleton created
by Gormogon and his master,

553
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,831
and his master, who
has got to be in his 80s.

554
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:41,884
And we know that there are
seven in the one

555
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,463
created by Gormogon and
his dead apprentice,

556
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:50,245
including the violinist and the priest.

557
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:54,525
Now, my point of view. he's going
after the Knights of Columbus.

558
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:56,931
Gormogon is nuts.

559
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,855
Dr. Sweets?

560
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:02,481
Dead apprentice.

561
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,437
Gormogon needs a new apprentice.

562
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,482
He may have already found one.

563
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:09,956
We're looking for a kid in his teens.

564
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,053
Tempe, what happened to you?

565
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,422
I got blown up.

566
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:17,548
Russ, I never told Dad that you should
turn yourself in to Booth.

567
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:20,029
If I'd come to you, you would've
told Booth anyway.

568
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:22,470
- What do you mean, blown up?
- It's a case, Russ.

569
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:23,721
It's my job.

570
00:30:23,911 --> 00:30:25,527
We're trying to put a bad guy away.

571
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:26,880
You mean in here.

572
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,805
With other bad guys like me.

573
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:31,247
And Dad. There are
levels of bad guy, Russ.

574
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,076
And you're not even on the first level.

575
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,773
Why do I feel like you just
called me a sissy?

576
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:39,407
I wanted you to hear it from me, Russ.
Dad lied.

577
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:41,602
I never told him it was safe
to come back.

578
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,572
I had to come back, Tempe.

579
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,022
- For Hayley.
- Yes.

580
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:47,488
But they are gonna put
me away after my parole hearing.

581
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:49,796
It's not just that you violated parole.

582
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:52,262
They think you know something
about Dad's murder case.

583
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,535
I don't!

584
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,097
Nobody believes anybody in this family.

585
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,834
What... maybe I'm just like him, right?

586
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:02,217
- A liar? Not worthy of trust.
- No, don't say that.

587
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:05,122
I am just like him.

588
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,329
I am.

589
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,272
I had a family, I left them.

590
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,758
You haven't killed anyone.

591
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:12,089
That's the most reassuring
that you can be?

592
00:31:12,194 --> 00:31:15,262
"Hey, Russ, congratulations on
never killing anyone."

593
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:20,728
Being reassuring has
never been my strong suit.

594
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,826
Levels of bad, right?

595
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:28,510
And I'm a sissy.

596
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,239
It's a good thing, Russ.

597
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:34,011
Thanks for helping Hayley.

598
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:36,912
I love that little girl like
she was my own.

599
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,639
You believe that, don't you?

600
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:41,213
Yeah, Russ.

601
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:43,962
I believe that.

602
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:53,672
Normal person gets blown to hell, they
go home, pour a glass of wine, watch TV.

603
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,844
Caroline, it think it should be worth
something that Russ turned himself in.

604
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:59,789
Bumping into Booth at the hospital is
not the same as turning himself in.

605
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,533
That's not what happened.

606
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,052
It's what Booth says happened.

607
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,073
No, Russ turned himself in,
but I convinced Booth

608
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,864
to let him go see Hayley
at the hospital.

609
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,413
I did not hear that.

610
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:10,744
Russ turned himself in,

611
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:14,638
but I convinced Booth to let him
go see Hayley at the hospital.

612
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:16,288
Do I have this straight?

613
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,014
You're a genius?

614
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:20,937
An honest to goodness,
dyed-in-the-wool genius?

615
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,219
Yes.

616
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:25,392
Dr. Brennan, I like you, on and off,

617
00:32:25,512 --> 00:32:28,550
but your brother is a material
witness in my murder case.

618
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,016
I cannot recommend that he be set free.

619
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:32,670
Please?

620
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:34,098
Oh, well.

621
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:36,046
Now that you said please.

622
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,312
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Yes!

623
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:44,042
Best I can do is arrange for you to
speak at your brother's parole hearing.

624
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:48,575
Looking the way you do, maybe the
judge will feel sorry and let him go.

625
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,996
These are the marks
left by Gormogon's teeth.

626
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:56,147
I reverse engineered a dental set.

627
00:32:56,267 --> 00:33:00,133
So this is what the front plate of
Gormogon's teeth looks like

628
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:03,547
top and bottom, from incisor to incisor.

629
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:04,464
Okay.

630
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:06,923
These are the teeth from the bomb.

631
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:14,518
It's a match.

632
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:17,502
It was Gormogon's tooth
lodged in my shoulder.

633
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,487
The tooth found in your
shoulder was chipped.

634
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:23,163
In fact, all of the teeth we found,
almost a full set, were chipped.

635
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:24,366
Due to the explosion?

636
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:29,276
No, these marks here were made by
common, hardware store pliers.

637
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:31,111
He pulled out his own teeth?

638
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:33,985
I don't know. Certainly they were
removed with pliers.

639
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:35,504
That's what happened, Zack.

640
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:38,225
Gormogon pulled out all
his teeth, one by one,

641
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:40,436
with pliers, and put them in a bomb.

642
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:42,737
Booth was right.

643
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:45,820
He meant to kill us.

644
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:50,444
I was photographing the skeleton in
preparation for taking it apart,

645
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:53,752
when I noticed this on a rib.

646
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:57,541
"1026." What is it?

647
00:33:57,722 --> 00:33:58,827
It's a number.

648
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:01,958
- No, Zack, Cam meant what does it mean?
- Is it code?

649
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,400
It could be an ordinal indexed automata.

650
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,395
I could start a solution, but it would
extend into infinity.

651
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:08,913
And how long would that take?

652
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:10,688
Forever. Obviously.

653
00:34:10,794 --> 00:34:13,576
How's about that alpha-numeric business?

654
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:15,072
"J. B.F."

655
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:16,207
Meaningless.

656
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:17,520
No, wait a minute.

657
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:18,827
- I got it.
- What?

658
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:20,180
He's an artist.

659
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,654
He's finished something.

660
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,970
I mean, it's terrible, but, to him,
this is a piece of art.

661
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:26,123
It's a signature.

662
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:28,409
1026 is a number, not a name.

663
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:30,567
No, I'm telling you,
this is a signature.

664
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:32,984
The vault is like a museum of
the Gormogons, right?

665
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,101
An archive.

666
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:37,646
Then why don't we just look in
Safety Deposit Box 1026?

667
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:40,048
'Cause they're all rigged to
blow up when you open them.

668
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,370
Oh, I solved that one.

669
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,852
In my head, while having my Cuppa Soup.

670
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:50,237
What I'm doing is smothering
the phosphorus with argon,

671
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:52,267
thus giving Booth time to
reach in with tongs

672
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,989
to remove whatever's inside
the box before it ignites.

673
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,921
Why me?

674
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:57,894
Obviously because you have
the fastest reflexes.

675
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,901
- Fine, you can pull the tray.
- Fine.

676
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,352
Exactly how far back
should I be standing?

677
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:03,771
Ready?

678
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:05,458
Door! Tray!

679
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:07,334
Lid! Tongs!

680
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:12,750
Did Booth get it?

681
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:14,073
Yes, Zack, can't you see?

682
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:16,163
Not for another three to five minutes.

683
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:18,720
It's a key with a bar code on it.

684
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,560
You called me to the FBI because
you found a key to my office?

685
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:27,223
We accessed the information
contained in the bar code.

686
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:30,667
It came up as the key to your office
in the Social Services building.

687
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,261
That's not the key to my office.

688
00:35:32,336 --> 00:35:35,562
Room 1026, Municipal Department
of Social Services.

689
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:38,336
Nobody's used a key like
that since the 70s.

690
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,810
It was before my time.

691
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,086
Wait a second, has that office always
belonged to Social Services?

692
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:46,144
Yes, back then, it was dealing with
foster care and group homes.

693
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:47,813
Booth, Sweets is right.

694
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:50,452
That would be a great place
to recruit disturbed boys.

695
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:51,713
Recruit for what?

696
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:58,647
It's just that that man that was
in that office is a bit of a legend.

697
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:00,703
He helped a lot of kids find their way.

698
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:01,900
What was his name?

699
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:03,275
Arthur Graves.

700
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,961
He's retired now.

701
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,326
He wouldn't happen to live in a nursing
home that used to be a mansion?

702
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,649
Mr. Graves has been here for five years.

703
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:15,809
In a wheelchair for the last four.

704
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,710
Sweet guy, a little particular
about what he eats.

705
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,461
You have no idea.

706
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:21,921
I beg your pardon?

707
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:23,787
What's wrong with Mr. Graves?

708
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:24,967
Alzheimer's.

709
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:26,913
The last few months,
he's gotten pretty bad.

710
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,009
Is he lucid?

711
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,402
He comes and goes.

712
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:33,302
Hey, Arthur, some nice people
are here to see you.

713
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:34,961
Hey, Mr. Graves.

714
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:36,964
FBI Special Agent Seely Booth.

715
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:40,811
Listen, we got a court order here to
get a dental imprint from you.

716
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,837
Mr. Graves, I'm not going to hurt you.

717
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:46,700
I just need you to bite down
on this for me.

718
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,578
Sorry. He's not like that usually.

719
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,285
- I think you may have frightened him.
- How'd he lose his teeth?

720
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,029
They'd all been pulled when he got here.

721
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,605
- Does he have any regular visitors?
- There used to be a man.

722
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:00,889
He drove a motorcycle.

723
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,589
- I believe he may have been a nephew.
- We know who you are.

724
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,035
- We know what you did.
- All right, Bones, it's okay. Let's go.

725
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,848
We'll check out his case files.
See what kids he could've recruited.

726
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:11,975
Come on.

727
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:13,450
Let's go.

728
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,245
While I'm here, I'm gonna
get a court order

729
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,110
to monitor Arthur Graves' visitors.

730
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:22,914
Just in case "Gargonzola"

731
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,253
decides to come back and
visit his old master.

732
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,651
You're doing that Gorgonzola thing
on purpose, aren't you?

733
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:28,903
Hi, Temperance.

734
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:30,230
Hi.

735
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,820
If that's who I think it is, I can't
really be friendly.

736
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,529
I understand, I'll just wait over here.

737
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,752
Here.

738
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,405
That's for you.

739
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:47,801
Hayley's feeling better.

740
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:49,936
She even wanted to come.

741
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,579
Please tell her thank you.

742
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,466
Agent Booth?

743
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,257
- The Judge will see you now.
- Great.

744
00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:57,347
In chambers.

745
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:58,715
Why in chambers?

746
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:06,544
Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan has
already proven himself a flight risk.

747
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:08,006
He is attached to his family.

748
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:10,412
- The same family he abandoned?
- Temporarily.

749
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:14,449
When his little girl needed him, he
returned without any regard for himself.

750
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:15,938
You're his parole officer.

751
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,292
We're all here because you're
the one who violated him.

752
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,592
Only because it's the law, Ms. Julian.

753
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:22,908
I have a lot of faith in Russ Brennan.

754
00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:27,374
Judge Watkins, Russ Brennan not only
broke his parole by fleeing the region,

755
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:30,292
he is a material witness in an
upcoming murder trial.

756
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:33,481
That is a totally different issue that
has nothing to do with this hearing.

757
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,670
This isn't a hearing.

758
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:37,405
It's an informal meeting to decide
whether there will be a hearing.

759
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,731
Can I say something?

760
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:41,011
That is a slippery slope, Judge Watkins.

761
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:42,139
- Can I?
- No.

762
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:43,612
But you said this was informal.

763
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:46,590
I'm still the Judge and I get
to make those decisions.

764
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:49,346
Agent Booth, what are your thoughts?

765
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:53,171
- I got nothing to say, Judge.
- Booth, please!

766
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:57,514
I got a phone call from the Archbishop
of D. C. 15 minutes ago.

767
00:38:57,664 --> 00:39:01,585
He promises to take a personal interest
in Mr. Brennan's rehabilitation.

768
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:03,386
For God's sake, why?

769
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:06,913
Also a psychiatrist, Dr. Lance Sweets,

770
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:11,273
who says he believes Mr. Brennan
will not flee the jurisdiction again.

771
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:16,315
Plus, a parole officer who is
recommending against revoking parole.

772
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,439
Why should I ignore all that?

773
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,021
Because Ms. Davis will simply
send Russ Brennan home.

774
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:24,795
That is not my intention.

775
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:26,103
It's not?

776
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,983
Mr. Brennan should be punished.

777
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:29,421
Punished how?

778
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,010
30 days in county jail.

779
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:32,532
- What?
- That's nothing.

780
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:34,231
Seems pretty harsh from where I sit.

781
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:37,013
Also 18 months should be
added to his parole,

782
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:39,871
and he should be forced to wear
electronic monitoring.

783
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:43,021
That is slightly more than nothing,
but only slightly.

784
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:47,043
I will register your opinion,
Ms. Julian, but that's my ruling.

785
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:50,246
If I had a gavel, I'd bang it, but

786
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,878
how about the last one out
just slams the door?

787
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:00,495
I want you to consider
what side you're on.

788
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:03,406
Bishops and psychiatrists and
bleeding heart parole officers,

789
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,897
that's what's wrong with
the justice system in this country.

790
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,926
Russ, you've got to go
with the marshals.

791
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,174
Thank you again.

792
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:16,618
I didn't do anything again.

793
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,339
- You should thank him, too.
- Why?

794
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:21,388
- He saved Russ.
- I didn't do anything, okay.

795
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,170
Russ... time to go.

796
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,806
Okay, here's the thing, Russ.

797
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:33,039
All right, you run again, you disappoint
that woman and her kids,

798
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,008
and you break your
sister's heart, I will...

799
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,483
Do something terrible.

800
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,069
I got it.

801
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:39,573
Yeah, I hope you do.

802
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:41,239
All yours, boys.

803
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:45,237
Hey, Booth.

804
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:47,427
Thanks.

805
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:49,490
Yeah, clean nose, buddy.

806
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,468
Clean nose, clean heart.

807
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:58,813
"'Why was I forgotten?
Mary said, stamping her foot.

808
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,686
'Why does nobody come?'

809
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:05,069
"A young man whose name was Barney
looked at her very sadly.

810
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:08,974
