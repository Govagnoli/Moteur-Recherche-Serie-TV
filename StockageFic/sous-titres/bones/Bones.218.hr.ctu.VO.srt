1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
So, you ever been here before ?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,300
No.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
Oh, I don't mean here here.
I mean Baltimore.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah, I've given several lectures

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,900
to the Baltimore Homicide Division.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,700
What's wrong with your mouth ?

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,100
- I got a tooth situation.
- Well, go to a dentist.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,100
All right, I will if
it doesn't get any better.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,200
- Ow ! Man !
- Are you afraid of the dentist ?

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,600
- I'm not afraid.
- Welcome to Balmer.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,900
This is, uh, actually a federal
flood abatement project,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
which is why we called you.

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
K-9 unit was using it
for an exercise,

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,600
and one of the cadaver
dogs went berserk.

15
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,300
When they dug up the cement...

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, that's concrete.

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,100
Cement is an
ingredient in concrete.

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah, that's a real important
distinction to make

19
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,900
at this juncture.

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
So, what do we got, Bones, huh ?

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Do your thing.

22
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,100
Nothing.

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,300
Nothing. Nothing ?
No, I can't see enough

24
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,000
of the skull, the tibia, the pubis.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,900
Nothing. Nothing.
Wait a second. Nothing.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,799
Oh, sorry about that.

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,700
We drove all the way here so
you could just tell me nothing ?

28
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,800
All right, so what do you,
what do you want to, uh,

29
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
get the whole slab
of cement... Concrete.

30
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,800
...concrete, whatever...
shipped back to the Jeffersonian ?

31
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Abso...

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Sex ?

33
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,800
The mandible suggests male,

34
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,900
and the tibia suggests

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,200
he was between five
six and six feet tall.

36
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,600
Waffle-soled training
shoes and a track suit.

37
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,800
- You know who wears track suits ?
- Athletes ?

38
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,100
No. Huge tubs of lard
or retired people.

39
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,900
And rap stars.

40
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
The teeth suggest
early middle age.

41
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,800
So not a retiree.

42
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,100
Uh, calcified holes
with radial fractures

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,500
in the left clavicle and
scapula are consistent

44
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
with ballistic damage.

45
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,600
- He was shot to death ?
- And stabbed.

46
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,900
But neither killed him.

47
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,300
The wounds healed.

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,900
Shot, stabbed, but lived
to die another day ?

49
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,300
Rap star.

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
There is a small hole
in the back of the cranium.

51
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,300
Get the skull out first,
establish cause of death,

52
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,600
then give Angela something
to work with to ID the guy.

53
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,700
Where is Angela ?

54
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm really not good
at this kind of thing.

55
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,300
You know, I don't...

56
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't get the significance.

57
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,800
One year ago today,

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
you buried your mother.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,300
You laid her to rest.

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Here.

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
You're marking the anniversary.

62
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,200
Angela, I simply don't believe

63
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,700
my mother retained
sentience beyond death.

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,900
Well, part of you is made up
of your mother, right ?

65
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,300
In a manner of speaking.

66
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,500
So, honor that part of yourself.

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Visualize a memory of her.

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
See what it brings up.

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,300
I have very few distinct
memories of my mother.

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll wait in the car.

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,500
Hiya, honey.

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
I was hoping you might show up.

73
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,800
I don't... I don't
want to talk to you.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
We're standing here

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,300
in front of your mother's grave.

76
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,500
Obviously, you've come
for some kind of answer.

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
Maybe I can... provide 'em.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
You're a killer.

79
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,800
You burn people.

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, I'd like to report
a sighting of Max Keenan

81
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
at Eternal Spring Memorial Gardens.

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
He's a wanted fugitive.

83
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,800
I love you.

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,700
Yes, I'm sure.

85
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,100
Because he's my father.

86
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,400
"Bones" Season 02 Episode 18

87
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,600
... your dad at all before
you called the cops ?

88
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,400
No. Why would I ?

89
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,100
Well, I mean, I haven't
seen my dad in a long time,

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
and if I had the opportunity
to talk... Ow !
­

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,500
Go to a dentist.

92
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,500
Oh, I will if it doesn't
get any better.

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,700
Based on decomposition
of the track suit,

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,900
Hodgins is estimating a postmortem
interval of two years.

95
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Based on bone deterioration,
I like three years.

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, what killed him ?

97
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,400
The victim was dead shortly after

98
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,700
this hole was punched
into his skull.

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Too small for a projectile.

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,500
No radiating stress lines.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,200
A slow entry, a piercing wound.

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,800
Like a-a screwdriver ?

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,300
Nail gun ? Ice pick ?

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,900
Yeah, something along those lines.

105
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,900
Oh. Cold steel to the brain...
would that kill him ?

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Depending how far it penetrated.

107
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah, it's Booth.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,700
I need, um, all murders

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,500
in which a penetrating wound
to the back of the head figured.

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
Great. Thanks.

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Don't freak out.

112
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Oh !

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,300
You broke into my house ?

114
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,400
That is not acceptable.

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,400
This, uh,

116
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,900
little device here...
it jams cell phone frequencies.

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,700
That is illegal.

118
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,900
Unfortunately, illegal

119
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,799
is what I do best.

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm not staying.

121
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
I just want you to do
something for me.

122
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
I want you to take a
look at my rap sheet.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
- Why ?
- Why ?

124
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,600
Because I want a chance to talk to you...
actually talk to you...

125
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,700
without you calling
in the 82nd Airborne.

126
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
How is reading your police record

127
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,400
going to change my mind ?

128
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,300
Just do it.

129
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,900
I think our victim was killed by Ice Pick.

130
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,400
Angela did a facial
reconstruction of Cement Head.

131
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,000
Concrete Head, you mean.

132
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,000
No, Cement Head...
it's got a nicer ring.

133
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,900
So, I ran it through
IntelPlus and got a match.

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
William Raymond "Billy Ray"

135
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
McKenna. West Virginia.

136
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,900
"Assault, manslaughter, kidnapping,

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
torture...." This here...

138
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
This here is, uh, Hugh Kennedy.

139
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,000
Uh, I think he
killed Cement Head.

140
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Why ?

141
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,700
Well, West Virginia,

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,100
likes to use an ice pick
on his victims, plus Ice Pick

143
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
and Cement Head were both employed

144
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,000
by a regional crime
boss in West Virginia

145
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
named... Gallagher.

146
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,500
Well, what are we
going to call him ?

147
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:50,699
Gallagher.

148
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,500
But he runs most
of the, uh, prostitutes,

149
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,500
strippers, gambling,
bootlegging, meth,

150
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,900
extortion in West Virginia.

151
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Five years ago, the West Virginia

152
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,700
State Police began pressuring

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,500
Gallagher's criminal operation,
making a lot of arrests.

154
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Including Ice Pick and Cement Head.

155
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Cement Head goes to jail.

156
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,800
- Ice Pick ?
- Out on bail, babe.

157
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,400
You say that like
it means something.

158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,100
Oh, I talked to the officer
in charge, and he said

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,500
that Ice Pick wouldn't say anything,

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,900
so they punished him
by letting him out

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,900
on bail.

162
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
How is bail punishment ?

163
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,000
'Cause it makes Gallagher think

164
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,400
that Ice Pick cooperated
with the cops.

165
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,300
You know, it's criminal
psychology, Bones.

166
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,199
You know, you wouldn't get it.

167
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Just read. Just continue
reading there, will you ?

168
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,400
"Half a million dollar bond.

169
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,000
"Kennedy jumped bail.

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,700
"Killed in a car accident

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,300
while fleeing a Bail
Fugitive Recovery agent."

172
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Bounty Hunter.
"Car burned the remains to ashes."

173
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,800
All they got was a severed leg.

174
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,200
They didn't actually
get Ice Pick's body.

175
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,500
So, are we going to talk
to the bounty hunter ?

176
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,100
No, I am. You're gonna make sure

177
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,000
that that severed leg actually
belonged to Ice Pick.

178
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
Well, someone kept the leg ?

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,300
The severed leg was
frozen as evidence.

180
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,900
So, you think Ice Pick
might still be alive ?

181
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,900
As a friend of mine

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,700
likes to say, "Don't jump to conclusions

183
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
until all the evidence is in."

184
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,400
If the facts are in, then
it's not jumping to conclusions,

185
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,300
so I never said that.

186
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,900
I never said that the friend is you, okay ?

187
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,900
Does it have to be completely
thawed for you to examine ?

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,300
No. My interest lies
only in the femur.

189
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,900
I need to get some tissue
for DNA testing.

190
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,700
I'm the bounty hunter
you want to talk to.

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,900
Veleska Miller.

192
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
You want to know about Kennedy's leg ?

193
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,300
Anything you want to tell me
outside the official report,

194
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
that's great.

195
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Sure.

196
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,400
How it smelled, his body
cooking over the fire.

197
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,500
Otherwise, I stand by the record.

198
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,600
How'd you find him ?

199
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,500
Tip from someone I know
who provides documents

200
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,700
to fugitives.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Tailed him, he made me, took off.

202
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,500
Boom !

203
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,600
Found his leg about 30
yards from the vehicle.

204
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,200
And you saw him burn ?

205
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Yeah.

206
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Why ?

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's it ?

208
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,400
That's it.

209
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm a little disappointed.

210
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
I was hoping you'd
keep me here a while,

211
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,100
ask me some dumb-ass
federal questions, check me out.

212
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,500
How's about I buy you
a nice breakfast, huh ?

213
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Guy like you must be going
crazy in the FBI.

214
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
What kind of guy
is that, exactly ?

215
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm a bounty hunter, sport.

216
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,900
I read people fast, or I die.

217
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,100
You are not standard
government issue.

218
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Take a walk on the wild side.

219
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,800
I have more fun, fewer rules,

220
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,400
and a lot of money.

221
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Yeah.

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
You make a compelling case.

223
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Booth.

224
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,400
Coroner's report said

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,600
Kennedy's leg was severed
in the car accident.

226
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,900
We don't call him Kennedy.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
We call him Ice Pick.

228
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,000
Hold on for one second. Sorry.

229
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah. Aah.

230
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
Listen, I got the, uh,
bounty hunter here.

231
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,700
She was an eyewitness to the crash.

232
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,900
Saw him incinerated.

233
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,700
Tell Booth that Ice Pick's
femur is sliced cleanly

234
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,200
at 90 degrees.

235
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,200
I can hear you, Bones.

236
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,900
Okay ? It's a speakerphone.

237
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Look, amputation
like that could happen

238
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
in a bad wreck, right, Cam ?

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,800
Yes.

240
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,800
Well, there are kerf marks.

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,800
She's seeing evidence
of a saw, Booth.

242
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,000
Look, I know what
kerf marks are.

243
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Booth should arrest
the bounty hunter.

244
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,900
I can hear you, Bones.

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
What am I gonna arrest
her for, huh ?

246
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
For lying, for perjury.

247
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,200
For aiding in a cover-up.

248
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,100
If she's there with you,
just detain her.

249
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,100
Okay.

250
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,500
Hey, look at that, huh ?
DNA is a match.

251
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,700
West Virginia state troopers

252
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,200
got a DNA sample at
Ice Pick's arrest.

253
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,500
This is definitely his leg.

254
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Was she pretty ?

255
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
Ice Pick is a male.

256
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,600
I mean the bounty hunter
who gave Booth the slip.

257
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,200
You know, she didn't get away
because she was pretty.

258
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
She was a she ? No, she was a...

259
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,300
Oh...

260
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,900
What's wrong with your mouth ?

261
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm guessing the anterior molar

262
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
on the left side is infected.

263
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,900
The leg was surgically amputated.

264
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Go to a dentist.

265
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,500
He's afraid of the dentist.

266
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,900
These kerf marks are

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
consistent with a type

268
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,100
of wire saw used
to remove horns

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
from heifers. Ah, so...

270
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,600
Ice Pick and this bounty hunter
set up a car accident

271
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,200
with a dummy victim so everyone
stops looking for him.

272
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,700
Two years later
he kills Con... Cement Head.

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
She hoodwinked you
'cause she was hot.

274
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
All right, look, you know what ?

275
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
She wasn't hot. In fact,
she looked like a man.

276
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,700
The amputation was probably performed
by a livestock veterinarian.

277
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,500
Hey, Bones, I've got that other
thing you want to discuss.

278
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,900
Oh, let's...

279
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
go to my office

280
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,600
so we don't disturb Cam.

281
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,800
Booth ? Yeah ?

282
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,100
Livestock amputation.
That is one tough,

283
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,400
determined old criminal.
Be careful.

284
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
You know, I was going
through your father's

285
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
crim... Shh !

286
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
... criminal record and
he was right about one thing.

287
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,500
You know, he never ended
anyone's life who didn't

288
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,400
have it coming to them.
He's a sociopath.

289
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,100
Well, maybe, but at least
he aimed in the right direction.

290
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,800
- Ow !
- Let me take a look at your tooth.

291
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,700
All right, just...

292
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
Go easy. You promise ?

293
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,200
Okay. All right.

294
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,100
Open up. You know,

295
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,700
What ?

296
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,099
In the Old West,

297
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
he would have been
considered a hero.

298
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah, well, the Old

299
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,600
was a time of chaos and violence that,

300
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,100
anthropologically speaking,

301
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
our country is still Ow !

302
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
trying to recover from.

303
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,600
Yeah, I was right. Anterior
molar on the left side,

304
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
it's infected.

305
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,600
You know, your father never killed

306
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,000
any hardworking, tax-paying

307
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,600
citizens or honest cops.

308
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,500
Ow ! You still think

309
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,100
that society should forgive him ?
All I'm saying

310
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,900
is if I have an opportunity
to arrest him, I will.

311
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,500
But you know who maybe

312
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,800
should forgive him ?

313
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
His daughter.

314
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,300
Oh, look at that.

315
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,200
The small town crime
boss is here.

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,100
Let's go have a little
chat with him, shall we ?

317
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,600
Billy Ray McKenna shortly before

318
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,200
he became Cement Head.

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
I like nicknames.

320
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,600
They are universal
mnemonic devices.

321
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,000
Why are we doing this ?
Don't we know that cause

322
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,400
of death was brain scrambling
due to an ice pick ?

323
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
The technical term is "pithing."

324
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
And it's not how he died.

325
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,400
It entered the medullary

326
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,700
pyramids, and beveling
on the entry site suggests

327
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
it was...

328
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,600
I don't believe there's
an English word that

329
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,200
adequately describes...

330
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,100
Wiggling. Up and down

331
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,500
is wiggling. Okay...

332
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,500
wiggled, thus paralyzing the victim

333
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
and causing some
difficulty breathing.

334
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
But he would live for upwards

335
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,800
of several hours. Smart.

336
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
Very little blood spilled.

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
How did the victim die ?

338
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,800
This is the bad part.

339
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
It appears that the concrete

340
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,400
was poured over him while
he was still alive.

341
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,200
Oh...

342
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,000
These chunks of concrete

343
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,000
are in the shape of...

344
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,000
a sinus cavity,

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,500
bronchial tubes,

346
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,700
plus a kind of a hollow

347
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
around the middle finger.

348
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,300
You said he was paralyzed.

349
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,300
Well, if the ice pick was
inserted and then waggled...

350
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,800
... it would affect
the median nerve

351
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,400
and the T1 nerve roots.

352
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,700
Which control the flexor
carpi radialis.

353
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Anterior palm, thumb,
index and middle fingers.

354
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
But if it was...

355
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:00,299
Wiggled.

356
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,700
... the victim would
lose the ability

357
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,300
to move the ring and pinky fingers.

358
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,200
We think he wiggled
instead of waggled.

359
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,400
Because he could still
move his middle finger.

360
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,300
It's a terrible way to die.

361
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,300
Our conclusion is that he was
trying to swim to the surface

362
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
using only his middle finger.

363
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,400
The last time I saw Billy Ray McKenna

364
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,900
he was "So long, suckering" me
from his F-150

365
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
and heading off on a
well-earned vacation.

366
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,600
Well-earned by
torturing a journalist

367
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,100
who was talking too much.

368
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,900
Well, I resent your inference.

369
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,600
Get him my, uh...

370
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
whatcha call it ? Tax papers,

371
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
employment records.
Did I get that right ?

372
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,600
Not quite. You resent
his implication.

373
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,100
He's implying that
you're a criminal.

374
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,200
You're taking inference
with hisimplication. Have at it.

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
According to this, Mr. Lightner
is your flight instructor.

376
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,200
That is correct.

377
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,900
I have wide-ranging enterprises.

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
Clark here is helpful
in getting me

379
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,500
where I got to get.

380
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,200
And William Raymond McKenna

381
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,000
is down as a media liaison.

382
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,200
Yep, by breaking
journalists' fingers.

383
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,800
You know, you never
asked me about, uh,

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Billy Ray McKenna
there, big dog.

385
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Well, I assume,
big dog, that, uh,

386
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
Billy Ray is deceased.

387
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,200
Why ?

388
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,900
He was a valued employee.

389
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
Disappears for three years,

390
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,700
I got to assume the worst.

391
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,100
His body was found
encased in concrete.

392
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,500
Tell you what, we're gonna
claim his remains.

393
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,700
We'll bury him proper.

394
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,100
Where'd you send him on vacation ?

395
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
- Canada.
- Canada ?

396
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,300
Was it the Mounties that

397
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,500
found Billy Ray
encased in cement ?

398
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,000
- Concrete.
- Hmm ?

399
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Not cement. It's a common error.

400
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400
Baltimore Police.

401
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,500
- Is Baltimore on the way to Canada ?
- Well, the most

402
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,800
efficient route is up
through Detroit,

403
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,000
but Billy Ray, hell,
he loved Vermont so.

404
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,100
Do you have any idea who might
want to kill Mr. McKenna ?

405
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,300
Oh, hell, yeah. He, uh...

406
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,900
- Well, how would you put it ?
- Aggressive.

407
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,700
- Yeah.
- Both socially and sexually.

408
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,200
How about Hugh Kennedy ?

409
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,100
Hugh Kennedy.

410
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah, handy with the ice pick.

411
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,100
According to this,

412
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
you hired him as a "Liquor

413
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,700
License Consultant
on a per case basis."

414
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,900
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I remember.

415
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Taciturn type. Very dour.

416
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,600
Right. In jail for murder once,

417
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,900
manslaughter twice,

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,900
and suspect in four
unsolved murders,

419
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
all involving ice picks.

420
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,500
You know, good old Hugh did not put
none of that on his ràÍum ?

421
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,500
If I recall, Mr. Kennedy

422
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,400
was killed in a car accident

423
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,300
fleeing a bail
enforcement officer.

424
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Got burned up.

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,800
Well... you guys look us up

426
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
if you're ever
in western West Virginia.

427
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,800
We're at Snackie's
Roadhouse and Grill.

428
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Where the 119 hits the 64.

429
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
I'll make a note of that.

430
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
119 hits the...

431
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,400
64. 64.

432
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,700
Hey, T, look.

433
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,500
Snickerdoodles. What do...

434
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,800
Oh, come on, you used to love them.

435
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,500
When you were a little girl.

436
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
I got a message for
you from your brother.

437
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
What message ?

438
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,900
Uh, he says, um... He says "hi."

439
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Have you turned Russ
into a criminal, too ?

440
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Hey, I haven't committed a crime

441
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,200
in over 15 years.

442
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
I'm straight. Except for

443
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,500
killing, gutting, and burning

444
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,100
the deputy director of the FBI.

445
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,300
He was trying to kill
Russ, and then he was going

446
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,500
after you. It is not

447
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
a crime to protect your family.

448
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Some fathers do it without killing.

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
Did, uh... you and Booth

450
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,500
take a look at my, uh, rap sheet ?

451
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,900
Yes.

452
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,400
And ?

453
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,100
He'll arrest you
if he has the chance.

454
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
What else ?

455
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,600
So the snickerdoodles. Come on.

456
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,400
You don't remember ?
You loved them as a little girl.

457
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I don't remember.

458
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,300
I'd come home, and then you'd

459
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,600
be jumping around. You were five
or six years old and you'd say,

460
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,200
"Come on, why don't you put
on the trying song ?

461
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,500
Put on the trying song !"
The trying song ?

462
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,900
It was my favorite song.

463
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
I used to sing it.
It was, uh... by Poco.

464
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,700
The band.

465
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,100
Hugh Kennedy ?

466
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,100
Bad guy, but he's dead.

467
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,000
About five years ago in a car
crash in West Virginia.

468
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,600
Recent evidence suggests
otherwise. How do you know him ?

469
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,500
Well, him and his ice pick
were pretty famous in some circles.

470
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
I've got to go.

471
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,000
- Now ?
- Yeah.

472
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
You speed-dialed Booth.

473
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
He's been listening
to everything and the...

474
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,500
the SWAT team's on its way.

475
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
I mean, I'm just guessing.

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
But there is something
I do want to say to you.

477
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,500
Mom ?

478
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
It's not about Mom,

479
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,600
it's about you and
it's about stuff

480
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,200
that she wanted you to know.

481
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,800
She never got the
chance to tell you.

482
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,200
Hey, Booth, there's a couple

483
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,400
of things that you should
know about this guy, Kennedy.

484
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,600
He's got an addiction
to model airplanes.

485
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Try some of these again.
You'll love them.

486
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Wait, Dad... What's...

487
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,700
What's the second thing ?

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,900
Mmm, he's wily.

489
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
You be careful, okay ?

490
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Did you get that ?

491
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,400
I've got to tell you,
you were right, Zack.

492
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,200
Every model airplane freak

493
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,600
from Baltimore is here.

494
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,500
We prefer the term "pilots."

495
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,500
Yeah, okay.

496
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,900
So you're into
this stuff, too, huh ?

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, forensic anthropology
is only one of my doctorates.

498
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
The other is in
applied engineering.

499
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm extremely adept at
practical aeronautics.

500
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,400
Do you see Ice Pick ?

501
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,600
A lot of these guys
are kind of old.

502
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,800
You know, they're
wearing those, uh...

503
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,100
those sunglasses that
wrap around their heads.

504
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,000
Well, how many of them
only have one leg ?

505
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,900
Well, half of them
are sitting down.

506
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
Okay, how am I going to get
them to stand up ?

507
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,700
Crashes bring
everyone to their feet.

508
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,500
W... uh, shoot down
one of the planes.

509
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,000
That's great, and the
next thing you know,

510
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm being evaluated by
my shrink again.

511
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
That's not going to happen.

512
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,900
Drive onto the field.

513
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:14,799
What ?

514
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
Put your car where they like to land.

515
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,300
Everyone will stand up
and yell at you.

516
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
This better work.

517
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,400
Okay, just stay with me here.

518
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Oops.

519
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,200
Look at that, huh ?

520
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
It seems to be working.

521
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
Ha, ha. Oh, they're mad.

522
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,400
Do you see him ?

523
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,300
They're all wearing long pants.

524
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,700
I mean, how can I tell if any
of them are wearing a prosthetic ?

525
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,300
The prosthetic will cause

526
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
a slightly unnatural
alignment of the spine,

527
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,800
which will result in
a compensating adjustment of...

528
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,200
Booth, the instinct will be
for these men to step

529
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,200
toward you.

530
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
One man will be standing
perfectly still.

531
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,300
Okay.

532
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,500
Yep, I got him.

533
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,900
Sorry.

534
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,900
I apologize.

535
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,500
Just passing through.

536
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,800
Afternoon.

537
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Anybody asking after me ?

538
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Nope.

539
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
What the hell ?

540
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm gonna need his room number.

541
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,600
Maybe I can help you.

542
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,800
What did you hit me with ?

543
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,900
Huh ?

544
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,300
Only reason I ask is my tooth
doesn't hurt anymore.

545
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,800
You know, you're the first guy

546
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
that got the drop on me
in ten years.

547
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
I used to get that a lot.

548
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,500
Can I ask you a question ?

549
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,100
As long as you answer
one for me, then.

550
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Huh ? What's your story ?

551
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,300
Billy Ray got in the
back of my cab.

552
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,100
Don't know which one of us
was bigger surprised,

553
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
but it must have been Billy Ray

554
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
'cause he's the one ended up dead.

555
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,600
Hey, what's your question ?

556
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,700
How you people find him
under all that cement ?

557
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,800
A dog.

558
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,200
- Dog, huh ?
- Yeah.

559
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,900
So why am I not dead ?

560
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,800
I never killed nobody for fun.

561
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
It was my job.

562
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
And I'm retired.

563
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Now, listen.

564
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
I know you fellas get in trouble
if you lose your gun.

565
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm taking the bullets,
though, if you don't mind.

566
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Oh.

567
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,100
- Well, what about me ?
- Settle down.

568
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,300
What ? Settle down, relax.

569
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Someone'll find you.

570
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,400
You have a good day now.

571
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,300
I just want to talk
about your mother.

572
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,500
Booth is missing.

573
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,900
It's been over 18 hours.

574
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,500
He tried to take down Hugh
Kennedy by himself ?

575
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
He's only got one leg and he's old.

576
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, you know how he got old ?

577
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,100
By being fast and paranoid.

578
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,700
He cut off his own leg.

579
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,600
Booth is tough.

580
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
What does the FBI say ?

581
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Nothing.

582
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,800
Yeah, "need to know," right ?

583
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,000
Mm-hmm.

584
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,700
I want to do something, but
I don't... I don't know what.

585
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,900
Are you asking ?

586
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,600
You'd help find the man who's
going to put you in jail ?

587
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, Booth will...
will do the best he can,

588
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll do the best I can,

589
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,900
and we'll see how it works
out when we get there.

590
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
W-Where did he find Kennedy ?

591
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Baltimore.

592
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm afraid that's not Hugh Kennedy.

593
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,700
What's that called when they
wrap a sausage in a pancake ?

594
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,100
Pigs in a blanket.

595
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Pigs in a blanket.

596
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,100
Now how'd you get here ?

597
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,200
How'd you get here ?

598
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,900
Billy Ray was killed by
an ice pick in Baltimore.

599
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,800
We asked around.

600
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,500
Was it Hugh Kennedy that
bundled you up in a carpet ?

601
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
Look, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation

602
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,400
with civilians, all right ?
So just cut me out of here.

603
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,100
Hey, what are you doing
with my gun ? Put that down.

604
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,900
Okay, time to step out
of your comfort zone, people.

605
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
What comfort zone ?

606
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,800
We've stopped working.
I'd like to start again.

607
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,200
We process evidence.

608
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,900
There's no more evidence
for us to process.

609
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He's right. We process, Booth interprets.

610
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,600
I'd like to give it a try.

611
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,700
Yeah, we suck at interpretation.

612
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,700
We absolutely blow.

613
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,900
Um, what do you want us to do ?

614
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,000
Work what we know.

615
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,800
McKenna was probably killed by Kennedy.

616
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,000
Booth ran afoul of Kennedy.

617
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:45,799
I'm with you.

618
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm with you, not ahead of you.

619
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,100
Okay, is there any forensic
evidence on our victim

620
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
that might lead
to Kennedy and Booth ?

621
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,400
Yeah, I mean,
I've finished the inventory

622
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,700
on McKenna's tracksuit.

623
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,000
There were flakes of tobacco,

624
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,600
fibers from the upholstery

625
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,600
of a Crown Victoria,

626
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,400
popcorn, chocolate,

627
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,500
a host of other wool
and cotton threads.

628
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,900
Okay, what does that tell us ?

629
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
That the man was a pig ?

630
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
All right, look, there were also

631
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,300
cellulose fibers consistent
with newsprint,

632
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,300
gum from a number
of different mouths.

633
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,300
Uh, he had dried chunks
of human mucous,

634
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,000
a half dozen filaments of nylon

635
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,300
consistent with women's hosiery.

636
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,300
Oh ! Uh, Kennedy
was a transvestite.

637
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,400
Keep going.

638
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,600
The rest was just waxy buildup

639
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,400
from soap or upholstery cleaner.

640
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,400
Let's assume all this adds up to a place.

641
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,300
Crime scene.

642
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,800
Close your eyes

643
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,100
and imagine the smell of all those things.

644
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,700
Tobacco, snot,

645
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,700
gum,

646
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
popcorn,

647
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,100
a lot of clothing, chocolate...

648
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,100
A porno movie theater !

649
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,300
You can't smoke at the movies.

650
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
I don't know about porno.

651
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,700
Upholstery cleaner,
Crown Victoria...

652
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,300
I got it.

653
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,400
A taxi cab.

654
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,900
McKenna was killed in a taxi cab.

655
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Yes.

656
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Where are you going ?

657
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,500
To tell the FBI

658
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,500
they're looking for a one-legged
cabbie in Baltimore.

659
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,700
You know, you guys,
it's not like

660
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
we all know each other off
the field, so...

661
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,200
But you know a man with
a prosthetic leg ?

662
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,600
Uh... yeah, I've seen him around.

663
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
We need his name.

664
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
No, honey, he'd be using a fake name.

665
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,600
No, we need to know where he lives.

666
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Well, maybe he's listed
under his fake name.

667
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,700
He's too careful for that.

668
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,400
He drives a cab.

669
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,700
How do you know that ?

670
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,800
My associates are very good, Dad.

671
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,500
Can I ask a question ?

672
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,700
Do you guys have any, like,
official I.D. or anything ?

673
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,700
- I can have the FBI here in 20 minutes.
- No, no, no.

674
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,700
- Screw the FBI.
- No, no, no !

675
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,700
Hold on ! Easy !

676
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:50,599
Take it easy, pal.

677
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
- Where does he live ?
- I don't know !

678
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,200
- Dad !
- No !

679
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,500
All right, all right !
Halton Inn on Decatur.

680
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,600
- No, no, no !
- Dad, he told us !

681
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,500
Are you lying to me ? Because
if you are, I'll know it !

682
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,200
Halton Inn on Decatur,
just past the tracks. Easy.

683
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,000
Wha... ? !

684
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
What's that all about ?

685
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,900
Thank you.

686
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,300
You're welcome. Your dad's a psycho,

687
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,600
by the way. You have no idea.

688
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,500
Do you have a one-legged
old man staying here ?

689
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,500
Give me 40 bucks.

690
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,900
Room number, please.

691
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,300
Dad !

692
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,100
I... I have money.

693
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,600
Dad, look out !

694
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
Who is she ?

695
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,600
I don't think she's going
to tell us.

696
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,500
Come on, help me !

697
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,400
Pull ! Pull !

698
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,300
Hey. Hey, listen to me.
I like you.

699
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,500
But if you make
another move on me,

700
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,400
I will hurt you. You understand ?

701
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,100
If her name's Veleska,
she's the same bounty hunter

702
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,500
who brought in Kennedy's leg.

703
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,500
How'd you find him ?

704
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
It's not that hard
to find a one-legged,

705
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
old, white hit man in Baltimore.

706
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Why is she after him ?

707
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,600
She has to make sure that Kennedy

708
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,000
stays gone. I helped

709
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,700
a wanted fugitive evade arrest.

710
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm not going to jail.

711
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,200
What have you got ?

712
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,200
It's a left anterior molar.

713
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,000
It's Booth's tooth.

714
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:28,499
Where's Booth ?

715
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,600
Temperance, honey !

716
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,200
Kennedy has Booth, Dad.

717
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,300
He's got Booth ! Okay.

718
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,500
Perhaps he didn't see Kennedy.

719
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,700
Yeah ? How'd you come to that thought ?

720
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,899
Well, Kennedy would have left him

721
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,400
with an ice pick
protruding from his head.

722
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,400
Just one simple question, big dog.

723
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
Did you see Kennedy ?

724
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,500
Well, we could get our own ice pick.

725
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,400
Make it look like Kennedy killed him.

726
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,800
You know we can't let you live, right ?

727
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,100
You've been struck and restrained.

728
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Technically, kidnapping
a federal agent is as bad

729
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
as murdering him these days.

730
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
How would you like to kill him ?

731
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,200
First, I got to know for sure
if Kennedy is dead or alive.

732
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,000
Good luck with that one, big dog.

733
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,900
Oh, big dog.

734
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I suppose we could do that thing
that McKenna used to do,

735
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,600
but I'd need a blowtorch and
a sharpened screwdriver.

736
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,000
Just tell us.

737
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,900
Woof.

738
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,300
Cute. Oh !

739
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
- Must be his kid.
- Yeah.

740
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,800
Head like a anvil.

741
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,600
I hurt my hand.

742
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
All right.

743
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm gonna let you take
a look at your sweet boy,

744
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,100
consign his face into your memory,

745
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,000
and then I'm gonna ask you which
one of your eyes you like best.

746
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,200
Definitely Booth's tooth.

747
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,400
I knew it.

748
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Brennan...

749
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
You're not alone in this.

750
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,600
I know I'm not alone.

751
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,400
We all want to find Booth.

752
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I know.

753
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,500
This is one of those times when
I have no idea what's happening.

754
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,300
Brennan, wait.

755
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,200
- I have to go, Ange.
- What's going on ?

756
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,400
I've got to find Booth.

757
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,600
I'm coming with you. No.

758
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,700
I can't fight or shoot a gun,

759
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,100
but if something bad happens,
I can spit with deadly accuracy.

760
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Thanks, but no.

761
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,000
Why can't you tell me ?

762
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,700
By definition, I can't tell you.

763
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,700
All right, all right, Hodgins
is outside in his fastest car.

764
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,300
It's Italian.

765
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
One call and he follows you
everywhere.

766
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:54,399
Angela...

767
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,300
All right, you're after
a crazy, old, ice pick hit man

768
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
who has Booth.

769
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,600
You need help.

770
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,500
Look at my face.

771
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,600
Do you really see me backing down ?

772
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I... I already have help, Ange.

773
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,000
From who ?

774
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,600
From someone worse than Kennedy.

775
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,200
Are you serious ?

776
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,200
Don't say it.

777
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,700
- You're father is helping you ?
- I have to go.

778
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Dad !

779
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,700
Was it Booth's tooth ?

780
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,100
Yes. Stop that.

781
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,900
What are you doing ?

782
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,900
Well, we have to know for sure
if Kennedy is alive or dead.

783
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean, what if she and
her friends took Booth ?

784
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,900
If this bothers you,
maybe you should go.

785
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,100
No, alpha male, man of action...

786
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,900
I... I get it.

787
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,600
Now, tell us.

788
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,700
Okay... okay...

789
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,000
Kennedy is alive.

790
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
I was chasing him for the bail.

791
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,300
He was smarter than me,
and he gave me a choice:

792
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,300
help him fake his death
or die myself.

793
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,100
Where'd you get the body ?

794
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,300
We stole some dead old geezer
from a mortuary in Charleston.

795
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,900
Where is my partner ?

796
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,800
When I got here, no one was here.

797
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
I swear.

798
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,000
What do we do with her ?

799
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,400
The room is paid for through
the end of the week.

800
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,200
Kennedy does not have Booth.

801
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,200
How do you know ?

802
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,300
He's only got one leg.

803
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,800
So ?

804
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,200
Well, so he's retired.

805
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,200
He's like me.

806
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,400
He just... he just
wants to disappear.

807
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,100
Then who's got Booth ?

808
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,100
Well, there's only one other
significant player in all this.

809
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,800
What am I going to do with you
when I get to the lab ?

810
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,200
I'll just take a nap
here in the car.

811
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,800
Awfully exciting day for
an old guy like me.

812
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Booth is being held
by Melvin Gallagher.

813
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,400
That's a leap. How do you know ?

814
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,600
Can we just go with this, please ?

815
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,600
Of course not.

816
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,500
Obviously, Brennan
found out from her father...

817
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
- who is a wanted fugitive.
- Ange !

818
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,900
Now that I can go with.

819
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,900
We need to figure out where
Gallagher is holding Booth.

820
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,400
Has anybody noticed that every
time there's a panic situation,

821
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,200
all eyes turn to Hodgins ?

822
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,000
It's okay.

823
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,400
What's he supposed to do ?

824
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,400
Shoes. Shoes ?

825
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,200
Gallagher said the last
time he saw McKenna

826
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,000
he was leaving for vacation
after a tough night at work.

827
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,300
You think Gallagher might
have a place

828
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,700
he takes people for
that sort of thing ?

829
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,100
Let me go over Cement Head's
shoes... see what they tell us.

830
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone.

831
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,000
It's a solvent.

832
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,000
See if it has any specialized uses.

833
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
Also chromic

834
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,900
MEK and chromic acid are both
used to prepare metals.

835
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,800
Prepare metals for what ?

836
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,600
Coating... painting mostly.
Electroplating.

837
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,700
I'm seeing micro-thin deposits
of aluminum here.

838
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Shavings ?

839
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,500
No, it's more anodized...
vapor deposition.

840
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Gallagher flies everywhere ?

841
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,800
An aluminum propeller requires
a coating that could withstand

842
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,300
between ten and 20 tons
of centrifugal force.

843
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,200
Preferably anodized.

844
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,500
These are Gallagher's tax returns.

845
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,100
We're looking for
the purchase of any machine

846
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,500
that could be used
for anodization.

847
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,800
What, like a copier, or... ?

848
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,600
Oh, that's so cute, but no.

849
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,500
Look for the words
"lamination, electroplating."

850
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,200
"Alloy membranes,
catalytic bed reactor..."

851
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,900
"A serial thermal processor."

852
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,500
"Vacuum pyrolysis."

853
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,300
"D-330 Vacuum plating processor" ?

854
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

855
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,700
Yes, this is Dr. Brennan
at the Jeffersonian.

856
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,700
I just received a call
from Agent Booth

857
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,700
that he's being held at...

858
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,700
the Purdue Airfield
in Oakville, Virginia.

859
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,800
Send backup, I'm going in.

860
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
You just lied your ass off

861
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,500
to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

862
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
That is so hot.

863
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,300
If you lie really still,
you may not die.

864
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,600
I need your car.

865
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,300
Max Keenan, you're under arrest.

866
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,600
Not if I get the keys.

867
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,300
They're in the ignition.

868
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,300
Well, it's not like I actually
gave him the keys.

869
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,000
Why didn't you just...
just tell them about Kennedy ?

870
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,600
Well, I needed to give
you time to find me.

871
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,700
I've been tortured worse.

872
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,100
So, uh, you hear anything
from your old man ?

873
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,300
He left my car in the garage.

874
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,500
He'll be back.

875
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,600
How do you know ?

876
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,000
Max Keenan does not strike
me as the kind of guy

877
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,700
who, uh, leaves things undone.

878
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,300
Next time he shows up,
what do I do ?

879
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,700
Do I call you ?
Do I knock him on the head ?

880
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,100
What's my obligation ?

881
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,200
Well, if I were you, Bones,

882
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,500
I'd want to know what he has
to tell you about your mother.

883
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,700
But, uh... that's just me.

884
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,800
There's, uh, this old song.

885
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,800
It's called "Keep on Trying."

886
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,900
Yeah, Poco.

887
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,600
You know it ?

888
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,100
Yeah, what about it ?

889
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,200
It's a good old song, right ?

890
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,900
Right.
