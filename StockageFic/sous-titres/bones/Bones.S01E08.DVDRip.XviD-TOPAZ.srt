1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,874
So I spent the night at Todd's.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,078
You remember Todd? The bass player
with the big hands. Big, nimble hands.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,958
- I'm trying to piece together a skull.
- Greatjob.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,113
So I wake up this morning and he's
sitting there. No clothes on, just his bass.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,433
Singing to me in this low, low voice.
It was creepy.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,230
- Is this conversation really appropriate here?
- Sorry, but I'm into alive people.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,630
- Anyway, Todd has a friend.
- I thought you said he was creepy.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,109
Todd, not the friend.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,078
- Good news.
- I hope this is work-related.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,838
The <i>Anthropology Journal</i> is publishing our
piece on the evolution of the coronal suture.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,593
Worthy interruption.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,308
- You're meant to bump my fist with yours.
- Why?

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,157
I'm told it's a widely acknowledged
gesture of mutual success.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,549
I love it when you impersonate earthlings.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,519
This is weird. There's some guy
in the lounge who asked me to give you this.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,831
Is he alive?
This is an excellent start to a relationship.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,309
I didn't put a mirror underneath his nose.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,279
He said you'd know
who he was when you opened it.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,236
OK, a guy who gets her to stop working?
This I have to see.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,590
- You left it at my place.
- Three years ago.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,070
My first time in Washington.
I thought I'd return it in person.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,516
- Why didn't you say you were coming?
- What if you didn't take my call?

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,195
- You're a big important author now.
- You could come down, you know?

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,430
You could come up.

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,151
Halfway.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,958
As always.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,429
I hope you don't have any expectations.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,750
- Do you?
- Civility.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,515
- I can handle that.
- So why are you here?

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,479
George Washington University wants
me to head their anthropology department.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,233
- They'd be lucky to get you.
- They tried you first.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,790
- I already had ajob.
- This is like watching cars mate.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,314
It's gotta be Michael. Stires.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,790
Her forensic anthropology professor
from Northwestern.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,190
- They were...
- Very, very close?

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,193
Dr Brennan is my forensic anthropology
professor. Does that mean...?

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,952
<i>(both)</i> No.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,032
It seems like we should
have dinner tonight, catch up?

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,715
- Sounds reasonable.
- Hey, Bones! Whoa.

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,155
OK. Put it here. Easy.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,394
Bones, I got a present for you. Straight out
of an illegal ravine on a dump in Fairfax.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,119
Our forensic people
confirmed it's human matter.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,398
So, rather than open it and risk being trashed
for contaminating the evidence,

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,756
I decided to bring
the whole refrigerator to you.

45
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,229
What we need is a toaster oven.

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,629
Bones?

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,869
<i>(sniffs)</i>

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,349
The body's gonna be mostly decomposed.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,830
- Which is my cue to leave.
- This is where it gets fun.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,673
- All right, you can open it.
- All right.

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,711
Oh! OK. Uh... he or she?

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,628
- She.
- Late teens, early 20s.

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,030
I'm guessing she's been
in the refrigerator for a year.

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,998
Is there enough insect activity
to be more precise?

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,833
There's always enough insect activity.

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,559
Remove and clean the bones, Zack.

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,474
Michael, you can pick me up at 7:30.
I'll give you my address.

58
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,279
- Beautiful lab.
- Thanks.

59
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,920
- Old friend?
- Old teacher.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,279
They're actually going to eat dinner
after seeing this? Well, I hope it's not soup.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,558
If she was his student
and I'm her student, then it follows...

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,599
Ain't gonna happen, Zacko.
Not in this universe.

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,990
Here's a sketch of the victim. Her skull
was intact so it made it easy to work with.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,074
I just got her dental records.
Name, Maggie Schilling. 19.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Then I guess you don't need this.

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,874
She was a dancer.

67
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,349
Bone markers in her metatarsals.

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,195
How do you go from the freedom of dance
to being crammed into a refrigerator?

69
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,829
I hope she was already dead
when they shut the door.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,518
He's hotter than you said.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,033
Michael?

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,839
Any other ex-Iovers
come knocking on your door?

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,275
The "ex" in ex-Iover is not a variable.

74
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,956
- It's a constant, like the speed of light.
- Save your dirty talk for the professor.

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,955
I can assure you our relationship is purely
platonic. We share the love of science.

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,477
Neither of us has the time or inclination
for emotional complications.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,758
- Sounds very reasonable.
- I have to get this data together for Booth.

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,512
Sure.

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,873
Have a good dinner tonight.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,871
Maggie Schilling went missing
11 months ago.

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,239
Her parents got a ransom note for S1 million.
Negotiations went on for a couple of weeks.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,472
Then all contact stopped. The assumption
was that the kidnappers killed her.

83
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,120
- No visual physical trauma.
- Cause of death?

84
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,510
Not yet. But there are
stress fractures on both wrists.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,993
We're running chemical analysis and toxicity
screens on the effluent in the refrigerator.

86
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,790
- OK. You'll call me later?
- I'm not working tonight. I have a dinner.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,911
What? Wow.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,913
I just assumed that the two of you
would be eating off an autopsy table.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
- Not tonight.
- I was being...

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,951
Tomorrow's fine. Call me tomorrow.

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,109
<i>(kissing/music plays)</i>

92
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,958
- We missed our reservation.
- Ah, well.

93
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,715
That's the price we pay
for scientific exploration and discovery.

94
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,873
You realise this is just recreational, Michael.

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,636
Of course. I'm just impressed that we can pick
up where we left off like no time has passed.

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,029
Well, time is an imposed construct.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,795
It's nice to know we can rely on physics.

98
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,077
You really think you'll move here?

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,071
Depends on the offer.

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,754
I could get you a position
at the Jeffersonian.

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,230
- Working for my old student?
- Would that be a problem?

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,279
Well, we're better when we're not
vying for dominance in the same arena.

103
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,396
I can't help it if I'm usually right.

104
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,950
Does that mean you've closed the case
on that girl in the fridge?

105
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,160
I found some stress fractures on the wrist.
Not much else. But I will.

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,711
- Same old confident Brennan.
- I'm sorry. Is school in session?

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,834
Old habits die hard.

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,832
She did fight, Michael.

109
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,948
They kept her... tied up like an animal.

110
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,838
But she fought.

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,677
That's how she got those stress fractures,
because she was bound and struggling.

112
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,796
I just...

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,348
I keep seeing her face.

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,238
You know how it is.

115
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,909
Using a refrigerator to hide a body.
It's kinda perfect, isn't it?

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,073
Good way to remove the victim.
The rubber gaskets seal in the odour.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,674
Maybe the company
should use that in their ads.

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,957
- She's late. She's never late.
- You worried about her?

119
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,474
- I'm happy for her.
- Why?

120
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,235
- Remember that time you were late?
- Oh. Yeah.

121
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,436
Good morning, all.

122
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,756
<i>(Angela)</i> Hey, you can take the day off.
You deserve one day.

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,831
Michael wanted to see our equipment.

124
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,196
I'm gonna let that one go.
The guys wanted to meet him anyway.

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,955
- They could learn a lot from him.
- You were Brennars professor?

126
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,429
She was 23. An adult.

127
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,399
- That's what Clinton said.
- You run through a lot of students?

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,678
That was a long time ago. Tempe was
very advanced. More colleague than student.

129
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,354
I'm a pretty advanced student.

130
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,908
No offence, but I'm not interested.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,915
- No, uh, I meant me and her.
- Oh, burn.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,592
What have you found?

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,992
X-rays reveal low bone density and the
parathyroid hormone levels are also low.

134
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,594
There is a condition, hyperparathyroidism...

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,240
Symptoms are muscle weakness,
brittle bones.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,596
- Your struggle theory may be premature.
- I doubt that.

137
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,195
- You mean you don't want to be doubted.
- I can take it.

138
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,748
The fractures could be from her condition.

139
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,674
- Unlikely. However...
- Or unrelated nontraumatic fissures.

140
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,990
Nontraumatic? Look at these.

141
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,116
Well, it's something to consider.

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,239
You don't want to jump to conclusions.
I know you want to find who did this.

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,233
This seems like an appropriate moment
to discuss human goop.

144
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,348
Chemical analysis of the liver and kidney
tissues reveal evidence of hydromorphone.

145
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,238
- Hydromorphone?
- Also known as hospital heroin.

146
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,632
- In what kind of concentration?
- Given her size and weight, it's fatal.

147
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,029
- Where did you go to dinner?
- We stayed in.

148
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,114
We need to know if that amount was accrued
over time or was delivered in one large dose.

149
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,351
- You didn't come back to the lab, did you?
- I made a frittata.

150
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,432
Oh, wow. He cooks, too. Can we share him?

151
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,354
We need to know if it
was administered intravenously or orally.

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,876
I should go.
I'm meeting with the board at the university.

153
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,713
It was nice meeting you all.

154
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,279
What? Is it so odd for everyone
to see me with a man?

155
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,953
Print out the levels of hydromorphone
in her system.

156
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,237
Find the overload point
that caused fractures in her wrist.

157
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,316
And examine the left ilium. There seems to
be some kind of degeneration on the edge.

158
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,078
I know it sounds terrible,
but I hoped that she had just run away.

159
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,596
That way I could believe she was still alive.

160
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,912
She started turning against us in high school.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,036
Did a lot of drugs.

162
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,078
We tried to help her.
Sent her to rehab, therapy.

163
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,790
- Kids have a lot to contend with these days.
- We didn't help her, not really.

164
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,031
We had nannies to raise her
because we were so busy,

165
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,430
and we sent her to shrinks
instead of talking to her.

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,873
Don't blame yourself.

167
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,033
Environment plays a huge role
in development.

168
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,714
<i>(Booth clears his throat)</i>

169
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,509
I'd like some pictures of Maggie
so I can compare them with her remains.

170
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,717
Pictures of her dancing
would be most helpful, or swimming.

171
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,634
- How do you know she danced and swam?
- Some things can't be erased.

172
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,679
I'm sorry. But I need to ask you
about your daughter's drug problems.

173
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,914
- Do you know what she was using?
- Alcohol, ecstasy, marijuana.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,958
What about the narcotic hydromorphone?

175
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,837
Hospital heroin?

176
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,273
Doesrt sound familiar.

177
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,717
She had a thyroid condition.
Was anything prescribed for that?

178
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,598
Her endocrinologist might know.

179
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,192
<i>(Mrs Schilling)</i>
We have to find who did this to Maggie.

180
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,555
We have to do this for her.

181
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,591
Maggie's condition didn't respond to
medication. I wanted her to agree to surgery.

182
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,353
What types of medication
are we talking about?

183
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,671
Furosemide, pamidronate.
I tried various calcitonins.

184
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,591
What about hydromorphone?

185
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,117
There is no pain with hyperparathyroidism,
but I knew Maggie had a drug problem.

186
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,149
She was interested in getting opiates.
She bribed my office manager for samples.

187
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,630
- I'll need your office manager's address.
- Ex-office manager.

188
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,430
She's gonna be what you call
a disgruntled employee.

189
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,115
I didn't give Maggie those samples.
She boosted them herself.

190
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,352
- Barragan blamed me so he could fire me.
- Why did he fire you?

191
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,434
Because he's a horn dog. I tried to keep
things professional. You know what I mean?

192
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,876
He said you were closer
to Maggie than any other patient.

193
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,030
- Did you meet her parents?
- Yes.

194
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,157
Then you know she was pretty much
on her own. We took her in.

195
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,232
He said you went out together.
That you took her to clubs.

196
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,515
We just felt sorry for her, you know?

197
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,797
She was Ionely
so we showed her a good time, right?

198
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,757
<i>(woman)</i> We went on a road trip.

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,913
<i>(man)</i> Yeah, the three of us
ended up in Atlantic City.

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,397
<i>(woman)</i>... pills, vodka, weed.

201
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,189
Mary wanted Maggie to go to meetings,
you know? AA.

202
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,791
That's very kind of you.
Let's talk about your new refrigerator.

203
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,118
Why?

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,352
Mainly I'd like to know
what happened to your old one.

205
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,110
<i>(woman over radio)</i>
<i>We've got the FHA coming.</i>

206
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,199
The fridge we found her in is a match
with the marks on the Costellos' floor.

207
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,149
- They're sadomasochistic fetishists.
- Yeah. Turned the basement into a fun room.

208
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,949
Seeking sexual gratification
through the manipulation of power.

209
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,158
Probably the oldest of fetishes - master-slave.
It's all about dominance.

210
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,676
This comes up when the bloom
goes off the rose. Know what I mean?

211
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,878
- I don't know what you mean.
- When it gets old, you need to spice it up.

212
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,077
- When the sex is good, you don't need help.
- That's for sure.

213
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,798
- I'm sorry?
- I was agreeing.

214
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,836
Well, don't. It freaks me out.

215
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,516
I'm just saying that I've no inclination toward
pain or dominance when it comes to sex.

216
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,431
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

217
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,432
Because you can be very bossy.

218
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,748
Look at him, huh? Ooh, look at him.
All smiley. I bet he just loves these things.

219
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,035
These could explain the fractures.

220
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,797
Her bones were brittle from the disease.
Struggling would cause the cracks we saw.

221
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,269
The handcuffs are consistent
with the injuries to her wrists.

222
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,999
Maybe she wanted to be cuffed.
Think about that?

223
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,119
Here's what I was thinking.
Female - dominant, strapped for cash -

224
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,112
meets wealthy teenager
on the outs with her parents,

225
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,033
convinces her husband
to hold her for ransom.

226
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,556
- Any proof? Or is it story time?
- You feed her pills to keep her quiet.

227
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,713
The negotiations drag on. She dies
of an overdose before an exchange is made.

228
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,874
You seal her up in a refrigerator and you and
your honey go back to playing "tie me up".

229
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,033
<i>(man)</i> Maggie was an adult. We don't deny
she was in the house, even cuffed.

230
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,272
We don't deny there was a legal
sexual relationship which got rough.

231
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,273
- But Maggie was a willing participant.
- And enthusiastic.

232
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,477
You have no evidence my clients killed her.

233
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,394
It's weird for you, huh?
Being the one that's all locked up.

234
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,756
The way you come at me,
are you threatened or do I turn you on?

235
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,355
Now I'm the one who's hating psychology.

236
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,073
If you don't have anything but those cuffs,
my clients will be out of here in 24 hours.

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,555
I was right about how she got the fractures.

238
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,668
- I don't have the time. I have an appointment.
- The university can wait a few minutes.

239
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,399
It's with someone they want me to meet.

240
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,712
- If we start debating evidence, I'll be late.
- There's nothing to debate.

241
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,634
I can prove that Maggie Schilling
was bound in fur-covered handcuffs.

242
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,554
We found strands of matching fur
embedded in the scaphoid and the lunate.

243
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,996
- You can't prove it was involuntarily.
- Oh, yes, I can.

244
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,470
- It's not a competition.
- No. The Olympics are a competition.

245
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,391
Ours is a struggle to the death.

246
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,040
Want to bet dinner?

247
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,999
Yes. If we make it to a restaurant.

248
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,548
- Bet's on. You got 10 minutes.
- OK.

249
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,952
<i>(Bones)</i> Pull up the frontal and lateral
view of the victim's lower fibulas.

250
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,110
You trained her well, Doc.

251
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,113
She's brilliant. Little cocky, though.

252
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,111
Yeah. Tell me about it.

253
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,479
- <i>(Zack)</i> Here's the left... Here's the right.
- Good partner. What you see is what you get.

254
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,518
That's a rare quality.

255
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,672
- This is between us, isn't it?
- <i>(Bones)</i> Michael?

256
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,110
Dr Brennan found marks
on the medial malleoli, left and right.

257
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,269
Her legs were bound.

258
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,238
Mirror erosion patterns
from the bones rubbing.

259
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,599
If this were the result of sex games, then
the legs, they wouldn't be bound together.

260
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,074
Come on. Looking for a little nookie,
the last thing you tie together are the legs.

261
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,912
I'm not convinced.

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,549
Brittle bones from her condition.
It could've happened in a short time.

263
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,110
We also found inflammation
on her right humerus and ilium.

264
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,079
The abnormalities show pathosis
from lying in one position for a long time.

265
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,720
The only explanation is long-term bondage.

266
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,429
Decreased bone density
could've caused it. This isn't definitive.

267
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,629
- There's a nice French place I'd like to try.
- I still have five minutes.

268
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,917
- My department still works with Polaroids.
- So what do you think?

269
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,629
Very Impressive.
Especially to the nonprofessional.

270
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,076
You want science?
Give me the estimated time of captivity.

271
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,197
Approximately three weeks.

272
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,838
OK, here are your affected areas.
Now, during an advanced time simulation...

273
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,109
You're winning, right?

274
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,388
Can I see your findings?

275
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,034
This appears to be indisputable.

276
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,749
The narcotic in her system
was not from recreational drug abuse.

277
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,310
The inflammation would've been painful.
The pain would've increased.

278
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,279
They upped the dose of hydromorphone
till they gave her too much. She died.

279
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,920
Those people bound and killed that girl.

280
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,356
I yield. French restaurant?

281
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,556
I'm more in the mood for Italian.

282
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,633
I need to put together the evidence
for Booth to deliver to the US Attorney.

283
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,393
I'll meet you at your place.

284
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,194
Good work.

285
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,068
Do you really think
he can handle your success?

286
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,271
Because of today?
No, we've always been competitive.

287
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,797
I know. But he's a man. And his student,
a woman, has surpassed him.

288
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,474
Michael is extremely secure, Ange.

289
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,393
Honey, when you stuck it to him
today, he was upset.

290
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,155
It was a healthy debate between scientists.
You don't know Michael.

291
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,550
I know men. I know what happens
when two people sleep together.

292
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,519
- It's not like that. We're colleagues.
- Colleagues with benefits.

293
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,878
I don't know what that means,
but Michael and I are not involved.

294
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,875
I'm sorry if it's difficult for you to understand,
but what we have isn't traditional.

295
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,590
Don't talk to me about traditional. OK?
I've dated circus people.

296
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,879
You and Michael, you have something.
And that's OK. That's good, even.

297
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,757
Just be honest about it.

298
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,592
Bones?

299
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,151
Judge is holding them without bail.
The US Attorney wants to send you flowers.

300
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,629
Facts are facts.

301
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,475
Bones, I have to ask. How much
have you been sharing with the professor?

302
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,915
- None of your business.
- I mean, on the case.

303
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,070
I've bounced everything off him. Why?

304
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,833
- Keep him out of it from now on.
- Out of it? Why?

305
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,388
You know that appointment
that he had today?

306
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,359
- Yeah.
- He met with the Costellos' lawyer.

307
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,352
Michael is their expert witness.

308
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,399
It's his job to tear apart
the case that you've built.

309
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,039
How could I not be upset?
Basically you were spying on me.

310
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,998
Spying? It's a criminal proceeding.

311
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,629
You're required by law to disclose
your findings to the defence.

312
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,190
I only have to provide the raw facts
we'll enter into evidence,

313
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,909
not the process by which
I arrived at those facts.

314
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,878
I apologise. That nuance had escaped me.

315
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,111
Why didn't you just tell me, Michael?

316
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,795
The defence doesn't have to
tell the prosecution anything.

317
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,314
It's grounds for a mistrial.

318
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,633
Look, I've never done this before. You're
the teacher in this situation. I'm the student.

319
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,836
A little competitive.

320
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,037
Part of the job at the university
is to be an expert witness.

321
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,352
And, yes, I would like to do thatjob
at least as well as you.

322
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,878
But if you feel I've overstepped some
boundary here, I'll back out of the case.

323
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,837
No.

324
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,276
But if you stay on,
you have to move back to the hotel.

325
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,033
- Really?
- Yes.

326
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,799
Well, would I have to do it tonight?
Or should I order another bottle of wine?

327
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,838
I suppose tomorrow would be soon enough.

328
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,029
I apologise, Tempe.

329
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,034
- He still at it?
- Yep. And it is fascinating.

330
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,875
- I want you to keep an eye on him.
- That's not going to be a problem.

331
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,519
Did you just give them
a sign of encouragement?

332
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,277
It's the first time I've looked at them without
imagining Moe knocking their heads together.

333
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,874
Booth, you're accessing your inner squint.

334
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,511
You listed a fracture on the right femur.
It looks minor. Do you consider it evidence?

335
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,559
Dr Brennars conclusions
belong to the prosecution.

336
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,950
I don't want to destroy your case.
I'm trying to get a sense...

337
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,669
Of her interpretations of data,
to which you are not privy, Dr Stires.

338
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,709
I understand the game the doctor is playing.
I'm capable of dealing with him myself.

339
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,519
I'm sure he's thrown
by findings he'd have missed.

340
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,670
This is not about you and Dr Stires.

341
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,514
This is about our reputation
as a source of expert witnesses.

342
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,273
OK, I'm... I'm on my own.

343
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,638
Oh, in the interest of fairness,
I am willing to share my thoughts with you.

344
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,598
I red-pencilled a few things.

345
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,117
- You corrected my findings?
- Consider it an opposing opinion.

346
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,397
My findings are based on facts,
Michael, not opinions.

347
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,677
You've finished
your allotted time with the remains.

348
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,276
- I'd like my people to get back to work.
- Thank you.

349
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,518
- You OK?
- Why wouldn't I be?

350
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,718
Cos the Nutty Professor's grading your paper.
What'd he give you, anyway?

351
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,828
- I was always happy with a B.
- Well, I never got a B and I never will.

352
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,150
That's my girl.

353
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,311
US Attorney Levitt. Jury consultant
Joy Deaver. Dr Temperance Brennan.

354
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,710
Nice to meet you. I looked at your findings.
We're in good shape.

355
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,678
- Thank you.
- Butjuries don't like you.

356
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,399
- Excuse me?
- I've seen you testify before.

357
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,517
- You come off cold and aloof. I want...
- Cold and aloof?

358
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,549
Don't interrupt. You sound arrogant. Don't
front-Ioad your testimony with technical crap.

359
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,471
This is not the best approach.

360
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,632
I'm a technical witness.
I've testified in over 30 trials.

361
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,192
The experts you've come up against are
dry and boring. Have you seen their expert?

362
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,239
- She's seen him, Ms Deaver.
- Well, then you understand my concern.

363
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,678
Professor Stires is open,
charming, great-Iooking.

364
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,955
Jury's gonna love him. I love him.

365
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,999
This isn't a personality contest.
It's about data we present to the jury.

366
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,275
You're kidding, right?

367
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,672
The women on the jury won't listen
to a word he says. They'll be undressing him.

368
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,639
I don't want the men on the jury
to be putting more clothes on you.

369
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,191
Wear blue. It suggests truth. Make eye contact
with the jury. Lose the necklace.

370
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,953
The Costellos murdered Maggie Schilling.

371
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,759
The forensic data proves it.
That should be enough.

372
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,035
- But it isn't enough.
- That's great.

373
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,510
We'll take that under consideration. Thanks.

374
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,270
Why didn't she say anything about you?
You can be irritating.

375
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,430
Bones, she's an expertjust like you.

376
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,913
She has an obvious personality disorder,
but she wants to help. Just try.

377
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,275
- OK, sure.
- Good.

378
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,879
I can do it.

379
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,918
Mary Costello lured Maggie Schilling
into her home with the promise of drugs.

380
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,797
She was not held against her will.

381
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,237
She was, in fact, orchestrating the plot
to extort money from her own parents,

382
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,117
from whom she was estranged.

383
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,272
They bound her for weeks, the pain growing.

384
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,272
And to keep her quiet,
they pumped her full of drugs.

385
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,158
She died from a self-administered overdose.

386
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,279
After killing their captive and ruining
their chances of getting a ransom,

387
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,796
they stuffed Miss Schilling's body
into the refrigerator.

388
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,269
Knowing they could be accused of murder,

389
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,749
my clients panicked
and disposed of her body.

390
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,755
While their behaviour might be ill-advised,
they are neither kidnappers nor murderers.

391
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,992
Samples of hydromorphone
were found in the Costellos' belongings.

392
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,356
The lot numbers match those
that were in Dr Barragars office.

393
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,231
When I went to the Costellos' kitchen, I saw
marks from the old refrigerator on the floor.

394
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,916
It was like these marks,
they screamed at me:

395
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,594
"These people, they did it."

396
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,831
- Objection.
- Sustained. Just the facts, Agent Booth.

397
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,275
Sorry. The receipt for the new refrigerator

398
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,512
was dated two days after the negotiations
broke off with the kidnappers.

399
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,434
I mean, you figure it out.
I know. I'm sorry.

400
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,193
Any evidence
she wasrt a willing participant

401
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,114
in sexual activity involving
those cuffs and other paraphernalia?

402
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,639
Winding up in the fridge tells me that she
really wasrt that into it. No direct evidence.

403
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,349
Any evidence my clients forced
Miss Schilling to take that narcotic?

404
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,557
I'll leave those answers for the experts.

405
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,669
Sciarids, also known as dark-wing fungus
gnats, went through several life cycles.

406
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,479
Also present were <i>Acaridae</i> and <i>Anotidae</i>.

407
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,112
But the most interesting find was not a bug
at all, but was common bread mould.

408
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,955
All this data led to the same conclusion.
She was in that refrigerator between ten...

409
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,353
Even though we had medical and dental
records to identify Maggie Schilling,

410
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,638
I was also asked to do a sketch
based on the architecture of her skull.

411
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,314
That's sort of what I do.

412
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,559
Turned out pretty accurate,
if I do say so myself.

413
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,430
She was a pretty girl.
That's why I drew her smiling.

414
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,876
It... itjust seemed right.

415
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,078
I'm really sorry for what happened to her.
And I hope my work helps you.

416
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,230
The gelatinous puddle was tissue

417
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,030
from which our labs extracted
and analysed liver and kidney samples.

418
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,592
The hydromorphone level
in her liver was 8.4 and 6.6 in her kidney.

419
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,310
Death occurs at 7.7 and 5.2 respectively.

420
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,675
And why would they give her this narcotic?

421
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,470
Short-term periosteal reaction
on the right proximal lateral humerus

422
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,835
was consistent with a bound individual.

423
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,913
- So to rephrase...
- Wrist restraints with hyperparathyroidism

424
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,348
would account for the stress fractures on the
distal anterior surface of the radii and ulnae.

425
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,956
Her bones broke
because she was struggling to free herself.

426
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,679
Yeah. I believe I just said that.

427
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,195
Thank you, Doctor. That'll be all for now.

428
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,829
I'd like a recess with the right
to recall the witness, Your Honour.

429
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,993
OK. We'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

430
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,595
She can't connect.
Those killers are gonna walk.

431
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,591
- It was well-reasoned.
- Yeah, it was very scientific.

432
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,310
You didn't listen to a thing I said.
You were like Klaatu the robot up there.

433
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,518
- Would it have killed you to speak English?
- I wore blue, I looked at the jury.

434
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,116
- For a people person, you're a little rude.
- When did the facts stop working for you?

435
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,590
I have no problem with facts
as long as the jury understands them.

436
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,878
- You underestimate their intelligence.
- You overestimate their ability to stay awake.

437
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,990
When these S-and-M perverts walk on this,
it'll be on your head.

438
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,833
Can you believe that?

439
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,718
- What? You agree with her?
- Well, not entirely.

440
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,439
Not entirely? So that means partly.

441
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,671
I was perfectly clear.
Didrt you think I was clear?

442
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,069
Sometimes. And...

443
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,199
sometimes you were... a little hard to follow.

444
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,512
- What are you talking about? When?
- When you were... talking.

445
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,751
I know you care about this case.
You should let them see that.

446
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,876
- I should perform?
- A little bit.

447
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,111
See how I portrayed myself
as a no-nonsense, tough cop?

448
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,794
- You are a no-nonsense, tough cop.
- Exactly.

449
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,713
It wouldn't hurt
if the jury saw who you really are.

450
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,148
I don't know who you think that is, Booth,
because this is who I really am. Just this.

451
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,232
God! Sorry.

452
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,880
I'm OK. Are you?

453
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,952
Sure. Well...

454
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,033
Truthfully, this whole thing
is pretty awkward, don't you think?

455
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,159
- We're just doing ourjob. You'll be fine.
- They have this jury consultant.

456
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,233
They want to turn this into a melodrama.
They don't know what a scientist is.

457
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,880
- We're not allowed to talk about this.
- I know.

458
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:38,677
- My guy's gonna freak if he sees us talking.
- Sure. Sorry.

459
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,873
In my opinion, the levels of hydromorphone
are more consistent with recreational use.

460
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,633
Could you explain?

461
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,716
I might not use all the technical language,
but I'll try to make myself understood.

462
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,758
Objection.
The witness is impugning another witness.

463
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,990
Sustained.
Continue.

464
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,833
I'm sorry.
I, um, I don't do this professionally.

465
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,708
People who need to relieve physical pain
stop after the pain disappears.

466
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,031
It doesn't take more than
an average dose to accomplish that.

467
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,078
Drug users are trying to bury emotional pain,

468
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,675
which means that they will medicate
until they feel nothing.

469
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,638
So they tend to overdose,
like Maggie Schilling.

470
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,508
Sometimes intense chronic pain
does not respond to medication.

471
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,192
I'll bring it up.

472
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,149
What about the claim that her pain was
linked to being bound for a length of time?

473
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,835
The Costellos have stipulated
that they bound Miss Schilling

474
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,832
as part of their rather unorthodox sexual life.

475
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,232
And Dr Brennan agrees
that Miss Schilling had hyperpara...

476
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,110
Well, if I can simplify, a thyroid condition
that could weaken her bones.

477
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,839
No need to look for bondage scenarios.

478
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,876
He's ignoring all the facts.

479
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,397
With respect to my former student,
Dr Brennan,

480
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,916
I don't know why
she became a forensic anthropologist.

481
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,879
She seems to have ignored all but
her preconceived notions about the case.

482
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,076
- Objection.
- Sustained.

483
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,517
- I apologise.
- Do you disagree with Dr Brennars data?

484
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,912
Well, sometimes doctors can use data
to confuse a very simple situation.

485
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,673
I mean, I'm a doctor
and I could hardly follow her.

486
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,356
This case is about people,
not incomprehensible technical jargon.

487
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,273
These people
shouldn't be convicted of murder

488
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,989
- just because Dr Brennan sounds smart.
- Your Honour, really!

489
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,358
The jury will disregard Professor Stires'
personal view of Dr Brennan.

490
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,955
Court will adjourn until 9am tomorrow.

491
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,270
Don't worry about a thing, OK?

492
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,875
He wasrt acting as an objective expert.
He was making up a story.

493
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,554
The judge chastised him. That'll work for us.

494
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,313
The hell it will. The jury loves Stires.

495
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,155
He looks like a regular guy who's can't speak
the truth because stupid rules get in the way.

496
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,470
The rules ofjurisprudence aren't stupid.

497
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,792
Dr Brennan, you need to learn
the difference between reality and perception.

498
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,440
- A trial is all about perception.
- Wow.

499
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,637
You're the reason civilisation is declining.

500
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,951
- Talk to her.
- I kind of agree with her.

501
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,392
- Thanks.
- I don't agree with you, I just don't like her.

502
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,358
Put me back on the stand.
I can rebut everything he said.

503
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,637
- She can do this.
- I'll think about it.

504
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,790
I've never been in this position.
I need to get back up there.

505
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,792
All right. Just let me talk to him.

506
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,314
Trial going badly?

507
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,070
You don't usually cram at the last minute.

508
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,596
The jury likes Michael better than
they like me. Apparently that's a problem.

509
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,118
Are they stupid?

510
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,111
Compared to you, yes, they are.

511
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,957
However, compared to you,
most of the world is a little stupid.

512
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,074
You have many skills, Temperance.

513
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,596
Not one includes communicating
with the average person,

514
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,148
which is exactly whatjuries are made of.

515
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,993
I am a better forensic anthropologist
than Michael.

516
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,799
Which is why two years ago
I hired you instead of him.

517
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,235
- Michael applied for this job?
- Yes.

518
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,709
- His credentials are better than mine.
- Yes.

519
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,194
But you are the more rational,
reasoned, empirical scientist.

520
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,510
And you care.

521
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,038
And if he tries to convince you otherwise,
tell him to go to hell.

522
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,475
- Is it safe to approach, Dr Brennan?
- Don't charm, Michael.

523
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,472
- You're taking this personally.
- I should be rational?

524
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,913
- Yes.
- Go to hell.

525
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,117
You're not the only one with a consultant.
I listened to mine.

526
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,714
He told me to create reasonable doubt. I did.

527
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,554
This one isn't about winning a dinner
or showing up your former student.

528
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,235
It's about putting two people away
who murdered a 19-year-old girl.

529
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,151
You can't personalise the work.

530
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,028
Do you remember standing in a mass grave
guarded by soldiers?

531
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,511
We knew they were the same soldiers
who killed the people we were digging up.

532
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,594
I was just a student. I was scared.
I turned to you and I asked, "What do we do?"

533
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,353
That was a different place and context.

534
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,230
You said, "We tell the truth. We do not flinch."

535
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,595
You flinched, Michael.

536
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,790
I can't ask her that.
The line of questioning isn't relevant.

537
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,838
He brought it up,
so legally you can reintroduce it.

538
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,233
- I don't see how it's gonna change anything.
- Trust me, it will.

539
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,550
Am I testifying?

540
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,433
Only a prolonged struggle,
not sexual activity,

541
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,798
would cause a tearing of the gastrocnemius
muscle on the distal portion of the bone.

542
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,599
- So, in lay terms...?
- The muscle avulsed.

543
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,433
- She pulled a muscle.
- Because she was immobilised.

544
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,308
- Tied up.
- These conditions have to be contextualised.

545
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,516
The inflammation on the ilium,

546
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,550
<i>(fading)</i> the stress fractures on the wrists
have to be contextualised, the...

547
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,996
Dr Brennan, why did you become
a forensic anthropologist?

548
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,069
Pardon?

549
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,311
There must be a reason you chose this
out of the other careers

550
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,709
someone of your intelligence could choose.

551
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,268
Was there some emotional reason, perhaps?

552
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,069
- Objection. Relevance?
- How does this pertain to the case?

553
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,232
Dr Brennan is cold,
distant and alienating, Your Honour.

554
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,199
I need the jury to know why, so
they might be willing to accept her testimony.

555
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,956
- Her personality issues are not relevant.
- They opened up this line of questioning.

556
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,352
Dr Stires wondered why Dr Brennan
became a forensic anthropologist.

557
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,670
The defence must've thought it relevant.

558
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,231
Sorry, Mr Meredith.
You did raise the issue. Overruled.

559
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,515
You may continue, Mr Levitt.

560
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,071
Dr Brennan, your parents
disappeared when you were 15.

561
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,393
And no one's ever found out
what happened to them. Isn't that correct?

562
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,355
Please, answer the question, Dr Brennan.

563
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,750
- That's correct.
- It must be very painful.

564
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,277
Is it fair to say you've tried to solve
the mystery of their loss your whole life?

565
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,032
Do I want answers? Yes.

566
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,194
As how that has affected my behaviour,
I don't put much stock in psychology.

567
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,589
Is that why you wrap yourself
in technospeak?

568
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,194
So the victims
don't remind you of your parents?

569
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,919
My job doesn't depend on how I feel.

570
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,389
But it's informed by it.

571
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,314
Or are you as cold
and unfeeling as you seem?

572
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,358
I see a face on every skull.

573
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,275
I can look at their bones and tell you
how they walked, where they hurt.

574
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,639
Maggie Schilling is real to me.
The pain she suffered was real.

575
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,429
Her hip was being eaten away
by infection from lying on her side.

576
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,595
Sure, like Dr Stires said, the disease could
contribute to that if you take it out of context.

577
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,117
But you can't break
Maggie Schilling down into little pieces.

578
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,988
She was a whole person
who fought to free herself.

579
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,789
Her wrists were broken
from struggling against the handcuffs.

580
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,316
Her ankles were ground together
because her feet were tied.

581
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,188
Her side, her hip and her shoulder
were being eaten away by infection.

582
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,990
The more she struggled, the more pain she
was in. They gave her drugs to keep her quiet.

583
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,878
They gave her so much it killed her.

584
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,193
These facts can't be ignored
or dismissed because you think I'm...

585
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,158
boring, or obnoxious, because I don't matter.

586
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,951
What I feel doesn't matter.
Only she matters. Only Maggie.

587
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,148
Tempe. Tempe.

588
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,356
Tempe, I'm sorry.

589
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,829
What can I do?

590
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,469
Bones. The Costellos are trying to cop a plea
to a charge that won't mean the death penalty.

591
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,233
- They know they're going down.
- You had no right.

592
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,154
- There are things that are private.
- Yeah. Maybe you're right.

593
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,554
But you know what? This was my case, too.
All right? So, nothing personal?

594
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,638
Guilty on all counts.

595
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,551
Yeah.

596
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,430
- So he owes you another dinner, huh?
- No. I won't be seeing him any more.

597
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,831
Sorry.

598
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,270
I was foolish to be so open with him.
It was irrational.

599
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,114
- You know how you get when you're tired.
- Yeah.

600
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,431
- You want to go out? Grab a drink?
- Um...

601
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,909
I think I just want to work.

602
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,797
OK.

603
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,317
- Hey, Bones.
- What is it? I'm not feeling very forgiving.

604
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,631
Yeah, I know, but... we have a case.

605
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,589
Victim is an adult male, 35 to 40 years old.

606
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,753
From the pattern of the burning, I'd say
an accelerant was used. Hand me my bag?

607
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,512
Yeah. Sure.

608
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,034
Listen, do you want my coat?
It's cold up here.

609
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,193
- If I did, I'd ask for it.
- Yeah. Sorry.

610
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,999
And, uh... I'm sorry.

611
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,959
You had something to accomplish. You found
a logical way of getting what you needed.

612
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,878
I probably would've done the same thing.
