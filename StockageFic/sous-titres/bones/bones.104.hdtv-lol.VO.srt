1
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,813
We already know
what killed the bear.

2
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:09,464
Who's the vet
here, Sherman?

3
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:12,139
You are, Denise.
Who's the park ranger?

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,459
That'd be you, Sherman.

5
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:15,242
That's why I know
what killed him.

6
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:18,869
Scared camper drilled him
with a Winchester Magnum .338.

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,905
I get it-- you're afraid I'm not showing
respect to the bears spirits.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,911
Because I have better
things to do

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,825
than wait around for you to
tell me what i alread know.

10
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,447
The law says I have to send in
as much information as I can.

11
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:33,310
Age, weight, what he last ate...
Ooh, yummy.

12
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:36,124
Hot dogs, refried beans...

13
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:39,026
What's that?

14
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:42,426
Beef jerky.

15
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:43,616
Beef jerky?

16
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:47,522
Yeah, he was in hyperphagia, eating everything
he could find before going into hibernation.

17
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:49,308
What?

18
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:51,759
Sherman, this is...

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,305
Oh, God.

20
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:11,913
Looks human to me.
- Sorry.

21
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:13,428
What's the deal?

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,249
Found in eastern
Washington state.

23
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:17,164
Where?

24
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:18,485
Inside a bear.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,609
No, I mean...

26
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:21,123
Inside a bear?

27
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:25,575
An autopsy revealed more bone fragments
in the bear's stomach and intestine.

28
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:28,179
An autopsy on an animal
is called necropsy.

29
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,359
Yeah, you know, it's pretty crucial

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,600
we get that straight right off the bat.
Meanwhile, about the dead human being?

31
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:34,663
What do you need me for?
The bear ate somebody.

32
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:36,820
26 bone fragments in total.

33
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,878
The case bumped to the Seattle field office.
They bumped it to me. Check it out.

34
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:41,495
Why'd they bump it to you?

35
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,108
Bones, I mean, do you really care about
the inner workings of the FBI office?

36
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,640
They bumped it to you
because you work with me.

37
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,010
No, they hope that you
could help ID the body.

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,330
From a hand??

39
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,279
Yeah, they have
high expectations.

40
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:00,833
Definitely human, opposable thumb,
probably male, from the size.

41
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:04,754
- Uh-oh!
- What?

42
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,668
Kerf marks. Marks made
from a cutting tool.

43
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,012
Maybe when they
cut en the bear?

44
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,874
No, it's not
a straight edge.

45
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,706
Residual
cross-section striae.

46
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:18,067
Hmm, just because you say in that definitive
tone doesn't mean it means anything to me.

47
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,826
These marks we made from a saw.

48
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:22,933
The hand was already separated from
the rest of the person when the bear ate them.

49
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:26,441
Somebody was dismembered
and fed to a bear?

50
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:28,909
That's one possibility.

51
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,375
Okay, um, thanks, Bones.

52
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,517
Glad I could help.

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,109
But, uh... you're not done.

54
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:40,535
I'll check out the photographs and the
X rays, see if I can confirm sex and age.

55
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,732
Pack your bags.
We're going to Washington state.

56
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,087
I am not going
to Washington state.

57
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:50,060
Again, just because you say it in that definitive
tone, doesn't mean it means nothing to me.

58
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,971
Why Booth is the one who decides
we go to Washington state?

59
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:57,334
He gets a gun and the authority.
He's the one that people like.

60
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:01,010
Firstly, he didn't decide that you go
to Washington State. He made a request.

61
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:04,399
I am the one who decides
where you do and do not go.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,596
And secondly?

63
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:10,378
Secondly, it's time to live a little, Temperance.
Connect with other people.

64
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:14,914
Are you suggesting that I take this opportunity
to have sex with Booth on a field trip?

65
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,666
Good God, where is
Dr. Freud when you need him?

66
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,744
I don't understand
what you're saying.

67
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:22,023
Which is precisely why I´m sending you
to the Great North Woods.

68
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,070
Come on, now.

69
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:28,905
You have partially-digested, dismembered
skeletal remains to examine.

70
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:30,798
That should put
a smile on your face.

71
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,484
The mosquitoes out there
are the size of dogs.

72
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:35,907
pack and set the perimeter

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,878

1X04: The Man in the Bear

Transcript: cfsmp3
Sync: Narkond, Roberto, Dedek0

75
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,151
You know, being cooped up in a crappy
hotel in the middle of nowhere

76
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,608
with a $50 per diem is not my idea
of a good time either, you know.

77
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:28,503
You only get $50 a day?
How can you live on that?

78
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:30,177
Okay, what do you mean?
What do you get?

79
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:32,627
I don't have a limit.
Just give them the receipts.

80
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:35,836
Oh, no, you have to have a limit. Everyone
has a limit. We work for the government.

81
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,040
I don't have a limit.

82
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,971
But it's not fair. It's not fair to the taxpayers.

83
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,377
You're like one of those
thousand-dollar toilet seats.

84
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:46,925
I imagine i´m a pretty differently than
you because I have an indispensable skill.

85
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:49,128
Right, indispensable... I do not need you.

86
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:53,455
Oh, so you can determine the origin of the kerf
marks as well as the sex and age of the victim?

87
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,479
You know, u're a smart ass,
you know that?

88
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,742
Objectively, I'd say I'm very smart,
although it has nothing to do with my ass.

89
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,101
You know, I'll tell you what. You can
take me out to dinner, hmm?

90
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,102
Put me on your tab.

91
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,478
That doesn't seem ethical.

92
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,691
You still want that gun,
now don't u-- hmm?

93
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,425
We'll start with breakfast.

94
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:20,902
You know, it's beautiful here
It feels good to be out of the city.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,919
Yeah, where murderers
feed their victims to bears.

96
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,953
Small town America. Got to love it.

97
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:45,828
No, this is not a small town.
Chuntala in Guatemala, 150 people,

98
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,429
no running water.
That's a small town.

99
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:50,253
I said small town America,
not small town Guatemala.

100
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,277
And I've been there,
too, by the way.

101
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:54,178
Where are you going?

102
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,552
To see the sheriff.

103
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:57,638
How are you going
to do that?

104
00:05:57,993 --> 00:06:00,701
It's an old FBI trick. I'm going to ask
somebody who lives here.

105
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:02,947
What took you to Guatemala?

106
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:04,808
Eco-tourism?

107
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:09,072
I went down to shoot somebody
through the heart from 1,500 feet.

108
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,561
I was pretty sure it was human,
but I'm a vet,

109
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:20,790
so I called Andrew, Dr. Rigby,
and he thought it was human, too.

110
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:25,034
Officially I'm the coroner here in Aurora,
but I'm just a country doctor.

111
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:26,555
I have no training
in forensics.

112
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:30,054
This is approximately 60%
of the arm of a male,

113
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:32,706
late teens, early 20s,
well muscled.

114
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:33,547
That's amazing.

115
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:37,440
You see these marks here
below the radial tuberosity?

116
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:41,037
You haven't by any chance performed
any amputations lately, have you?

117
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:43,608
Uh, a few frostbit
toes last winter,

118
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:47,354
and a thumb from a nasty
Murphy bed accident. Why?

119
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,029
These are saw marks.

120
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,548
That's not good, people getting
sawed up and ate by bears?

121
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,550
I'm going to send
this back to my lab.

122
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,496
My people there can give a better estimate
of how long ago the bear ingested the arm.

123
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,537
You got pretty good
equipment there, I guess.

124
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:03,413
I'm still on dial-up.

125
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,773
What's the fastest way
to ship a human arm

126
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:07,532
Charlie

127
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:12,175
Need a hand?

128
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,269
Thanks, but I'm trying
to get rid of this one.

129
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,981
These are human remains.

130
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:20,686
I have to ship them to the Jeffersonian
Institute in Washington, D.C.

131
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:22,913
Cool, they have Dizzy
Gillespie's trumpet there.

132
00:07:22,913 --> 00:07:23,703
Yeah, I know.

133
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:27,386
Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves
Abm Lirahaoln's assaination top hat.

134
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,729
I know, I work there.

135
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:30,580
You ever sit in
Archie Bunker'chair?

136
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,239
I work in a different part of the museum.
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

137
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,395
- My name's Charlie.
- Yeah, I know.

138
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:42,013
Wow. What, you could tell
from my, like, skull structure?

139
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:44,637
It says it on your
shirt, Charlie.

140
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:47,874
Where can I
find the sheriff?

141
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,910
He's out past the
garage to the right.

142
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,725
Hey, Temperance Brennan.
I've been reading your book.

143
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:59,508
Gave me a few ideas if I ever want
to kill someone and get rid of he body.

144
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:03,777
Well, don't forget, Charlie, the
heroine always catches the bad guy.

145
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,988
Sounds good to me.

146
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:12,220
These are false start kerfs,
which suggest a hand saw.

147
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:15,585
The cut marks
on the break-away spur...

148
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:17,465
Here

149
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,872
it should give me the number of teeth
per inch, but... to me, it just looks broken.

150
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:27,080
I could work it up into a three-dimensional
image. See if that helps.

151
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:29,841
Dr. Brennan could
do it from this.

152
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:33,896
Not when she was a lowly
grad student, Zack.

153
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:38,436
Upload all the digital info that Brennan
sent you into my mainframe.

154
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:42,438
And lighten up, dude.

155
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,991
You know, somebody cut that
guy's arm off, Sheriff.

156
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,659
Couldn't be a local.
Somebody missing an arm,

157
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,059
that's something
you notice.

158
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,993
How many people
live in Aurora?

159
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:58,071
326 in town, another couple hundred
in the unincorporated surroundings,

160
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,188
maybe 1,200 on the
Indian reservation.

161
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:02,605
Tourists?

162
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:06,429
Hikers, campers...It's beautiful country,
so they don't realize how dangerous it is.

163
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,891
On average, we lose a couple
of pople a year. Cycle of life, eh?

164
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:11,418
Lose anyone recently?

165
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:15,001
Woman, 29,
Ann Nuyes from Olympia.

166
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:19,272
Disappeared a couple weeks ago. Her parents
say she was an "experienced" hiker.

167
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,376
Must have some
resident crazies.

168
00:09:27,377 --> 00:09:32,096
Juvenile bush drinking, a couple of domestics,
a bar fight or two, joy riding.

169
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,968
The only felons we have arpoachers.

170
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:37,387
They shoot the black bears and
sell the gallbladders on the black market.

171
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,812
Park ranger handles that stuff.

172
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:42,427
Can I help you?

173
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,455
Yeah-- thanks. I'm with him.

174
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,498
Suddenly I wish I was FBI.

175
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,182
Sheriff Chris Scutter,
Dr. Temperance Brown.

176
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:51,477
My first forensic anthropologist.
Please.

177
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:53,937
We need to find
the rest of the body.

178
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:57,267
Sherman-- Ranger Rivers--
traced the bear's route back a week.

179
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:58,746
Said he didn't find anything.

180
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,733
What is he, like,
some kind of an Indian scout?

181
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,173
Sherman's a Flathead Indian, but since
the bear was wearing a GPS collar,

182
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,977
he didn't have to fully utilize
his native powers.

183
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:07,158
Did he check the scat?

184
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:10,286
What, do you think there's more
people parts in the bear crap?

185
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:13,054
We could maybe go out with
Sherman tomorrow, take a look.

186
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:17,578
Oh, yeah, now that you met Bones, you're
all about the inter-agency cooperation

187
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,799
Bones? I don't think that´s
a way to talk to a lady.

188
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,635
Thank you.

189
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,297
Do you have... dinner plans?

190
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,806
We're working.

191
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,921
Thanks for that.

192
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:33,036
All I'm saying is,
why cut somebody into pieces?

193
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:36,022
Pack them up tighter maybe,
say, in a suitcase.

194
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:39,454
How did a bear
open a suitcase?

195
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:44,183
I saw a documentary once where a bear
go in a car and drove away.

196
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:47,295
That was not a documentary,
it was a cartoon.

197
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,752
Hello.

198
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,969
I'm looking for Zack Addy.

199
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,958
I've got a package of human remains.

200
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,271
Yeah, I can sign
for that.

201
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:03,895
Where's Jimmy?

202
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:07,227
Tahiti, Fiji, who knows?
He won the lottery.

203
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,170
Is it too much of a line to say,
"No, we won the lottery"?

204
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,702
It is, yeah. You know what?
I take it back.

205
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:18,211
It's just, compared to you,
Jimmy, you know...

206
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,290
- The third nostril...
- That whistling sound when he sneezes.

207
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:25,453
Unfortuny, it is too soon to
ask you to have coffee.

208
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:26,859
It is?

209
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:29,829
Yes, yes. Coffee is the
third delivery capper.

210
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,380
So what's the first
delivery capper?

211
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,479
Initial contact, meet
cute, light flirting.

212
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:41,010
Then I'll catch you
in another couple of deliveries.

213
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:42,318
Ok.

214
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,017
Tchau.

215
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,738
You bogarted my package.

216
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,894
You panicked and froze, my man.
Thus, the package came into play.

217
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,635
Also incorrect use of
the verb "bogarted."

218
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,277
I've been looking for that female
hiker since she went missing.

219
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:05,971
But sometimes you never find a trace.
They fall in the ravine, the river...

220
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,211
So how do you like
the Evergreen Lodge?

221
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:12,580
Very nice. I have a beautiful view
of the mountains from my terrace.

222
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,984
You have a terrace?

223
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:16,132
- Yeah.
- I'm sharing a bathroom.

224
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,924
This is where
the bear was shot.

225
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,846
- How far did he get before he died?
- About a hundred yards.

226
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,461
How do you know
that's the right way?

227
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:27,144
Not hard to track
a wounded bear.

228
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,885
Ever hear of the
bone gatherers?

229
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:32,841
Collecting bones so that the dead can
make their journey to the next world?

230
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,659
I'm not even sure I believe
in the next world.

231
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,050
Doesn't matter what you believe in.
You're a bone gatherer.

232
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:42,059
That's a good thing,
helping the spirits move on.

233
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:46,324
Thank you. It's probably the best
job description I'll ever get.

234
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,059
Over here.

235
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:50,322
You find something?

236
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:52,098
Does a bear scat
in the woods?

237
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:55,965
I think he voided here, and he...
headed off over there.

238
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,831
See if you can fin
dy older samples.

239
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,609
She ain't the squeamish
type, is she?

240
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,329
I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Sherman

241
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,721
and guess you don't get a lot of eligible
good-looking women coming through town.

242
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,269
Hey. I just finished chapter 7.

243
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:23,558
- This has to go to my...

244
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:25,460
Do you do all the stuff
the girl in your book does?

245
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:29,266
I'm... suddenly uncomfortable
discussing that with you.

246
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,532
No, I-I'm not talking about the sex.
I'm talking about the running and the shooting.

247
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:38,535
I mean, if you... do do all that
other stuff, that's great, too, for...

248
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:42,368
you and, um... whoever you're...doing it with.

249
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,005
I'd like to send this
to my lab.

250
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,404
Yeah, more bones?

251
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,817
No, it's bear scat.

252
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:49,788
Oh, I can deal with that.

253
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:52,808
Brennan.

254
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,406
The person who belonged to the arm
died approximately a week ago

255
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,345
and the bear ate it between one
and three days after that.

256
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,236
Anything from the saw?

257
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,967
Angela's entering the data
into the holographic display.

258
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,813
I found something else I can't
categorize. Can I beam it to you?

259
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:08,692
Okay, hold on

260
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,126
Do you mind if I place the laptop here?

261
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,488
Uh, yeah! No problem.

262
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,193
Give me a second. I´m connecting
with the satelite.

263
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:25,114
Okay. I´m link.

264
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,236
...been focusing on,
Dr. Brennan.

265
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,344
- Who's that?
- My assistant, Zack.

266
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:31,428
Hey, Zack.

267
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,299
- Who's that?
- The overnight guy, Charlie.

268
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,795
Okay, I'm set up--
you can send me the picture.

269
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:41,260
- Hey, Zack, does your boss have a boyfriend?
- Not currently.

270
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,585
- Are you extremely good looking?
- Yes, I am, Zack.

271
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:46,165
Zack, these are bite marks.

272
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:47,871
You mean from the bear?

273
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:50,594
No. Black bears have premolars
that are small and peg-like.

274
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:52,897
These marks show
a doub cusp pattern.

275
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,172
Pigs are double cusped.

276
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:58,036
- Hey, Zack, are you extremely smart?
- Yes, I am, Charlie.

277
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:03,396
No, pigs have six incisors. These marks were made
by four incisors, like a chimp, except...

278
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:06,579
these teeth form
a continuous arch.

279
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,180
So what's got a continuous arch?

280
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,118
Humans.

281
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:16,474
We don't just have a killer on our hands,
we have a cannibal.

282
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:24,919
Zack'll have the odontologist at the Jeffersonian
take a look, but I'm right.

283
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,176
A canibal?

284
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,187
You mean
a Hannibal Lector type... deal?

285
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,533
I don't know what that means.

286
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:33,157
You're certain a human being
gnawed on that bone?

287
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,361
Bit, gnawed,
removed the flesh.

288
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,526
That's-that's really not good.

289
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:41,084
Are you sure, Bones? You've never see
anything like this before?

290
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,365
Of course I've seen this before--

291
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:46,630
I did grad work ong the Wari of the Amazon.
They have a long history of cannibalism.

292
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:50,835
I've also seen evidence of cannibalism in some
12th-century Native American sites--

293
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:52,305
it's not that big a deal.

294
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:53,495
Have you ever...?

295
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:57,034
I've never been offered
human flesh before.

296
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,170
But if you had?

297
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,842
That's an interesting question. I'd have
to measure my own social inculcation

298
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:03,974
against objective scientific inquiry.

299
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:06,452
'Kay, that's sick.

300
00:16:06,855 --> 00:16:09,224
Maybe we're looking for someone
who needs to be rescued.

301
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:12,522
Maybe the young man died,
and the missing girl,

302
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:15,837
hungry and lost, came upon him
needing food, and she...

303
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:19,205
Sawed him up and...
barbecued him?

304
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,718
Well, there's no evidence
that the hand was cooked.

305
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,850
She does not look like the type
of girl who would chew on raw flesh.

306
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,744
You'd be surprised. When survival
instincts kick in...

307
00:16:27,744 --> 00:16:31,093
If it isn't her, then we're dealing
with some psycho cannibal killer.

308
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,618
This is sick.

309
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,656
Someone eating raw human flesh
is going to get sick.

310
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:45,622
Teeth marks?

311
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:49,332
Yes, and these drag marks are where
the flesh was ripped right off the bone.

312
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:52,229
It's ike a zombie movie.

313
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,729
Where is my bear poop

314
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:57,571
Is it the excrement you're anxious
to look at... or the courier?

315
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,186
What do you think?

316
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:03,139
Somebody gnawed on this arm
like some kind of man corn?

317
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,344
According to that Peruvian soccer team that crashed
in the Andes, human flesh tastes like frogs' legs.

318
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,824
As if I need another reason
never to eat frogs.

319
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,712
We're gonna make a cast of these markings.

320
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:15,760
We won't get a full dental impression,
bu'll at least get something

321
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,417
Zack. You're needed upstairs.

322
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,998
Angela.

323
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:30,730
If we were a Peruvian soccer team
and crashed in the Andes,

324
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:33,372
Who you would you rather eat,
me or Zack?

325
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:38,124
What?

326
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:47,177
- I have a package for Zack Addy.
- That's me.

327
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:51,756
I thought...There was the other guy.

328
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:55,836
That was Hodgins. He zoomed you, because
you're so beautiful.

329
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:59,107
Thanks, that's sweet.

330
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:00,601
I-I'm not being sweet.

331
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:02,695
It's just a fact.

332
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,560
- How old are you?
- Twenty-four.

333
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:09,743
Twenty-four.

334
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:13,876
I could just eat you up.

335
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:26,069
Have you diagnosed anyone
rently with a prion disease?

336
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:28,094
A prion disease? No.

337
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:33,129
Some Alzheimer's, yes. Some brain 
damage due to alcoholism

338
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,158
Delusions, erratic behavio
violent outbursts?

339
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,073
The incubation period for
a prion disease can be years.

340
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:42,851
You're thinking the cannibal might be
showing symptoms of mental deterioration?

341
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:45,592
Dr. Rigby, I never said
anything about a cannibal.

342
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:48,152
Well,it's all over town.

343
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,494
Charlie, the overnight guy. What do you
think our chances are of keeping this quiet?

344
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,390
I'd say absolutely zero.

345
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,426
You knew I was waiting
to see her again.

346
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,322
You said you were waiting
for your bear poop.

347
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:12,153
I said, "Are you excited about
the excrement or the courier?"

348
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:12,845
and you said,
"What do you think?"

349
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,852
And you actually thought
I was excited about excrement?

350
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,513
You have to be clear.

351
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,408
What's that?

352
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,785
A piece of undigested bone.

353
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:26,120
Metacarpal.

354
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:27,995
I think that goes with my hand.

355
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:31,269
Part of a tin can.

356
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:36,589
Elastin fibers. Some kind of sporocarp.

357
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,595
Here's something.

358
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:54,568
Hair follicles. Sebaceous glands?
There's a layer of dermis.

359
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,017
Pigmentation marks
in the macrophage.

360
00:19:57,018 --> 00:20:01,371
A flap of skin with a tattoo.
We need a tatoo expert.

361
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:11,178
It's fairly simple. Uh, two colors,
red and black.

362
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,638
Some kind of native design.

363
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,663
She likes me more
than she likes you.

364
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:17,804
She said I
was sweet.

365
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:20,108
I made her laugh
at Jimmy's third nostril.

366
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,648
That's pretty good. Making a woman laugh
at a third nostril.

367
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,242
We have a tentative
coffee date.

368
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:28,276
She said she wanted
to eat me up.

369
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:30,428
Zack's definitely
ahead on points.

370
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,079
There it is.

371
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,832
The skin in the scat
has a sun on it.

372
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,986
- What is that, a haiku?
- It's a tattoo.

373
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,382
Hi, Booth.

374
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,437
Hi. I'm Angela Montenegro.

375
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:55,270
- How you doing, Angela?
- Angela, focus, please.

376
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,784
It's a Haida sun motif.

377
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:58,993
Good work,
very impressive.

378
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:02,178
18 to 25-year-old man,
Haida sun tattoo on his arm?

379
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:07,104
Hey, Booth, I have kind of
a thing for tattoos. You got any?

380
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,062
Angela!

381
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,085
I'm sorry, sweetie, but
what's with that town?

382
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:15,286
You getting anything going
with that hot overnight guy?

383
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,091
Angie, we're trying to work.

384
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,300
Is that town totally wasted
on you, sweetie?

385
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,735
Because I'd take this as a sign
from God to loosen up.

386
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:27,537
You know what they say-- "What
happens in Aurora stays in Aurora."

387
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:29,612
Hey.

388
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:33,254
I'm running a missing persons check
using the new info on the tattoo.

389
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,665
She seems very friendly,
your associate.

390
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:38,915
She's 3,000 miles away.

391
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,346
I'd send away
for a Russian bride.

392
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,046
Adam Langer, 22. Missing ten days from
a college in Richen

393
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:51,839
Wait, I know this kid. He used to come up
to visit Sherman. He wanted to be ranger.

394
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:58,044
Look, I've known Sherman for years.
I can't believe he had anything to do with this.

395
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:05,397
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Sherman.

396
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:06,701
Mind if we come in?

397
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:09,366
You guys here about
the cannibal?

398
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,162
We can´t talk about
official business.

399
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,699
How's about some tea?

400
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:13,613
Sure.

401
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:20,330
Oh, yeah.

402
00:22:20,732 --> 00:22:21,674
What'd you do that for?

403
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,599
Give you a chance to look
around, get a sense of the man.

404
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:27,804
The raven spirit.

405
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:31,012
In some Native American stories
it has a cannibalistic element.

406
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:34,691
He went out back.

407
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:35,954
Give me a flashlight.

408
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:38,099
No way you'll catch
Sherman Rivers in the woods.

409
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,759
Just search the place.

410
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:41,981
Sherman, stop!

411
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,399
I don't know if
a wall of knives is evidence,

412
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:52,702
but it sure is creepy.

413
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:56,729
Hey! Stop.

414
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:02,228
Is there a saw?

415
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:05,585
Yep.

416
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:07,197
I want to take it.

417
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,827
See if it matches the cuts in
Adam Langer's bones.

418
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,323
See if this matches
the teeth marks.

419
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:22,264
You've got to be kidding me.

420
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,419
As Justice of the Peace, I authorize
you to open that locked freezer.

421
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:29,552
Thank you.

422
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,338
What kind of meat
do you think that is?

423
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,333
I send it a bunch of frozen
meat by overnight air

424
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:44,261
I need to know what
it is as soon as possible.

425
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,843
Think it's human?

426
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,836
Maybe, it's a funny color.

427
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:49,395
So did you catch the guy?

428
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,835
No, Booth lost him in the woods.

429
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,531
Whoa, wait a second!
I didn't lose him.

430
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,857
Well, you didn't catch him.

431
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:55,195
So you two have the night free.

432
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,768
Yes, we can't do anything until
I get a determination

433
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,141
on that meat,
and Booth has to wait

434
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,565
until it's light to look
for the guy he lost.

435
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:01,666
I didn't lose him, okay?

436
00:24:01,826 --> 00:24:05,235
I... He... Tell her that
my flashlight died.

437
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,323
She doesn't care.

438
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,629
What?
Give me the phone.

439
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:09,682
It's not safe to drive and talk
on the cell phone.

440
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,650
Are you two figh?

441
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,675
Professional pride. Tell her,
please, tell her that.

442
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:16,705
Booth wants you to know that he
lost the guy because his flashlight died.

443
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,448
And because he's an Indian
and he's a park ranger,

444
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:22,132
and he's very, very familiar
with the territory. Tell her that.

445
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:22,964
Did you hear that?

446
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:24,929
Yeah, something about
Indian territory.

447
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,407
Yeah, she says she understands.

448
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:28,703
I need to know about that meat
as soon as possible.

449
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:29,586
Yeah! I´ll tell Zack.

450
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:30,901
Give me the phone.
Hold on. Plus...

451
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:31,549
What?

452
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:33,270
It wasn't even
my flashlight, okay?

453
00:24:33,461 --> 00:24:34,720
It was the
sheriff's flashlight,

454
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:36,460
and his batteries,
they ran out, okay?

455
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,048
Good night, Angela.

456
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:40,579
Hey, you have to take
that man for a drink.

457
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:42,656
And have a little fun yourself.

458
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:45,450
Fun and a drink,
where do we find that?

459
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:53,735
So I was surprised
to see you here.

460
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,066
In your book you never sleep
until you get your man

461
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,034
Well, that's not me,
that's just a character.

462
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,153
In real life, you have
to wait for lab results.

463
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:02,852
I see, well, lucky for me.

464
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:05,299
I don't know, I'm afraid
I'm not a very good dancer.

465
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,355
Apparently I lead.

466
00:25:06,811 --> 00:25:07,991
So, I'll follow.

467
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,059
Hey Booth, wanna a beer?

468
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,601
What you need sheriff?

469
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,873
You know, I climbed
with Adam sometimes.

470
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:14,247
I was kind of freaked-out

471
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,815
when I found
out it was his arm

472
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:16,963
You knew Adam Langer?

473
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,658
I taught him how to climb.

474
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:20,151
Man, he was strong.

475
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,114
No matter how
much I lift,

476
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,371
I could... I could
never match him.

477
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:26,004
You do have...
excellent definition

478
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,270
in your biceps
and triceps.

479
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,201
Well, thanks.

480
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,225
And your waist muscles

481
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,545
feel good, too.

482
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:34,012
Transverse abdominals.

483
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:35,117
Thank you.

484
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,194
So that meat we sent
back to your lab,

485
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,443
that wasn't more
of Adam, was it?

486
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:41,272
I can't discuss it.

487
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:41,760
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

488
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:44,764
Dr. Rigby.

489
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,269
I thought rescue you.

490
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,560
I can't imagine you and Charlie
have a lot to talk about.

491
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,639
We were managing.

492
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:53,115
Look, um... I guess it looks
pretty bad for Sherman, huh?

493
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:56,190
I can't discuss the investigation
with you, Dr. Rigby.

494
00:25:56,484 --> 00:25:57,596
Look, Sherman is
a Flathead.

495
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,409
The spiritual beliefs
of his tribe

496
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,378
don't value cannibalism,
they never have.

497
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,097
Well, anthropology
teaches us

498
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,413
that beliefs
and customs evolve.

499
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:08,469
That's why you can still find
cannibalism practiced today.

500
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:12,214
So wait, you can justify the act
of eating another human being?

501
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:13,904
I can understand it
intellectually.

502
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,216
I shouldn't
be talking shop.

503
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,181
Not with such a beautiful
woman in my arms.

504
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,521
You really think you can match the
bite marks on Sherman's apple

505
00:26:24,522 --> 00:26:26,176
with the bite marks on
that kid's arm bone?

506
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:28,170
I don't really feel
comfortable discussing a case

507
00:26:28,307 --> 00:26:29,090
on the dance floor.

508
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,223
Well, I'm the sheriff.

509
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:31,757
We're colleagues.

510
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,224
Mind if I cut in?

511
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:34,855
Thought you might
need a break.

512
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:37,202
What happened
to your shirt?

513
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,043
Well, we're in a bar.
It's a look.

514
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:41,622
Sorry?

515
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:43,734
For information
on the case.

516
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,145
Bones, they're
only pretending

517
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,209
to be interested
in thease.

518
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,830
Why?
They're hitting on you.

519
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:50,406
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

520
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,328
You're the hottest thing
this town in a long time

521
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,834
Check out the competition.

522
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,565
Now that is someone who
wants to eat your heart.

523
00:27:04,597 --> 00:27:06,139
Ooh. Very pretty.

524
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,718
Lovely.

525
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,722
It's a sporocarb
called tririgbosum,

526
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,624
after a week in bear poop.

527
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,296
Thank you for ruining
my moment.

528
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:17,158
It's a mushroom--
an Oregon white truffle.

529
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:18,893
They're a microrisal
species

530
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:21,394
that only grow in symbiosis
with Douglas fir trees.

531
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,657
Are Douglas fir trees very,
very rare in the woods?

532
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:25,657
No.

533
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,230
Then you really haven't found
anything useful, have you?

534
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:28,776
No.

535
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,819
Want to get something to eat?

536
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:31,729
No.

537
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,188
Ah, you're expecting
a delivery tonight.

538
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:36,149
Zack is.

539
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:37,647
And you're going
to zoom him.

540
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,295
Like the Indy 500, baby.

541
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:46,109
You didn't come down
for breakfast, Bones.

542
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,066
I wasn't hungry.

543
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:48,913
Sorry you had to pay
for your own meal.

544
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,206
I called your room,
there was no answer.

545
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:54,599
Why the sudden interest
in my morning habits, Booth?

546
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,236
Well, I just thought we were
going to get something to eat.

547
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,190
You know? So I waited.
And my eggs got cold.

548
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:00,276
That's all. Cold eggs.

549
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,898
This is where
my flashlit failed

550
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:06,513
You mean
my flashlight.

551
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:07,734
And how can you be sure?

552
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,395
Because this is where
I was standing.

553
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,396
A shirt button?

554
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,930
And I heard him disappear
in this direction.

555
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:18,694
Leaving buttons on the trail.
Must be an old fish *** trick

556
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:22,373
You mean a snake eater.
An old snake eater trick.

557
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,127
Were you here all night?

558
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,352
Yes.

559
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:30,910
Did I miss Toni?

560
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:31,728
Yes.

561
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,632
She asked about you.

562
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:35,915
You torpedoed me, didn't you?

563
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:37,555
No, I told her the truth.

564
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,799
you were sifting through
excrement.

565
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:40,789
You want a war?

566
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,645
Fine, because I am the warrior.

567
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:44,780
Zack?

568
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:47,498
I got the measurements for your
saw from the Angelator.

569
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,712
Now all you have to do
is find a match.

570
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,440
Say thank you with gifts.

571
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:54,174
Did you work all night?

572
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,834
Yes, I shaved
the truffle.

573
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,490
Is that anything like
spanking the monkey?

574
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,680
- I found boring dust.
- Is there any other kind?

575
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:04,229
Boring dust is produced
by beetles.

576
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:06,782
Which means the tree the
truffle grew on was infested.

577
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,562
That's not going
to impress Toni.

578
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:09,483
That's not why I did it.

579
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:12,306
I did it to serve justice and
capture a murderous cannibal.

580
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,475
That'll impress the hot courier.

581
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:17,030
I'm back in the game.

582
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,769
No way you'll catch
Sherman in the woods.

583
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,996
He's a park ranger
and an Indian.

584
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,677
Right there.

585
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,255
. He's doing some kind
of Indian ritual.

586
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,709
- He's waiting for us.
- Brennan.

587
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:38,677
The meat samples you sent us
were all Ursus americanus.

588
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,193
Black bear.

589
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:42,920
I didn't kill no one.

590
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,785
Why'd you run?

591
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:45,500
You're FBI.

592
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,495
Ever hear of Leonard Peltier?

593
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:50,081
Pineridge? Wounded Knee?

594
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,269
Indians and FBI don't mix.

595
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,812
He ran because
he's the poacher.

596
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:55,039
You're the poacher?

597
00:29:55,306 --> 00:29:57,339
Yeah, the meat we found in
his freezer was black bear.

598
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,413
No wonder you never caught him.

599
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,414
I want a lawyer.

600
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:01,255
You should be on the lookout
for a patch of woods

601
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,852
that's infested with
Dendroctonus brevicomis LeCon.

602
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,135
Hodgins says the bear dug up the arm

603
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:09,227
in a stand of western pine beetle
infested Douglas fir.

604
00:30:09,262 --> 00:30:11,033
Say you did catch
a poacher.

605
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,527
Say he was an Indian

606
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:14,667
who shouldn't have to follow
white man's law, anyway.

607
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,423
Not even a park ranger?

608
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,287
Say he could show you
a stand of trees like that.

609
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,976
Would you maybe let
that Indian go?

610
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:24,216
The saw is 300 millimeter

611
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:26,218
with 32 offset
teeth per inch,

612
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,860
with a wobble factor
of 1/100th of an inch.

613
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,185
Wait, that's a common hacksaw.
That won't help us much.

614
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,965
Dr. Brennan, I'm just wondering if you're
going to be sending us any more samples.

615
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,962
Yeah, uh, even more
of the same samples,

616
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,475
you know, in case we want
to double-check the data.

617
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,019
I'll let you know.

618
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:43,617
Do you think
she'll send more?

619
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,038
God in heaven, I hope so.

620
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,995
Japanese, right?

621
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:48,512
They pay a fortune
for that bear meat.

622
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,695
They think thgallbladders
fix up their pecker troubles.

623
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,057
Would have got
away with it,

624
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:54,021
if you hadn't kept the
meat in the freezer.

625
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,615
I'm not admitting nothing.

626
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,649
He couldn't bring himself
to waste the meat.

627
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:00,344
This patch of trees

628
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:02,046
is all infested
with beetles.

629
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,167
According
to the GPS,

630
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,012
the bear was here
seven days ago.

631
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:08,564
That fits the
timeline for the arm.

632
00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:09,688
What a we looking for?

633
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,231
I'm guessing
we're looking

634
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,099
for a shallow grave
that's been disrupted

635
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:14,211
by a hungry bear.

636
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:17,559
Or maybe some kind
of satanic Stonehenge circle.

637
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:27,725
We see this kind of thing
all the time.

638
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,166
Kids come up
here, get baked,

639
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:31,284
do their own version of The
Blair Witch Project.

640
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,710
I don't know what that means.

641
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:34,045
It's a horror movie,
Bones.

642
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:36,641
Didn't make any sense.

643
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,352
Scary, though, with
the bloody handprints.

644
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:42,077
Ang, I'm going
to beam you some stills

645
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,465
of what looks like
a ritualistic Indian site--

646
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:46,225
a medicine wheel of me kind.

647
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:47,548
is thing legit?

648
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:49,066
What am I, a shaman?

649
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,824
Dr Goodman is an expert in
Native American anthropology.

650
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,450
He should be able to tell you
what it means.

651
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:55,854
Symbols, Indian site...

652
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:57,880
Sherman, you're looking
guiltier by the minute.

653
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,038
Oh, shut up, Chris.

654
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:00,218
You know better
than that.

655
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,305
Hey, you're
a poacher, man.

656
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,720
I sure as hell didn't see
that coming, either.

657
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,232
Got something?

658
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:12,508
Waxy leaves.

659
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,529
It means methane gas
leeching from the soil.

660
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:16,714
Like a body?

661
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:25,966
That's Adam Langer!

662
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,970
Uh, there's
a woman here, too.

663
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,422
Ann Nuyes,
the hiker.

664
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,521
And she´s missing her heart.

665
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,330
It's a perversion
of a Salish medine wheel.

666
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:51,045
This is the spirit chief,
Chichayilmaytchu.

667
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,514
The southern most stone
should represent strength.

668
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,723
The center of the wheel
should represent life force.

669
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,642
But this is upside down
and inside out.

670
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:00,071
We're dealing with a cannibal.

671
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:02,561
I suppose you could
interpret this as a way

672
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:05,275
of taking energy from someone
by eating their flesh.

673
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:06,267
Zoom in.

674
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:12,795
There. This is the symbol
for the strength: the arm.

675
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:17,252
This one is for spirit:
the heart.

676
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:19,240
This one for knowledge.

677
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,963
And this is for courage.

678
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:25,062
So we're looking for maybe
a scarecrow, tin man or a lion?

679
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:28,415
You say two bodies
were found?

680
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:32,957
Over here.

681
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,488
They were dug up by a bear;

682
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:37,343
one showing signs that his arm
was eaten by the cannibal,

683
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:39,460
the other missing her heart.

684
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,903
There should be two more bodies
to complete the ritual.

685
00:33:46,562 --> 00:33:47,562
They checked
the site.

686
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:49,812
There were
only these two.

687
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,310
If I've analyzed this correctly,

688
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:53,070
it means there will be
two more victims.

689
00:33:54,496 --> 00:33:56,380
Both victims were killed
by gunshots to the head.

690
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,466
These stellate patterns
at the entry wounds

691
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,106
indicate
a low-caliber handgun

692
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:01,892
at close range.

693
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:03,716
That remarkable.

694
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:04,973
Not really.

695
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:06,958
Based on adiposear formation,

696
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,456
I'm estimating the female
has been dead for about

697
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:11,280
A week?

698
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:13,065
Very good.

699
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,994
Thanks.

700
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,125
Well, her clothing matches
that of Ann Nuyes,

701
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:19,988
and the male
is Adam Langer.

702
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,321
My people at the Jeffersonian
tell me that the medicine wheel

703
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:26,097
suggests a perversion
of an old healing ritual.

704
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,146
The cannibal may have eaten
the arm for strength

705
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:29,207
and the heart for spirit.

706
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:32,152
Well, that makes sense, from a
certain point of view.

707
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,645
Do they think
it's an Indian?

708
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:35,477
No way to tell.

709
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:39,056
I'm no policeman, but
it doesn't make sense

710
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:40,866
that Sherman Rivers would lead you

711
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:42,467
straight to the
evidence that proves

712
00:34:42,468 --> 00:34:43,738
he's a murderer
and a cannibal.

713
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:46,882
Adam was a good guy.

714
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,110
He wanted to be
a park ranger.

715
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:52,064
I was a...
what do you call it?

716
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:53,239
His mentor?

717
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,859
That's right,
his mentor.

718
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,624
Taking him out with me
on my rounds,

719
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,397
showing him the ropes
of the job.

720
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,844
Or maybe he had found out you´re poucher
so you made sure he wouldn't talk.

721
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:09,397
Yeah, so I ate his arm and ate
someone's heart for dessert,

722
00:35:09,397 --> 00:35:10,921
because that's the type
of guy I am.

723
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,570
You know, he fits
the description

724
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:13,885
of someone who's
missing an arm.

725
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:15,876
Why didn't you
say anything?

726
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,615
Somebody says maybe
they're going to come and visit.

727
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:22,678
Maybe they do,
maybe they don't.

728
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:26,071
Maybe they go see
their climbing buddy instead.

729
00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:27,958
Charlie?
The overnight guy.

730
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,090
Maybe sometimes
they go visit a girl.

731
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:32,640
What girl?

732
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:35,556
I'm not comfortable saying.

733
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:40,324
Well, maybe what, you know, with
the, uh, murders and cannibalism,

734
00:35:40,324 --> 00:35:42,462
you, uh... you get
past that discomfort?

735
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:46,541
Adam had a thing
with the vet lady.

736
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,029
So did his buddy,
Charlie.

737
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,727
You know how jealously
white people can be

738
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,116
Um, in the interest
of full disclosure,

739
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:54,398
I've got to say
I see Denise

740
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,325
from time to time, too.

741
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,767
What, you find
that funny?

742
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,697
You know the apple we
found in Sherman's cabin?

743
00:36:01,908 --> 00:36:02,777
You get a mold?
Zack?

744
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:04,586
Yeah. The mold from the apple

745
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,734
does not match
the teeth marks on the bone.

746
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:07,841
Thanks, Zach.

747
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,994
So what does that mean?

748
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:10,294
It means you aren't
the cannibal.

749
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:11,993
I already knew tt.

750
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,220
The point was to convince us.

751
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,022
What do we do now, start checking
everybody's teeth in town?

752
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:17,680
Not everybody.

753
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,716
We consume.
We are consumed.

754
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:26,884
We're consumed by greed,
by ambition, lust, jealousy.

755
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:29,001
Dr. Randall, if
u'd just like to...

756
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:31,411
I mean, even just regular love
is a form of cannibalism.

757
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:33,843
Could you just put the dental
medium between your teeth...

758
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,100
I mean, the whole
perfect idea of love

759
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,625
is that two people
become one.

760
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,470
Now, that's a kind
of consumption.

761
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,220
We're talking something a little
more literal, Dr. Randall.

762
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:43,957
I need you to bite it

763
00:36:45,224 --> 00:36:46,230
Why didn't you
report him missing?

764
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:49,021
Because I would have had
to admit

765
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:50,422
that he and I were lovers.

766
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:51,562
Why not admit it?

767
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:53,699
Because it would have made
another guy angry.

768
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:55,168
What other guy?

769
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,279
Charlie.

770
00:36:58,648 --> 00:36:59,379
And Sheriff Scutter.

771
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,910
And Andrew Rigby,
and maybe a couple others.

772
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:07,798
Well, there is not a lot to do
in a place like Aurora,

773
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:10,686
so what you do,
you do a lot.

774
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,450
Dr. Randall, if you... can you just
bite, please?

775
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,802
And if I were your cannibal,
would I have pointed out

776
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,531
that there we human bones
in the bear after the autopsy?

777
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:20,584
An autopsy on an animal
is called a necropsy.

778
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:24,948
Yeah, there's a reason I get
all the guys and you don't.

779
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:29,539
Uh, let me tell you,
if I ate Adam,

780
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,536
there wouldn't be anything left.

781
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:40,023
Here and here-- these look
like tooth marks again.

782
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:40,930
Okay.

783
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,360
Byt They´re too regular
That is 2.4 millimeters apart.

784
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:45,403
Teeth aren't that exact.

785
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,678
It has to be some kind
of a machine.

786
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,501
She was eaten
by a machine?

787
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,141
I don't know.

788
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:53,899
We got a love triangle,

789
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:56,440
quadrangle,
octangle, whatever.

790
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:58,320
Jealousy--
always a good motive.

791
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,227
For murdering Adam Langer,
maybe, but Ann Nuyes?

792
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:03,477
And the cannibalism?
No, we're looking for someone

793
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,508
who's clinically insane.

794
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,060
That whole rant thing
the vet lady had

795
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,242
about people consuming
each other?

796
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:08,146
That was wacky.

797
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,832
Yeah, but kind of
true, don't you think?

798
00:38:10,898 --> 00:38:11,535
Hey, Angela

799
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,562
Sweetie, Zack wants
to beam you something.

800
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:14,824
Okay, hold on a second.

801
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,124
See if you can
tell what it is,

802
00:38:19,415 --> 00:38:20,308
but if you're in
a public place,

803
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:21,961
you might want to
cover your screen.

804
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:23,345
What am I looking at?

805
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,511
Indentations
on Ann Nuyes' sternum.

806
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:26,589
Magnification?

807
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:27,383
Forty.

808
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:30,712
I can't belie both Dr.
Rigby and I miss these.

809
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,005
- Good job.
- What are they?

810
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,206
How far apart are
these indentations?

811
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:35,968
2.4 millimeters.

812
00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:38,713
Okay, these marks
and the splitting

813
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:40,948
of the bone
here were made

814
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:42,123
by a sternum spreader.

815
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,995
There's no record of Ann Nuyes
having heart surgery.

816
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,147
Moments like this
are why I need a gun.

817
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:52,833
Where else
do you keep them?

818
00:38:54,342 --> 00:38:54,655
Thank you.

819
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:56,081
That is for
self-defense.

820
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,405
Don't just go blasting
away in there.

821
00:38:58,487 --> 00:38:59,143
What if I have to shoot?

822
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,748
What part of his body
should I hit?

823
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:02,883
The part that isn't me.

824
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:04,773
Just stay back.

825
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:08,713
The bodies are gone.

826
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,264
What's he going to do,

827
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,575
take them into the woods
for a late-night snack?

828
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,062
If I were him, I'd
destroy the evidence.

829
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,246
Step away from the incinerator,
Dr. Rigby.

830
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:29,561
You don't understand.

831
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,268
It's a spiritual right
to share the life force...

832
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,289
Look, you're nuts, okay?
We get it.

833
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:35,423
We don't need to
hear the rambling

834
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:36,838
psycho speech on why you did it.

835
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:38,740
You're an
anthropologist.

836
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,233
You know that
ancient civilizations

837
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,476
would sacrifice some

838
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,106
in order to preserve
the strength...

839
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:48,577
What'd you do that for?

840
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:51,207
Nobody wants to hear
that rambling psycho speech.

841
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:52,525
A bedpan?

842
00:39:58,255 --> 00:39:59,508
Why do we have to
face her togher?

843
00:40:00,176 --> 00:40:01,110
You want this settled
or what?

844
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:02,428
I'd definitely
like this settled.

845
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:06,795
What are you doing here?

846
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:07,864
Are you kidding?

847
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,961
It's like watching the Clash
of the Horny Titans.

848
00:40:15,252 --> 00:40:16,272
Who'd like to sign for this?

849
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:17,641
Who wouldn't

850
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:18,712
want to sign for it?

851
00:40:22,596 --> 00:40:25,506
So the idea is
whoever signs for this...

852
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,854
Yes, the act of signing is
an analog for choosing...

853
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:28,361
She gets it.

854
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:43,446
Oh.

855
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:46,791
Oh.

856
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:49,042
Oh.

857
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:54,628
That is really sweet.

858
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:56,500
Thank you.

859
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,687
That is so hot.

860
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:06,104
Why? Why is that hot?

861
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:08,828
It'd be hotter if
she'd choosen me

862
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,620
No, this is definitly

863
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,689
And to think I didn't want
to come here with you.

864
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:20,063
I mean, this was
a fascinating case.

865
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:22,381
You don't often find
ritual cannibalism practiced

866
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:23,185
so close to home.

867
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:24,618
Which I find a plus.

868
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,727
There are always those
individuals within a species

869
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,801
who are driven to break
the most basic taboos.

870
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:32,683
I mean, Rigby
actually ate human flesh.

871
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,923
Bones,
my steak and eggs.

872
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:36,431
Rigby has a prion disease,

873
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,055
which means he's been a cannibal
for quite some time.

874
00:41:38,368 --> 00:41:39,449
Do you realize
when we go to trial,

875
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:41,083
he could use
the insanity defense?

876
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:42,012
The guy is nuts.

877
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:45,165
Yes, but is he nuts
because he got a brain disease

878
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,204
from eating human flesh,

879
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,301
or was he already nuts
the first time he ate flesh,

880
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:51,188
or did he just lick
his fingers after surgery?

881
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,833
I should just
become a vegetarian.

882
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:56,602
Or, as an alternative,
just don't eat people.

883
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:05,201
You know, I'm going to come
back up here this winter.

884
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:07,136
Charlie says
the skiing is great.

885
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:08,814
Oh, it's Charlie.

886
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:11,469
Yeah, the overnight guy.

887
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:14,404
Yeah, I know who he is.

888
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:16,684
I bet he's a great skier.

889
00:42:17,308 --> 00:42:19,169
His hips and thighs
are perfectly developed

890
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:21,419
for strength
and mauverability.

891
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:23,763
That's it. I´m done.

892
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:25,052
What?

893
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:26,808
No good?

894
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:30,143
You want some corn flakes?

895
00:42:33,729 --> 00:42:34,641
Want some.
