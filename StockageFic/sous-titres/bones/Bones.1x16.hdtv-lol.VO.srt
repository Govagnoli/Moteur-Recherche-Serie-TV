1
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,237
Where are we?

2
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:06,570
Apparently, this was
an access shaft

3
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,271
to an underwater aqueduct

4
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:11,271
which has never
been activated.

5
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:12,503
No, no, I mean where
are we geographically?

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,670
Oh, somehwere

7
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:15,704
beneath Wisconsin
and Massachusetts Avenue

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,071
near the National Cathedral.

9
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:18,137
How far down?

10
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:20,037
We seem very far down.

11
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,071
Oh, about 60 feet
so far.

12
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,338
Is there any other way?

13
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:24,470
It's a giant maze
down here,

14
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,237
but this was
the fastest way

15
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:27,704
to get to the corpse.

16
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,004
I've done plenty
of climbing.

17
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,470
These lines have low tolerances

18
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:31,704
that are more
than adequate.

19
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,837
What about shock tolerance?

20
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,670
The rope jerks,

21
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:36,304
pounds-feet of
kinetic energy increases

22
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,171
and snap-- we fall
to our deaths.

23
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,104
Oh... Okay.

24
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,470
I say we just stop the chatter.

25
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,704
Two city workers
found it.

26
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,137
D.C. public works are under
federal jurisdiction,

27
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:53,971
so this is
your party.

28
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:00,537
BOOTH:
Oh...

29
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,904
Any idea what's at
the top of that shaft?

30
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,271
Utility tunnel for accessing
steam pipes.

31
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:06,404
May I borrow your gun?

32
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,037
Why do you want my gun?

33
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:10,071
I'm not going to shoot
anyone. I promise.

34
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,804
It's not a hammer
or anything.

35
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,137
We've been working together
for months, Booth.

36
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:16,071
A little trust

37
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:17,537
would be nice.

38
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,537
Careful.

39
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:22,503
Here. Hold this.

40
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:31,204
Now they'll eat each other
and leave our remains alone.

41
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:33,438
You know, you do know

42
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,104
I have to file a report

43
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,937
with the review board
each time I discharge

44
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,171
a round from
my weapon.

45
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:40,470
Pictures, Zack.

46
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:42,071
The rats scattered
the remains,

47
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:43,937
so give me a five-meter radius.

48
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,404
The velocity
of the fall

49
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,804
shattered her body on impact.

50
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,904
Tibias and fibulas broken

51
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,338
below the knees,

52
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:51,570
vertebrae compressed

53
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:52,670
and shattered...

54
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,104
Her?

55
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:55,570
Yeah. I just hope that
she was dead

56
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:56,503
before the rats got to her.

57
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,404
Oh, God.

58
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,570
Any idea how long
she's been down here?

59
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,770
We should have some answers
when Hodgins

60
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,204
analyzes the bugs,

61
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,503
but rats can strip a body
in days.

62
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,804
Shirt, pants, but no jacket
or shoes.

63
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,904
No way rats

64
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,770
can carry that off.

65
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:14,704
Excuse me!

66
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:17,971
Sir?

67
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,171
Sir!

68
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:20,737
Hey, what the hell?
Bones! Easy!

69
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,737
Bones, what the hell
are you doing?

70
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:23,971
Bones!

71
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:25,570
Bones!

72
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:26,837
You don't just go running
after guys into the dark.

73
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:28,237
He didn't need any light.

74
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:29,670
He knew exactly where

75
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:30,670
he was going.

76
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:31,704
Yeah, that's creepy.

77
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,704
He lives down here.

78
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,971
 <font color="#ffff00">Cync by</font>
 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com</font>

79
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,937
Her name
is Marni Hunter, 24.

80
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,137
1.7 meters tall,

81
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:14,104
left-handed.

82
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,604
Documentary filmmaker.

83
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:17,738
Fiance reported her missing
ten days ago.

84
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:19,337
The police find the guy?

85
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,704
Your mole man? No.

86
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,537
I've heard of those people.

87
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:24,504
They patch into electrical
grids down there.

88
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,671
Some can even tap cable.

89
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,671
I'd set time of death

90
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,271
at about ten days,

91
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,170
when the Missing Persons
Report was filed.

92
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,070
You sure?

93
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:32,671
See the ratio of fly larvae

94
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:34,237
to Silphidae beetles?

95
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:35,970
Yeah. Ten days.
I believe you.

96
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,638
She fell approximately
40 feet

97
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,770
and landed feet first,

98
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,170
which explained
the crushed tibias.

99
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,770
That what killed her?

100
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:45,070
Not necessarily. Her skull
sustained traumatic injuries

101
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,571
that are inconsistent
with a feet-first fall.

102
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,271
We found blood traces
and bone chips

103
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:50,304
on pieces of exposed pipe
and rebar

104
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:52,104
jutting from the side

105
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,271
of the ventilation shaft.

106
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,271
So that's what killed her?

107
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:56,437
No, not necessarily.

108
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,471
The fingernails
are totally clean.

109
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:00,271
BRENNAN:
If she were falling,
she would claw at the wall

110
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:01,704
to slow her descent.

111
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,104
It's an instinctual response.

112
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,271
So she was dead before the fall.

113
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:07,404
No. Not necessarily.

114
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:08,437
Bones.

115
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:09,471
Please.

116
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:11,004
Just tell me.

117
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,803
She may have simply
been unconscious.

118
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,738
Mr. Garfield, why did
you wait two days

119
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:26,803
to file the Missing Persons
Report on your fiancee?

120
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,537
Marni is
a documentary filmmaker...

121
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:29,970
or was.

122
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,870
She was very dedicated
to work.

123
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,837
She immersed herself
in each project.

124
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,738
It's not odd for her
to stay out in the field

125
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:36,970
without coming home.

126
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:38,704
You get invested

127
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,304
in your work, time has a way
of getting away from you.

128
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,237
That's what Marni...
always said.

129
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:44,903
You didn't worry about her
down there?

130
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,604
She's been all
over the world.

131
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,037
Rwanda, Latin America,

132
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,537
the Balkans,

133
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:50,870
the Middle East.

134
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:52,337
I was just glad
to have her home.

135
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:53,504
You two were engaged.

136
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:58,170
And we'd finally set a date.

137
00:04:58,237 --> 00:04:59,903
I'm very sorry for your loss.

138
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,337
Was it her work

139
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:02,404
that took her down
into the tunnels?

140
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,903
Her latest project

141
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,704
the last couple of months
is about the maze of tunnels

142
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,271
beneath the city.

143
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,004
That's what she'd cut together
so far.

144
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,903
I told her to be careful.

145
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,404
You know, a lot of those guys
are pretty nuts.

146
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:19,271
That's fascinating.

147
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,704
A fully functional
shadow society.

148
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,037
Did you ever go down there

149
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,571
with her?

150
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:26,037
Who did she work with?

151
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:27,537
Marni worked alone.

152
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:29,571
She did her own camerawork
and sound.

153
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,437
It was very raw.
That's her style.

154
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:33,738
She never appeared on camera
in her own work.

155
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,337
She thought the documentary
should be about the subject,

156
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:36,537
not the filmmaker.

157
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:37,770
That's true.

158
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,371
As an anthropologist,

159
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,437
you try to immerse yourself
in a culture

160
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,537
without distorting it

161
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:44,004
with your own presence.

162
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,704
It's another reason
to work alone.

163
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,204
So you found her

164
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:49,638
at the bottom
of an air shaft?

165
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,104
You think that

166
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,537
one of these people...

167
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:54,070
Her skull has
some unexplained damage.

168
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,504
The shattering
on the right...

169
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,638
We're still

170
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,404
investigating,
Mr. Garfield.

171
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,004
Wait a minute.

172
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:12,237
Wait! Freeze.

173
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:14,770
That's the man I saw

174
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,304
in the tunnel.

175
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,437
Marni ever mention

176
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:18,837
this particular guy to you?

177
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,070
No.

178
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,037
The blonde woman
is Helen something.

179
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,537
She's a social worker,

180
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:25,837
I think

181
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:27,970
in the shelter over on 26th.

182
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:29,903
Marni came to the shelter.

183
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,537
She heard I worked
with what she called
"the mole people."

184
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,137
She asked me to introduce
her to them.

185
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,638
Spend a lot of time
down here?

186
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:37,837
Mmm. It's kind of
my beat,

187
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:39,070
I guess you'd say.

188
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,404
Did you resent
Marni's intrusion?

189
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:41,638
HELEN:
Why do you ask?

190
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,604
BRENNAN:
It's an ordered society.

191
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,770
Marni and her cameras might have
been disruptive in some way.

192
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,671
Well, these people
are here for a reason.

193
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:49,738
And in my opinion, they have
a right to their privacy.

194
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:51,371
I respect that.

195
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,937
I'm not sure a documentary
filmmaker does.

196
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,004
She disruptive enough
to make any enemies?

197
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,304
Perhaps.

198
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,504
It's tough to know
these people.

199
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,903
BRENNAN:
Well, isn't that what
Marni was trying to do?

200
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,004
Get to know these people?

201
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,738
Explain them to the rest
of the world?

202
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:05,537
Well, no offense,
Doctor Brennan,

203
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:07,271
but I find that
a bit naive.

204
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:08,903
Her job was to sell
her films.

205
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,937
What she was doing
was exploitive.

206
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,371
Maybe one of these people
agreed with you.

207
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,537
There's the man
you're looking for.

208
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,271
Harold Overmeyer.

209
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,337
Marni called him
"the mayor of Mole Town."

210
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:22,803
I imagine she thought
that was clever.

211
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,537
BRENNAN:
He's mediating a dispute.

212
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:27,037
He appears to have
alpha male status.

213
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,870
How did Harold
respond to her?

214
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:30,571
My impression was
he liked her.

215
00:07:30,638 --> 00:07:34,738
But again, nobody really
knows these people.

216
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:45,837
I brought you
some food, Harold.

217
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,070
Eh... I have enough food.

218
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,704
What do you want?

219
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,504
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

220
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:56,537
Well, I'm not required
to answer any questions.

221
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:57,903
I'm not required...

222
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,437
That's correct.

223
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,004
Harold has rights.

224
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,170
Ms. Bronson, you want to please
take a step back?

225
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:04,671
You're interfering
with a criminal investigation.

226
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:11,337
Did you know Marni Hunter?

227
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:18,970
You saw what hned
to Marni, didn't you?

228
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,638
You guys are trespassing.

229
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:21,903
Go away.

230
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,404
Okay, buddy, that's it.
Let's go.

231
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:24,437
BRENNAN:
Whoa... Booth.

232
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,371
This man is obviously

233
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:27,671
someone important
down here.

234
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:29,137
Important?

235
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,738
He lives in a cardboard
box underground.

236
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,037
In this society 

237
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:34,037
he has status.

238
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,571
Give him his due.
Treat him with respect.

239
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,237
Okay, Mr. Overmeyer.

240
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,070
We got off on the wrong foot.

241
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:44,371
I'm Special Agent
Seeley Booth

242
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,471
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

243
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,137
and I would appreciate it
very, very much

244
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:49,337
if you would grant us
the advantage

245
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,903
of your expertise
as we investigate

246
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,104
Marni Hunter's death.

247
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:55,504
Fair enough.

248
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,970
Oh.

249
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,170
Mr. Overmeyer,
I saw you in the tunnel

250
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:04,271
over near where we found

251
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,337
Marni Hunter's remains.

252
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:06,437
Checking the tunnels.

253
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,970
Checking the tunnels,

254
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:09,271
or checking
on Marni?

255
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:12,204
I warned her.

256
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:15,903
So... you two were friends

257
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,803
beyond being observer
and observed?

258
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,337
You talk like her. Are you
making a documentary, too?

259
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:21,304
No, but there are things
I need to understand.

260
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:23,004
That's my stuff.

261
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,371
Bones.

262
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:27,537
Harold, is this, uh,
Marni's video camera?

263
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,803
You'd better go now.

264
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,104
You can go now!

265
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,104
Booth, this clothing

266
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,571
has blood all over it.

267
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:36,204
BOOTH:
Give him his due, huh?

268
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,537
I think it belonged
to Marni Hunter.

269
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,170
You know what?
Afraid you're going

270
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:40,937
to have
to come with us, pal.

271
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,104
What?! No!

272
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,803
I-I can't leave!

273
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,970
Bone fragments.

274
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,037
I can't leave!

275
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,537
Let's get this back to the lab.

276
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:49,004
HAROLD:
She would have wanted me

277
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,004
to have
that stuff.

278
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,937
She would have wanted
me to have that.

279
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,404
You know, I find scrap
metal. That's all.

280
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,137
That's why
I go deep.

281
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:01,770
 You don't have to say

282
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:03,271
anything you don't want to,
Mr. Overmeyer.

283
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,304
Well, you're not here
because you scavenge.

284
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,337
You know that.

285
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,170
I-It's too bright in here!

286
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:08,870
Bright in here!

287
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:11,237
I know you have a distinguished
military record, Harold.

288
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:12,704
10th Special Forces Group.

289
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,237
You know,
I was with the Rangers.

290
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:18,204
What, so, you...
you gonna tell me, uh,

291
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:19,903
"Harold, I know what
you been through.

292
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,337
"I been there, too,
you know?

293
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,237
I know how you ended up
how you ended up."

294
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:24,638
You telling me that?

295
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,204
Yeah. I'm telling you that.

296
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,137
I killed people.

297
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,870
You saved five of your men.

298
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:35,870
By shooting a pregnant woman.

299
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,204
She had a grenade
in her hand.

300
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:42,037
She had a child in her arms.

301
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:46,837
I shot her and...
the grenade went off.

302
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,137
She died right away.

303
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:55,671
That kid...

304
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,837
took awhile.

305
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:02,571
He kept looking at me, but I...

306
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,037
You did what a soldier
had to do.

307
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:08,371
Yeah. You know...
I was a good soldier--

308
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:10,371
I was a very good soldier--

309
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,903
but a pretty bad human being.

310
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,037
Pretty bad
human being.

311
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,604
What happened to Marni?

312
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:25,870
I... I hadn't seen
her in days, you know?

313
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:29,471
That's why I went 
to go take a look.

314
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:32,204
Rats were all
over her, man.

315
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,404
You know, the rats
were all over her.

316
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,204
How did you end up
with her things?

317
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,604
Oh, you know,
I was going to sell them.

318
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,471
I mean, she would have wanted me
to have those.

319
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:43,004
So you had nothing
to do with her death?

320
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:52,104
I, um... I...
I gave her something.

321
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,237
And that's

322
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:54,170
why she died.

323
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:55,970
What did you give her?

324
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,738
Mr. Overmeyer, I'm advising you
not to say anything else.

325
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,004
You know what? I think
it's best, um... I not

326
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,437
talk about
this anymore.

327
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:04,137
Not cause
any more trouble.

328
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:05,738
I... I got to go.

329
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,704
No, Harold, you can't,
all right? Not yet. You got...

330
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,704
It's too bright in
here! I got to go!
Harold...

331
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,304
I never wanted her to die.

332
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,204
I finished the skull.

333
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,204
We still have
some pieces missing,

334
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:20,471
but we should be able to
determine cause of death.

335
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:22,004
You haven't eaten
anything all day.

336
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,671
Now, I have some
killer yellowtail here

337
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,337
and spicy tuna rolls.

338
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:28,104
Time gets away
from me sometimes.

339
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:30,404
What?

340
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,571
The victim used
to say that.

341
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:34,437
You think the homeless
mole-guy killed her?

342
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:35,870
Booth does.

343
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:37,037
Well, he had her camera

344
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:38,504
and her bloody clothes.

345
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:40,037
Plus, he's killed
people before.

346
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:42,170
As a soldier.
Socially sanctioned.

347
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,770
Booth has killed people
as a law enforcer.

348
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,204
What if, from mole-man's

349
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,537
point of view, 
Marni was a criminal?

350
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:49,170
Marni Hunter
was an observer--

351
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,770
by definition, passive.

352
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:52,371
Like you?

353
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,671
Yes. Exactly.

354
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:58,137
Are you getting at something?

355
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,903
Just that I wish you were
a little more scared, Brennan.

356
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,237
I'm careful.

357
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:05,371
Running after a murderer
in the dark

358
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:07,104
is not being an observer.

359
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,738
Booth told you about that?

360
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,404
More and more
of your work

361
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,437
is outside of this lab,
running after bad guys.

362
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,738
Just promise me
you'll be careful.

363
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:19,070
Every society
has its fringe dwellers,

364
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:22,304
and every society
fears its fringe dwellers.

365
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,104
Usually because
they are the example

366
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,671
of what happens when you fail

367
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:27,271
in that society.
But they are

368
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:29,671
seldom dangerous in reality.

369
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,571
Brennan, I understand
that this is what you do

370
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,170
when things get too close
to home.

371
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:35,237
You get all analytical
and academic.

372
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:36,837
I just want you to know

373
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:39,337
that maybe Marni Hunter
did the same thing.

374
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:40,803
And now she's dead.

375
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,903
We got most of the skull.

376
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,638
There's just a piece missing
about the size of a quarter.

377
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:52,070
Why are missing pieces

378
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:53,704
always the size
of quarters?

379
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,937
Why are tumors always
the size of grapefruits?

380
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,638
Those are rhetorical

381
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,337
questions I'm not supposed
to answer, right?

382
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:01,638
These are
not simply

383
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:02,870
random abrasions.

384
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,704
What are they?
Marni's skull

385
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,704
was fractured by a midair impact
during her fall.

386
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,537
That's evidenced
by the radiating

387
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,638
fractures centered
above her right temporal bone,

388
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:14,537
but this damage is isolated
on the left side of her skull.

389
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,537
A girl can't bang both sides
of her head

390
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:17,970
as she falls down a shaft?

391
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,671
From the fracture pattern,

392
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:22,970
it appears to be a sharp,
pointed weapon.

393
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:24,837
Brennan mentioned
that Harold said

394
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:26,738
he had given the victim
something he wished he hadn't.

395
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:27,837
Could this have been it?

396
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,571
Fragments of Latin.

397
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,104
Roman numerals.

398
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,604
You know who knows
about that kind of stuff?

399
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,437
You show it to him.

400
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,738
No. I am not taking possession
of that piece of evidence.

401
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,471
You show it to him.

402
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:44,870
Armor-- a Roman cuirass. 

403
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:47,803
Doric columns common to Rome 
around the first century BC.

404
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,738
Crazy mole-guy gave
something to the victim

405
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:51,504
he thinks could
have gotten her killed.

406
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,271
Of course, he's crazy.

407
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,170
This could be valuable.

408
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,170
Let's have
Ms. Montenegro X-ray it.

409
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:58,738
Stress from the 
initial pressing

410
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,738
should provide
a clear picture

411
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:00,937
of what's been
worn away.

412
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:02,704
I was hoping
you'd take possession

413
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,537
of this piece
of evidence.

414
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:07,137
And the paperwork that
goes along with it.

415
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,170
I wasn't born yesterday,
Dr. Hodgins.

416
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,170
Well, you don't really
need me for this.

417
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,704
Yes, I do.
Why?

418
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,404
Because I have not
taken official possession

419
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:22,104
of this piece
of evidence.

420
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,104
Fascinating.

421
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:26,571
1778.

422
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,903
It appears to be
an official seal

423
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,903
of some kind.

424
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:35,738
Oh, my God!

425
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,137
Aren't you going
to go after him?

426
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:42,204
Nope.

427
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,837
Why not?

428
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,404
Because he is now officially
in charge of that medallion.

429
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,537
Treasure?

430
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,070
It's an official
vault seal,

431
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,870
manufactured
by the War Office.

432
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,870
It was established
in 1778.

433
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:58,537
The Latin <i>sigal</i> and <i>thesaur</i>
tie it to the treasury.

434
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:00,237
A bank vault kind of a vault.

435
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:01,604
Much better.

436
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,537
The War Office
established several vaults

437
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:05,504
under the city to safe keep
cultural treasures.

438
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,204
They must all be empty by now.

439
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,137
No, no. Several were
unaccounted for

440
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:11,704
after a series of cave-ins 
and mudslides

441
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,237
in the early 1900s.

442
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:15,037
So you're saying
this seal came off 

443
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,903
a vault full of treasure
buried beneath the city?

444
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,004
It could contain currency,
gold ingots,

445
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,738
paintings and engravings.

446
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:23,004
The original draft
of Lincoln's inaugural address

447
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,404
was never recovered.

448
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,004
This could be
an extraordinary find.

449
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,738
We have to find
these artifacts

450
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,937
before they're stolen

451
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,304
or sold off.

452
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:32,903
What's the monetary value
of this thing?

453
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,638
Priceless.

454
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:34,704
You can't put

455
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,837
a value on our cultural

456
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:36,870
heritage.

457
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,170
I think someone did.

458
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:39,504
That's why Marni's dead.

459
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:46,510
??

460
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:49,444
Yeah. She liked it.

461
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,544
Where did you get it?

462
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,677
Beyond the perimeter.

463
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:58,243
Harold? Harold, you
have to trust us.

464
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,343
We just want to find
who killed Marni.

465
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,111
And you can help.

466
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:08,977
You killed people.

467
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,078
Maybe this is your chance
to put that right.

468
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,144
You said you

469
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,911
wish you hadn't given it
to her. Why?

470
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,744
Did you take it
from someone?

471
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,477
The blonde.

472
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:20,844
It was hers.

473
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,777
And I shouldn't
have taken it.

474
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,310
A blonde killed Marni?

475
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,811
Marni went too deep.

476
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,944
That's the blonde's territory.

477
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,677
Does the blonde woman
have a name?

478
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,577
People around me die.

479
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:35,410
Marni died.

480
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:37,377
There's always going to
be casualties, Harold.

481
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:38,744
The important thing is
to recognize the enemy,

482
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:39,977
and take him out
so more people
don't get hurt.

483
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:44,677
Can you take us down there,
Harold?

484
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:46,577
No. It's beyond the perimeter.

485
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,577
I took Marni
beyond the perimeter.

486
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,410
I'm not going to make
that same mistake again.

487
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,977
Won't make 
that mistake again.

488
00:18:58,777 --> 00:18:59,977
The social worker.

489
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:01,711
Why? Because she's a blonde?

490
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,178
Yeah. I mean, come...

491
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,877
Why didn't she want
Marni poking around?

492
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,243
Because she thought
the documentary

493
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,377
was exploiting the homeless.

494
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:08,811
You buy that?

495
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,610
Well, obviously, you don't.
You know what?

496
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,410
You want to know
what a better reason

497
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:13,711
for not wanting somebody
poking around is?

498
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,644
A mythical treasure?

499
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:17,577
All right, look. You ever see
 <i>Treasure of the Sierra Madre?</i>

500
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,610
It doesn't matter
if the treasure

501
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,210
is mythical or not.

502
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,944
People will still kill
if they think it exists.

503
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,844
It did exist.

504
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,577
What?
In the movie,

505
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,944
it's gold dust.

506
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,377
People think it didn't exist,

507
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:30,811
so it blew away,
but it did exist.

508
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,510
But no one got it,
is the point.

509
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:35,977
Huh! All of a sudden,
you know a movie.

510
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,744
Everybody knows that movie.

511
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,610
Brennan.

512
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:42,677
It's Hodgins. Your victim
was in some other tunnel system

513
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:44,011
before she died.

514
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:46,078
Facts before conclusions,
please.

515
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,243
Her clothing shows traces
of diamond dust.

516
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,877
That suggests a much older
system of tunnels than the one

517
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,111
in which you found her.

518
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,977
Industrial diamonds were used 

519
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:55,011
in blast-hole drilling 
in the 19th century.

520
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:57,044
It's near a vault.
It makes sense.

521
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:01,310
Good job, Hodgins.

522
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:04,310
What would we do without you?

523
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:07,144
So Marni was killed
near a vault,

524
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,310
and then dragged to the shaft.

525
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,877
Harold will know
where that vault is.

526
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,610
Okay, maybe you could try

527
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,610
the "Hey, we're brothers
in arms" thing on him.

528
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:18,210
Okay, that, what you just said
right there, Bones--

529
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:19,477
that was cynical.

530
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:21,377
It was glib and cynical.

531
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,343
Really? 

532
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,078
Yes, really.

533
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,310
I know what
that guy has been through.

534
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:29,811
You killed a pregnant woman
who was holding a child?

535
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:34,078
Look, if you really
want to know

536
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,078
what I've done, I'll tell you,

537
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,844
but you better be ready
for the truth.

538
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,444
Good choice, Bones.

539
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,277
Harold is afraid of me?

540
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:53,911
Does he have any reason
to fear you?

541
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:55,544
Oh, Harold is afraid
of the world.

542
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,711
Why do you think
he lives underground?

543
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:57,510
Because he's
paying penance.

544
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:58,911
What?

545
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,078
You catch murderers
to pay off your penance.

546
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:03,343
Harold lives
underground.

547
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,310
Did you ever tell Marni
that you found her
documentary exploitive?

548
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:06,777
Of course I did.
I'm an honest person.

549
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,544
I told her I wouldn't help her.

550
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,811
Which is when she turned
to Harold as a guide.

551
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,310
Yes, and those two other guys.

552
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:12,577
What... what
two other guys?

553
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:13,977
She took climbing lessons--

554
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:16,111
how to use ropes--
all that stuff.

555
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,677
When you told Marni
that you thought
she was exploitive,

556
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,977
how did she react?

557
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,178
Well, she said
that showing the truth

558
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:21,944
couldn't possibly be exploitive.

559
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,744
I agree with her.

560
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:25,944
Truth doesn't mean the same
thing to everyone, Dr. Brennan.

561
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,911
Harold said he was afraid of me?

562
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:29,544
Said he was afraid
of a blonde.

563
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,677
How do you know
it wasn't Charlize Theron?

564
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:32,044
Who's that?

565
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,377
An actress.
She's being sarcastic.

566
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:34,577
Thank you for your help.

567
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:35,811
Appreciate it.

568
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,377
You know, you amaze me,
you know?

569
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:38,644
You know <i>Treasure</i>
 <i>of the Sierra Madre</i>

570
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,277
but you don't
know Charlize Theron.

571
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:41,343
You know who you are?

572
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,777
You're my grandmother.

573
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,610
Okay, here's
the recreation.

574
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:01,011
Here are the wounds.

575
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,044
Those skull fractures
are centered 

576
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:05,610
above the left
parietal lobe.

577
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:10,944
Okay, the lasers
can measure the angle

578
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,977
of the attack
and the amount of damage

579
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,644
that was done to the living bone

580
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,343
of the skull;
3.3 millimeters indentation

581
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,444
into the bone
at the deepest point

582
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,210
which trailed off
to .04 millimeters.

583
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:25,277
ZACK: 
A glancing blow.

584
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,844
Yeah, she saw it coming.

585
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,144
The angle of the attack

586
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,577
was between 50
and 53 degrees.

587
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,844
Meaning the attacker
struck from above.

588
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,811
And from the
victim's right.

589
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:41,677
So the attacker was left-handed.

590
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:43,977
She was only struck once.

591
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,477
Sometimes that's all it takes.

592
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:55,044
Good job, bro.

593
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:56,711
Take care.

594
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,078
Kyle Montrose and
Duke Diallel?

595
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,277
Yeah.

596
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:01,277
We're from the FBI.

597
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:03,144
We have credit card
receipts

598
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,811
showing that you gave Marni
Hunter climbing lessons.

599
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:06,977
If anyone could talk
the FBI

600
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:08,744
into getting a refund,
it's Marni.

601
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,744
She's dead.

602
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:13,944
What?

603
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,011
Oh, my God.

604
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,610
What happened?

605
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,544
She was found in a ventilation
shaft beneath the city.

606
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,811
Did she fall?

607
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:22,644
We told her
not to go down there.

608
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:23,944
It's way too dangerous.

609
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:28,343
Marni's dead? That's... God.

610
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,477
We gave her
some climbing lessons

611
00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:31,078
and rappelling,

612
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,711
but definitely not enough

613
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,243
for her to go spelunking
on her own.

614
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,078
Did you ever go into the tunnels
with her?

615
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:37,144
No, no, way.

616
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,310
The whole point of rock climbing

617
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,577
is to head for the sky, right?

618
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:41,243
She ever ask you to?

619
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,277
Yes, yes, she did.

620
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:43,477
She was doing some sort

621
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:45,677
of documentary and...

622
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:47,510
God, she fell?

623
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,078
That's what we're investigating.

624
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,744
You seem pretty shook up.

625
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:53,078
Well, yeah, somebody you know
dies, that's...

626
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,644
I'm sorry, sir,
but I got to ask.

627
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:56,343
Were you and Marni intimate?

628
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,644
Yeah, we-we had a thing,
but we broke up.

629
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,377
She had a fiancee

630
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,078
and I was always
very clear that I didn't

631
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,777
want to marry anyone.

632
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:11,310
But... I liked her.

633
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:14,777
God, this is terrible.

634
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,577
Did her fiancee know about you?

635
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:19,377
I don't know.

636
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:22,078
I can't believe this.

637
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:31,510
Yes, I was aware
there was another guy.

638
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:33,377
Marni was never sneaky.

639
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:34,777
Did you know
who it was?

640
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:35,977
No.

641
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,377
She told me it was over.

642
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,078
Romantic triangle--

643
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:41,844
it makes for a pretty
compelling motive.

644
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:42,644
You mean me?

645
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:45,711
I didn't kill Marni.

646
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,310
She was sleeping
with another man.

647
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:49,078
Why didn't you tell us that
your wedding was called off?

648
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:52,210
Because it's humiliating.

649
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:53,277
Make you angry?

650
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:54,844
Of course it made me angry

651
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,377
and depressed, made me

652
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:58,178
question my manhood, all that.

653
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,477
What do you want
from me?

654
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,677
I didn't kill Marni.

655
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:05,178
She always came back to me.

656
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:06,811
But this wasn't thfirst time
she found someone else.

657
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:09,144
No. 

658
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:12,078
Okay, Bones, the fact
that she was sleeping around,

659
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,444
that's going
to make it tougher.

660
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,677
Why?

661
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,310
Mythical treasure
versus actual jealous men?

662
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:17,577
That's stupid.

663
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:19,343
No, it's not
stupid, Bones, okay?

664
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,210
Jealousy is probably
the oldest motive for murder

665
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:22,644
 the world.

666
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:24,811
Any man getting involved
with a woman like Marni

667
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:26,644
should know that
she's adventurous
and independent.

668
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,011
Man, that's horrible
coffee.

669
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,310
Yeah, with
a cheating heart?

670
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:30,477
Well, if she didn't
hide anything.

671
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:33,111
She was direct
and honest.

672
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,844
Bones, I mean
you do realize

673
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:36,944
that you are discussing
motive right now?

674
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:39,410
Psychology,
not hard evidence.

675
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:42,510
It won't happen again.

676
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,011
We really need you

677
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,811
to show us where you
got this, Harold.

678
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:52,410
It's only safe on this side
of the perimeter.

679
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:53,844
Then just take us there.

680
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:55,277
Take us to the perimeter

681
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:55,777
and you point the rest
of the way.

682
00:25:56,977 --> 00:25:57,944
No.

683
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,210
Harold,

684
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:01,243
those people
you live with,

685
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,844
they depend on you.

686
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:05,410
What about them?

687
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,577
It's up to you
to keep them safe.

688
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:13,744
You know, you don't
have to live down here.

689
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,510
There are alternatives.

690
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:18,711
No, not for me.

691
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,178
You're hiding.

692
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:21,977
You have to face
your demons.

693
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:24,343
Living here, this
is the only way I can pay

694
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,977
so I won't have
to go to hell for
what I've done.

695
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,377
Harold, there are programs
that help people like you.

696
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:31,811
And what are
people like me?

697
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:33,178
Mentally ill.

698
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,711
Whoa, Bones, simmer down,
all right?

699
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:36,343
You might want to just,
you know,

700
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:36,944
sidle up to the issue
a little easier.

701
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,210
I like it.

702
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:41,011
Someone's honest,
says the truth.

703
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:42,544
You don't lie,
I guess.

704
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,011
No, I don't lie.

705
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:45,844
Agent Booth and I
would be glad to help you.

706
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:47,410
This is as far
as I go.

707
00:26:47,477 --> 00:26:49,011
It doesn't have
to be that way.

708
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:50,544
No, Bones, he means
this is the perimeter.

709
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,011
This is as far
as he agreed to take us.

710
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,977
Beyond this
it's not safe.

711
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:57,510
BRENNAN:
How much farther to where
you found the medallion?

712
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,977
HAROLD:
You'll see.
It's down there.

713
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:03,144
You stay here,
all right?

714
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,210
Between one soldier
to another?

715
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:06,243
You got my back.

716
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,777
I never left my men.

717
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,178
BOOTH:
Hmm, cave-in.

718
00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:37,444
Dead end.

719
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,078
We came all the way
down here for nothing.

720
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:50,904
??

721
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:59,174
This is a very old skeleton.

722
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:01,573
Male, mid-30s.

723
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,041
There's no clothing because
it simply rotted away.

724
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:07,473
Buttons: bone for the shirt,
pewter for the pants.

725
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,507
Brass eyelets
for the boots.

726
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,074
Belt buckle also pewter.

727
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:13,041
is is a half-inch button

728
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:17,207
from the Union Army
Corps of Engineers.

729
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,074
By Union Army you mean...

730
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,408
Civil War.

731
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:22,007
( <i>whistles</i> )
That plus the fact

732
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:24,408
that Hodgins found diamond dust
on this skeleton, too?

733
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:28,440
I think Marni Hunter was killed
in a Civil War era tunnel.

734
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,007
These pellets
are commonly known

735
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,640
as birdshot.

736
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:34,807
Pellet size 12, 0.73 inches
in diameter, made of lead.

737
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:36,640
Also Civil War vintage.

738
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,640
The spread pattern suggests
not a shotgun,

739
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:41,807
but a muzzle-loaded
pistol like a LeMat.

740
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:43,308
If you don't mind
some conjecture.

741
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:44,573
You're the boss.

742
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,174
This fellow knew

743
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,907
something of value
was being stored.

744
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:50,308
Came down with an accomplice.

745
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:56,473
I apologize. I've been hanging
around Booth way too much.

746
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,607
It's a valid hypothesis.

747
00:28:57,674 --> 00:28:59,607
No doubt one of many.

748
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,141
ADDY:
They argued.

749
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,807
One killed the other
for the treasure.

750
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,174
Doesn't that mean the vault
will be empty

751
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:05,274
when we find it?

752
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:08,573
Oh, my God, they got me, too.

753
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,607
If the vault had
been looted years ago,

754
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:13,640
the artifacts would have
surfaced, been sold off.

755
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:15,707
It must have
still been down there.

756
00:29:15,774 --> 00:29:17,674
I'll pull all the city plans
from the mid-19th century

757
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,874
to the present.

758
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:21,107
We have to save 
what we can.

759
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,374
Is there any way to discover
who these bastards are?

760
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,607
Zack,

761
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:26,674
take a cast of
Marni Hunter's skull.

762
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,107
See if we can be specific
about the murder weapon.

763
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:34,174
Booth thought Harold
could give you

764
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:35,774
enough for a sketch
of the blonde woman.

765
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,308
You said
he was suspicious.

766
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,141
What if I can't get him
to trust me.

767
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,473
You nervous?

768
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,507
I'm not nervous.
I'm scared.

769
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,341
I don't know how
to talk to crazy people

770
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,341
unless I'm dating them.

771
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:49,874
I'm not sure
he's actually
clinically insane.

772
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:52,107
Okay. I don't know how
to talk to people

773
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,408
who live underground
and who might have tossed

774
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:56,007
a documentary filmmaker
down a hole.

775
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:58,308
Just be honest
with him, Ang.

776
00:29:58,374 --> 00:30:00,308
Treat him with respect.

777
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:01,907
You're good at that.

778
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:16,107
You're scared of me.

779
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,473
Yes.

780
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,840
Why?

781
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,174
You live underground.

782
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:24,941
Yes, I find it
very bright up here.

783
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:51,907
How does this work?

784
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:56,440
Um, you tell me what
the blonde looks like

785
00:30:56,507 --> 00:30:57,907
and I draw her.

786
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:00,674
You mean, like height,
weight, hair color?

787
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,207
Yeah. Yeah, but more.

788
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:05,074
More?

789
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:08,607
Yes, you know,
how she seemed to you.

790
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:10,241
You know, your, uh,

791
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,674
your impressions.

792
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:15,874
Her eyes are dead.

793
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:20,807
Like she sees you and doesn't
at the same time.

794
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:21,840
You mean like that?

795
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:22,974
Yeah.

796
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:29,573
Her mouth was small.

797
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,674
Stern. Little...

798
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,941
The mold filled in

799
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:43,207
the missing sections
of the skull.

800
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:44,740
It shows the entry point
of the injury 

801
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,674
has a very distinctive
shape.

802
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,640
Enlarge the image.

803
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,241
ZACK:
It's a "T."

804
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:55,174
It's not a knife or a hammer
that I've seen before.

805
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,907
Okay, make a list
of possible implements

806
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:59,374
using the size
and force of the damage.

807
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,207
Marni Hunter's fiancee
found some raw footage

808
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:04,473
of her documentary.

809
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,941
A dark labyrinth, a warren
of tunnels and fissures,

810
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:12,573
forgotten coal cellars,
sewer lines, storm drains,

811
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,440
sub-basements, access shafts,
easements and crawlspaces,

812
00:32:17,507 --> 00:32:20,074
some as old as the city itself.

813
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,674
Why would anyone
venture down here?

814
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,274
Bones, I thought
she worked alone.

815
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:26,640
Who's running
the camera?

816
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:30,974
...shelter for a place to hide
from the evils of the world.

817
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,141
Others are looking
for treasure.

818
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,874
Look, she might have started
out to make a documentary

819
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:38,408
about the homeless,
but she wound up

820
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:39,674
using Harold
so that she could

821
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,141
loot the treasure.

822
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:44,074
Doesn't mean
she deserves to die.

823
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:46,007
And who are these
treasure hunters?

824
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:50,141
Not the homeless who scrounge
for bits of metal.

825
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,874
Some are Civil War enthusiasts.

826
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:56,274
And some are remarkably
handsome adventurers.

827
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,473
I am so sorry.

828
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,341
BONES:
They said they never
went underground.

829
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,983
??

830
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:10,740
??

831
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:13,174
with a handle, not a hatchet.

832
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,141
Those climbers haven't been
back to their apartment

833
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:16,474
since we talked
to them last.

834
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,040
I think the murder weapon
was a climbing axe.

835
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,574
How about this:

836
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,974
while exploring those tunnels
with Marni Hunter,

837
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,141
those climbers, they find
something valuable.

838
00:33:24,207 --> 00:33:26,141
Marni wants to
put it in her film,

839
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:28,174
those climbers, they want
to take it for themselves.

840
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,241
Wham on the head,
smack down the shaft.

841
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:32,207
Logical to think
they're down there now

842
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:33,307
emptying out that vault.

843
00:33:33,374 --> 00:33:35,074
That was a total bust.

844
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:37,274
Harold couldn't provide you
with a description?

845
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,241
Yeah, he provided me with
a description all right.

846
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:43,141
That's the blonde
that Harold

847
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,840
keeps seeing in the tunnel?
See, this is
what happens

848
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,341
when you ask for information
from the mentally ill.

849
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:47,840
Where did you get that?

850
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:49,773
I drew it.

851
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,107
That, Ms. Montenegro,
is a Raeburn.

852
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:53,673
Sir Henry Raeburn

853
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,141
painted a number of
these studies,

854
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:57,707
extremely rare now.

855
00:33:57,773 --> 00:33:59,407
Very valuable.

856
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:00,274
There.

857
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,740
Hmph. Damn, I'm good.

858
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:08,740
 <i>Miss Eleanor Urquhart</i> painted
in 1793 by Sir Henry Raeburn.

859
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,241
Missing since 1862.

860
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:11,773
Worth over $200,000.

861
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:14,174
If Harold saw that
underground,

862
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,807
he's seen the inside
of the vault.

863
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:16,840
Let's go.

864
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,374
Booth.

865
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:20,174
It's a labyrinth down there.

866
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:23,207
You can't blunder around
in the dark looking for them.

867
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:26,141
Maybe you won't have to.

868
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:29,141
I entered all the modern
and historical city plans,

869
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:30,940
including ventilation shafts
and tunnels,

870
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:32,608
plus the newer schematics.

871
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:34,374
There's also oral accounts
of tunnel construction

872
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:36,141
and underground passages.

873
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,207
Wow.

874
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:39,673
All that exists
under the city?

875
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,907
Yes. What we can corroborate.

876
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,574
Good point, Bones,

877
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,574
you know, not rushing off
to find those guys.

878
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,141
How accurate is this?

879
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:51,107
Blue is modern,
near 100% accurate.

880
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:52,673
Yellow is historical.

881
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,241
GOODMAN:
Estimate 80%.

882
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:56,307
MONTENEGRO:
Red represents less exact

883
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,974
renderings from stories,
memoirs,

884
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,608
accounts from city workers...

885
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:02,441
Unfortunately,
if this treasure exists,

886
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:04,207
it probably exists in one of
the red tunnels.

887
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:06,773
Well, we found that Civil War
victim near a cave-in.

888
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,740
Maybe the treasure's
on the other side?

889
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,707
Inductive,
reductive or deductive?

890
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:13,541
Deductive.

891
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:14,608
GOODMAN:
As you wish.

892
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:16,141
Ms. Montenegro, please

893
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:18,040
remove all tunnels
containing power, cable

894
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:19,773
or utility lines.

895
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,508
And fiber optics.
Yes...

896
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:23,241
also steam tunnels
and transit access?

897
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,740
Oh, what about diamond dust?

898
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:31,407
You said that there
was diamond dust

899
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:32,974
in the old tunnels.

900
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,940
There was also diamond dust
on the Civil War guy...

901
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:37,407
So... what?

902
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:38,707
I'm not allowed to help now?

903
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,707
That's inductive logic.

904
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,007
We agreed on deductive.

905
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,574
I'm sorry, I'm just, you know,

906
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,508
trying to think outside
your box.

907
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:54,940
Can you indicate where we found
Marni Hunter's body

908
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:58,141
and the Civil War victim?

909
00:35:58,207 --> 00:35:59,940
BOOTH:
'Cause, you know,
if Marni was killed

910
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,407
near the treasure
and moved,

911
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:02,840
and the Civil War guy

912
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,241
was murdered
by his accomplice...

913
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:05,907
Mm, gotcha.

914
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,740
Can you connect
the two bodies?

915
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,574
This one's the closest.

916
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:19,740
There's no way to get there.

917
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:20,707
Wait, can you put
some more blue lines

918
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:21,474
back in that area?

919
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:24,174
It's just a guess.

920
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:25,307
Throwing it
out there.

921
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,341
Sue me.

922
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:31,608
And connect where Marni Hunter's
body was found.

923
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,740
Somewhere along that line
is where the treasure is.

924
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,107
What's that blue line?

925
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:38,974
MONTENEGRO:
Storm sewer.

926
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,174
H-15B.

927
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,407
The weapon was a Hanks

928
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:42,374
climbing axe.

929
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,474
This is one of the situations
where I need a gun.

930
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,640
No, you don't, okay.
We're going to have six

931
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:53,374
highly-trained FBI Tac Team
members do the dirty work.

932
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:54,773
We're just going to watch.

933
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,307
What's your 20,
Tac Team Three?

934
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:58,207
According to this map,
we're with you?

935
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:59,474
They aren't with us.

936
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,773
I realize that, Bones.

937
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,207
Re-orient,
Tac Team Three.

938
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:05,107
Suggest you wait
for rendezvous, Booth.

939
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:07,907
Ten-four,
Tac Team Three.

940
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,608
Okay, I bet tick-tock team
is here,

941
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:12,307
two levels above us.

942
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:14,141
Don't call them
tick-tock team, okay?

943
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:15,174
They're Tac Team.

944
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,907
It's short for tactical.

945
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:20,040
Can I just have a gun
at least until they get here?

946
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:22,407
It's not for shooting rats.

947
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:24,541
It's for psychos
with climbing axes.

948
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,241
BRENNAN:
Okay. So what do
we do, just wait?

949
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:29,807
We just, uh,
we reconnoiter.

950
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:30,740
In.

951
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,407
Tic-Tac.

952
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,307
Easy.

953
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:42,241
Watch yourself.

954
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,441
BOOTH:
Wow.

955
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,807
What do we got here?

956
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:00,241
Tac Team Three,
this is Booth.

957
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:01,307
What's your six?

958
00:38:01,374 --> 00:38:02,907
Stand by, Booth.

959
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:03,840
They're lost.

960
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,040
They're not lost.

961
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:16,007
What's that,
lucky quarter?

962
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:17,508
This could be
the missing piece

963
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:20,341
from Marni Hunter's skull.

964
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,141
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Okay.

965
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:23,541
Think she was killed here?

966
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:24,807
That's a plausible
conclusion.

967
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:26,574
Don't get all gushy on me.

968
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,207
Tick Tock Three.

969
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:29,673
Did you just call us
Tick Tock?

970
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,007
Tac Team Three, standby.

971
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,807
MAN:
Maybe we should've
brought bigger bags.

972
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:36,174
Do you hear that?

973
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:39,107
Yeah.

974
00:38:49,274 --> 00:38:50,840
That's the blonde woman.

975
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,141
This is locked.

976
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:57,707
You know what,
we got to get in there.

977
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,241
Are we waiting for
Tick Tock Three?

978
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,807
They might not
find us for a week.

979
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:02,274
If we go after them,
these guys will take off.

980
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,807
I want to catch them
in the act of stealing.

981
00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:06,541
All right, we can
go in through here.

982
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:07,707
Bones, we go in there,
you are responsible

983
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:09,441
for whoever is on your left.

984
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:11,207
Okay, you put
your gun on him.
Okay.

985
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:13,074
How will I know whether
or not to shoot?

986
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:15,640
Wondering whether or not
to shoot, you shoot.

987
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:17,441
And let you do the talking.
Yeah, well, I took
that one for granted.

988
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:19,874
We should've brought
bigger bags.

989
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,174
( <i>chuckling</i> )

990
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:26,673
FBI. Hands in the air.

991
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,241
Yeah, hands in the air.

992
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,374
We're not armed.
Everybody relax.

993
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:33,508
They don't shoot people
for trespassing.

994
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:35,807
They do for murder.
Put your hands on your head.

995
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,508
Do it.

996
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,374
Murder?! What murder?

997
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:41,740
Kyle, I'm throwing you
these restraints.

998
00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:42,707
Put them on Duke.

999
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,241
Now.

1000
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:46,307
How are we supposed to climb
out of here in handcuffs?

1001
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,174
Would you rather
go out in body bags?

1002
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:49,374
Put on the damn
restraints.

1003
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:50,608
( <i>clears throat</i> )

1004
00:39:50,673 --> 00:39:53,107
Let you do the talking.
Got it.

1005
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:54,608
You think
we killed Marni?

1006
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:55,640
She was killed
with a climbing axe.

1007
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:56,940
Duke, sit down.

1008
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,773
Bones, give me your gun.

1009
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,707
Take the restraints
out of my belt,

1010
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,807
and put them on Kyle.

1011
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:07,407
That's not cocked, is it?
Because where that's pointed...

1012
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:08,640
You're safe.

1013
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:10,608
Marni was killed
with a climbing axe?

1014
00:40:10,673 --> 00:40:12,608
She knew about this treasure,
she was going to put it

1015
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:14,508
in her documentary,
would've cost you
guys a fortune.

1016
00:40:14,574 --> 00:40:17,341
So one of you
killed her.

1017
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:19,074
Who's left handed?
Bones, you know,

1018
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:20,508
it's best to have this
sort of explanation

1019
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:22,207
after the bad guys
are incapacitated.

1020
00:40:22,274 --> 00:40:23,241
Why?

1021
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:24,608
You killed her for this?

1022
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:29,541
That's why.

1023
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:31,907
Yeah, well, I'll try to remember
that for next time.

1024
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:46,604
You single-handedly regained

1025
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,370
one of the great cultural finds
of the century.

1026
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,304
A glimpse of Civil War life.

1027
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,037
Marni Hunter wanted to document
the treasure, not steal it.

1028
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:54,570
So Duke killed her

1029
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:56,171
and threw her down
a bottomless pit.

1030
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:58,304
Kyle wasn't so innocent himself.

1031
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,403
He hit Duke in the crypt
with a candlestick.

1032
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:04,204
Kyle hit the Duke
with a candlestick in the crypt.

1033
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,304
That's very good.

1034
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,238
Very good.

1035
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,570
Right?

1036
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:10,770
What?

1037
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:11,837
What's the joke?

1038
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:12,904
Wha...?

1039
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,670
Clue?

1040
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:16,837
What clue?

1041
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,604
What clue?

1042
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,370
Unbelievable, Bones.

1043
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,370
What's funny?

1044
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:24,971
I have no idea.

1045
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:28,971
Harold's being releangd.

1046
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:31,904
You found a place for him?

1047
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:36,104
Yes.

1048
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:00,037
Here, Harold,
here's some food.

1049
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:02,071
Thanks.
