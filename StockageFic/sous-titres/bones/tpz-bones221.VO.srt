- <i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>
- <i>[Man] Walk it back three meters.</i>

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,141
[Booth]
Oh, oh, oh.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,143
Well, you should've worn gum boots.

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,476
- I'm fine, you know. I'm... I'm agile.
- <i>[Siren Blares]</i>

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:19,780
- So, Hodgins asked, uh, Angela to marry him.
- Twice.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,380
Whoa. And she, uh,
turned him down both times.

7
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,517
- I heard all this from Angela.
- Yeah, but did she tell you
that he said that he was...

8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,528
he wasn't gonna ask her
to marry him?

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,759
- Yes.
- And she said?

10
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,324
- "I'd like to marry you."
- Kind of sudden, Bones. Let me think about it.

11
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:40,339
- What? No, Booth. That's
what Angela told Hodgins...
- [Chuckling]

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,807
- <i>[Man] Two lights over here!</i>
- You're joking.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,313
You know, a lot of psychologists say that jokes
are the way we manifest our hidden desires.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,610
Yeah. [Grunts]
Geez!

15
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,616
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,279
- What have we got?
- Uh, during a foot pursuit last night...

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,916
suspect tosses a knife into this muck
in an effort to avoid incarceration.

18
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,153
The effluent gets drained.
We start finding stuff.

19
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,161
Define "stuff."

20
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,188
Stuff... cell phones, guns,
knives, crack vials...

21
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,293
<i>Evidently, you wanna lose something</i>
<i>in this vicinity, you toss it in here.</i>

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,668
<i>Miscreants probably think</i>
<i>it's some sort ofbottomless pit.</i>

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,435
<i>[Brennan] Does the word "concise"</i>
<i>mean anything to you?</i>

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:19,035
Uh, we found that. Concise enough?

25
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,686
<i>It's small.</i>

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,450
<i>Is it a kid?</i>

27
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:35,825
<i>Female. Pelvic girdle and skull sutures</i>
<i>suggest preadolescent.</i>

28
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,199
- Child's pencil case.
- How long has she been dead?

29
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,533
- Does this freeze over in the winter?
- Yeah. Solid.

30
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,699
It's possible she was placed here
as long ago as last fall.

31
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,802
- Cause of death?
- Looks like a gunshot wound
to the back of the head.

32
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,746
- Can you guess the caliber?
- Nothing larger than a.22.

33
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,749
- Find any.22s?
- Two.

34
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,082
<i>All right. Let's get an F.B.I. forensic team</i>
<i>down here and search for bullet fragments.</i>

35
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,315
<i>[Officer]</i>
<i>I'll go call it in right now.</i>

36
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,563
"I love you."

37
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:17,592
You said that pedophiles can delude themselves
into thinking they love their victims.

38
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,273
<i>Nice traditional church service.</i>
<i>Very ecumenical.</i>

39
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,542
That's great. As long as the reception
makes Caligula blush.

40
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,948
- Let's hope he got his invitation.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,112
- <i>[Angela] Hey, what are those?</i>
- <i>They were found in this case.</i>

42
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:39,284
Probably belong to the victim. And these are
water samples teeming with organisms.

43
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,887
I found an inordinately large number of dead
fairy shrimp in the mud beneath the remains.

44
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,523
I will not make
a"clap for Tinker Bell"joke.

45
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,295
[Chuckles]

46
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,533
How's about we not discuss child murder and
our upcoming nuptials in the same conversation?

47
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,131
That's a good idea.

48
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,709
Hey, do you want me to,
uh, change my name?

49
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,411
Do you want me to want you
to change your name?

50
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,160
<i>[Brennan] Do you know</i>
<i>what you're looking at?</i>

51
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:23,328
<i>The neck bone...</i>
<i>that's connected to the shoulder bone.</i>

52
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:29,332
There's arthritic lipping
here and here on the posterior dens.

53
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,813
- Arthritis.
- For this to occur, she had to...
she had to look up like this.

54
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,341
- Maybe she prayed a lot.
- Four to six hours a day?
What did she want so badly?

55
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,683
Her father?

56
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,316
- Hey, baby.
- Dad.

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,450
- Booth.
- Put your hands up.

58
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,623
- Booth!
- I was hoping we could get
a drink before this part.

59
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,098
Max Keenan, you're under arrest
as an escaped felon.

60
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay. Then I guess
that's no on the drink, huh?

61
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,800
- Bones, grab the cuffs
out of my back pocket there.
- No.

62
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,306
- What do you mean no? Bones.
- It's okay, baby.

63
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,003
I don't want to handcuff my own father.
Plus, remember when he saved your life?

64
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,171
<i>Just throw 'em over here.</i>
<i>I'll do it myself.</i>

65
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,511
He's tellin' me what to do.
Put your hands on the wall.

66
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,517
What... Dad, what are you doing here?

67
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,179
- I heard you were getting married.
- What? No.

68
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,315
Angela's getting married
to Hodgins. Not me.

69
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,825
- Oh, the bug guy. Uh... Oh, that's great.
- <i>[Handcuffs Ratcheting]</i>

70
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,123
Will you shut up, please? Well...

71
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,324
Long enough for me to Mirandize him.

72
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,993
"You got the right to remain silent."
Got it. We'll talk more later.

73
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,901
Look, I'm sorry, Bones, but he killed
the deputy director of the F.B.I.

74
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,872
- I'm just doin' my job.
- It's okay.

75
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,741
- He's right.
- Kisses, baby.

76
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,079
Uh, sweetie, was that your dad?

77
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,183
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

78
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,192
What do you mean,
that's not Max Keenan?

79
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,525
<i>Cher,</i> you know that's Max Keenan
and I know that's Max Keenan.

80
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,123
But to the rest of the world, that man
is a hardworkin' electrician...

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,293
from Coos Bay, Oregon
named Art McGregor.

82
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,066
That electrician was a bank robber
for 15 years and murdered two F.B.I. agents.

83
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,269
- Only one was still an agent
at the time of his demise.
- The guy was a deputy director.

84
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,804
And a crooked, murderin' son of a bitch...
not to speak ill of the dead.

85
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,339
Driver's license,
credit cards, tax returns...

86
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,943
And this library card
was issued 11 years ago.

87
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,955
- Complete history?
- Yes.

88
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,787
We'll keep diggin',
but, <i>cher,</i> I don't know.

89
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,885
- I gotta cut that guy loose.
- <i>Legally speakin'...</i>

90
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:07,899
that man is a law-abidin', taxpayin',
fully certified, dues payin' member...

91
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,765
- of the International Brotherhood of...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,567
- <i>[Door Slams]</i>
...since 1984.

93
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,845
<i>Tell me something, Max.</i>

94
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:26,317
On a job site, what's the most hazardous
classification for an electrician?

95
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,911
Class I, Division 1...
You planning a career change?

96
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,791
<i>Oh, you're checkin' out my prints.</i>

97
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:38,024
<i>Max, you know I like you and I hate to hurt</i>
<i>Bones, but, uh, it's myjob to catch you...</i>

98
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,031
and I'm very good at my job.

99
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,260
You'd have to be
to work with my daughter.

100
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:46,032
What do you say,
shake hands with an old con.

101
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,505
Or-Or is that bad for the F.B.I. image?

102
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,134
You abandoned her as a child.

103
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,144
You don't think she feels that...

104
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,273
every time you pop in
and out of her life, huh?

105
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,785
[Chuckles]
You're just saying that so I'll hit you...

106
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,790
and you got a reason to lock me up.

107
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:11,093
Twenty years ago,
that would've worked.

108
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,990
<i>[Zack]</i>
<i>Your estimate was correct.</i>

109
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,366
<i>This hole is consistent</i>
<i>with a.22-caliber slug.</i>

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,372
I learned "slug" from Cam.

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,170
It's a colloquialism
for "projectile."

112
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,836
Which, so far, the F.B.I.
has been unable to find.

113
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,871
Okay, I have a face, but
you are not going to like it.

114
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,556
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>That is an old woman.</i>

115
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,492
I provided you with the tissue data
for a 10-year-old Caucasian female.

116
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:47,795
Well, when I actually held the skull
and started, the tissue markers felt wrong.

117
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:52,361
Angela, with all due respect to your art,
facial reconstruction is a science.

118
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:57,205
It's both, babe. And this time,
art made science her bitch.

119
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,575
- Mmm...
- Hey, moan all you want. I stand by this.

120
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,581
<i>We should recheck for other indications</i>
<i>that we got the age wrong.</i>

121
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,549
Because art made science her bitch?

122
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,882
Because the lipping on the vertebrae
had to have been caused...

123
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,445
by looking up
over a period of several years.

124
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,117
That's a scientific rationale
for rechecking.

125
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,530
Hey, Brennan.
I'd like to ask you a favor.

126
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,194
Well, it's not so much ask a favor
as-as extend an honor.

127
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,670
I mean, I hope you see it as an honor
and don't think of it as some onerous duty.

128
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,230
Which I don't think you will, but then again,
I've never done this before...

129
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,108
- Angela, just ask.
- Will you be my maid of honor?

130
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,773
At the wedding?

131
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,243
[Exhales]
Is that yes?

132
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,756
I'm... completely, totally honored.

133
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,792
Really? I thought I'd
have to tell you...

134
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,521
I don't even care
how awful the bridesmaid dresses are.

135
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,496
I'm... so glad you asked me.

136
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,499
[Chuckles]

137
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,161
<i>[Max] I have your brother set up</i>
<i>in a little auto supply place.</i>

138
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,330
<i>It's a "shade-tree mechanic" situation.</i>

139
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,340
You set him up where? Oregon?

140
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,433
It's better that you don't know.

141
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,104
He's, uh,
in violation of his parole.

142
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,942
Because you made him
leave the state.

143
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,974
Y-Your brother
is in a slippery slope, and...

144
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,647
Yeah, I know, I know.
The irony of me being a good influence.

145
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,316
But it's true. I am.

146
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,759
It's nice to see you smile.
That's... That's something.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,302
Booth is going to find proof of who you are.
Then he'll arrest you.

148
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,964
Not tonight.

149
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,842
Did you come here just to tell me
that Russ is okay?

150
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,813
No, actually.
I have something for you that...

151
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,442
that, uh,
belonged to your grandmother.

152
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,988
<i>I have a grandmother?</i>

153
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,854
I know your mother and I told you
that you didn't have grandparents...

154
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,554
but... try it on.

155
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,371
I... I have to go to bed.

156
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,275
There are some inconsistencies
with the remains...

157
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,905
which I have to address
first thing in the morning.

158
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,347
Okay.

159
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,484
You're welcome...
to stay here if you want.

160
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,988
- The cou... The couch would be great.
- No, Dad, I...

161
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,588
I made up the guest room...
in case... you...

162
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,260
[Exhales]
Good night.

163
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,449
His fingerprints don't match?

164
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,179
There's nothing to compare 'em to.

165
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,051
Max Keenan got himself
wiped from the system.

166
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,183
- That's right.
- Who is this guy, some sort of supercriminal?

167
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,727
Must've been Deputy Director Kirby.

168
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,787
He wanted Max dead, so...
made him invisible first.

169
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,390
Hmm. That would be
an ironic twist...

170
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,403
seein' as how you wanna arrest Max
for Kirby's murder.

171
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,940
You don't have doubts
about catchin' this guy, do you?

172
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,570
<i>I mean, he is your partner's father.</i>

173
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:24,138
No. [Scoffs]
Bones gets it.

174
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,548
You hope she does.

175
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,789
I'll get you a warrant
to collect a D.N.A. sample from the man.

176
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,623
<i>You</i> find something to compare it to.

177
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,729
<i>No wisdom teeth</i>
<i>suggests prepubescence.</i>

178
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,236
The lower bone plate
and the radius have not fused.

179
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,898
Angela's wrong.
The victim is not yet 20.

180
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,668
- Mmm...
- What?

181
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,643
The arthritic lipping
on the vertebrae...

182
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,842
degeneration in the collarbone,
spiking on the superior articular process...

183
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,079
<i>And all the large bones in her body</i>
<i>show "osteolytis" and advanced deterioration.</i>

184
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,019
Meaning Angela was right.

185
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,183
Meaning you are not wrong,
which is not the same as being right.

186
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,658
Progeria.

187
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,821
She had one of the aging diseases.

188
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,423
Anyone wanna hear about the hit
my sketch got off the N.C.I.C. database?

189
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:21,868
Chelsea Cole, age 22.
Went missing last November.

190
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,637
Good, Angela.

191
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,201
Really good.

192
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,982
Yeah.

193
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,487
- Zack...
- I really should have thought of that.

194
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,649
A disease which prevents the sufferer
from entering puberty...

195
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,989
but simultaneously
ages her otherwise.

196
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,393
I'd like to ask you
to be my best man on Saturday.

197
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,624
Things aren't always either-or.
Sometimes they're both.

198
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,224
At my wedding.

199
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,895
Saturday.

200
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,030
To Angela.

201
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,577
My best man.

202
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,477
- When do I have to decide?
- You have to think about it?

203
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,641
- Yes.
- Fine.

204
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,719
Let me know what you decide.

205
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,562
You found her in a shopping cart?

206
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,690
- Yes.
- From Tuffs Grocery?

207
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:25,032
- How did you know that?
- Chelsea loved Tuffs.

208
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,902
Give her a dollar,
and she'd go down there...

209
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,932
<i>and buy a candy bar or...</i>
<i>some cheap toy.</i>

210
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,880
<i>Everybody knew Chelsea, walking along</i>
<i>with one small thing in a big cart...</i>

211
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,883
bringing it home to show me.

212
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,409
- Did Chelsea draw these?
- Yes.

213
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,682
She's 22 years old.
These are drawings of a young child.

214
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,389
Oh, Chelsea had a... condition.

215
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,728
- Werner's syndrome?
- How did you know?

216
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,325
- What's that?
- It's an aging disease...

217
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,803
in which mental development
can be a factor.

218
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:08,169
Your daughter spent
a long time looking up, correct?

219
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,114
<i>Chelsea was obsessed with the stars.</i>

220
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,018
She thought they were
signals from heaven...

221
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,454
showing people the way home.

222
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,291
Mrs. Cole,
when Chelsea disappeared...

223
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,295
you, uh, gave the police a name?

224
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,491
Joe Mellon. He was a caretaker
provided by the city...

225
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,592
<i>while I was going to classes</i>
<i>at community college.</i>

226
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,900
One night, I came home from class...

227
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,239
and her hair smelled
like the shampoo I use... lemons.

228
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,404
I always use baby shampoo
on Chelsea.

229
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,116
Th-That wasn't... part of his job,
bathing Chelsea?

230
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,983
Definitely not!

231
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,785
<i>I complained to Child Services</i>
<i>and they, um...</i>

232
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,917
launched an investigation.

233
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,861
Which ended
as soon as Chelsea disappeared.

234
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,661
- I guess so.
- No victim, no crime.

235
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,136
<i>I absolutely...</i>
<i>did not molest Chelsea Cole.</i>

236
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,443
- Why'd Child Services let you go?
- They didn't let me go.

237
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,211
They reassigned me 'cause they know
I didn't do anything wrong.

238
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,448
What did you not do wrong, Joe?

239
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:28,285
Chelsea Cole had the mental capacity
of a six-year-old.

240
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,852
She got jam all over her
and freaked out from being sticky.

241
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,231
So I ran her a bath, and I sat
outside the bathroom door...

242
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,736
and made her talk to me
while she was in the tub.

243
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,501
She used her mom's shampoo,
and it stung her eyes. She cried.

244
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,340
So I went in and rinsed the soap
out of her eyes.

245
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,074
And then I went back out
and let her get dressed...

246
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,049
what is what she told her mother,
who did not listen.

247
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,517
Then why is Cynthia Cole
so insistent...

248
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,850
that you were inappropriate
with her daughter?

249
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,390
l-I crossed the line, man.

250
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,485
I... suggested
that Cynthia consider...

251
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,928
an alternate solution for Chelsea.

252
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,330
What, like an institution?

253
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,459
The woman was exhausted.
She-She was lookin' like crap.

254
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,495
She was failin' all of her college courses.
She couldn't hold on to a job.

255
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,734
Everything was goin' downhill.

256
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:22,440
Listen, Joe. I want you
to look me in the eye...

257
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,712
and tell me that you never
touched that little girl.

258
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,051
I wiped the soap out of her eyes...

259
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,057
and I wrapped a towel around her.

260
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,060
That's it.

261
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,924
<i>[Max] This ring was, uh, passed down</i>
<i>from oldest daughter to oldest daughter.</i>

262
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,970
It's a tradition in your mother's side
of the family.

263
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,632
You told Russ and me
that we didn't have any relatives.

264
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,800
Well, honey, we were underground.

265
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,969
We had new names.
We had to tell you that.

266
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,816
What's the truth?

267
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,985
Your mother's the oldest
of three sisters...

268
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,578
<i>and if you wanna seek them out,</i>
<i>you show them the ring...</i>

269
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,623
they'll know who you are
and accept you into the family.

270
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,454
What about on your side?

271
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,619
Your mother was
the only family I ever knew.

272
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,459
<i>And you and Russ.</i>

273
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,999
You abandoned me for 15 years.

274
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,298
And I'll do whatever I can
to make repairs.

275
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,135
While running away from the F.B. I?

276
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,836
I have more...
a message from your mother on videotape.

277
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,903
Wh... What does she say?

278
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,972
I don't know. It's for you.

279
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,143
When you're ready.

280
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,582
<i>Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>but I have a warrant here...</i>

281
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:42,058
to take a D.N.A. sample from you...

282
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:47,292
Mr. Arthur McGregor
from Coos Bay, Oregon.

283
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,694
I'm really sorry.

284
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,607
- Zack?
- There's a recalcification around this hole.

285
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,648
It healed.

286
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:08,709
Zack, I'm getting married Saturday.
Two short days, man.

287
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,948
I need to know
if you'll stand up with me.

288
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,395
I don't need a formal response.
A simple yes...

289
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,461
Iraq?

290
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,036
You can't go to Iraq.

291
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,839
- The president is asking me personally.
- No.

292
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,245
Not personally.
The president has a machine to sign for him.

293
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,308
He's probably talking to every forensic
anthropologist in the country.

294
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,650
You can't go to Iraq. No.

295
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:48,022
No way. You... You stay here and you be
my best man. You let someone else go.

296
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,391
He says I'm at
the forefront of my field...

297
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,363
- that my country needs me.
- You can't go to Iraq.

298
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,732
Zack, will you be my best man
or not?

299
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,328
No.

300
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,772
- Why?
- Because if I decide to do
what the president wants...

301
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,776
and go to Iraq and get killed...

302
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,869
you won't be able to remember
your wedding with happiness.

303
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,414
Okay. Big assumption there, buddy.

304
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,714
Rationally speaking, I'm not good
at social ritual. You should ask Booth.

305
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,880
Everything isn't rational.

306
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,254
It should be.

307
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,658
I no longer believe
this is a bullet hole.

308
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,630
I believe this
was created by a drill.

309
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,096
Chelsea had brain surgery
when she was three.

310
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,575
- They had to drill into her skull?
- Yes, to relieve the pressure.

311
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,272
- These are accurate.
- I beg your pardon?

312
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:47,216
These are all constellations...
Centaurus, Aquarius, Gemini.

313
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:52,223
I knew Chelsea loved the stars, but I never
thought her drawings were actually...

314
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,193
- They're real?
- This one's Delphinus, the dolphin.

315
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,627
It was... my favorite
when I was a child.

316
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,222
My mother and I
both loved dolphins...

317
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,292
so that was something that we...

318
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,268
shared.

319
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,903
Mrs. Cole, why exactly did, uh,
your daughter require brain surgery?

320
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,913
Why did you ask it like that?

321
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,677
<i>You think</i>
<i>I did something to Chelsea.</i>

322
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,776
Head injuries
are extremely common...

323
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,844
with children
who are physically abused.

Excuse me, but it's very important that
I take my medication on time.

325

My daughter, age three,
fell out of bed.

326
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,538
She didn't stop crying, and so I took her
to the hospital. She had the surgery.

<i>It was because of that injury that they</i>
<i>discovered that she had the aging disease.</i>

- Is that Hodgins?

338

Yeah, he wants me
to be his best man.

339

- Because you said you'd fire us...
