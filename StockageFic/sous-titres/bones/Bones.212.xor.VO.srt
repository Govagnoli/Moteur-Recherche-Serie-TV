1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,010
Where'd the fire start?

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,520
Not sure yet.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,330
It spread through the ducting,though.

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,380
Maybe you'd like something
a little bit more exciting,huh?

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,350
Like Attica.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,300
My neighbors are renovating their apartment.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,640
One of the workmen left his radio on.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,530
Hip-hop is not conducive to sleep.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,580
Whoa,are you allowed to
put that many men in one cell?

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,350
Cut the warden a little slack,okay,Bones?

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,490
There was a riot.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,420
The cell doors open automatically in a fire.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,410
The guards had to subdue the inmates

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,420
so the firefighters could do their jobs.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,410
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,660
You stay close.Okay?

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,640
A lot of these animals haven't seen
a real woman since Reagan was president.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,550
Body's in here.

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,620
You sure this is Howard Epps?

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,890
This was his cell.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,610
Why not keep him on death row?

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,040
We don't have one.

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,180
He was transferred to Bayview

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,890
so he could be closer to
he courthouse for his trial.

25
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,160
The victim is male.

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,200
Approximately 30 years of age.

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,250
He matches Epps general size and build.

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,500
Contortion indicates a painful death.

29
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,120
Well,after killing four teenage girls
that we know about-

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,780
it's just what the doctor ordered.

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,140
It seems as if someone threw accelerant on him,

32
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,320
lit him on fire.

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,130
Hey,look,any idea who would want him dead?

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,130
All the inmates hated him.

35
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,700
Once the fire started,it was chaos.

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
Could have been anyone.

37
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,420
Booth...

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,110
this is the wrist I broke.

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,620
- So? - So,this break is fresh.

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,560
So,Bones- they break in a fire,right?

41
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,020
Yes,but...

42
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,870
there's no sign of a prior break.

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,330
This man's wrist was slammed against
a hard edge within the last few hours.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,850
What are you saying?

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,460
This is not Howard Epps.

46
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,480
That's impossible.

47
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,300
Look,all your prisoners- are they accounted for?

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,340
They are if this is Epps.

49
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,980
What about the guards?

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,500
They've all reported in.

51
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,500
- Whoa... - What now "whoa"?

52
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,540
This dye from the tattoo survived the fire.

53
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,350
DC Fire Department.

54
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,630
He was a firefighter.

55
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,600
You're saying the fireman comes in to save Epps,

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,430
but Epps kills him,takes his uniform,

57
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,400
and sets him on fire.

58
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,570
And walks right out the front door.

59
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,770
Son of a bitch.

60
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,600
Lock this place down now.

61
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah,it's Booth.

62
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,030
Listen,I need you to close off a 30 mile radius
of the Bayview Federal Penitentiary.

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,050
Howard Epps escaped.

67
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,990
ks short,don't you think?

68
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,270
Is that important?

69
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,840
You were supposed to say no.

70
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,630
But you are short.

71
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,660
And the article describes you as robotic.

72
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,100
And wildly intelligent.

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,940
Did you really call me "The heart of the operation"?

74
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,460
Yeah. That was before you called me "short. "

75
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,510
Hey,Zack called you short.

76
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,360
I think you're just the right height.

77
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,610
Yeah?

78
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Short men have better leverage.

79
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm feeling uncomfortable.

80
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,070
Any answers?

81
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,980
Hope you enjoyed your 15 minutes of fame,people,

82
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,660
'cause we have a psycho on the loose

83
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,200
so it's back to work.

84
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,430
I photograph well.

85
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,660
Okay,so what have we got?

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,450
The accelerant was distilled alcohol.

87
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,770
Fractures are consistent with Dr. Brennan's theory.

88
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,890
The victim's wrist was broken to match Epps injury.

89
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,090
A blow to the head rendered him unconscious.

90
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,790
He was then set on fire.

91
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,990
If there was ever anyone who should be in Gitmo...

92
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,190
I agree.

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,520
But he's not,he's out.

94
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,740
And that means more victims unless we stop him first.

95
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,240
Which we will do,or they'll be another article
written about us that won't be so kind.

96
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,450
Where's Dr. Brennan?

97
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,750
She and Booth are talking to Epps's wife.

98
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,250
I.D. the remains.

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,010
I'm no longer involved in Howard's life.

100
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,170
That's hard to believe,being his wife and all.

101
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,970
Ex-wife.

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,360
The judge signed my divorce papers last month.

103
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,900
Why didn't it work out exactly?

104
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,300
Was it a lack of quality time

105
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,310
or all the women he bludgeoned to death?

106
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,320
I thought I could help Howard,but he used me.

107
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,680
I haven't had any contact with him in over six months.

108
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,580
Well,I'd like to place you in protective custody
until we find him.

109
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,990
That won't be necessary.

110
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,140
Mrs. Epps,the women in Howard's life
don't tend to live very long.

111
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,300
I appreciate your concern,Dr. Brennan,

112
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,350
but I've changed jobs,apartments.

113
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,590
We found you.

114
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,470
Howard could,too.

115
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,840
I have a new life... and a new boyfriend.

116
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,370
Raymond's a good man.

117
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,440
If he found out...

118
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,830
We all have secrets in our past,Mrs. Epps.

119
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,200
Admittedly not as bizarre as yours,

120
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,740
but you shouldn't risk your life
to tell your boyfriend the truth.

121
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,840
Howard's interest is in young blonde girls.

122
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,790
I'm not even his type.

123
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,480
If he contacts you...

124
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,140
I'll call.

125
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,300
Wait,you can't let her go. She's not safe.

126
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,390
I can't force her to take protection,all right?

127
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,380
I'll have the local police,you know,

128
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,140
drive by her house every couple hours,

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,410
make sure she's safe.

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,890
And you know what,you're not safe either.

131
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,830
But I'm not unhinged. I can take care of myself.

132
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,560
You and Epps- okay,it's personal.

133
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,360
You're everything that he hates.

134
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,260
What is that exactly?

135
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,780
Well,you know,you're a smart,strong,confident woman.

136
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,420
And you figured him out,you made him feel powerless.

137
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,730
So he's going to want to prove that you're weak and inferior.

138
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:06,210
So,you are not to go out on your own ever.

139
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,650
Hey,did the wife give you anything?

140
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,030
Chills.

141
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,860
I need you to double security here at the lab.

142
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,700
You think Epps is going to come after Brennan?

143
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,760
I can't rule anything out when it comes to Epps.

144
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,440
I'll take care of it.

145
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,800
Look,I don't want you to be alone either.

146
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,900
Are you inviting me over?

147
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,430
I'm just thinkinthat everyone should just stay here at the lab.

148
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,310
Leave it to a serial killer to spoil the mood.

149
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,900
Whatever security you think is enough...

150
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,490
You double it,Camille.

151
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,710
I'm glad you're on my side,Seeley.

152
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,980
The burn victim is Donald Kent,a decorated firefighter.

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,780
Epps would appreciate the irony.

154
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,740
Kent was still alive when he was set on fire.

155
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,950
How many victims does that make?

156
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,990
Seven... that we know of.

157
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,440
And they aren't just young blonde women anymore.

158
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,620
No,they aren't.

159
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,750
He's such a monster.

160
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,820
He's killed from behind bars and new victims keep turning up,

161
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,470
and now he's out.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,070
We will find him,Ange.

163
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,460
We're ready this time.

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,190
I'm not.

165
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,640
Look,I have some sick days coming.

166
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,350
And I was thinking that since Epps makes me sick,that...

167
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,540
We need you,Ange.

168
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,160
Hodgins certainly does.

169
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,240
That was low.

170
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,990
I know.

171
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,920
Did it work?

172
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,450
How do you deal with the fear?

173
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,930
I... have this.

174
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,930
Oh,my...

175
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,590
That... that think is huge.

176
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,110
Whoa,wow,that's like movie huge.

177
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,460
Where the hell did you get that?

178
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,960
- The mall.
- The mall?

179
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,430
Yeah,it's pretty big,right?

180
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,220
Bigger than the one you have.

181
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,190
Excuse me,it's not the size,that matters,
it's how you use it.

182
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,810
Well,I think size is pretty important.

183
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,560
The point is that you shouldn't have a gun in the first place.

184
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,810
If you do have one,bigger is always better.

185
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,940
You're not helping.

186
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,510
Right,yeah,this does seem like a private conversation.

187
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,020
Yeah,private.

188
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,130
Okay,you know,people see you with that,

189
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,690
the next thing you know everyone in this place
is going to start packing.

190
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,480
This is America- get used to it.

191
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,060
Brennan.

192
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,520
I'd forgotten how nice it was to breathe fresh air.

193
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,040
We will find you,Howard.

194
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,570
We'll see.

195
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,260
I can't tell you how nice it is
to be out of that stupid orange jumpsuit.

196
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,250
I mean,I have a IQ of 180,for God's sake,

197
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,790
and they had me dressed like a pumpkin.

198
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,670
You burned a man alive.

199
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,200
Means to an end.

200
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,820
Everything is a means to an end,Dr. Brennan.

201
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,150
I thought it was just women you were after.

202
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,800
I felt the need to grow as a human being.

203
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,270
What is it you want?

204
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,740
You must want something or you wouldn't be calling.

205
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,780
Yes.

206
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:38,100
I want you to know that everything
that happens from here on in is your fault.

207
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,750
What's going to happen,Howard?

208
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,070
I can't answer all of your questions.

209
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,190
Use your head,Dr. Brennan.

210
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,280
Use your head.

211
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,180
Okay,we got it.

212
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,140
He's in a pay phone at Water Street and 23rd.

213
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,820
Bus stop. Three different lines.
They run through here.

214
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,140
I want you to check every bus stop.

215
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,930
See if there are any witnesses- bring them to me.

216
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,940
Booth,Epps left us sething.

217
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,750
What is that?

218
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,880
It's bone.

219
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,450
Shaved down by a rough sandpaper.

220
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,030
Hodgins found mica grit.

221
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,040
I'll tell you this.

222
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,440
If Epps comes near Angela,I'll kill him.

223
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,180
What about the rest of us?

224
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,400
Everyone will be fine.

225
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,890
Cam increased security.

226
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,370
And you have the big gun.

227
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,970
Tough to keep that one a secret.

228
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,670
Beautiful woman with a weapon?

229
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,780
<i>Very Guns And Ammo summer issue.</i>

230
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,580
I'm gonna concentrate on my work now.

231
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,210
Osteon count places the victim's age as mid-30s.

232
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll run amelogenin and nuclear DNA tests
to get sex and race.

233
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,910
I got the chemical breakdown.

234
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,130
The powders in the bone are organic.

235
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,730
A mixture of cardamom,tamarind and kokam.

236
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,900
- Spices?
- Yeah.

237
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,090
Bone wasn't cooked.

238
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,670
Why would he add spices to it?

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Epps like puzzles.

240
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,520
The spices are a message.

241
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,470
Angela!

242
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,490
Oh,my god!

243
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,590
What happened?

244
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,250
A heart.

245
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,750
Definitely human. Adult.

246
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,190
DNA can give us sex.

247
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,700
He's killed two people today.

248
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,460
That's if this heart's from the same victim as the bone dust.

249
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,350
What is that?

250
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,210
<i>It's a D.C. Sentinel article about the lab.</i>

251
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,380
Every line is blacked out except for one.

252
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,480
"Dr. Hodgins called Angela 'The heart of the operation. '"

253
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,560
Son of a bitch.

254
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,690
You'll have to stay in here,Angela.

255
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,290
How did this even get in here?

256
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,830
I thought that there was security.

257
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,560
So did I.

258
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,130
I'll take care of it.

259
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,530
He's coming after me through my friends.

260
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,520
What?

261
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,550
He told me whatever happened would be my fault.

262
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,940
Then we'll make sure nothing else happens.

263
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,710
There are cut marks on both sides of the inferior vena cava
and connecting arteries.

264
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,000
The heart was cut out using shears or scissors.

265
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,950
Package was delivered by a bike messenger.

266
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,500
He said a man matching Howard Epps's description

267
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,380
approached him on L Street,paid cash.

268
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,900
He's just playing with us.

269
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,720
Not for long.

270
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,950
How's Angela? Angry.

271
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,170
She sisted on helping me,which worked out well.

272
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,080
She realized the present Epps gave us was a recipe.

273
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,620
- Wait,the heart?
- No,the ingredients in the vial.

274
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,770
After he ground up the bone,Epps mixed it with spices.

275
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,560
The cardamom,tamarind and kokam
which are all used in making curries.

276
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,590
Indian food.

277
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,570
Epps's wife. The last address we had for her was
in Little India over a curry restaurant.

278
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,860
You know,I could have the Bureau pull your license.

279
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,110
Yeah,I and could assign Zack as your forensic anthropologist.

280
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,040
Place hasn't been rented since she moved.

281
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,550
It's just not logical. Playing games with us?

282
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,710
It's just going to lead us right to him.

283
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,560
Wait.

284
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,060
If the lights are off,then why is the refrigerator working?

285
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,420
Just stand back.

286
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,900
?????????

287
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,300
?????just above the shoulders.

288
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,020
The jagged marks on the bone indicate

289
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,350
that Epps used some kind of saw to decapitate her.

290
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,650
No sign of blunt-force trauma to the skull,

291
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,010
Epps's usual M.O.

292
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,730
No clear cause of death.

293
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,190
Without the rest of her body,

294
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,810
we can't know for sure how she died.

295
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,740
I'm seeing some kind of white powder in her hair.

296
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,120
Hodgins can tell us what it is.

297
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,070
Why just leave her head?

298
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,460
To get us all involved.

299
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,440
I mean,the less we have to work with,
the more we're all drawn in.

300
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,040
Epps told me to use my head.

301
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,940
Everything he says is a clue.

302
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,060
Could it be inside the head?

303
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,450
It's too early to tell.

304
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,240
What do you mean,"Too early," okay?

305
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,040
All we do is just cut open the damn head and find out what's inside.

306
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,540
But there are protocols,Booth.

307
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,240
Yeah,and I'm sure Epps is really concerned about the protocols.

308
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,250
This is my autopsy.

309
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,750
We're gonna do it by the book.

310
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,420
That means surface exam,followed by X rays,
after which I will open the skull.

311
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,630
Sorry,I'm just a little anxious to
get the little gerbil back in his cage,that's all.

312
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,120
Okay,that's terrifically disturbing.

313
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,130
What?

314
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,630
Massive blood aspiration to the soft tissue of the neck.

315
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,140
Meaning?

316
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,410
Caroline Epps was alive when Howard cut her head off.

317
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,800
Now he's torturing his victims.

318
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,860
So let's torture him.

319
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,010
How?

320
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,590
Bring his mother in.

321
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,550
I thought Epps hated his mother.

322
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,130
His FBI profiler believes he was emotionally attached to her.

323
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,610
Prison log show that he wrote to her almost every day.

324
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,520
- That's sick.
- But helpful.

325
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:58,600
I mean,if he feels responsible,for his mother being in jail,

326
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,290
we could knock him off his game.

327
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,420
What's that smell?

328
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,760
It's mold. It grows in the fat creases
of morbidly obese people.

329
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,260
What is this about?

330
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,530
Did you bring me here to make fun of me?

331
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,310
I merely stated a fact,Mrs. Epps.

332
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,730
You need to lose weight.

333
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,630
Obesity also causes diabetes,heart damage,liver failure,

334
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,200
not to mention the wear it puts on your joints.

335
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,240
I have a glandular condition.

336
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,340
A little compassion and understanding,
that's what I really need.

337
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,740
Why am I here?

338
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,040
We found some drugs at your place.

339
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,300
Those are my pills. My doctor gave them to me.

340
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,580
I need my medicine.

341
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,790
Well,you know,they're not properly labeled.

342
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,870
This could take us a few days
to sort this out with your doctor.

343
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,940
We're looking for Howard,Mrs. Epps.

344
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,350
Howard's in jail.

345
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,730
I haven't seen him or talked to him in years.

346
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,340
Howard escaped yesterday.

347
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,460
Oh,dear Lord.

348
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,060
I tried to raise a good son.

349
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,630
Tried to keep him pure like the Good Book says.

350
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,060
I don't know what happened.

351
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,510
He was such a sweet child.

352
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,100
Howard- he wrote to you all the time.

353
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,600
He wants me to understand.

354
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,180
Wants me to forgive him.

355
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,210
Says he's still my little boy.

356
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,160
But I don't answer.

357
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,280
Your son murdered his wife yesterday; beheaded her.

358
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,300
And you want to blame me?

359
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,020
You made your son bathe in ammonia.

360
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,850
The women he would go out with,they were loose.

361
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,110
Not the right kind for a God-fearing son.

362
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,960
I wanted him to wash their scent off.

363
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,140
Is there anything else that you can tell us

364
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,470
that might help us find your son before he kills again?

365
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,320
It's not my fault what he did.

366
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,870
Yeah,okay.

367
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,840
Uh,that's all for now.

368
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,520
We'll have an agent escort you back to your cell.

369
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,620
Um,of course,you have the right to an attorney.

370
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,420
I should have been harder on him.

371
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,210
Beat him more regular.

372
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,930
But I'm a nice person. Too nice. What's my problem?

373
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,670
Too nice.

374
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,910
Marianne Epps is clearly a bad mother.

375
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,830
You think?

376
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,360
But a lot of people have bad mothers

377
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,900
and they don't grow up to be serial killers,

378
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,320
which is why I don't put much stock in psychology.

379
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
Listen,Bones,I don't care how you explain it,all right?

380
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,820
The guy,he's an animal. He's got no conscience.

381
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,810
I don't know how one draws moral distinctions between killers.

382
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,100
Listen,Bones,there are crimes of passion,all right?

383
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,710
Crimes committed out of desperation,

384
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,440
which are usually followed by remorse,
or an acknowledgment of human failing.

385
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,200
The key word here is "human. "

386
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,890
The reasons for killing someone are unimportant.

387
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,660
The life that's taken is all that matters.

388
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,230
You can't blame yourself here.

389
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,450
It's me he's after.

390
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,910
Angela and everyone else,they shouldn't be involved.

391
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,150
It's not your fault,all right?

392
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,840
It's all Epps,which is
why I'm going to take this little bastard down.

393
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,400
Booth.

394
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,800
Booth,we're being followed.

395
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,170
Mm-hmm,that's right.

396
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,790
Two agents all the time,at a very discreet distance.

397
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,300
See,I don't care how big your gun is,all right?

398
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,460
Booth.

399
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,340
Something was inserted in Caroline's ear.

400
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,400
Epps made an incision in Caroline's left ear canal,

401
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,100
inserted a token for a kid's ride from a place
called Hillside Park.

402
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,590
Oh,...

403
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,480
My son plays there every day after school.

404
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,190
Parker comes here every day at 4:00 with his nanny.

405
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,470
Rose,Rose,Rose,where's Parker?

406
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,040
On the merry-go-round. He was just there.

407
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,260
Parker!

408
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,690
Parker! Parker!Parker!

409
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,900
Parker?

410
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,100
Parker?!

411
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,770
Parker?

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,080
Parker!

413
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,670
Parker?

414
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,980
Parker!

415
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,260
Booth!

416
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,320
Parker? Parker! Parker!

417
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,170
Daddy!

418
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,020
Hey,come here.

419
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,900
Oh,my... All right.

420
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,690
Look,a man bought me ice cream.

421
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,500
That was my favorite!

422
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll buy you another one,okay? Just listen to me.

423
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,370
What did this man look like?

424
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,660
A man. Said he was your friend.

425
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,130
What did he say to you?

426
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,500
Did he say anything else to you,Parker?

427
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,650
To use my napkin.

428
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,400
Booth.

429
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,420
My name is Parker,Ask me how I can solve this case

430
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,670
All right,what else did he tell you?

431
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,880
Nothing. He was just nice.

432
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,810
Okay,just listen to me,Parker,all right?

433
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,470
This man is trying to hurt Daddy's friends,okay?

434
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,980
So I need you to think. What else did he say to you?

435
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,070
I didn't do anything wrong.

436
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,580
He said he was your friend.

437
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,230
You never talk to strangers,okay?

438
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,220
You never!

439
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,330
I'm sorry,buddy.

440
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,680
It's okay,all right? I'm sorry.

441
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,160
What's going on,Mr. Booth?

442
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,350
It's just an investigation going on,okay,Rose?

443
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,830
I have these agents take you and Parker home
and keep you safe,all right?

444
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,730
It's okay.

446
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,770
No.

447
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,590
I didn't say anything.

448
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,850
You've been in here every ten minutes since they left.

449
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,550
I will let you know when I'm finished.

450
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,130
I could take the head and X-ray it.

451
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,200
Then you could finish...

452
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,310
No. We have these protocols for a reason.

453
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,140
Saroyan.

454
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,340
Have you opened the head yet?

455
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,970
I just finished telling Zack...

456
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,390
Listen,Epps went after my kid,Cam.

457
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,330
Parker.

458
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,210
You know there's something there- he told us.

459
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,720
It's something we need.

460
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,220
He wants us to find it.

461
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,180
You're upset.

462
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,490
Of course I'm upset!

463
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,150
Listen,I know there are protocols,

464
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,280
but he could've killed my son.

465
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,520
Get me the number two saw.

466
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,040
I found some bruising to the back of her head.

467
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,690
I'm gonna cut below it so I don't disturb the area.

468
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,240
I hate this part.

469
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,940
Me,too.

470
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,670
Dr. Saroyan!

471
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,630
Protocol!

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,160
???

473
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,950
Unknown hazardous material.

474
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,220
We need an emergency medical team
at the autopsy lab,A.S.A.P.

475
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,850
- What happened?
- I don't know,I don't know

476
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,290
Dr. Saroyan!

477
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,650
Her heart rate is erratic.

478
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
There's clotting in the kidneys.

479
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,300
- How bad is that?
- Bad enough?

480
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,700
But what worries us more is the lung damage.

481
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,770
The toxin's caused edema.

482
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,640
What does that mean?
I don't know what that means.

483
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,660
Fluid build-up.

484
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,510
Essentially,she's drowning.

485
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,120
I'm sorry.

486
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,310
If she has family nearby,you'll want to send for them.

487
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,120
Yeah,C-Cam's got a lot of family.

488
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,650
How much time does she have?

489
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,280
Send for her family.

490
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,270
Zack saw everything.

491
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
- How close was he?
- A few feet.

492
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,780
And he's fine,so it's probably not a toxic gas.

493
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,090
Zack says it was some kind of powder,

494
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,200
which means there could be traces on her clothing.

495
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,120
Just work fast,okay,Hodgins?

496
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,950
Just work fast.

497
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,860
Considering the relationship between you and Cam,I...

498
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,510
I'd like to say the right thing,Booth.

499
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,520
I don't know what it is.

500
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,930
Usually,I...I'd ask you or Angela.

501
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,760
You just said it.

502
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,770
Thanks.

503
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,170
Can't find any traces of powder on Cam's clothing.

504
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,170
- Did you search electrostatically?
- Yes.

505
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,510
- You're sure it was a powder?
- Yes.

506
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,300
- It had to be a gas.
- If it were a gas,I'd be in the hospital with Cam.

507
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,250
No particles on her clothing. Zack,it had to be a gas.

508
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,430
It wasn't. Are we having an argument?

509
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,650
- Of course.
- Why?

510
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,790
Because Cam's dying,and I should be with Angela,
and because there are no particles.

511
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,680
- On the clothing.
- That's right.

512
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,900
What about in the glass parts still left in the head?

513
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,970
I'm not angry at you anymore.

514
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,690
Hey.

515
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,300
Welcome back.

516
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,890
Why can't I breathe?

517
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,740
Your saw,it,um...hit some kind of poison,

518
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,860
but,uh...you're gonna be all right.

519
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,980
- Zack?
- Oh,he's fine.

520
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,350
'Kay,everyone... everyone's good.

521
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,690
I'm-I'm...I'm so sorry,you know,

522
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,970
that I put so much pressure on you to hurry.

523
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,380
I didn't,uh...

524
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,620
Mm-mm.Not your fault.

525
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,340
Epps... did this to me.

526
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,590
Hey.Your family's coming.

527
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,460
Oh,...

528
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,950
And I thought poison...was my biggest problem.

529
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,400
You look exhausted.

530
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,490
What have you got?

531
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,600
Ok,This is an X ray of Caroline's head.

532
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,690
These are shards of glass. Very fragile.

533
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,810
What was it?

534
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,520
I think it was a glass capsule...
filled with a poisonous powder.

535
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,130
Epps inserted it after she was dead Probably up the nose.

536
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,650
And when the saw blade hit it,it exploded.

537
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,920
Hodgins has some of the shards now.

538
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,870
He'll figure out what the poison is.

539
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,080
If I were Epps,I would've made it something
that changes composition after prolonged exposure to air.

540
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,670
Let's hope he's not as smart as you.

541
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,390
I'm gonna go sit with Cam for a while.

542
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,430
Brennan.

543
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,680
So,who'd I get?

544
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,970
Epps.

545
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,610
If you're talking about the bulb in Caroline's head...

546
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,120
we removed it.

547
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,220
How'd you get it in there without breaking it?

548
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,560
I saw the emergency vehicles.

549
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,410
I know I got someone.

550
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,460
They may not be dead yet,but they will be soon.

551
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,580
Sorry. You missed this time.

552
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,030
If you don't admit to who it was,

553
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,430
then I can't give you the hint to save their life.

554
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,760
Okay,then,it was nice talking to you.

555
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,580
Wait.Wait.

556
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,630
Yes,Dr. Brennan?

557
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,640
Dr. Saroyan.

558
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,360
She tried to remove the bulb with forceps.

559
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,370
It was too fragile.

560
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,990
It snapped.

561
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,040
Yes,that's exactly what happened.

562
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,080
Now will you tell me the poison?

563
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,300
The body knows what the head can't say.

564
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,780
roline's body or your mother's body?

565
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,120
My mother?

566
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,210
Yes,we have her in custody- didn't you know?

567
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,120
On what charges?

568
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,840
What poison,Howard?

569
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,160
You had no right.
My mother's not part of this.

570
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,240
You tell me about the poison,
and I will tell you about your mother.

571
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,790
You don't run the game.

572
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,890
I run the game.

573
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,820
You're gonna be sorry.

574
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,870
Cell phone,downtown. There's a team on its way.

575
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,060
He's already gone.

576
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,440
Hey. Hodgins find the poison?

577
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,090
Not yet.

578
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,640
How's Cam?

579
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,150
She's worse.

580
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,980
She can't breathe on her own.

581
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,050
Uh... Bones,
I really need you to find out what she inhaled.

582
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,700
- Epps called and... left me a clue.
- What is it?

583
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,180
He said "The body knows what the head can't say. "

584
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,080
- Caroline's body.
- I think so. Yes.

585
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,890
You were right,he was pretty upset
when he found out that we had his mother.

586
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,090
You told him?

587
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,170
That's good.

588
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,390
Make the bastard sweat.

589
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,560
He said we'd be sorry.

590
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,230
I'll call you as soon as we have something to go on.

591
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,520
Bones... I'm c-coming with you,all right?

592
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,640
Hold on,all right? This is gonna take all of us.

593
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,610
If I put too small a sample into the photoelectric aerosol sensor,

594
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,000
then I'll both lose the sample and not get an accurate response.

595
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,110
I estimate that there's about one-ten-thousandth
of a gram on this shard.

596
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,520
We're not getting enough.

597
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,680
Not to mention the particles themselves are extremely small,
about 1.6 micrometers in diameter.

598
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,310
Hey,what's the poison?

599
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,200
I don't know yet.

600
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,660
Well,what-what do you know?

601
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,940
It's none of the common poisons: arsenic,cyanide,mercuric chloride.

602
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,310
Let's start bytelling the hospital  what it isn't,then,okay?

603
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,740
What was in Caroline Epps's hair?

604
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,710
The white powder? Just common plaster dust.

605
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,650
There was also a very small amount of sodium hydrosulphide in her ear.

606
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,160
Great. Put those two things together,what do we have?

607
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,860
Dry-walling and...

608
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,420
Uh... uh,leather goods?

609
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,780
Great. I'll look through the evidence

610
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,500
and see if I can find those two things.

611
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,570
Booth. What?

612
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,100
I'm sorry,man.

613
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,690
Without more material,it's just...

614
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,630
No,it's... you're both doing a great job.

615
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,930
Now it's up to me to find Caroline Epps's body.

616
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,460
Booth. What?

617
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,610
We've endowed Epps with intelligence he does not have.

618
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,330
His clues are unsophisticated word games.

619
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah?

620
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,050
Uh,"My name is Parker. Ask me how I can solve this case. "

621
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,680
I already asked Parker- he doesn't know anything.

622
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,860
It doesn't have to be your son.

623
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,310
It can be something else named Parker.

624
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,560
Something to do with leather goods or drywall.

625
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,850
Do a Boolean search.

626
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,300
Okay,right,you don't know what that is.

627
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,690
Boolean is... I won't explain; I'll just do it.

628
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,210
I am walking out of here.

629
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,030
You try and stop me again,I will shoot both of you.

630
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,770
Mmm...

631
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,900
What?

632
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,170
I really need him to come back.

633
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,800
Booth!

634
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,370
Whatever you got better be worth dying for.

635
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,300
Uh... There's a Parker & Parker Leather Goods owned by the Parker brothers

636
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,020
on Parker Street in the town of Parker just outside of Arlington.

637
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,380
That's a lot of Parkers.

638
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,810
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.

639
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,130
Grab your boss and let's get going.

640
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,070
Come on.

641
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,360
Clear!

642
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,600
Okay. Uh,uh,uh.

643
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,970
How do we even know that's Caroline's body there?

644
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
It it isn't,it'll still be a clue.

645
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,900
Okay,let me do this,all right?

646
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,620
Jam all the frequencies.

647
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,710
If he's got a remote detonator,it ain't gonna work now.

648
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,650
No sign of trip wires.

649
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,960
There it is on her stomach,the poison just like Epps said.

650
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,270
- I'll just...
- No,Zack! No. Don't hesitate.

651
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,660
Put your palm on the stomach and press down.

652
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,790
What?

653
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,310
That was a pressure trigger.

654
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,860
The body is booby-trapped. Everybody out!

655
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,210
Roger that. Egress. Let's go.

656
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,850
What do I do?

657
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,810
Don't be scared.

658
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,780
I'm not scared. I- I just need to know what to do

659
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,040
Out.I want to help him. Out. Now!

660
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,270
Zack,uh...

661
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,420
This,uh...

662
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,460
This is gonna hurt.

663
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,260
You or me?

664
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,110
Mostly you. Okay,on three,

665
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,300
I want you to jump back as high as you can.

666
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,540
I'm not a good jumper.

667
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,590
Be a good counter.

668
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,000
I am a good counter.

669
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,560
Ready? On three.

670
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,370
One... One...

671
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,760
Two... Two...

672
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,650
Three...

673
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,740
The explosion occurred as FBI agents searched the shop
for escaped serial killer Howard Epps.

674
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,370
At least one pson was killed in the blast.

675
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:21,710
Dr. Zack Addy,a forensic anthropologist
who was working with the FBI,died at the scene.

676
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,690
Special Agent Seeley Booth remains in critical condition.

677
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,410
Okay,that's creepy.

678
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,680
Zack dead and me in critical condition,right?

679
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,480
Why? It's not true.

680
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,160
Let's just hope Epps buys it.

681
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,150
You going to be all right?

682
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,840
My doctor said most of my injuries
didn't come from the explosion.

683
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,050
but from being slammed into the floor.

684
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,480
Apparently you're extremely strong.

685
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,360
Did you have to be ||so rough on him?

686
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,090
It was a bomb. I was being,you know,heroic.

687
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,280
I was heroic,too.

688
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,640
Yes,you were.

689
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,060
Somebody saved somebody,that's all I'm saying.

690
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,500
I got the poison.

691
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,690
Which is good,because Caroline's body was blown to pieces.

692
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,400
That was good thinking,you know,you keeping your wits.

693
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,530
But what I did was...

694
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,890
I guess if you have to explain to yourself why you're a hero,
I guess you're not really a hero.

695
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,960
What the hell are you?

696
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,300
You're not a bacterial protein or a non-opioid analgesiac.

697
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,860
You're not a neurotoxin or a heavy metal.

698
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,210
You act like chloromethane,

699
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,830
but Zack said that there was no sweet smell
when the powder was released.

700
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,640
Are you talking to the evidence?

701
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,430
Just working through this as systematically as possible.

702
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,020
You know,when this whole thing is over,

703
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,900
I am moving to a doorman building,

704
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,200
I'm getting an unlisted number

705
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,090
and I am hiring a full-time bodyguard named Knuckles.

706
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,270
Don't get paranoid.

707
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,090
That's funny,coming from a conspiracy theorist.

708
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,190
Of course,Methyl bromide.

709
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,270
I'll call the hospital.

710
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,640
Methyl bromide mixed with plaster dust.
That's what made it so hard to isolate.

711
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,550
Well,what's the treatment?

712
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,240
Racemic epinephrine. I called the hospital.
They're starting an IV.

713
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,420
Shouldn't you be there for that?

714
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,490
Priorities in life,man.

715
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,990
One,be there when someone you love comes back
from the brink of death.

716
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,640
Two,catch the serial killer.

717
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,360
Everything after that is basically unimportant.

718
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,730
I'm gonna go see Cam at the hospital

719
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,910
and you're gonna go home and get some sleep.

720
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,380
Why can't I go home?

721
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,050
Didn't you just hear what they said on the news?
You're dead.

722
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
What about Epps?

723
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,600
I got an entire surveillance team
outside your house watching you.

724
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,580
Why does everyone question me?

725
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm the hero.

726
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,330
Why is it taking so long?

727
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,990
It's not.She's responding.

728
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,840
- Camille?
- Seeley.

729
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:48,580
- Don't call me Seeley.
- Don't call me Camille.

730
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,880
How are you feeling,babe?

731
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:58,100
Like I got poisoned
by a disembodied head full of plaster dust.

732
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,430
Plaster dust.

733
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,510
Everything is secure.

734
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,180
Agent Holtz will stay in the hallway,

735
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,230
and there'll be another agent in the lobby.

736
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,040
Thank you.

737
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,040
- Good night.
- Good night.

738
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,900
Check the apartment next door.

739
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,930
Dead end.

740
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,760
You won't let me shoot him,will you?

741
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,610
You knew he was gonna be here,didn't you?

742
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,210
It's the only scenario that made sense.

743
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,100
Oh. Were you heading for the balcony,Howie?

744
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,930
Hope you can fly 'cause that's about
a 50-foot drop,right?

745
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,080
Yeah.

746
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,750
How did you know?

747
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,330
Plaster dust in the poison.

748
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,820
Renovations to the apartment next door.

749
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,570
You're not all that smart,it turns out.

750
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,960
One minute. All I want is one minute alone with you.

751
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,940
Fine with me.

752
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,750
Don't provoke the lunatic,all right?

753
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,280
You got nowhere to go.

754
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,200
I'm not going back to jail.

755
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,040
You see,that's really not your decision,Howie.

756
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,950
Put your hands up.

757
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,330
Drop the crowbar.

758
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,490
I'm in the line of fire,Bones.

759
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,670
You're not getting away,Howard.

760
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,070
Look who the killer is now,Agent Booth.

761
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,190
Can I have a little help here,Bones?

762
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,090
I got nothing but dead weight here. Help me.

763
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,890
Sorry,I can't reach.

764
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,030
Grab the railing.

765
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,180
You're gonna drop me anyway.

766
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,100
Just get it over with.

767
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,090
You son of a bitch.

768
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,730
Are you saying you don't want me dead?

769
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,610
Yeah,I'm not you.

770
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,170
Oh,really?

771
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,950
You're not thinking of the world with me still in it?

772
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,130
Going after Dr. Brennan.

773
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,850
Your son.

774
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,000
Unit on the ground saw what happened.

775
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,390
So did the sniper across the street.

776
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,860
You tried to save him.

777
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,370
Yeah.

778
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,780
No one could have helped him.

779
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,610
Yeah.

780
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,290
You can take off now,Booth.

781
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,950
The department might want to assign you a shrink,
on-the-job death like that.

782
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,940
You didn't have your full strength.

783
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,140
Your wrist was hurt from pulling Zack
away from the explosion.

784
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,160
My wrist wasn't hurt,Bones.

785
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,760
I wish you'd let me shoot him.

786
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,730
No,you don't.

787
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,410
Oh,Parker,I'll put you...

788
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,150
No,Daddy,I don't want to get on.

789
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,050
Up. Up. There you go.

790
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,640
Hi. How'd you know I was here?

791
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,590
Saturday morning.

792
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,800
How's Parker?

793
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,500
Yeah,I'm afraid I freaked him out the other day.

794
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,970
He's really scared of this place.

795
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,440
Now I... I gotta put that right.

796
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,530
That's you all over.

797
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,890
Putting things right.

798
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,550
Cam gets released from the hospital today?

799
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,300
Yeah.

800
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,970
What?

801
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,610
You know,what happened to Cam happened because...

802
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,610
we had a personal relationship.

803
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,980
"Had"?

804
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,950
Yeah. People who work in high-risk situations,

805
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,280
they can't be involved...romantically

806
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:18,250
because it...leads to... things like what happened.

807
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,170
High-risk situations.

808
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,530
Every single day,it's with us.

809
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,520
There's this line,and we can't cross it.
You know what I'm saying?

810
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,610
Yes.I understand.

811
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,990
He seems okay now.

812
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:46,880
Yeah. You know,it's important..to make things right.

813
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,700
I just don't know how. I don't know how.
