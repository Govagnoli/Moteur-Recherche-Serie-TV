1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,100
BOOTH:
Look,Bones,all I'm saying
is that Caroline went to a lot

2
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,960
of trouble to get you private
visitation with your father,

3
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,430
and now you
don't want it.

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,660
The federal detention facility
already has visiting areas.

5
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,660
Yeah,behind
two-inch glass.

6
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,200
I mean,now you'll be able
to give your old man,
you know,a hug!

7
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,600
I didn't ask for
special treatment,Booth.

8
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,800
That's because
you don't have to,
because you <i>are</i> special!

9
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,000
And you are
gonna tell me...

10
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,500
Whoa,what happened

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,600
to whatever the hell is melted
to that steering wheel

12
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,130
and... everything else?

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
It's female,

14
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,530
mid-40s to late 50s.

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,700
Pelvis indicates
she's given birth.

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,900
Hey,Bones,look at
that-- married,right?

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,800
Wedding ring--
it's a possibility.

18
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,130
Don't just focus
on the ground.

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
(siren wails nearby)

20
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,600
Why do you care

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,530
about my relationship
with my father,Booth?

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,700
You were only too
happy to arrest him

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
and put him in prison.

24
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,430
All right,look,
Bones,you know,

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,060
it's not about
being happy,okay?

26
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,760
It's about doing my job.

27
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,300
Do we know if it was a bomb
that caused the explosion?

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,130
Well,let's see,
the roof is peeled back,

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,300
and the doors and...
I was asking him.

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,130
We found explosive residue

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,800
all over the van and metal
fragments in the bushes.

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,430
What is that,
a pipe bomb?
I can't really be sure

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,860
until the explosive unit
gets the van back to the lab.

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,430
No,they can't have the van.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,600
There are remains seared
all over the inside

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,800
of the vehicle,
and they can't be compromised.

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,160
I have to call and get...

38
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,030
This van will be brought
to the Jeffersonian.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Your bomb techs
can look at it there.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,300
I'll... make the call?

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,300
That's all right,
you go make that call.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,500
Bones,come on,you were
a little harsh there.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,700
Maybe you want
to talk it out.
Look,Booth.

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,400
BOOTH:
It's a locket.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,530
Aw,it's...

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,860
probably her daughter.

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,560
Who would want
to blow up a soccer mom?

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,560
Hey,you have a skull
for a facial reconstruction?

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,900
Help yourself.

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh,great.

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,600
Is this all I have to work with?

52
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,230
I've always hated puzzles.

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,730
Hodgins,before we take
the hands from the wheel,

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,630
you might want
to check the fingernails

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,500
for particulates.
You know I do.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,260
Oh,my God.

57
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,600
Shouldn't you wait
for the bomb tech

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,600
before you gather
the explosive residue?

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,330
I'm just getting enough
to verify his results.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Remember,he's
a government bureaucrat.

61
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,330
Hey,<i>you're</i>
a government bureaucrat,babe.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,930
I am a passionate,

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,730
dedicated scientist
who will not be cowed

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,260
by authoritarian pressure.

65
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,030
Stay out of the van until
the bomb tech comes,Hodgins.

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,430
But...
Out.

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,200
(sighs)
Fine. I have to check
the fingernails anyway.

68
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,660
How close are we to
ID'ing the victim?

69
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,230
Well,this is

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,500
the skull.

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm good,but...
I'm not that good.

72
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,200
BRENNAN:
Perhaps you could use these.

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,700
There's a portion of tongue,

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,230
hair and...

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,530
brain matter.

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,930
Okay. If anybody
needs me,

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,430
I'm gonna go throw up,
then do some paperwork.

78
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,100
Okay,this is
Special Agent Frost

79
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,330
from the bomb unit.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,530
Booth pulled me out
of an important lunch.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,830
It took me months

82
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,730
to set up that meeting.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,700
It better be good,Booth.

84
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,030
She'll be working
with you,Hodgins.

85
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,130
Yes,please.

86
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,830
What? No. Um,hm?

87
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,830
Hodgins.

88
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,330
Doc-Doctor.

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,030
We're... okay?
(Frost laughs)

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,230
I beg your pardon?

91
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,360
It's...
He's Dr. Jack Hodgins.

92
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,860
Angela...

93
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,000
Montenegro.

94
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,960
I do facial reconstructions.

95
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,830
And him.
Mm.

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,060
Pleasure to meet you.

97
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm gonna need you
to recover all the
metallic particulates,

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,100
then I'm gonna need
a chemical tray

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,900
with aqueous
buffer solution.
Aqueous buffer solution.

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,500
Yeah,I-I know.

101
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,260
You want to perform
capillary electrophoresis?

102
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,360
You can do that?
Oh,yeah.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,960
And it will save time,

104
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,100
so Angela

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,560
Mm.
and I can have
dinner alone.

106
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,030
BOOTH:
 <i>The license plate</i>
 <i>was destroyed,</i>

107
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,330
<i>but we traced the VIN number</i>

108
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,860
on the van-- it was,uh,
registered to Jeremy Nash

109
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,060
in Culpepper,Virginia.

110
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,000
BRENNAN:
He looks familiar.

111
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,160
with a lot of stuff:
clothes,personal items.

112
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,030
BRENNAN:
Photo album.

113
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,730
Most of the pictures
were burned,

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,460
but the man in this photo

115
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,360
could be Nash.

116
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,830
She packed herself up,
keepsakes and all,

117
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,660
and took off in a van?

118
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,700
Looks like Mrs. Nash
was leaving Mr. Nash.

119
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,460
Oh,God,I hate domestic cases.

120
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,200
All right,so let's
go talk to the husband.

121
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,930
I can't.
I'm seeing my father.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,630
Now?
You and Caroline

123
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,630
went to a lot of trouble
setting this up.

124
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,300
d hate
to appear ungrateful.

125
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,760
But...

126
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll go talk to,um...

127
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,530
the husband by myself.

128
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,330
(door opening)
GUARD:
All right,Max,there you go.

129
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,130
Ooh,gee.

130
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,360
Real chairs.

131
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,430
It's nice to have
an important daughter.

132
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,030
This is Booth,
not me.

133
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,600
Well,you thank him
for me.

134
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,300
I always liked Booth.

135
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,700
Nicest guy that
ever arrested me.

136
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
Touching.

137
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,200
Well,you must like this--
me in here.

138
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,360
I finally have
to follow the rules.

139
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,260
hat makes me

140
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,430
less than you,because I think
people should follow the rules?

141
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,460
You're upset.

142
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,630
Yeah,of course I'm upset.

143
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,830
My father's a criminal.

144
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,460
No,outlaw.
There's a difference.

145
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,260
Subtle distinctions like that
are lost on me,

146
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,260
and,I imagine,your victims.

147
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,100
I know you want
some sort of a...

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,200
nice,neat story
that puts my life

149
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,630
into perspective for you,
but it doesn't work that way.

150
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,630
You could try.

151
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,400
Don't I deserve that?

152
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,100
I guess I always had
a problem with authority.

153
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,230
I just always saw myself
fighting the system,

154
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,960
kind Do you realize
how ridiculous you sound?

155
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,130
You're here
for murdering

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
the deputy director of the FBI.

157
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,800
He was a crook,he was a killer
and he was going to kill you.

158
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
And you walked out
on Russ and me

159
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,200
when I was 15.

160
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,760
But that was to protect you--
people were after us.

161
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,560
Because you were a criminal.

162
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,800
Outlaw.

163
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,430
See? I knew you weren't
going to understand.

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,760
You know what? You're right.

165
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,900
This is my fault for expecting
we could get past...

166
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,860
We can get
past this.

167
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,130
We can.

168
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,530
Th

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,800
how to punish me.

170
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,060
But now? Here?

171
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,800
Come on,we can make this
whatever we want.

172
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,700
Here are the cards
you asked for.

173
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,830
I gotta to go.

174
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,260
Wait. These are for us.
What?

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,130
Come on,you remember
that game we used to play

176
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,100
when you were five years old?

177
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,300
Blitz. Blitz..

178
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,130
Come on,let's play
a couple of hands.

179
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,330
You always beat me.

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,660
I remember that,too.

181
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,530
A good father would occasionally
allow his child to win.

182
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,060
I don't believe
in encouraging

183
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,300
all that,uh,
that self-esteem crap.

184
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,600
You want to win,earn it.

185
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,600
That's why you're so good
at what you do now,

186
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,460
because you know that nobody
is going to hand you anything.

187
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,730
So you were a great father?

188
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,130
Well,maybe just not
as bad as you think.

189
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,500
How 'bout this,one hand?
Come on.

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,400
Let me know if you
need anything else.

191
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,800
Well... socks.

192
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,300
Socks,you know? The,uh...
with arch supports.

193
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,500
I got to stand in that
chow line forever.

194
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,100
NASH:
A bomb?

195
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
BOOTH:
Yeah,I'm sorry.
Where you and your wife

196
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,260
having any problems?

197
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,900
What-What kind of problems?

198
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,260
Well,she was traveling with
a lot of personal stuff.

199
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,660
Photo albums,
and more clothes...

200
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,530
That stuff was for
Celia's new dorm room.

201
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,630
She was bringing her clothes,
things to help decorate...

202
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,600
You're FBI,for God sakes!

203
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,560
You have no idea
who did this?

204
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,760
What is this,your first case?
Just relax.

205
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,130
Okay?

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,530
I'm just here to help,
Mr. Nash,that's all.

207
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,860
How do I tell Celia?

208
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,030
How do I... tell my daughter?

209
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,430
ADDY:
Dermestes maculatus.

210
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,060
They clean the bones
by eating the charred flesh.

211
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,360
But they leave behind pieces
of shrapnel you might need.

212
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,630
Fascinating
and very weird.

213
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,230
They're mine.

214
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,260
Not a surprise.

215
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,100
HODGINS:
Hey. Hi.

216
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,230
How was your visit with your...

217
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,430
Not germane
to the investigation,Hodgins...

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,400
Zack,her left shoulder
was badly shattered,

219
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,700
but still shows
evidence of old trauma.

220
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,260
I need the cleaned bones
as soon as they're ready.

221
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,760
I also would like you
to look at the manubrium.

222
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,230
These shadows
look like pitting.
(sighs)

223
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,860
Have you determined
what kind of bomb was used?

224
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm still sifting through debris

225
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,400
and waiting for whatever goodies
these bugs leave behind.

226
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,930
And Dr. Hodgins
is just...

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,160
keeping you company?

228
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,560
What? No.

229
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,760
(chuckling):
I'm working.

230
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,400
Hard.

231
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm going to go
right now and work...

232
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,630
...hard some-someplace
else,so...

233
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,800
Hey.

234
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,360
What are you doing down here?

235
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,300
Uh,analyzing the iconography
for the Widow's Son case

236
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,860
until somebody needs me
for the bomb victim.

237
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,930
(clears throat)
Look,Angie,um,

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,260
Agent Frost
is-is a colleague,

239
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,960
and I am a professional.

240
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,530
Okay,so,

241
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
all the stammering and stuff,
I mean,that's not...

242
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,260
That isn't... I... It's...

243
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,260
You know,that's...
it's involuntary.

244
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,030
It's a... It's a bodily thing.

245
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,630
Yeah,that didn't
come out right.

246
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,760
Look,I'm not going to deny
that she is attractive.

247
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,830
Oh,totally hot.

248
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,330
What?

249
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
The bombshell
from the bomb squad.

250
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,030
She's totally hot.

251
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,500
Yeah,I know-- I mean...

252
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,200
Look,Jack,

253
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,530
I really don't care
what's going on in your pants.

254
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,660
As long as it staysr pants.

255
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,260
You know who's totally hot?

256
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,530
You.

257
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,800
You are
totally...

258
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,060
Okay,save it.

259
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,730
What have you got?

260
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,100
These were in
Amy Nash's bag.

261
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,660
Hmm. There's writing on them.

262
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,860
Yeah. Yeah,Cam needs you
to restore them.

263
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,760
I'll give it a try.

264
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,100
FROST (over P.A.):
Dr. Hodgins,I need your samples
for tI-I-I... I have to...

265
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,430
Uh...

266
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
So,I... love you,and...

267
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,330
Go.

268
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Okay.

269
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,030
BOOTH:
 <i>Nash is going</i>
 <i>to pick up his kid,</i>

270
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,200
tell her in person.

271
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
I mean,I don't know
how you do that.

272
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,560
Tell your kid that your
mother just got blown up?

273
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,630
I would think
a direct approach would be best.

274
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,200
What,as opposed to
what,sugarcoating it?

275
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,830
"Hey,what do you say
we go to the park?

276
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh,and by the way,your
mom just got blown up"?

277
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,130
How's your dad? You
haven't mentioned him.

278
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,360
Apparently,
his feet hurt.

279
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,030
You know,I mean
his spirits.

280
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,830
Well,he's a con man,
Booth.

281
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,160
He's always cheerful.

282
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,360
What? That's it?

283
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,960
Well,it's not like
I ever really had a father.

284
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,260
Max was absent
for years.

285
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,730
Well,here's what I know.

286
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,730
I know that Nash girl
would give anything

287
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,030
to spend one more day

288
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
with her mother.

289
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm sure you'd feel
the same way

290
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,330
if something happened
to your father.

291
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,100
and iron sulfate imbedded
in the manubrium and the flesh.

292
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
Both are found
in ballpoint ink.

293
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,630
Ah. It's a homemade tattoo.

294
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,230
Angela's working
on recreating the design.

295
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,230
The tatHmm. You mean like
to have bea prison tat?

296
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,060
No record
of her being in prison.

297
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,200
In Russia,
prisoners make tattoo ink

298
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,900
by burning the heel
of a shoe

299
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,260
and mixing it
with soot and urine.

300
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,430
This was a ballpoint pen rigged
with a sewing needle

301
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,060
pushed down
so deep

302
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,700
it penetrated her periosteum.

303
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Ah,you mean bone.

304
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,660
Doesn't seem like
a very soccer mom thing to do.

305
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,360
And... here we go.

306
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,400
SAROYAN:
An inverted
pentagram?

307
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,900
Devil worship.

308
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,530
Mom had a little thing
going on the side with Satan?

309
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,230
Oh,the burbs.

310
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,760
There is a design in the
center that I can't quite get.

311
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,860
HODGINS:
Wait. Wait,wait.

312
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,730
Is that a fist?

313
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,160
Fist?
BOOTH:
It's a fist.

314
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,400
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah.

315
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh,my God,it is a fist.

316
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,700
So she wasn't
Satan's old lady.

317
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,160
She was in the NLA.

318
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,460
The NLA?

319
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,630
National Liberation Army.

320
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,900
HODGINS:
Student radicals
in the '70s.

321
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
Thought they could
change the world.

322
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,800
Set off bombs in Army
recruiting offices,

323
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,130
torched cop cars.
BOOTH:
Yeah,real
visionaries.

324
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,160
They also shot
and killed a cop in '75.

325
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,330
HODGINS:
That was the burglary.

326
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
They broke
into the house

327
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,860
of a defense contractor
to rip off his safe.

328
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,700
Said it was
the people's money.

329
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,700
Here. June Harris and her
boyfriend,Neal Watkins,

330
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,860
were charged with the
murder but never found.

331
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,230
FBI's been looking
for them for 30 years.

332
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,500
And there they are.

333
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,360
And our victim?

334
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,860
It's the same woman.

335
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,860
BRENNAN:
So our soccer mom

336
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,400
was a killer.

337
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,460
WOMAN:
 <i>People,</i>

338
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,300
please tell me
that all your

339
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,930
fancy-ass equipment

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,860
is wrong.
(high-pitched beeping)

341
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,930
BRENNAN:
You are not supposed
to be up here.

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,460
Booth can shoot me later.

343
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,030
This cannot be June Harris.

344
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,000
BRENNAN:
But the dentals match.

345
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,000
Angela's reconstruction matches.

346
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,330
Amy Nash was June Harris.

347
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,030
<i>Porquoi moi?</i>

348
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
She couldn't have waited
four days

349
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,760
to turn herself
into a charcoal briquette?

350
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,660
I don't understand?

351
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,830
Caroline,why are you here?

352
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,700
June Harris was
turning herself in.

353
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,030
I arranged

354
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,600
with her attorney
for the surrender.

355
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,000
He was going to
deliver her on Thursday

356
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,800
after she said good-bye
to her family.

357
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,100
What was the deal?

358
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,600
Nine years.

359
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,700
Nine years
for killing a cop?

360
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,360
For turning herself in
and laying this

361
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,330
all to rest,
and since

362
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,560
she still maintained
her innocence,

363
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,600
this was going to be
a tough case to prosecute.

364
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,800
Sam Reilly was the lead
on this case for 30 years.

365
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,660
He was okay with nine years?

366
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,260
He doesn't know.

367
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,660
Part of the deal.

368
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,630
He wasn't to be consulted.

369
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,400
Well,you know what?
It's okay to tell him now.

370
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,160
I know Sam. He deserves
that much after 30 years.

371
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,330
Up to you.

372
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,860
You're the lead
now,<i>cherie.</i>

373
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,560
You should bring
in Huntzinger.

374
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,230
He was her attorney.

375
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,360
I love Huntzinger. might know
Real old-time leftie.h

376
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,060
Worked the Chicago
Seven trial.

377
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,130
Sued Nixon,
the CIA,Bush...

378
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,630
Okay,that's great--
let's get out of here

379
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,030
before Hodgins gives him
the pinko medal of honor.

380
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,430
Are you coming?
I can't.
Zack and I have

381
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,560
to pull the rest
of the shrapnel
for the bomb tech,

382
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,930
and then I have
to buy some socks for my dad.

383
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,130
Leave her be,<i>cherie.</i>

384
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,560
Absence makes the
heart grow fonder.

385
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,730
Socks?

386
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,230
MAN:
 <i>I have worked this case</i>

387
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,060
for 30 years,
and you don't think

388
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,400
I deserve
a phone call?

389
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,960
It was part
of the deal.

390
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,530
And you,Booth--
I trained you.

391
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
You think this is right,
to blow me off like this?

392
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,500
Well,I just got
thrown the case,Sam.

393
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,760
Don't go
wailing on me.

394
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,160
Damn lawyers.

395
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,160
Working a case for 30 years,

396
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,260
and you don't think
it deserves a damn phone call?

397
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,660
Hey,I'm talking
to you.

398
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,500
No,you're
yelling at me,

399
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,360
and my ears are
starting to ring.

400
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,230
Now,I'm sorry
that after 40 years

401
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,100
as an agent for the FBI
you're still a little girl,

402
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,230
but I'd like to find out
who killed June Harris,

403
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,530
so how about you stop
whining and help?

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Okay,<i>cherie?</i>

405
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,700
(door closes)

406
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,160
So,how have you been,Sam?

407
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,630
Shut up,Booth.

408
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,360
CAROLINE:
 <i>What's in the bag,Leonard?</i>

409
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,600
LEONARD:
Toothbrush,change
of underwear.

410
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,060
You guys always find some reason
to toss me in the can.

411
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,700
No belts,no laces.

412
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm ready.

413
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,700
Yeah,great. Well,we just want

414
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,200
to ask you a few questions
about June Harris' death.

415
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,800
I loved June Harris.

416
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,260
I loved what she stood for
and what she did with her life.

417
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,200
NExcept maybe Neal Watkins.e.

418
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,100
(laughing):
Yeah,you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

419
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,630
Blame another revolutionary.

420
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,760
Do you know where Watkins is?

421
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,100
CAROLINE:
They were partners in crime.

422
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,730
I don't think he would want
to risk June turning him in.

423
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,700
You ever hear
of attorney-client privilege?

424
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,630
Ever hear of obstruction
of justice?

425
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,800
You know,a woman is dead.

426
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,200
She's not a martyr
to her family,

427
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,360
just someone they loved.

428
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,960
If you can understand that.

429
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,800
LEONARD:
Cooperating with the system
perpetuates that system.

430
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,060
(sighs)
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

431
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,560
And if the system
is corrupt...
Blah,blah.

432
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,530
Blah,blah. So what's
next,Leonard?

433
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,100
You going to warn Watkins
that we're onto him?

434
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,630
You son of a...

435
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,830
Sam! Sam,Sam,Sam!

436
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,800
Watkins and Harris
are not heroes.
Hey,Sam.

437
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,900
You want to see
how they changed society?

438
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,100
Ask the kid
whose father they killed.

439
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,260
I know that kid.

440
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,000
He became a cop
just like his father.

441
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,400
Very touching.
You son...

442
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,630
Hey!
Get out of here!

443
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,130
Hey,hey,hey,hey!

444
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,060
You just hit a
federal agent,

445
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,430
Mr. Huntzinger.

446
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,760
Good thing
you brought your toothpaste.

447
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,930
What a surprise.

448
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,360
Lock me up to shut me up.

449
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,600
You should be talking

450
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,030
to that kid Valenti
instead of busting my ass.

451
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,430
The pig comes to me
the other day.

452
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,630
He wants to know where June is.

453
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,800
He said he got a letter

454
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,700
from her,as if
she'd write him

455
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,130
or I'd give her up.

456
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,900
A gift

457
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,360
from your noble
son of a cop.

458
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,760
Nice and soft.

459
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,200
I'll be the best dressed
on cell block eight. Thanks.

460
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,900
Sure.

461
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,160
Honey... I'm sorry.

462
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,200
For what?

463
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,330
For... For being such
a disappointment as a father.

464
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
You deserved better.

465
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,260
And I should have told you
sooner.

466
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,230
Well,that's it? Nothing?

467
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,630
Well,what were you expecting?

468
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,030
I agree with you.

469
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,630
I was expecting some tears,
or a hug or something.

470
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,960
I did apologize.

471
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,760
Well,you didn't mean it?

472
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,800
Of course I meant it.

473
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,260
Listen,
under any objective standard,

474
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,760
you have a horrible human being
for a father,

475
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,430
but I-I'm trying to move on.

476
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,160
I got caught
so that I could be with you.

477
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,030
I was hoping
you'd meet me halfway.

478
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm here,aren't I?

479
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,460
I...

480
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,200
got you shampoo.

481
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,030
Soap isn't good for your hair.

482
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,200
Oh,nice.

483
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,230
I... I don't want
to smell too good.

484
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,060
That can be a problem
around here.

485
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,700
There.

486
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,130
See? It's better.

487
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,560
Thanks.

488
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,260
Sure.

489
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,400
So,the prosecutor's going
to want to talk to you about me.

490
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,500
It wouldn't hurt if you,uh,

491
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,930
had some good things
to say about your old man.

492
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,030
Might even offer
to testify on my behalf.

493
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Is that why
you finally apologized?

494
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,260
What?

495
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,530
To use me?

496
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,730
Maybe you'd like me

497
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,430
to alter
evidence now.

498
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,700
That way I could join
the family business.

499
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
How can you think that?
I don't know,Max.

500
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,360
Maybe because I seem
to pass in and out of your life

501
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,530
when it's most convenient.

502
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,700
Maybe because you built

503
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,000
a whole career using
your considerable

504
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,230
charm to manipulate people.

505
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,860
Listen,I know
that it's hard

506
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,530
to trust me,I know,
and it's going to take some time

507
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,860
to fix things,but we can...

508
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,100
No! No!

509
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,330
Some things break,

510
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,260
and you can't put them
back together again.

511
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,700
That's just the way it is.

512
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,860
I was fine on my own,Max,
I was just fine.

513
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,560
FROST:
 <i>Electrophoresis</i>

514
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,360
and HPLC shows
potassium nitrate,

515
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,830
charcoal and sulfur

516
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,830
in a 75/15/ten ratio.

517
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,530
Graphite glazed,
Triple F Goex--

518
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,200
Sporting Grade.

519
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,660
You are a constant surprise.

520
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,700
Yes. Yes,I am.

521
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,830
I don't know many people
who get as excited as I do

522
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,500
about the chemical makeup
of explosives.

523
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,060
Well... I...

524
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,530
Complex molecular
structures.

525
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,360
Hey,how's it coming with
the-the... the detonator?

526
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,960
Seems to be a wristwatch.

527
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,930
Pretty
Microscopic glass chips,

528
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,760
probably the crystal.

529
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,430
I'll,uh,take a look
at the composition,

530
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,600
see if I can...

531
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,200
...locate a manufacturer.

532
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,360
Great.

533
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,160
So,where do you want me
to dump this junk?

534
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,600
You're tossing the air filter?

535
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,230
I tested it
for explosive residue.

536
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,560
There wasn't any.

537
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,130
It was blown free
from the car.

538
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,300
Yeah,even better.

539
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,560
Do you have
any ideare?

540
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Don't touch my things.

541
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,630
Watch her.

542
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,660
SAROYAN:
 <i>She was shot,too?</i>

543
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,200
The injury
presented itself

544
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,530
when I was
removing shrapnel

545
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,030
from the reconstructed
shoulder.

546
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,660
Well,you're sure it's not
from the bomb

547
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,130
or the fire?
No.

548
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,960
The fragments are lead
in a copper alloy coating.

549
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,160
Yep,that's a bullet.

550
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,560
I didn't find any
dried blood

551
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,430
on her clothes.
When was she shot?

552
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,300
Damage from the blast makes it
difficult to tell

553
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,500
when the shooting occurred.

554
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,130
I'm going to check
the remodeling

555
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,300
to estimate a time.

556
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
Hitting the top of the shoulder

557
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,630
wouldn't be a severe injury.

558
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,730
She could bandage herself
and still be ambulatory.

559
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,100
y walk
around instead;

560
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,000
I wouldn't fire you.
"Walk around"

561
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,830
implies aimlessness
which I'm not able to determine.

562
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,000
Can't believe I still ask
these things.

563
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,330
Send everything
you've got

564
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,830
s
at the FBI.

565
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,500
I'll inform Dr. Brennan.

566
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,600
REILLY:
 <i>Does not</i>

567
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,330
make any sense.

568
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
The van was rigged
to blow up,why
shoot her?

569
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,430
Well,until we see what
ballistics determines,

570
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,760
it's absurd to speculate.

571
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,630
Speculating is kind
of what we do here.

572
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,030
Listen,Danny Valenti
is a cop.

573
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,730
June Harris murdered his father.

574
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,900
He has a gun.

575
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,100
He's a good kid,Booth.

576
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,130
He didn't do it.

577
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
But that is meaningless
speculation.

578
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,030
Is she really necessary?

579
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,200
She's my partner.

580
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Mentors often feel
threatened

581
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,600
when their students
surpasses them.

582
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,160
Bones!
Well,it's true,Booth.

583
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,700
Change can be difficult
to accept

584
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,460
||
whether it comes in the form
of a revolutionary

585
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,130
or the simple
passage of time.

586
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,030
If she were a guy,
I'd deck her.

587
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,260
Right.
You know,that
distinction

588
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,500
is no longer
necessary,

589
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,300
but I wouldn't
recommend it.

590
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,160
Go,Sam. Thank you.

591
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,830
<i>Officer Valentcredit card reco</i>

592
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,660
that,uh,you bought gas
near June Harris' home.

593
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,360
I didn't know where she lived.

594
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,560
Just the town from the postmark
on the letter.

595
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,300
Her apology letter.

596
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,660
She should've had the nerve

597
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,300
to come talk to me
face to face.

598
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,630
So that's when you went
to Huntzinger.

599
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,460
Yeah.
And hit him.

600
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,130
He protects people like her.

601
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
That's his job.

602
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,760
I was five years old
when my father was killed.

603
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,660
My mother told me he
wasn't coming home again.

604
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,100
I didn't believe her.

605
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,700
I sat by that window,waiting,
every day for months.

606
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,360
You seem be pretty angry
about that.

607
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,930
Why didn't you tell me
what you were going to do?

608
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,830
You'd try and talk me out of it.

609
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,960
Did you know

610
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,200
how little time she was going
to serve?

611
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,360
Because that
might make

612
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,660
someone take matters
into their own hands.

613
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm a cop,man.

614
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,860
I didn't blow her up.

615
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,030
Booth...
Sam.

616
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,200
It's my investigation.

617
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,230
Officer Valenti,

618
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,230
I going to need
your gun.
Why?

619
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,230
Be

620
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,360
was shot before she died.

621
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,360
We'd like to make sure
the bullet didn't come

622
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,530
from your gun.

623
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
You going to let them do this
to me,Sam?

624
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,630
It's just a formality,Danny.

625
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,630
Then let's be formal.

626
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,900
Sam?
Ballistics

627
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,430
says the bullet was <i>not</i>
a match for Danny's gun.

628
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,030
Booth should have that
report first.

629
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,260
He's the lead.

630
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,130
You know,Booth,
she must be really good in bed,

631
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
because I can't see
any other reason

632
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,030
you keep her around here.

633
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
I am. Very good,but...

634
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,560
Booth has no direct knowledge
of that fact.

635
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,430
Okay,okay,let's all stay
focused here,people,okay?

636
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,930
Sam,you know what?
You should never...

637
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,560
But it was a match for the gun

638
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,560
that killed Danny's father
30 years ago.

639
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,000
Right,the same gun
that was registered

640
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,000
to Harris' old boyfriend,
Watkins.

641
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,730
But it was never found.

642
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,160
Everyone we interviewed
at the time

643
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,030
without talking to Watkins
mafirst.ov

644
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,800
I told you,we need to find him.

645
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,960
Yeah,okay,we
will,Sam.

646
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,560
You just got to give
me some room here.

647
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,560
Hey,hey,Booth.

648
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,730
Don't cut me out.

649
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,500
I've worked my whole career
for this.

650
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,830
As soon as I find something out,
I'll let you know,Sam.

651
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,460
Come on,Bones.

652
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,230
I remember seeing a picture
of him before.

653
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,230
I was going through some
old photographs,

654
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,230
cleaning out a closet.

655
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,700
Amy said it was an old
boyfriend.

656
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,360
Mmm.

657
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,300
They keep in contact?
No.

658
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,300
I mean,she would've told me.

659
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,300
Why?

660
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,100
You don't think
that...

661
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,900
Did he kill her?

662
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,360
How long did you know
about your wife's real identity?

663
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,030
Yeah,how long?
I only found out

664
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,960
a couple of weeks ago.

665
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,600
Why didn't
you tell me?

666
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,760
What,you didn't think

667
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,630
I deserved to know
about my own mother?

668
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,060
She didn't want me
to tell you.

669
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,430
She wanted to do it
herself.

670
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
Your wife never talked
about her past?

671
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,130
She used to say only the future
was important,

672
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,630
what we could do is change
the world.

673
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,300
They didn't agree on how.

674
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,660
Celia was a,a bit conservative

675
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,730
for Amy.

676
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,060
That never mattered.

677
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,330
She wasn't some

678
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,960
crazy radical
to me.

679
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,000
She was my mom.

680
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,330
You must have been
relieved she got
such a great deal.

681
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,960
What deal?

682
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,300
She didn't tell you?

683
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,460
She mentioned she was thinking

684
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,800
of talking to a federal
prosecutor,

685
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,230
but I talked her out of it.

686
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,960
Well,you do know,
that it's a felony

687
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,960
aiding and abetting
a,a fugitive.

688
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,960
You want to charge me? Fine.

689
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,960
But saving my family
doesn't feel like a crime.

690
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,500
Amy was a,a good mother,
a wonderful wife.

691
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,960
Do you mind if we
take a look around,

692
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,160
see if there's
any evidence

693
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,830
linking your wife
to Watkins?

694
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,830
The house is yours.

695
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,600
Come on,sweetheart.

696
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,400
The only reason we found any
lead or copper in the shoulder

697
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,060
was because of the blast.

698
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,400
There was advanced
bone remodeling.

699
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,700
So it's a very
old injury.
Yes.

700
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,260
Bone had completely grown
over it.

701
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,530
And since it was the same gun
that killed the policeman

702
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,760
and was never recovered,

703
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,830
I think we can assume
June Harris was shot

704
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,160
during the robbery.

705
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,630
I also found
microscopic lead particles

706
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,630
on the metacarpals
of the left hand

707
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,000
with the same degree of
remodeling at the shoulder.

708
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,800
Another gunshot?
No.

709
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,900
The same one.

710
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,700
The metals are an
identical match.

711
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,430
So,she was shot

712
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,430
in the hand and the shoulder
with the same bullet?

713
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,200
Is that even possible?

714
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,200
Angela could give us
a scenario that
could tell us.

715
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm creating a trajectory
analysis factoring in

716
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,030
both the hand
and the shoulder.

717
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,530
These are photos
from the crime scene

718
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,560
30 years ago.

719
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,330
That's the home of the
defense contractor,
Gerald Locklear,

720
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,600
where the NLA
burglary occurred.

721
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,260
June Harris and
Neal Watkins

722
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,530
were in Locklear's
office

723
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,030
at the back of
the house.

724
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,930
The original FBI photos
were crude,

725
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,260
based on fingerprints
and scuff marks on the floor.

726
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,800
It assumes

727
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,030
that June stood guard,
while Neal emptied the safe.

728
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,930
When Officer Valenti
walks in

729
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,030
surprising them,June fires,
killing Valenti.

730
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,360
But that wouldn't
her injuries.

731
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Unless June emptied

732
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,560
stood guard.
Exactly.

733
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,560
Neal aims at Officer Valenti,

734
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,530
but June steps between them,

735
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,360
raises her hands to stop Neal,

736
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,030
but he fires.

737
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,530
She was trying

738
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,500
to protect the policeman.

739
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,500
June Harris was telling
the truth.

740
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,600
She didn't kill Valenti.

741
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,330
Neal Watkins did.

742
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,360
HODGINS:
He also made
the bomb.

743
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,900
The watch used to make the timer

744
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,860
was coated with
a volatilized pigment

745
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,700
used by the Sawyer Time Company.

746
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,630
BRENNAN:
An American Flag
watch?

747
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,060
Nice ironic touch.
Watkins

748
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,500
always used the same type
of watch

749
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,830
when making bombs for the NLA.

750
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
It was his signature.

751
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,060
They found traces
of them

752
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,660
at an ROTC
headquarters,

753
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,700
the IRS office...
June told him

754
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,060
shHe wasn't going to let that
thappen,so he made a new bomb

755
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,200
using an old watch
and killed her.

756
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,860
And he left a message for anyone

757
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,560
who thought the revolution
was over.

758
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,400
Sounds like a bad ex-boyfriend.

759
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,560
Well,that's
assuming

760
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,960
she was in contact
with him.

761
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,460
And we have no way
of knowing

762
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,700
where that would've
taken place

763
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,030
if she had seen him.

764
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,030
Not so sure about that.

765
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,060
I have her air filter.

766
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,900
It's like an entomological GPS.

767
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,700
What's taking Hodgins so long?

768
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,730
It's an exacting process.

769
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,860
Ah.

770
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,000
Thank you.

771
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,830
So,um,

772
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,460
how'd your dad like his socks?

773
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,730
Fine.

774
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,600
That's sort of a way to start
a conversation there,Bones.

775
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,930
I know.

776
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,300
Yeah,look,I'm,

777
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,460
I should never have gotten
in the middle of all this.

778
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,560
I-I'm sorry,I was just,
I'm just trying to help.

779
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,060
He wanted me to testify
on his behalf.

780
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,060
He just wants
to use me.

781
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,500
Well,he's a con man,
Bones.

782
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
That doesn't mean
that he doesn't love you.

783
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,300
He's just looking
for a little payback.

784
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,800
Payback?
Yeah,he's thinking

785
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,960
he got arrested so he could
spend some more time with you,

786
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,630
I mean you could at least return
the favor

787
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,000
by doing something nice for him.

788
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah,I'm not sure
I want a father

789
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,460
who's always keeping score.

790
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,460
Yeah,sounds like you are,too.

791
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,430
You know what?

792
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,130
You're right.

793
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,460
This is none of your business.

794
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,460
You know what,
Bones?

795
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,730
You're never forgive yourself

796
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,400
if you don't cut the guy some
slack

797
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,060
just because you were afraid
to get hurt.

798
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,900
What the hell is taking Hodgins
so long?

799
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,230
Where's the bombshell
from the bomb squad?

800
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,230
She went back
to the FBI

801
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,730
to catalogue
evidence.

802
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,260
Thank God.

803
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,600
She was driving me crazy.

804
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,860
It was just science
all the time.

805
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,260
Then she tries to destroy
perfectly good evidence.

806
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,060
What about the breasts?

807
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,060
I started thinking about them

808
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,330
dragging on the floor
when she's 70.

809
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,700
How are you doing?

810
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,300
Well,that burned paper

811
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,730
is a letter that she wrote.

812
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,360
So I'm using
the Spectral Comparator

813
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,230
to locate the ink particles.

814
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,900
Cool.

815
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,560
The,uh,computer is rendering
the content now.

816
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,930
So...
Mm-hmm.

817
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,360
You?

818
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,260
I found pollen.
Mmm.

819
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,260
Most of it Pinus appalachiana--

820
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,630
Shenandoah pine...

821
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,860
which is only found on
Shenandoah Mountain

822
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,500
in West Virginia.

823
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,300
There was also crushed
Pendleton

824
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,000
leatherflower in
the tire treads,

825
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,560
which is only found

826
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,900
here in the shale barrens
along the upper Potomac.

827
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,330
It is very secluded.

828
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,000
Between the towns
of Hendersonville

829
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,900
and Maple Flats.
Booth!

830
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,930
That's nice work,
Hodgins.

831
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,330
You know,my computer

832
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,500
is going to be rendering
for a while.

833
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,760
You want to go
to the medieval storage room?

834
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,800
Oh.

835
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,360
Booth,what the hell is
taking you so long?!

836
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,730
BRENNAN:
 <i>You told Reilly</i>
 <i>where Watkins is?</i>

837
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,100
Yeah,he's meeting
us there.
He's too emotional.

838
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,400
This is his case;
he's invested.

839
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,500
He's irrational.

840
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,630
Probably male menopause.

841
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,830
What?!
He's a good man.

842
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,160
And you know what?
There's no such thing.

843
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,400
That is a sexist myth.

844
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,560
Factually,

845
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,560
hormone production drops
in your 50s,

846
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,400
sexual desire decreases,

847
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,100
you have to deal with aof muscle mass,

848
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,030
erectile dysfunction...
All right,hey,
let's just

849
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,230
keep the conversation up,
shall we?

850
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,060
And there's evidence
that certain men

851
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,000
become very unstable.
Do you want me

852
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,430
to start talking
about your father again?

853
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,530
You're very testy.

854
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,560
You know,and 35.

855
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm only 35.
Okay,

856
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,200
okay.

857
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,460
They have blue
pills for that.

858
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,960
No,I don't like this.

859
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,330
It's too quiet.

860
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,460
Wasn't Reilly
supposed to meet us?

861
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,500
(cocking gun):
Yeah.

862
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,800
Gee,why didn't you
bring the big one?

863
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,460
BOOTH:
Easy,Sam.

864
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,930
Put the gun down.

865
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,030
Step away from the body.

866
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,930
Booth...

867
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
look at him.

868
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,830
He did it to himself.

869
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,160
I didn't do this,Booth.

870
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,460
SAROYAN:
.38 caliber slug.

871
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,060
Matches the revolver
found at the scene.

872
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,730
Now,positioning is consistent

873
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,760
with a self-inflicted
gunshot wound,

874
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,660
but could easily
have been staged.

875
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,060
Zack,bring up
that hand X-ray.

876
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,960
Look at this.

877
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,360
Asymmetric narrowing

878
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,530
on the first
metacarpophalangeal joints.

879
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,930
Ulnar deviation,
barely discernible.

880
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,260
Would you like my finger,
Dr. Brennan?

881
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,760
Please.
SAROYAN:
What are you two thinking?

882
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,960
Neal Watkins had rheumatoid
arthritis in his hands.

883
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,660
This would approximate

884
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,100
the strength of his
arthritic finger. Pull.

885
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,230
Harder.

886
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,100
I'm trying,Dr. Brennan.

887
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,600
Watkins' fine motor function

888
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,300
would be no greater than Zack's
gauze-wrapped finger.

889
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,460
Neal Watkins wasn't able
He couldn't have shot himself.

890
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,130
If he couldn't
pull the trigger,

891
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,760
he wouldn't have
the manual dexterity

892
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,030
to assemble the bomb either.

893
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,360
There's one man who knew
exactly how Neal made his bombs.

894
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,200
The same man who worked
the case for 30 years.

895
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,300
I'll call Booth.

896
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,830
Dr. Brennan determined

897
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,330
that... it wasn't a suicide.

898
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,030
What?

899
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,530
The gun was a plant.

900
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,660
Wouldn't be the first time

901
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,400
an agent planted
a gun,would it?

902
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,930
Forensics searched
the house and,uh...

903
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,860
they determined that there
was not enough evidence

904
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,330
to suggest that Watkins made
the bomb that killed Harris.

905
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,360
What about the watch?
That's the thing,Sam.

906
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,660
It turns out that two
Sawyer Company American flag

907
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,000
watches were confiscated
in a '74 NLA raid.

908
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,660
We checked the
evidence locker.

909
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,360
A lot of things are missing,
including a watch.

910
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,800
REILLY:
It was a dog case,Booth.

911
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,160
That crap was moved
off-site years ago.

912
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,500
You know what happens
during a move.

913
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
CAROLINE:
So you had a
30-year obsession,

914
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,830
but you didn't keep
track of your evidence?

915
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,730
You have a good
service record,<i>cherie.</i>

916
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,160
We could make a deal.

917
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,630
Look,

918
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,730
but there is a real
killer out there.

919
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,500
Look,I understand,Sam.

920
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,000
I do.

921
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,000
I think...

922
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,530
...you should find
yourself a lawyer.

923
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,530
I was cataloguing
the watch debris

924
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,300
and noticed that the oxidation
and bacterial erosion

925
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,330
of the metal was
inconsistent with watches

926
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
that would have been stored
in evidence for 30 years.

927
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,900
But weren't the watches
discontinued after '76?

928
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,530
Yes,but I found a few available
online for collectors...

929
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,700
still sealed.

930
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,030
You traced one to a buyer?

931
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,160
I didn't have to.

932
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,900
Since the watch
was 30 years old,

933
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,860
the bomber had
to put in a new battery.

934
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,560
He left behind a thumbprint.

935
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,960
The casing

936
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,700
protected it during the blast.

937
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,530
I asked the Bureau
to run the print.

938
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,700
The letter has
finished rendering.

939
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,930
It's not addressed to Watkins.

940
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,500
BRENNAN'S VOICE:
 <i>"Dear Celia,</i>

941
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,800
<i>"I've done terrible things</i>
 <i>in my life.</i>

942
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,330
<i>"Things I can't change.</i>

943
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,330
<i>"I know how much pain</i>
 <i>this will cause you,</i>

944
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,330

 <i>how much I love you.</i>

945
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,500
<i>"I know we didn't</i>
 <i>always agree on how,</i>

946
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,330
<i>"but we both hoped</i>
 <i>for the same thing:</i>

947
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,660
<i>a just world."</i>

948
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,500
The funeral's today?

949
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,100
Yeah.

950
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,760
They seem like every other
normal grieving family.

951
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,800
It's never what it seems,is it?

952
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,030
Mr. Nash,you're under arrest

953
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,600
for the murder
of June Harris,

954
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,330
aka Amy Nash.

955
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
That's crazy.

956
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,200
I'm sorry,Celia.

957
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,760
We know about the watch.

958
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,900
<i>"Even though I didn't fire</i>

959
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,900
<i>"the gun that took</i>
 <i>that man's life,</i>

960
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,900
<i>"I have to take</i>
 <i>responsibility for it</i>

961
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,800
<i>and for my cowardice</i>
 <i>hiding all these years."</i>

962
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,400
I caught her
sneaking out one night.

963
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,900
She had been seeing him.

964
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,600
She betrayed me,Celia.

965
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,260
She betrayed us.
(handcuffs tightening)

966
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,760
How could you do this?

967
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,160
25 years,I believed
she loved us,

968
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,630
but she used us
to keep her cover.

969
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,730
BOOTH:
Let's go.

970
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,260
<i>"I tried to spare you</i>
 <i>and your father pain.</i>

971
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,400

972

 <i>die than betray your father."</i>

973
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:57,660
She was trying t
to surrender,too.

974
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,160
She was trying to do
the right thing,Daddy.

975
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,260
Let's go.

976
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,760
You've got the right
to remain silent.

977
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,130
Anything you say,can
and will be used...

978

979

992
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,630
I... I wasn't sure I'd
ever see you again.

993
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,800
I thought maybe we could see

994
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,630
if we remember
that card game.

995
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Yeah,sure.

996
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,960
You know,I've kept this bottle
of single malt in my desk

997
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,000
since '75.

998
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,500
I always said
when we put this case to bed,

999
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,800
I'd open it.

1000
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,360
I'd like you to help me
with that,Booth.

1001
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,560
Listen,Sam,I...

1002
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,400
I want to apologize.

1003
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,600
Hey...
(cork pops)

1004
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,930
I would've done
the same thing myself.

1005
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Well,maybe not
quite the same thing.

1006
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,500
I would've slapped me
around a little bit.

1007
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,760
To the changing of the guard.

1008
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,430
How much scotch
did you drink?

1009
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,100
Oh,just enough.

1010
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,630
You know,I would've
invited you,

1011
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,960
but,Reilly,he just...

1012
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,360
Wow,he doesn't like you.

1013
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,700
I understand.

1014
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,130
I'm sorry,was that rude?

1015
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,260
Not from someone
who's been drinking.

1016
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,300
You know,
I love this plI love it.

1017
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,760
I love this country.

1018
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,860
You know,
I'll tell you something,

1019
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,300
if I was working law enforcement

1020
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,130
back in the day when they
threw all that tea,

1021
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,930
all right,in the harbor,
I'm good.

1022
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,200
All right,I'm good,
I would've rounded

1023
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,060
everybody up,
and we'd still be English.

1024
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,600
You think?
Yep.

1025
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,230
Yep,I definitely...

1026
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,700
I saw my father.

1027
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,500
Wow,I didn't think that
you were gonna do that.

1028
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,000
As an anthropologist,

1029
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,730
I accept change
as the natural order of things.

1030
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,360
But with him,I didn't
allow for transformation.

1031
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,000
You know,I predicated
his behavior

1032
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,400
based on a set of
outmoded preconceptions.

1033
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,160
It wasn't rational.

1034
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,960
Wow,I didn't get any of that.

1035
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,860
If I was conducting

1036
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,860
an objective experiment
on my father,

1037
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,260
observing his behavior,

1038
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:34,930
I'd... have to conclude
that he loves me.

1039
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,800
Hmm,whyWe played cards.

1040
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,960
Cool.

1041
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,660
I killed him.

1042
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,230
Good for you.
