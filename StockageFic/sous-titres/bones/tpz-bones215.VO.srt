1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
No, no , don't answer.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh, it's probably...
Probably, this is for my book.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,300
Shhh. Let's pretend it's the ocean.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,300
See that.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,700
God, love sex.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Keep calling.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,300
- I thought you hated publicity.
- Oh, it's a part of my contract.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,400
The book is getting a lot of
attention. Just trying to do my job.

9
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,299
Hello.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,400
Hi, Helen.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,600
Of course she did look out on the view.
I think Rosy had a little thing for it.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
That seems like a lot...

13
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,509
Well, it's two interviews, and
a book-signing in one day...

14
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,609
I don't know about tuesday.

15
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,509
Just hum... send the schedule

16
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,909
to the Jeffersonian okay.

17
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:07,609
I'll see you, I'm leaving right now.

18
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,709
- Now this is something you don't normaly look at the scene at
the publishing house. - Oh, dear Lord.

19
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,209
You smell that? Yeah.

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,108
Sorry I'm late.

21
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,909
Oh, thank god. Think...

22
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:29,309
You know, dear, your book
is on the bestseller's list.

23
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,209
You don't have to work
in this place anymore.

24
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:33,609
This is my real love, Helen.

25
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,309
I know a therapist who
could really help you.

26
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,409
OK.

27
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:41,109
The reading and the book-signing
are this wednesday night.

28
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,409
Hank is arranged for transportation.

29
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,609
He's... A car will pick you up
here at the lab, Dr. Brennan.

30
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,409
And then, there's the radio
interview, next tuesday.

31
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,009
Now that's an early one, so just tell
Hank what would you like for breakfast.

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,909
That's not necessary.

33
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,709
No, honey, don't worry about
that, that's what Hank is for.

34
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:53,609
Right, Hank?

35
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,409
Sure, um, I wanted to tell
you Dr. Bennett, I'm a huge...

36
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,109
fan, I thought this
book is even better...

37
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:01,109
You know, as far as you have
photo shoot is concerned...

38
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,509
OK, Bones. We gotta go. They
found a floater in the marina.

39
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:07,309
Oh, my partner, Seeley Booth,
this is the publicist for my book.

40
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,909
Helen Laskow, and her assistant, Hank.

41
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:09,809
Hello.

42
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,309
Now I see why Temper
writes those dirty little

43
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,409
scenes in her book.

44
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,509
- That's not me. Not me. No.
- It's not him.

45
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,409
Right, you must let me get you
that therapist number, dear.

46
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,009
No, seriously, she's got someone.

47
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,809
- Booth.
- No, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

48
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,309
I mean, he's kind of short.

49
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,609
- Short.
- He's not short. Just because he's not freakishly tall like you are...

50
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,109
Didn't you say that you had
remains for me to examine?

51
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:31,409
Oh, right. Come on, let's go.

52
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,909
Well, thanks for the schedule, Ellen.

53
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,909
So, is it just me, or is
this, you know, kind of weird?

54
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:46,809
What?

55
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,609
Well, in your new book, they
found a body at a marina, right?

56
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,409
- You read my book?
- Of course.

57
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,009
Anyhow, guy docking the boats

58
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,709
saw something floating in the water.

59
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:55,809
Thought it was a dead fish,

60
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,709
and it ended up being a decomposed hand.

61
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,709
The dive crew just located
the rest of the body.

62
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,609
I didn't think you'd
have time to read my book.

63
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,309
You've time to write it,
I have time to read it.

64
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,709
Besides, not like I can
avoid the damn thing.

65
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:06,909
Your book is everywhere.

66
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,109
Okay, bring it up.

67
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:11,809
Booth, look.

68
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,509
Wait... body on the anchor?

69
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,109
Yeah, tied to the chain.

70
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:19,509
Body's not tied with a rope.

71
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:21,009
Divers said they used...

72
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,009
Red tape.

73
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:26,909
How'd you know?

74
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,509
Because that's how I wrote it.

75
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,023
Victim was male, mid-40s.

76
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,923
Estimated time of
death is five days ago.

77
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,523
Only five days?

78
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,523
This is an extreme rate of decomp.

79
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,923
Blue crab season.
They'll feed on anything,

80
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,123
dead or alive.

81
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:25,923
Vegetation, fish, flesh...

82
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:27,923
Ugh, opportunistic little bastards.

83
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:31,023
Elliptical wound on the frontal
bone with the reverse beveling.

84
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:32,523
He was shot.

85
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,423
Is there a bullet?

86
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,323
No. Irregular exit
wound on the occipital.

87
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,623
Looks like a through and through.

88
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:42,523
Dr. Brennan, exactly how similar
is this situation to your book?

89
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,923
The victims in my book are bound

90
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,323
and gagged with red tape,

91
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:49,123
shot and then fed to various animals.

92
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:50,823
Cheery.

93
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,223
I loved the symbolism of the red tape.

94
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:55,623
Perfect way to dispose of bureaucrats.

95
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:56,923
Thank you.

96
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,523
The first body in the
book is tied to an anchor

97
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,323
and dropped in the water at a marina.

98
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:03,123
I'd prefer not to jump to conclusions.

99
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:05,323
I don't think it requires a jump.

100
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,223
Just a little hop. A little teeny...

101
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:12,123
In this lab, we are concerned
with science, not fiction.

102
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:21,723
This is a sketch based on
tissue markers on the skull.

103
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,823
PCB's and lead we found in the collagen

104
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,723
mean the victim's from the
north end of the Chesapeake,

105
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:28,923
probably outside Annapolis.

106
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:32,123
Did you have to whisper that in my ear?

107
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:33,423
It seemed right.

108
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:36,723
Check the image against
DMV photos from Maryland.

109
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,323
Bones...

110
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,023
How are you holding up?

111
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,423
What do you mean? Fine.

112
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,723
You know, something like this,

113
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,523
it's understandable if you're upset.

114
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,323
It's probably a coincidence.

115
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,923
Hey, how's it going?

116
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,023
What-what are you doing here?

117
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:54,923
Uh, yeah.

118
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,223
Well, I heard we have a copycat
killer using your book...

119
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,623
That hasn't been established.

120
00:05:58,723 --> 00:05:59,823
Yeah, I've got it covered here, Sully.

121
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:01,823
Two hands are better than one, Booth.

122
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:05,323
Well, last time I looked, I
have two hands, see? Thanks.

123
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:07,823
Testosterone spill on aisle four.

124
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:10,323
We don't know that my book is the cause.

125
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:12,523
So far what we do
know is... Someone died

126
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,623
exactly the way described in your book.

127
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,423
Do you keep any of your old fan mail?

128
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:18,923
No. I don't even read it.

129
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,823
The publicist deals with all that.

130
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,423
Yeah, I mean, why are you asking, Sully?

131
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,823
I'm in charge of this investigation.

132
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:26,823
Well, Booth, I was a
profiler for two years.

133
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,123
I have a lot of experience
with these cases.

134
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,523
This could be someone
showing what a big fan he is,

135
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:34,223
or someone trying to get
close to her, too close.

136
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:35,723
I don't need to be protected.

137
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:36,923
Yes, you do.

138
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,723
Look, you still call the shots.

139
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,823
I just think I'd be
an asset to the team.

140
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,223
Okay, fine. We send all the
fan mail to Sully in his office.

141
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:49,923
Fine, I'll call Ellen.

142
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,723
We could be dealing
with a real sicko here.

143
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:52,923
Jim Lopata.

144
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:55,523
Not the sicko.

145
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,223
The sicko's victim.

146
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:02,523
43, married, no kids.

147
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,623
From Glen Burnie outside of Annapolis.

148
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:08,223
So your husband never called you?

149
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:09,523
I thought, uh...

150
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:12,723
he was supposed to
be on a business trip.

151
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,423
And you hadn't seen
him since last Tuesday?

152
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:19,223
Oh, no, his trips...

153
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,023
he works so hard.

154
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:24,623
Morning till night,
driving hundreds of miles.

155
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:28,923
Greg, did you and your
sister's husband get along?

156
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:30,323
Well enough.

157
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,423
Mm.

158
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:36,323
Any idea if... he had any enemies?

159
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,223
Wouldn't come as a shock.

160
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,523
Jim liked to drink.

161
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:43,723
He could turn into a
real jerk sometimes.

162
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:46,523
- We were working through it.
- Right.

163
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:48,223
Greg... I'm sorry.

164
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,723
But part of me thinks
you're better off, Connie.

165
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,623
Are you better off, Mrs. Lopata?

166
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,423
How can you say that?

167
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,123
My husband's dead.

168
00:07:59,023 --> 00:07:59,923
Of course.

169
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:01,623
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,723
It's just... one more thing.

171
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,723
I realize this is gonna
sound a little strange,

172
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:11,823
but do either of you two
read, uh... mystery novels?

173
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,623
What the hell's this
got to do with anything?

174
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:15,923
Just answer him, Greg.

175
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,223
Greg likes them. Why?

176
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,823
It's just something I gotta ask.

177
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,923
The tape actually managed
to preserve particular matter

178
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:30,323
that was present on the
body before it was dumped.

179
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:33,123
Any hair? Other goodies
that can give us DNA?

180
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,323
No, but I did find sand.

181
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:38,723
Victim was in the ocean,
Hodgins. A lot of sand there.

182
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:40,723
Yeah, but the sediment
distribution doesn't match.

183
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:42,223
The sand came from someplace else.

184
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:44,423
Okay, try to locate the source.

185
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:46,723
What about the tape itself?

186
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:49,123
- Composition? Brand?
- Working on it.

187
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:50,723
Cool.

188
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,223
Do you really plan on
reading Dr. Brennan's book?

189
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,122
What?

190
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:58,723
Of course. I only... I bought it.

191
00:08:58,923 --> 00:08:59,923
You know, it's on a...

192
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,823
pile; I'm waiting... no, I don't.

193
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:04,622
Please don't tell her.

194
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:06,623
It's just, after dealing
with murder all day,

195
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:09,423
I can't bring myself to go home
and read about it for kicks.

196
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,523
So, for kicks you read...?

197
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,023
Feminist trash.

198
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:14,823
You know, woman finds her power,

199
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:16,623
leaves her oppressive husband,

200
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,223
discovers freedom and
fulfillment with an artist

201
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,523
who knows how to cry and
make love like an animal.

202
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:23,123
So, sex books.

203
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,323
Pretty much, yeah.

204
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:25,323
Hmm.

205
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:29,123
Let me know if you find
any organics on that tape.

206
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,023
Yup.

207
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,923
Is the FBI aware of the situation?

208
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:37,123
What do you mean?

209
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,523
Booth and Sully are
both working the case.

210
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:42,023
I meant the other murders in your book.

211
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:44,723
The marina victim is the first of three.

212
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,223
Please, concentrate
on the remains, Zack.

213
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:51,223
It's just, the later dump
sites are far less specific.

214
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,423
How could the FBI prevent...

215
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:54,523
Because we're the good guys, Zack.

216
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:55,523
Don't you forget that, okay?

217
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:57,723
Possible motive for
Jim Lopata's murder...

218
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,623
Connie Lopata's medical records?

219
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:03,623
Check out the ER visits.

220
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:05,523
Broken rib,

221
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:07,223
concussion, severe bruising.

222
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:08,423
Someone was abusing her.

223
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:09,523
Her husband.

224
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,823
So, the wife's brother
Greg knew about it

225
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,023
and killed the husband
to protect his sister.

226
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:17,423
Made it look like a
copycat to cover his tracks.

227
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:19,423
I got more info on the red tape.

228
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:22,923
It's a thermosetting silicon
adhesive with glass cloth backing.

229
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,323
Secures materials
under high temperatures.

230
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,723
Mostly used for electrical
and industrial applications.

231
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:30,223
Is this Greg person an electrician?

232
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,023
Other works at Reagan National Airport.

233
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,123
He's a baggage handler.

234
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:35,823
But glass tape is used on aircraft, too.

235
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,423
To secure cargo holds.

236
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,623
It didn't take a genius
to figure out he hit her.

237
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,123
You wanted to protect her.

238
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:45,323
She's my sister.

239
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:46,923
Of course I did.

240
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:50,523
I tried to get her to
leave him, but she was so...

241
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:53,923
I don't know. It was messed up.

242
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,923
So you decided to handle
things your own way.

243
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,423
What, meaning what, I killed him?

244
00:10:58,423 --> 00:10:59,423
No way.

245
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:01,523
I'm not saying I didn't want him dead,

246
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:02,923
but I never touched him.

247
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,723
Swear on my mother's grave.

248
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:09,623
Sorry, Greg, but that particular
oath is no longer recognized

249
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:10,523
in a court of law.

250
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:11,623
Listen, if you're gonna charge me

251
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:12,723
with something, do it. If not...

252
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:13,723
Where you were last Wednesday

253
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,423
when your brother-in-law
was killed?

254
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,123
In the mountains.

255
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:21,623
I went camping.

256
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,323
I'm assuming you were alone.

257
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:27,923
There were other people at the camp
ground. If you can find the other people...

258
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,523
Just stay close, all right?

259
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,323
Don't go anywhere anytime soon.

260
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,423
All right, Greg?

261
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:37,423
- Booth.
- Yeah.

262
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:38,523
Did you see his right hand?

263
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,623
Sure. Well, not really. Why?

264
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:42,923
The third and fourth phalanges,
they're fused together.

265
00:11:43,023 --> 00:11:44,023
Greg has syndactyly.

266
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,023
Syndactyly, yeah, of course.

267
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:46,923
Is that relevant?

268
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,723
Well, it could indicate the
presence of other birth defects,

269
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,023
things that might affect
his range of motion.

270
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:51,723
We should look into that.

271
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,623
Would he be able to shoot a gun?

272
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:54,522
What?

273
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,523
If his fingers, you know,
were fused like that,

274
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:58,223
would he still be able to,
you know, pull a trigger?

275
00:11:58,623 --> 00:11:59,923
Yes, I don't see why not.

276
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,523
Okay. That good enough for me.

277
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,923
If it's not him, Booth...

278
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:08,923
There are two other murders in the book.

279
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:11,323
I know.

280
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:13,223
Hank.

281
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:16,923
What are you doing here?

282
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:18,222
Ellen sent me out.

283
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:20,023
Said you needed all your old fan mail.

284
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:23,223
Plus, she needs a half-caf
soy latte every day at 10:00,

285
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:26,223
a half-caf soy latte
with a dollop of foam

286
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:28,023
and a sprinkle of chocolate shings

287
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:29,223
every day...

288
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:33,923
Um...

289
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,123
I'm looking for an Agent Sullivan.

290
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,123
Oh, yeah, he's down the hall,

291
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:39,223
in his office.

292
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:41,123
Booth.

293
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:43,623
Yeah.

294
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:47,123
What's wrong?

295
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:50,323
Someone must have
broken in Saturday night.

296
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,423
Store's closed Sundays and Mondays.

297
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,623
Clerk comes in this morning,
gets an eyeful of this.

298
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:10,423
Isn't this how you killed the
second victim in your book?

299
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,423
Yeah.

300
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,660
Sadie Keller, 28, lived in Chevy Chase.

301
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,860
Wow, that was fast.

302
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,760
Her face was chewed off.

303
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,160
Aside from bite marks on her
parietal and sphenoid bones,

304
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,660
skull was intact enough for Angela
to do a facial reconstruction.

305
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,560
Yeah.

306
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Sadie Keller... recently
married to Ashton Keller, 29.

307
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,360
No work history.

308
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,260
Went to some pretty
fancy schools, though.

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,660
- She was rich.
- Great. So we got

310
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,360
a dead traveling salesman
and a prep school socialite.

311
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,560
What the hell's the connection?

312
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,860
Not Greg Braley.

313
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,260
His story checks out.

314
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
He was camping the
night Lopata was killed.

315
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,960
Two rangers recognized him.

316
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,660
Oh, great. So the
only connection we have

317
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,960
is the tape and the fact that
they were both fed to animals.

318
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,360
So we're back to me.

319
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,460
No.

320
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,760
Your book.

321
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,160
I can only deal with what's before me.

322
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,960
Two discrete cases.

323
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,360
Physical evidence.

324
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,060
Look, Bones, I know it's
probably easier for you

325
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,360
to believe that the
cases aren't linked...

326
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,460
No, there's nothing
that would make the loss

327
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,160
of two lives easier for me, Booth.

328
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,660
- I'm sorry, but...
- I'm not burying

329
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,060
my head in the sand here.

330
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,560
I want to catch whoever did
this as much as you guys do.

331
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
But I have a method.

332
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,460
And the method doesn't change.

333
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,160
I'll be back in my lab.

334
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,760
She wasn't this emotional
before you came in the picture.

335
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,360
I thought you weren't interested.

336
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,560
Look, I don't need that,
okay? Believe me, okay?

337
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm gonna go talk to
Sadie Keller's husband.

338
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
Why don't you just go
back to your office there

339
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,360
and sort through the
fan mail, all right?

340
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,160
Got some phaenicia
sericata stuck in the tape.

341
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,660
Means she's been dead
less than two days.

342
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,260
Rats sure made quick work of her.

343
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,260
So, all the victims in Dr.
Brennan's book got eaten?

344
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,860
Yeah, it was part of the metaphor.

345
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,460
The victims were all corrupt
politicians who'd been

346
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,760
feeding for years on the
goodwill of the people, so...

347
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,560
I got it.

348
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,060
Lots of gore with a splash
of social commentary.

349
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,860
No wonder it's a bestseller.

350
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,260
Ooh, good.

351
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,460
Lots of tissue left over here.

352
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,960
There's no exit wound.

353
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
So we've got a bullet?

354
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I don't see it.

355
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,960
The tissue was too badly scavenged.

356
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,760
But if the bullet was
still inside Sadie Keller

357
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
when her body was dumped in the cage...

358
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,960
We need to X-ray us some rodents.

359
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,260
She was supposed to
be visiting a friend.

360
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,160
And when she didn't
return your phone call...

361
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,060
I just assumed...

362
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,360
She was very independent,

363
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,260
still kind of wild.

364
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,660
I mean, she was used to
getting whatever she wanted.

365
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Like what?

366
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,560
Let's just say she
wasn't the wifely type.

367
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,460
And since she had all the money,

368
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
she thought she could, uh...

369
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,260
you know.

370
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,360
Do you know any of the men

371
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,660
she might have seeing?

372
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,260
I didn't want to know.

373
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,860
I just wanted it to blow over.

374
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,260
I...

375
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,660
I loved her.

376
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,660
And I know that sounds pathetic

377
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,060
but I just loved her.

378
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,760
Forgive me, Mr. Keller,
but you stand to inherit

379
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,160
quite a lot of money

380
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,360
from your wife, don't you?

381
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,960
Yes, I do.

382
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,560
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised that you suspect me.

383
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,660
But I was out of town the
night that Sadie disappeared,

384
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,660
at a golf tournament.

385
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
I'll need the details.

386
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,660
- Of course.
- Yeah.

387
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Sadie meant everything
to me, Agent Booth.

388
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,360
And I know she loved me.

389
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,760
Whatever happened...

390
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,760
she did.

391
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,760
I know that.

392
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,260
They're cute, for rodents.

393
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,360
Yeah, well, don't grow too attached.

394
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,460
These little guys are
destined to be snake snacks.

395
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,160
But now that we've confiscated them,

396
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
shouldn't they be safe?

397
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,560
I mean, they're material witnesses.

398
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,560
It's not like they know
sign language, Angela.

399
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,760
In grad school, I developed
a more efficient method

400
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
for killing rats prior to dissection.

401
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,460
It involved a warm dish of water

402
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,960
and the clever use
of a ball-peen hammer.

403
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
Zack... Uh !

404
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,460
Found something.

405
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,460
Wow.

406
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Now what?

407
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,660
Warm water soothes
them like a bubble bath.

408
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,660
Then...

409
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,560
Can't we just wait until
nature takes its course?

410
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,660
Do you have any idea how
tight a rat's rectum is?

411
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,960
Please tell me you don't.

412
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,160
Locate the ammo thief?

413
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,760
Yes, but we're debating the
method of bullet retrieval.

414
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,860
Well, I fed them all a mixture
of extra-strength laxative

415
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,860
and soft tissue dilator
when they arrived, so...

416
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
shouldn't be long now.

417
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
She fed all of them laxatives?

418
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,960
I need to go to my office.

419
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,160
Lunch time.

420
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,060
Ho !

421
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm not hungry.

422
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on, it's meatball.

423
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,660
It's the perfect food.

424
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,860
Shouldn't you be working?

425
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,360
I went through the fan mail

426
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,760
and gave the likely candidates
to Booth to check out.

427
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,260
Yeah, I'm busy, Sully.

428
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,760
I'm cataloguing injuries
the two victims suffered.

429
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,060
Hey, I am on your side, Tempe.

430
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,760
I know what you're going through.

431
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Okay, what?

432
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,560
What, Sully? What...

433
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,060
What am I going through?

434
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,360
Okay.

435
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,760
You feel responsible.

436
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
You feel that somehow, if
you didn't write that book,

437
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,560
those two people would still be alive.

438
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,660
And you're terrified 'cause you know

439
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,360
that someone else dies in the book.

440
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,860
I don't put much credence in psychology.

441
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
Well, neither do I.

442
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,560
I'm basing this on knowing you... well.

443
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,960
Knowing how much you
care about your work.

444
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,560
And if trivializing it in
the book caused this, then...

445
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,760
It just, but it doesn't
work like that, Tempe.

446
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,960
Statistically, the
murders would have happened

447
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,960
whether the book was written or not.

448
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,560
The method might be different is all.

449
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,660
Right.

450
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,460
Now, if you only believed that.

451
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,460
You don't know me as well as you think.

452
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,660
We're just having a fling,
so don't get carried away.

453
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,060
When you can't stop
thinking about someone

454
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,960
when they're not around,
that's not a fling.

455
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,060
When you remember their touch
just like they were still

456
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,960
right next to you, that's not a fling.

457
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,160
If you need to be alone with this, fine.

458
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,860
But we both know what we have.

459
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
We have the bullet.

460
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,960
The bullet was jacketed,
showing little deformity.

461
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,760
And you've compared it with
the wounds on both victims?

462
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,260
Lack of shattering around the
exit wound on the first victim

463
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
suggests a jacketed projectile.

464
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,760
And Angela's rendering also matches

465
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,160
the bullet we recovered from the rat.

466
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,060
Zack... Hey, Bones.

467
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I thought you and
Sully were having lunch.

468
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,560
Not hungry.

469
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,560
Zack thinks both victims
were shot using the same gun.

470
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,860
You said that Ashton Keller was

471
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,260
going to get a large inheritance.

472
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,760
Right. But his alibi is airtight.

473
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,560
He was at Briarwood in Maine

474
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,060
at a charity golf tournament.

475
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,660
So much for that theory.

476
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
Yeah, what about the red tape?

477
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,060
I mean, did Hodgins...

478
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,960
It's the same.

479
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,860
Same gun, same tape, no
relationship between the victims.

480
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm telling you, we're
dealing with a serial killer.

481
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,260
He's just picking random targets.

482
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,460
Nothing else makes sense here.

483
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,660
But serial killers have a
pattern, a method of killing.

484
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
The first victim has numerous defensive
wounds, including a fractured manubrium,

485
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,760
and trauma to the temporal bone.

486
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,760
There was quite a
struggle before he died.

487
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,660
What about the second victim?

488
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,460
Nothing.

489
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,760
Only the gunshot.

490
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,360
Did you have something to show me?

491
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,160
Oh, new suspect.

492
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,160
All right, Sully narrowed the
fan mail down to the people

493
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,160
most likely to act out in obsessive

494
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,360
or dangerous ways.

495
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,260
But...

496
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,560
look who I found, huh?

497
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,460
Your number one fan.

498
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,660
Oliver.

499
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Haven't seen him in a while.

500
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,260
Oliver Laurier.

501
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,460
The guy who stalked you

502
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,760
when we first started working together.

503
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,560
He used to come to all my readings,

504
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,760
follow me around afterwards.

505
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,760
It says here your
publicist gives his picture

506
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
to security guards at every signing.

507
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
Must be why I haven't seen him.

508
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,060
I think it's time for to go see

509
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,660
what our buddy Oliver
has been up to lately.

510
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,960
Oliver?

511
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
You home?

512
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,260
Who is it?

513
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,060
It's an old friend.

514
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,160
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

515
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,360
You work with Dr. Brennan.

516
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Why are you here?

517
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Well, you know, somebody
loves Dr. Brennan's new book

518
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
just a little too much.

519
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,360
And since you're such a big fan...

520
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,760
Oh ! Okay.

521
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,560
You know what? Not good idea, Oliver.

522
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,460
Go away !

523
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,660
All right.

524
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
You know, this is probable cause.

525
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm gonna give you five seconds.

526
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,560
Oliver !

527
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,460
Five, four...

528
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,260
I didn't do anything.
Three-two-one !

529
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,860
My shrink is gonna be pissed.

530
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,460
I didn't do anything.

531
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,560
Of course you didn't.

532
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,160
Come on.

533
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,260
Yeah.

534
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,060
Ow.

535
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,357
It was just a game, okay?

536
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:54,157
If it was just a game, why'd
you slam the door in my face?

537
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:54,957
I'm not stupid.

538
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,357
I heard about the murders.

539
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:59,757
And I knew you wouldn't understand CRP.

540
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:02,257
- CRP?
- Creative role playing.

541
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:04,457
Sometimes I like to pretend.

542
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,757
I act out scenes from my favorite books.

543
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:12,257
Exactly, um, how far do
these "games" of yours go,

544
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,257
Ollie?

545
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,057
You ever get tired of pleding
with your little dolls,

546
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,657
maybe try acting it out on other people?

547
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,057
Dr. Brennan's book signing is tonight.

548
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:23,557
I wanted to see her again.

549
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:26,457
Let's stay on point here, Ollie.

550
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:27,457
I am on point.

551
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:28,857
I want to see Dr. Brennan.

552
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:31,157
This isn't like going to see Santa,

553
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:33,557
it's more like the
principal's office, you see.

554
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:34,657
I'm in charge.

555
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:35,757
I call the shots.

556
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:39,657
Did you read Dr. Brennan's
new book, Agent Booth?

557
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:40,757
Why do you care?

558
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:42,757
Merely wondering if you know

559
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:44,957
how many victims are in it.

560
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:48,957
What's this about, Ollie?

561
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:52,457
I want to see Dr. Brennan.

562
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:55,057
Santa.

563
00:23:58,557 --> 00:24:01,957
Sully asked Booth to double
security for my book reading.

564
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:03,157
Hot.

565
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:05,157
No, I don't need that kind of hot,

566
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,657
being treated like a damsel in distress.

567
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,557
Sully cares about you, honey.

568
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:10,357
It's a good thing.

569
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:12,357
We've only been seeing
each other for a month.

570
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:13,857
You know, he doesn't know me.

571
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:15,157
Not really.

572
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:17,357
And if he does, he won't like you?

573
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:23,357
I've already given up too much to him.

574
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:25,057
It's... this one or this one?

575
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:26,957
- This one.
- Okay.

576
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:30,357
Most relationships end badly.

577
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:33,657
I just think it's important
to... to be reasonable.

578
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:34,857
To stay in control.

579
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,257
Don't use your brain so much, sweetie,

580
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:41,657
you have other organs that
can give you far more pleasure.

581
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,757
I'm just saying that
the odds are not in favor

582
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:47,457
of lasting relationships.

583
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:52,857
Look, it might end with Sully, sure.

584
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:55,957
But I don't think you
want to rush the process.

585
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:57,857
Look at Hodgins and I.

586
00:24:58,357 --> 00:25:00,757
We're running on sex and laughing.

587
00:25:01,357 --> 00:25:04,557
The only thought comes when
we order takeout in bed.

588
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:06,357
And you're happy?

589
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:09,557
Hey, we did it in the
storage locker an hour ago.

590
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:11,857
I am thrilled.

591
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,757
Cam, I have a book signing tonight.

592
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,357
Oh, right.

593
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:28,857
You think that's safe?

594
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:32,057
Well, there haven't been
any threats on my life.

595
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:34,657
No threats on these victims either.

596
00:25:35,857 --> 00:25:37,257
Is that the soft tissue sample

597
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:38,957
from the second victim?

598
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:40,057
Sadie Keller.

599
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:42,157
Found something irregular.

600
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:45,457
Oxygen saturation levels in
the blood were extremely low.

601
00:25:45,957 --> 00:25:47,157
I think she might have been unconscious

602
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:48,357
before she was killed.

603
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:50,157
That would explain the lack of struggle.

604
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,057
But there was no skeletal
evidence of a head injury.

605
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:54,657
I know, my guess would be drug induced.

606
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:55,857
I'm about to run a tox screen.

607
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:58,957
Thing is, why would the killer
render this victim unconscious?

608
00:25:59,057 --> 00:25:59,957
It doesn't follow.

609
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:02,057
Serial killers are consistent.

610
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,357
Wow !

611
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,657
New dress code? 'Cause
I didn't get thmoge

612
00:26:06,757 --> 00:26:07,557
Okay.

613
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:09,557
The sand I collected
from the first victim:

614
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:11,657
it's from feldspathic rock.

615
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:13,657
But that's widely occurring, right?

616
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:14,457
Right.

617
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:15,957
Sixty percent of the Earth's crust

618
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,257
is composed of feldspar.

619
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:19,157
So, this is no help to us.

620
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,057
Actually, it is.

621
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:22,057
These particles are
way too finely graduated

622
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,457
to have occurred naturally.

623
00:26:23,657 --> 00:26:25,157
This is manufactured sand.

624
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:26,657
Hi, Booth.

625
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:28,357
Can we trace the manufacturer?

626
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:30,057
I've requested samples from every quarry

627
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:31,557
that distributes to the D.C. area,

628
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,657
see if that narrows it down.

629
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,657
Okay, ll be right there.

630
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:36,757
Hey, be careful tonight.

631
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,257
I'm not going to the signing yet.

632
00:26:38,457 --> 00:26:40,057
Booth has a suspect.

633
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,157
Serial killers like to show off.

634
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:44,857
Boast about their crimes.

635
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:47,457
You might be able to get him to open up.

636
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:48,957
But you don't have to talk
to him if you don't want to.

637
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,357
- I'm not afraid of him.
- I'm not saying

638
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:51,857
that you are, I'm just
saying... I'll be back.

639
00:26:52,957 --> 00:26:53,857
She'll be back.

640
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:55,557
That means...

641
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,457
Everything with you two, uh...

642
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,457
Well, you know what? Never mind.

643
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,657
Wow.

644
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,357
It's like you dressed
up just to see me again.

645
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:11,557
I can assure you, Oliver,
that, that's not the case.

646
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,757
But that's what it feels like.

647
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:15,157
To me.

648
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:18,257
Did you kill those people, Oliver?

649
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:20,657
I... can't answer that yet.

650
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:22,557
I want to talk a while first.

651
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:24,357
The dead bodies, is it true?

652
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:25,857
Did they really get eaten?

653
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:26,857
Like in the book?

654
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:28,957
Yes, they did.

655
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:30,857
I knew it.

656
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,057
Some of the Brennanites were skeptical

657
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:34,657
that the deaths were realistic,

658
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:35,757
but I told them.

659
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:37,057
Did he say "Brennanites"?

660
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,457
Did you say "Brennanites"?

661
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,357
Murder Mystery Chat Room members.

662
00:27:40,557 --> 00:27:42,257
See, all chat room
members have to identify

663
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,257
themselves with their favorite author.

664
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:47,057
I'm a Brennanite, of course,

665
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:49,557
but there are also, uh,

666
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:51,857
Pattersonians and Graftonadas.

667
00:27:51,957 --> 00:27:54,857
Okay, Oliver, I understand.
What did you tell them?

668
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,457
That you couldn't make those things up.

669
00:27:57,557 --> 00:28:01,257
Everything you write is based
in fact, it could really happen.

670
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:04,657
Oliver, I want to
talk about the murders.

671
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:08,357
You look so beautiful.

672
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:10,757
Maybe I could get a
picture of us together.

673
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,757
The murders, Oliver.

674
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:15,757
I know you just dismiss
me as another fan,

675
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,757
but once you get to know me,

676
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,157
you realize

677
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:22,257
I'm an interesting man.

678
00:28:22,357 --> 00:28:24,657
No touching, Oliver.

679
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:26,357
Okay, end of interview.

680
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,457
Seems like a good call.

681
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,557
Let's go.

682
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:31,557
No, we want to be alone.

683
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:32,957
You blew your chance for that, okay.

684
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:33,857
You can sit in a cell

685
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:35,157
till you're ready to talk.

686
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:37,057
Wait, don't leave yet. Not yet.

687
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:39,657
O-kay.

688
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:42,057
- Ow, my nose.
- See,

689
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,857
I can take care of myself.

690
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:45,757
Yeah, you'd better watch it, dude.

691
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:50,457
Oh, my...

692
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:52,157
There's so much...

693
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,057
The guy faints at the sight of blood.

694
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,757
- He has vasovagal syncope.
- Wait

695
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:05,057
there's no way he's the killer,
he just wanted your attention.

696
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,357
All right, so we're
back'r to square one.

697
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:09,257
All right the, uh, the book
is the only connection...

698
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,557
It sold 400,000 copies already.

699
00:29:11,657 --> 00:29:13,757
That's a pretty big pool
of people to question.

700
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:15,457
I'm going to be late for my reading.

701
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:17,257
Wait, there's still
potentially one more victim.

702
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:18,857
I think you should cancel.

703
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,657
What the, the killer's ter me, Sully.

704
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,357
If he is using the book,

705
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,657
that makes me the
object of these actions,

706
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:26,857
not the target.

707
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:28,857
I mean, you're the profiler, right?

708
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,657
I'm just trying to help.

709
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:32,657
Well, you're making this, this personal.

710
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:33,957
You got yourself assigned to this case

711
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:35,357
just because of me. Absolutely !

712
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:36,957
What you'r gonna give me more crap now

713
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:38,457
because I care about you?

714
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:39,757
I'll be over here making a few calls.

715
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:40,857
A little help, Booth.

716
00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:42,357
Do you think she should go alone?

717
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:43,557
No, no, not alone,

718
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,357
but there seems to be
other stuff going on here.

719
00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:46,157
I don't want to get involved.

720
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:47,957
No, you agreed wagrem, you are involved.

721
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:49,157
All right, so let Booth take you,

722
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:50,957
and that way, it won't
be personal between us.

723
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:51,757
- Fine.
- Fine.

724
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:52,657
- Fine !
- Fine.

725
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:54,557
Fine.

726
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:03,557
Oh, my...

727
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,757
Ellen is going to be so
upset you didn't take the car.

728
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:08,257
No, it's okay, I
wanted to go with Booth.

729
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:09,457
You're not gonna get in trouble.

730
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:10,957
Man, you're shaking.

731
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:12,657
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

732
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:13,557
I'm fine, it's my own fault.

733
00:30:13,657 --> 00:30:16,157
I'm diabetic and I have
not had time to eat.

734
00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:17,957
And Ellen's not here yet.

735
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:20,057
What, do you have any food, Candy?

736
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:20,957
Yeah.

737
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:23,557
I got a half-eaten chocolate
bar, caramel center...

738
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,157
Wow. Here, eat.

739
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,957
You need the sugar.

740
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:27,957
Where, where's Ellen?

741
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:28,857
I don't know.

742
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,557
She went home to hours
ago to change her clothes.

743
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:33,157
Left me to handle everything.

744
00:30:33,257 --> 00:30:35,257
There was almost a riot over
the seating arrangements.

745
00:30:35,357 --> 00:30:36,457
Well, did you call her?

746
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:37,557
Who, Ellen?

747
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,757
I can't. She left her
Blackberry as usual,

748
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:41,957
for me to answer, so I
would actually be calling...

749
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,257
myself.

750
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:44,557
This is, this is not like her.

751
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,757
She's never late.

752
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:47,757
All right, look, I'll
send a car by her place,

753
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:48,857
check things out, all right.

754
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:49,557
Thanks.

755
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:51,057
I'll go in and get them ready for you.

756
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,757
You can use the back
entrance to avoid the nuts.

757
00:30:53,857 --> 00:30:57,257
Oh, um, the candy was a little linty,

758
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,157
but...

759
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59,657
thank you.

760
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:02,657
Linty?

761
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:06,357
Quite a line of people there.

762
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:07,857
A lot of fans, Bones.

763
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:10,857
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.

764
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:11,757
Hold it right there.

765
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:12,557
Whoa.

766
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:13,757
FBI, hands in the air.

767
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:15,157
I just wanted an autograph.

768
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:19,457
Okay, just wait till the
Doc gets inside, okay, pal?

769
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:25,157
I'm sorry, love your book.

770
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:26,357
Was that necessary?

771
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,357
Just doing my job, okay Bones.

772
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:29,957
Are you gonna come at me
like you came at Sully?

773
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:30,857
What is that supposed to mean?

774
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:33,257
Far be it for me to stick
my nose into your bedroom,

775
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:35,357
but I've known Sully a
long time, and believe me,

776
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:36,757
he's one of the good guys.

777
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:38,257
Well, I know Sully, Booth.

778
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,357
Yeah, and I know you.

779
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:40,457
All right, somebody gets too close,

780
00:31:40,557 --> 00:31:41,757
you just want to push them away.

781
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,157
I think you're taking your
therapy a little too seriously.

782
00:31:44,257 --> 00:31:46,157
Maybe, maybe not, come on, let's go.

783
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,057
What?

784
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:56,657
What the hell is that?

785
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:58,557
Oh, no.

786
00:31:58,657 --> 00:32:00,357
Booth, they're fire ants.

787
00:32:00,757 --> 00:32:02,257
Just like the book.

788
00:32:03,057 --> 00:32:04,357
The third body.

789
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,957
Oh, okay, there it is.

790
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:08,657
Oh !

791
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:11,757
Careful, Booth, don't
let them get on you.

792
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,157
Oh...

793
00:32:28,957 --> 00:32:30,057
It's Ellen.

794
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,064
We have to be careful with fire ants.

795
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:39,964
they're extremy dangerous.

796
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:41,864
I think the victim would agree with you.

797
00:32:42,164 --> 00:32:43,464
I asked them to pull the book,

798
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:46,064
but according to my contract,
I don't have that right.

799
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,664
I heard sales are increasing
because of the murders.

800
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,064
It's sick.

801
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:51,664
These are real people,

802
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:52,964
not characters.

803
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,264
Just rember: at the end your books,

804
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:57,464
Kathy Reichs always gets the murderer.

805
00:32:58,664 --> 00:32:59,664
How long will this take?

806
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:01,564
Long as it takes to get
every last one of th.

807
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:03,464
Introducing fire ants into the ecosystem

808
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,364
around here would be
extremely devastating.

809
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:06,364
What about the crime scene?

810
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:07,664
It was covered.

811
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:09,664
Yeah, I had to fight fire with fire,

812
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,764
or in this case, fire ants with fire.

813
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,564
Meaning... Had to scorch it.

814
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:14,864
Used a flame thrower.

815
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,164
Dude, it was like Ghostbusters,
the way they all went up.

816
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,464
We get the idea, thanks.

817
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,264
Bullet hole is visible now.

818
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:22,164
Around the C-2 vertebra.

819
00:33:23,464 --> 00:33:24,564
Close range.

820
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:26,864
Each shot in a different
part of the body.

821
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,064
Very unusual for someone
who executes his victims.

822
00:33:31,864 --> 00:33:34,564
Data retrieval went through
Ellen Laskow's Blackberry.

823
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:36,264
Found a text messaging address,

824
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,364
used only once about six months ago.

825
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:42,264
Former work number of Ashton
Keller, Sadie Keller's husband.

826
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,164
Oh, wait, our-our third victim knew

827
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:45,864
our second victim's husband?

828
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:47,764
Asht Keller said his
wife was fooling around.

829
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:49,564
Maybe Ashton was fooling
around with Ellen.

830
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:51,064
He was a good-looking young guy.

831
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:53,264
She was a scary publicist.

832
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,664
No accounting for taste.

833
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:56,464
Well, I'll, uh...

834
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:58,364
... see what the
publicist's assistant knows.

835
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:00,164
They're always covering
for their bosses, right?

836
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:01,564
Let's hope so.

837
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:03,064
I'll look for any other connections

838
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:05,264
between Ashton Keller
and our first victim.

839
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:06,464
Okay.

840
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,564
Hey, uh, how's Brennan holding up?

841
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,364
Why don't you ask her yourself?

842
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:17,664
I'm... I'm not sure she's
exactly receptive right now.

843
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:23,264
Listen, don't let her
bully you into leaving, man.

844
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,164
- All right?
- Yeah.

845
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:35,464
I... woke up this morning
and picked up her cleaning

846
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:36,764
like always.

847
00:34:37,764 --> 00:34:39,064
Stupid, huh?

848
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:42,964
I just... I can't get used to the fact

849
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,664
that she's not here anymore.

850
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:47,364
You need candy bar or something?

851
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:48,964
No, I'm okay.

852
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:50,464
Thanks.

853
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:54,564
So... is it the same person
who killed the other two?

854
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:56,164
We don't know yet.

855
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:57,164
When she didn't show up,

856
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,664
I should have driven back to get her.

857
00:35:02,964 --> 00:35:05,164
Was she, uh, having an affair?

858
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:15,264
She had... lovers.

859
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:18,164
Women.

860
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:22,264
I don't know why she was so
secretive in this day and age,

861
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:25,664
but I was the only person
in the office who knew.

862
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,264
Did she know Sadie Keller?

863
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,164
The other victim?

864
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:30,764
W-Were they...?

865
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,664
If you can think of anything
that might connect them...

866
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,864
Of course; I'll go through
my old records and date books.

867
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:37,764
Great. Thanks.

868
00:35:38,864 --> 00:35:41,064
The ridging along the
edges is almost identical.

869
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:42,864
I'd say the third bullet
was definitely shot

870
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,564
from the same barrel as the first two.

871
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:46,864
Same glass cloth tape
used on body number three.

872
00:35:46,964 --> 00:35:48,864
So why are all the attacks different?

873
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,964
The first victim, Jim Lopata,

874
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:54,164
shows signs of a physical
attack before he was shot,

875
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:56,164
and look at the angle of the gunshot.

876
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:57,764
Through the forehead, execution style.

877
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,064
And the second victim, Sadie Keller,

878
00:36:00,164 --> 00:36:03,464
shows absolutely no sign of a
struggle as if she were drugged.

879
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,464
But the toxicology
screen came back negative.

880
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:06,664
And the gunshot in this body

881
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,764
was straight through the heart.

882
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:08,564
The killer didn't want to see

883
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:09,964
his victim's face get blown off.

884
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:12,964
And Ellen was shot at close
range in the back of the neck.

885
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:14,764
I've never seen a pattern like that.

886
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:16,364
I don't think it is a pattern.

887
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:19,164
I think there were
three separate killers.

888
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:25,864
Any more leads off the third
vic? Yeah, I'm working on it.

889
00:36:25,964 --> 00:36:27,464
Brennan called, the
publicist took a shot

890
00:36:27,564 --> 00:36:28,364
to the back of the neck.

891
00:36:28,464 --> 00:36:30,064
She thinks we have
three separate killers.

892
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:31,164
That's a hell of a coincidence.

893
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:32,564
Or one hell of a conspiracy.

894
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:33,764
You know, she sounded pretty certain,

895
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:36,664
and I trust her when
she's all calm and relaxed.

896
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,864
Uh, so the text message.

897
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,664
Uh, Ellen Laskow writes Ashton Kelle

898
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:46,364
comes clean about her and
Sadie, Ashton is enraged...

899
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,464
No, it was Hank.

900
00:36:47,864 --> 00:36:49,264
The assistant? What? What about him?

901
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:51,764
He said that he always
carried Ellen's Blackberry.

902
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,064
So maybe it wasn't Ellen who knew Ashton

903
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:55,264
That's right.

904
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:56,964
It was Hank.

905
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:01,464
I found a quarry sample that matches
the sand found on the first body.

906
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:04,164
It was distributed by the
Irving Company of West Virginia,

907
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,764
used exclusively by
country clubs nationwide.

908
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:08,764
Only a few clubs in this area,
though, so I've got a list.

909
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:10,464
W-Why do country clubs need sand?

910
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,464
- For golf courses.
- All right, Bones.

911
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,464
You're right; we're dealing
with three separate killers.

912
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:16,364
Somehow they all know each
other and they're using your book

913
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:18,064
to make it look like one person.

914
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:18,964
What are we talking about?

915
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,364
Motive, Bones, okay, motive.

916
00:37:20,464 --> 00:37:22,364
Victim one was beating his wife,

917
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:25,364
second victim left her money
to her lazy-ass husband...

918
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:28,964
Victim three's Ellen,
who... seemed lonely, so...

919
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:31,364
Bones, don't try the
psychological stuff.

920
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:32,864
It's really not a pretty sight.

921
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,564
Ellen was hated by Hank,

922
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:36,464
who was also next in line for her job.

923
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:38,664
Hey, good work, Hodgins.

924
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:39,464
Thanks.

925
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:42,064
So our suspects agreed
to kill for each other

926
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,664
so they'd each have and alibi?

927
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:46,564
So all I need from you
people is some proof, okay?

928
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,064
Oh, is that all?

929
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:48,964
Wait.

930
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:49,864
The sand.

931
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:52,264
Didn't you say that Ashton
Keller was a big golfer?

932
00:37:52,364 --> 00:37:53,964
Yeah, he plays nine
holes at least every day

933
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,464
at the, uh, Rockville Country Club.

934
00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:03,164
Yep. Rockville Country Club.

935
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:05,264
It is the only golf course in Maryland

936
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:06,364
that gets their sand from Irving.

937
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:08,764
Okay, so if Ashton killed Jim,

938
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:11,364
that would mean Hank killed Sadie.

939
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:12,964
What do we know about Hank?

940
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:14,564
Not much.

941
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:16,764
Hardworking, smart, diabetic...

942
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:18,864
Diabetic.

943
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,064
That's it.

944
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:21,764
Cam !

945
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:25,964
The killer injected Sadie with
an excessive amount of insulin

946
00:38:26,064 --> 00:38:27,264
to render her unconscious.

947
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:30,264
Being a diabetic, Hank would
have easy access to insulin.

948
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:32,164
Why didn't that show
up in the tox screen?

949
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:34,764
Because insulin is a naturally
occurring substance in the body.

950
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:37,464
We were only looking for
analgesics and depressants.

951
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:39,464
Yeah, okay. What about
the third body, Ellen's?

952
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:43,164
The tape and the ants did a great
deal of damage to the epidermis.

953
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:45,764
It's been difficult to get
a narrative of the injuries.

954
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:47,164
Okay.

955
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:49,164
What's that?

956
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:50,564
Cam is going to examine the body

957
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,964
with a reflective ultraviolet lens,

958
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,364
see if that gives us anything.

959
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:57,464
I filtered the lens
so that it only allows

960
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,964
UV wave lengths of less
than 400 nanometers.

961
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:01,164
That way,

962
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:03,264
we can see bruises and injury patterns

963
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:04,464
that are normally invisible.

964
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:05,864
Okay, have fun with that.

965
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:08,264
Booth.

966
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:09,964
Long bruise there,

967
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,064
as if the killer had his arm

968
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:13,964
around her neck.

969
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,764
And these marks on the arms...

970
00:39:16,964 --> 00:39:18,464
they look like handprints.

971
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:22,764
Think her killer grabbed her
repeatedly all along her arms.

972
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,464
Hands...

973
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:25,864
May I?

974
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,664
Well, Sully got confirmation

975
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:28,964
on the connection between the killers.

976
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:29,764
Which is?

977
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:31,764
The Brennanite chat room
that Oliver mentioned,

978
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:34,364
the FBI tech squad
traced the screen names.

979
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:37,364
Greg Braley, Ashton Keller, Hank Belden,

980
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:39,164
they're all members.

981
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:42,164
Look.

982
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,964
Syndactyly on the right hand.

983
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:50,464
We can link Greg Braley
to Ellen Laskow's death.

984
00:39:50,864 --> 00:39:51,664
All three murders,

985
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,264
each one linked forensically
to one of the three suspects.

986
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,364
Not bad.

987
00:39:57,964 --> 00:39:58,864
What are you waiting for, Booth?

988
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,064
Go get the bad guys.

989
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,364
That's a good idea.

990
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:47,064
Tell you something, all right?

991
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:50,164
Sales of your book are
gonna skyrocket after this.

992
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:51,964
The only problem is our ending is

993
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:53,464
a lot better than the
one I wrote in the book.

994
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,164
What, are you kidding me, huh?

995
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:58,464
Kathy Reichs and the FBI
guy in the back of the AMG...

996
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:00,464
The arrest.

997
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:02,264
Oh, yeah, that.

998
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:04,164
Sully.

999
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:05,864
Yeah, you know, you
really should apologize.

1000
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,064
I mean, you were really
ragging on the guy.

1001
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:09,564
He seems a little frail.

1002
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:12,564
I'm a lot stronger than I look.

1003
00:41:15,164 --> 00:41:16,564
Oh. You were...

1004
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:19,864
- Hey, Sul.
- Hey.

1005
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:22,864
So, congratulations.

1006
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:26,364
You guys make a great team.

1007
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:28,764
Mm-hmm. That's true.

1008
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:31,464
So true.

1009
00:41:31,664 --> 00:41:32,864
Thanks for your help.

1010
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:34,364
Sure.

1011
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:44,664
You know, I-I should run... Bones.

1012
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,264
You know, I got stuff.

1013
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:51,864
See you at work, Sul.

1014
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:53,064
Yeah, I'll see you, man.

1015
00:42:00,664 --> 00:42:01,664
I...

1016
00:42:03,664 --> 00:42:05,664
I did feel responsible, Sully.

1017
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,164
Do.

1018
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:12,364
And you thought if I saw you vulnerable,

1019
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,164
needing me, I'd run?

1020
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:17,564
I've been alone my whole life.

1021
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:21,564
It's all I know.

1022
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:25,064
Eh, don't worry.

1023
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:28,464
You'll learn fast.
