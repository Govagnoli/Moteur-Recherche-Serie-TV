1
00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:03,282
You like this song ?

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:06,100
Nobody likes this song.
Oh.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,919
You're dancing to it.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,853
I may be swaying a little.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,154
And humming.

6
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:13,178
Bones, you know,

7
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:14,738
it's just something
that you do in the elevator.

8
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,330
Buddhists say that if we can
lose ourselves in the moment,

9
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:23,103
without distraction or desire,
we experience truth.

10
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:26,364
Why can't you just hum
like a normal, happy person ?

11
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,417
Not really in the mood.

12
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,719
Okay, here we go.

13
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:34,151
Oh.

14
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:43,018
Special Agent Booth.

15
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,821
And I'm going to assume
this is Dr. Brennan.

16
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,977
Bones, Alex
Radziwill.

17
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:49,612
He's, uh, you know, from
the State Department.

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,411
Why'd you say it like that ?
Booth believes
the State Department

19
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,479
was put on Earth to
protect bad guys

20
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,444
from the FBI.
I count three dead ?

21
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,645
Four. There's one
behind the bar.

22
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:00,345
Already ID'd as the bartender.

23
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,645
This was a cocktail
party after a conference

24
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,178
on drug trafficking
in South America.

25
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,278
The keynote speaker

26
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,545
was Colombian judicial attaché|Dolores Ramos.

27
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:08,612
Did she survive ?

28
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,312
Minor burns,

29
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:11,812
smoke inhalation,
she'll be fine.

30
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,879
Luck of the draw.

31
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,645
You seem uncomfortable.

32
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:15,911
Does his size
make you self-conscious ?

33
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:16,879
Bones !

34
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:20,245
It's a condition;
skeletal dysplasia.

35
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:21,711
Pseudo achondroplasia
or SED congenita ?

36
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,512
Bones !

37
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,612
Dr. Brennan, I can see that
you're a straightforward person

38
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,545
and as much as I appreciate
that quality,

39
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:31,378
what you're asking me is neither
your business nor relevant.

40
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:33,479
But it's my business
because I'm a forensic
anthropologist.

41
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:34,745
But you're right,
it's not relevant.

42
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,912
So what happened here ?

43
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:37,912
Bomb ?

44
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,480
The blast came from
the room next door.

45
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,529
Your people are working
on the cause right now.

46
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,662
I'm betting Colombian

47
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,695
drug types.

48
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:45,762
They just love
blowing people up.

49
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:47,296
Before she was attached
to the embassy,

50
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:48,861
Dolores Ramos
was a prosecutor in Bogot ?

51
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:51,929
She had plenty of enemies
in the cartels.

52
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,429
You ID anyone else
besides the bartender ?

53
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,463
Hector Madure, Chief of Police
from Quito, Ecuador...

54
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,762
I brought you in to confirm
the identity of his wife.

55
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,962
She's the
extra-crispy one.

56
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,762
Father Gabriel Ruiz.

57
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,595
He ran a drug program
for kids in Bogot ?

58
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,029
Well, you know, it's a big score
for the drug cartels.

59
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,662
Any one of these people,
you know, make a good target.

60
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,463
I'm gonna check on the condition
of the survivors.

61
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,728
If you need anything,
just holler.

62
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,886
Will do. See ya.

63
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,224
What do ya got, Bones ?

64
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,227
Female, mid-40s.

65
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:26,536
The bone structure fits
this picture

66
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:29,436
of Constanza Madure
pretty closely.

67
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:32,803
Dental work will confirm.

68
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,269
And the debris embedded in the
remains suggests an explosion.

69
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,603
So does that giant hole
in the wall there.

70
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:44,236
Hmm. Part of the navicular,
the top of the left foot.

71
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,331
Not hers.

72
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:49,199
There are other bone shards
scattered here.

73
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,832
You mean like extra bits ?

74
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:53,998
Yes. These are fragmented
from the blast.

75
00:02:55,798 --> 00:03:01,431
All these bone fragments here
in the wall.

76
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,698
I think someone was standing
in this room

77
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:07,025
very close to the bomb
when it went off.

78
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,383
Well, it had to be the bomber,
right ?

79
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,911
I mean,
talk about instant karma.

80
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,723
The question is,
where are the rest

81
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:12,855
of his remains ?

82
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:14,656
Vaporized, maybe ?

83
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,955
Unlikely. Oh. Huh.

84
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,055
What do ya got ?

85
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:21,522
An external occipital
protuberance.

86
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:24,522
Fissures indicate
thermal detachment.

87
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,312
It's the back of a human skull.

88
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:26,930
Cam !

89
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:29,470
Any of your bodies
missing a protuberance ?

90
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,874
No, all these remains
are fully intact.

91
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,521
Fully intact.

92
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,754
Aha.

93
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:37,921
Not all of them.

94
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,547
Oh !

95
00:03:51,683 --> 00:04:05,762
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

96
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:16,983
<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@¡¤D¡¤</font>

97
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:19,582
the explosion definitely
originated in the room

98
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:21,216
next to the cocktail party.

99
00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:22,471
Who was checked
in there ?

100
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,425
Nobody.
It was being renovated.

101
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,922
Paint, combustibles,
they would have added

102
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,727
to the force of the fire
and explosion.

103
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:32,379
So maybe the bomber got caught
by his own explosion.

104
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,713
Her own explosion.

105
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,147
The bomber is a female ?

106
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:36,913
The sciatic notch
doesn't lie.

107
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,180
Neither does the vagina.

108
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:42,247
Whoa. Wait a minute.
Whoa. Wait a minute.

109
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:45,412
You're saying the skull's so hot
that it explodes,

110
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,546
but the, uh, girlie parts
are still intact ?

111
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,813
She was thrown
into that chandelier
above the fire.

112
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,113
The deep tissue
remained intact.

113
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,893
Thank you for that.
Uh...

114
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,780
Particulates embedded
in the remains

115
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:57,150
are a combination of glass,
wood splinters,

116
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,285
plaster and drywall.

117
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,018
The bomber is Caucasian,
five-feet four, late teens,

118
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,118
early 20's

119
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,419
Still no ID.

120
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,118
Hair sample makes her
a bleach-bottle blonde.

121
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,465
Ankylosis in the
right trochlea

122
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:09,230
and capitulum
and scaphoid.

123
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:11,630
Occupational markers
from carrying a tray.

124
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,042
Mad bomber

125
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,627
teenage assassin waitress ?

126
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,152
She might not have had a choice.

127
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:17,717
I don't understand.

128
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,330
The cartels force people
to do what they want.

129
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,509
Your waitress refuses, the
cartel wipes out her family.

130
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,342
I'm running
chemiluminescence
tests now

131
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,543
to get a chemical fingerprint,

132
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:27,843
then chromatography to see
what triggered the blast.

133
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,976
I scanned the skull
and reconstructed a face.

134
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,256
Send it over to Booth.

135
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:42,530
If drugs are involved,
maybe she has a record.

136
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,049
Yeah, I already did that.

137
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:46,289
Listen, people,
please, don't be
sending stuff

138
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:47,529
without informing me
first.

139
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,563
But you wanted her to
send it. I heard you.

140
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,330
But not without first...

141
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,397
Just run everything
by me first, okay ?

142
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,651
Every circus needs
a ringmaster.

143
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:58,384
In this circus, it's me.

144
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:01,910
Yeah.

145
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,533
All we ask
at the State Department

146
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,389
is that you treat this woman
with the respect

147
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,621
she is due as a friend
of this country.

148
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,488
I know how to question
the witness.

149
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:12,354
I am here at the request
of the Colombian ambassador,

150
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,189
Judge Ramos and
the State Department.

151
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,655
That's disingenuous.

152
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,288
What are the chances

153
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:19,588
that all three would ask you
separately ?

154
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,988
Why are you being
so confrontational ?

155
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:23,688
You're used to people deferring
to you because of your size.

156
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:25,888
It's a normal response
that you take advantage of.

157
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:26,855
I don't like it.

158
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,922
Here we go.

159
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,655
See, even you don't want
to say anything

160
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:31,888
to hurt his tiny feelings.

161
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:33,670
I don't mean that
your feelings are tiny.

162
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,823
I mean that you have
feelings about being tiny.

163
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,243
The ramifications
and repercussions

164
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:39,336
of impeded access
will comprise

165
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,302
accommodative responses
detrimental

166
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:44,503
to your unabated participation
in our shared endeavors.

167
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,069
That's State Department speak.

168
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:49,603
"We don't do it his way,
we'll get fired."

169
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:52,603
See ? If a regular-sized person
tried to intimidate you,

170
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,469
you'd threaten to kick him
through the window,

171
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:57,469
but because in his case it's an
actual physical possibility...

172
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,469
Let's just question the judge.

173
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,469
Thank you.

174
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,169
You're welcome.

175
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,170
That was a nice
moment, you know ?

176
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,741
Me translating for you.

177
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:10,476
I was speaking with Father
Ruiz when the bomb went off.

178
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:13,475
I believe his
body protected me
from the blast.

179
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,171
I was barely touched.

180
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:17,575
Father Ruiz
was a very close
friend of ours.

181
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:20,812
Did you see this woman
at the hospitality suite

182
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,514
at the time of the explosion ?

183
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:24,166
No.
You sure ?

184
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,287
She wasn't serving drinks,
anything like that ?

185
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:29,204
The service staff were all
from the embassy.

186
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:30,464
Who is she ?

187
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:31,706
She may have
been the bomber.

188
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,369
Mr. Radziwill ?

189
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:35,249
The State Department
recognizes Judge Ramos

190
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:36,835
as a great friend
to this country

191
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:40,235
and has charged me
with keeping her apprised
of this investigation.

192
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:43,268
Did you or anyone receive
any threats

193
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:44,801
at the embassy
before the conference ?

194
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,835
We are always receiving threats.

195
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,783
It's a fact of life for us.

196
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:52,135
The government provides my wife
and our family with bodyguards.

197
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,548
We have lost loved ones
in the past.

198
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:56,884
A daughter eight years ago.

199
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:58,543
Our condolences.

200
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,698
MR. RAMOS:
Do you believe this woman
to be connected to the cartels ?

201
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:03,337
We haven't identified her yet.

202
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,009
Perhaps, Judge Ramos,
your friends

203
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,742
in Colombian law enforcement
could be of help.

204
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,408
Yes, of course.

205
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,241
Anything to aid
the investigation.

206
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:12,608
Thank you, Judge Ramos.

207
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,142
That's all for now.

208
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,809
Hey, can you upload the pictures
from this camera ?

209
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,076
Am I going to regret it ?

210
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:21,208
What kind of guy
do you think I am ?

211
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:24,042
It's just that men sometimes
think things are funny

212
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,508
that women
merely find gross.

213
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:27,975
They're pictures
of the hotel room.

214
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,675
I went there
to collect some samples.

215
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,308
See ? The heat blast deposited

216
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,341
the first layer
of residue

217
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:36,809
on the walls:
hydrocarbons.

218
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,042
The first layer ?
Yep. Layer two,

219
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,842
I had to use an electron-capture
detector to identify.

220
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,308
It was toluene and benzene;
oxidized paint

221
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,208
which just exploded
from the cans.

222
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,809
The explosion
was a two-parter ?

223
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,176
More accurately, a fire
then an explosion.

224
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:53,475
But get this:
I found a patch of wall

225
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,975
with only oxidized
paint on it.

226
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,375
Basically, a shadow.

227
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,508
See, something was
between the wall
and the fire,

228
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,208
then was gone when
the explosion occurred.

229
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,842
Think you can figure out
what it was ?

230
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,508
I can try.

231
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:05,942
Cool.

232
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:11,775
I also found these blobs
of melted something.

233
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,842
Yeah, not my department.

234
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:16,675
You're just trying to prolong
this conversation.

235
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:27,559
What do you want to know ?

236
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,142
Everything.

237
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,975
The explosion shifted
the placement of the teeth

238
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,810
in the maxilla
and mandible.

239
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,249
I've repositioned them

240
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:35,216
so that we can match
the dentals.

241
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,832
The computer is looking now.

242
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:40,383
Why do you suddenly want
to know everything ?

243
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,156
I think there's a tendency here

244
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,250
for each of us to work
too independently.

245
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,677
My closest acquaintance
outside work

246
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:48,470
is a woman I know
who's a performance artist.

247
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,325
Last month,
she enclosed herself

248
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:52,127
in a plastic box

249
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:52,847
with six rabbits.

250
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:54,914
It went over quite well.

251
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:56,914
Perhaps you've heard of her ?

252
00:09:56,981 --> 00:10:00,448
Zack, when I said "everything,"
I meant just the case.

253
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:02,847
Lisa Winokur.

254
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,214
Yeah, never heard of her.

255
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:05,281
Me, neither.

256
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,614
Isn't she the rabbit woman ?

257
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,847
No, Lisa Winokur's the woman
in the chandelier.

258
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:14,181
Oh, good. I'll let Booth
know you ID'd the victim.

259
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,048
If you'd like to know
anything else...

260
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,747
I think I'm up to speed for now,

261
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:18,589
but thanks.

262
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,448
WOMAN:
I saw about the
explosion on the news,

263
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,301
but Lisa wasn't
supposed to be working

264
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,435
at the hotel last night.

265
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,134
So I never thought she'd
be one of the casualties.

266
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,712
How long had
your daughter been
working there ?

267
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,068
Off and on, a couple of years.

268
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:39,717
Waitressing when
she needed money.

269
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,144
Tomorrow's her birthday.

270
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:44,110
I ordered the cake.

271
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,311
I thought that

272
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,743
she would spend the night out
with friends,

273
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,511
that's why she didn't come home.

274
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:55,588
She spend many nights
away from home ?

275
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,521
Lisa was a very
attractive young woman

276
00:10:58,588 --> 00:10:59,988
living with her mother.

277
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:01,354
She had boyfriends,

278
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:04,621
and yeah, sometimes
she didn't come home.

279
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:09,454
Did she have anyone special
in her life lately ?

280
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,190
Yeah, but I, I never met him.

281
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,105
I don't know his name.

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Is there anything you can tell
me about him ?

283
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:18,553
Uh... he was foreign.

284
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,920
Puerto Rican maybe.

285
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,387
She called him
"Señor Hot Stuff."

286
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,087
Maybe that was a joke.

287
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:29,286
She said he was rich.

288
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:35,887
Lisa was a really sweet girl.

289
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,121
The fire started
approximately here.

290
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:51,121
Which means that whatever cast
your reverse shadow

291
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,253
was positioned here.

292
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,553
Well, what cast
the shadow ?

293
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,253
Well, I manipulated
the images you gave

294
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,987
in order to figure out
the shape of the silhouette.

295
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:00,320
The dark areas

296
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,453
are where there was both
blowback residue from the fire

297
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,587
and the deposits of oxidized
paint left by the explosion.

298
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,021
By going in as far

299
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,754
as individual pixels,

300
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,021
I was able
to find the area

301
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:14,854
where there was only
paint residue.

302
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,620
That's a person.

303
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,253
Yeah.

304
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,286
Given the angles
and the distance
from the wall,

305
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:23,954
I'd say it's somebody
about six feet tall.

306
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:27,054
Lisa Winokur was
only five-foot four.

307
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,453
Which means whoever this was

308
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,186
got out before the actual
explosion occurred.

309
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,787
I could kiss you.

310
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,087
That would require
permission...

311
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,654
which I deny.

312
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
I'll tell Booth that
the bomber is alive
and is six-feet tall.

313
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,220
You'll tell who what ?

314
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:45,587
There's a loop, people,
and I'm in it.

315
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:48,720
Not only am I in it, I'm
the big curvy part.

316
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:51,620
* *

317
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,920
Lisa wasn't scheduled
to work last night.

318
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,087
She just came in on
her own as a customer,

319
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:57,353
picked up a guy.

320
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,087
You know anything about him ?

321
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,487
Looked Hispanic.
That's not PC

322
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,420
to say, but you want
details, right ?

323
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:03,520
Mm-hmm.

324
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:06,387
And it looked like
he had money, too.

325
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,987
How tall was he ?

326
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:12,054
I don't know, but he was
sitting when I saw him.

327
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:14,620
Look, Lisa was a good kid,

328
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,487
but she used to scope
the place for rich guys.

329
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,553
So she was a prostitute ?

330
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,654
What ?

331
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,654
No ! No, she was just
like any of us.

332
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,054
Looking for a husband, right ?

333
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:30,787
This guy last night,
she zoned in on him real hard.

334
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:33,754
Took him upstairs,
you know, for privacy.

335
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,253
Upstairs where ?

336
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,754
The room that was
being renovated.

337
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,587
The one that caught on fire.

338
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:42,320
I mean, it's against the
rules, but we've all done it.

339
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:44,087
Right.

340
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,787
I mean, why else work

341
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,720
in a high-class place
like this, right ?

342
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,253
Yeah.

343
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,021
Someone's trying
to flag you down.

344
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:55,054
Oh. Excuse me.

345
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,887
Looks like it's possible
that Lisa went upstairs

346
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:59,186
for a little quickie

347
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,387
and blundered into
a nightmare.

348
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:03,054
She was trying
to get you

349
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:04,620
to go upstairs
for a little...

350
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,520
Hey, that's the guy
that Lisa was with.

351
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:09,620
Ooh, he looks like
he could be six-feet tall.

352
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,620
Hey, let's pay him
a little visit.

353
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:12,754
MAN:
Vodka, double,
straight up.

354
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,520
Mind if we ask you
a few questions ?

355
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:22,453
Lose your friend, and maybe.

356
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,253
It's about Lisa Winokur.

357
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:26,920
Oh !

358
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,320
Okay, it's good.

359
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,920
My name is Antonio Ramos.
Call the Colombian embassy.

360
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,694
£¿£¿

361
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:56,626
£¿£¿

362
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,239
A swab shows
no trace of carbon.

363
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:01,516
So Lisa Winokur was not
breathing when the fire started.

364
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:02,371
I found semen.

365
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,072
Where ?

366
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,610
The usual place.

367
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:08,677
No, I mean, no condom ?

368
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,811
Well, the sex may not have
been consensual.

369
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,644
She was already dead
when the fire started.

370
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,144
What killed her ?

371
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,911
Too much tissue
damage for me.

372
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:18,377
Now it's time for the boneyard.

373
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:22,239
You, Zack, do your thing.

374
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:25,061
I have to ascertain if these
fractures were the result

375
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,812
of heat, explosion or trauma.

376
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:28,478
Which means I need

377
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:31,048
to know the exact nature
of the explosion.

378
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,877
How do you do that ?

379
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:36,010
The usual way.

380
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:41,576
My embassy has been informed
of my whereabouts.

381
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:42,843
I have nothing more to say.

382
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,409
Antonio Ramos.

383
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:48,610
Any relationship
to Judge Dolores Ramos ?

384
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,177
She's my mother.

385
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:52,943
This seriously calls
genetics into question.

386
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,276
You know, your mother...
is a great woman.

387
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:57,610
Have some water.

388
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:59,649
Why'd you run,
Antonio ?

389
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:02,331
In my experience,
there are two reasons

390
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,137
why people run: one...danger.

391
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,135
What's wrong with your arm ?

392
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,533
What ?

393
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:09,238
Your arm, how did you hurt it ?

394
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,819
The second reason
people run is

395
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,819
they got something
to hide, so...

396
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:15,272
You got something to hide, Tony ?

397
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,019
Compound fracture,
three or five pins in there.

398
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,319
Say, uh, six months old ?

399
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:22,186
Did you have sex
with her last night ?

400
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:23,819
Is she what this is about ?

401
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,752
Because it was her idea,
not mine.

402
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:27,286
How well do you know her ?

403
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,760
Oh, very well, and not so well,
if you know what I mean.

404
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:32,927
I don't know what he means.

405
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,493
It means that he had sex
with her

406
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,660
and forgot to learn her name.

407
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,727
Well, you say that, not me.

408
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:40,393
Well, it's not like
you, uh, exactly
have a record,

409
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,927
because you have, you know,
diplomatic immunity.

410
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:44,794
More like a list
of complaints.

411
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,360
Let's see here.

412
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:49,794
Okay, speeding, DUI, riding
a motorcycle on the Mall,

413
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,660
urinating on
a national monument;

414
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,627
substance-abuse charges,
every one of them.

415
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:58,994
My guess is you got drunk
and fell off a bicycle.

416
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,293
It was a motorcycle.

417
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,327
Agent Booth, you know

418
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:04,393
Antonio Ramos
has diplomatic immunity

419
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,961
yet you insist
on questioning him.

420
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,327
Uh, diplomatic immunity
doesn't mean

421
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,360
I can't question him.

422
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,126
It means I can't
throw him in jail.

423
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,393
Are you all right,
Tonio ?

424
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,694
Mm-hmm.

425
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,027
RADZIWILL:
Mr. Ramos, you're
free to leave.

426
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,360
Thank you.
The FBI will not
bother you anymore.

427
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:17,493
Can he promise that ?

428
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,226
No. Do you have
any other higher
aspirations

429
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:22,360
rather than just,
you know, baby-sitting
drunken playboys ?

430
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:24,226
She's dead.

431
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,694
Who ?

432
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,360
Lisa.

433
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,527
Lisa Winokur.

434
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,527
That was her name.

435
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,660
How did she die ?

436
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:38,360
In the same explosion
that nearly killed your mother.

437
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,260
Did Lisa ever mention
your parents ?

438
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,493
Agent Booth ?

439
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,093
She knew who they were.

440
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,827
Antonio, answer
no more questions.

441
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:46,226
That's enough.

442
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,193
Do you have something
to say to me, Dr. Brennan ?

443
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,126
Little people have a long
history of being close to power.

444
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,560
That's clowns and court jesters.

445
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:01,961
I see you've been
to the art museum.

446
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,327
Yes, but as

447
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:06,460
clowns and court jesters,
they were the only ones allowed

448
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,994
to mock the king,
to give him perspective.

449
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,560
You don't do that,
Mr. Radziwill.

450
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:12,994
You just do what

451
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:16,594
the king says, without putting
anything into perspective.

452
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,927
Good thing I'm neither
a clown nor a court jester.

453
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:21,927
Whoa. Don't do that.

454
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:23,393
It's DNA evidence.

455
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:28,961
The FBI couldn't
find any evidence of
an explosive charge.

456
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:30,560
Then what blew up ?

457
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:34,226
There was liquor in the room,
paint, turpentine.

458
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:36,327
Paint, turpentine
and liquor

459
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:39,027
blew down a wall,
torched four people

460
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:42,027
and deposited a corpse
in a chandelier 12
feet off the ground ?

461
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,727
There was also
a petroleum distillate

462
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:46,560
in six HVLP canisters
hidden under tarps.

463
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,860
High volume,
low pressure.

464
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,093
So, you can see
where this is going.

465
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,360
No, we can't.
No, we can't.

466
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:55,360
A fire was set.

467
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,193
The question is--
given these ingredients--

468
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,560
would there be
a secondary explosion ?

469
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:00,427
I did the math
very carefully.

470
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:03,994
This experiment should generate
an explosion approximately

471
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,961
1/1,000th the magnitude
of the explosion at the hotel.

472
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,061
Excuse me ?

473
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:09,427
1/1,000th.

474
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,961
I think she meant
the explosion part, Zack.

475
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,827
Relax. A little pop.

476
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:16,961
This blast wall Zack built
is merely a precaution.

477
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:19,760
We can watch
through this porthole.

478
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,660
Okay, I'm going
to wait outside.

479
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:23,994
I hear that.

480
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,627
Did they not hear me
say I did the math
quite carefully ?

481
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,327
I'll ignite the alcohol.

482
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:39,560
The math says
there will be a ten
to 12-second gap

483
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,160
before the HVLP
container explodes.

484
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:43,760
Fine. You ready ?

485
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:48,193
Igniting
the alcohol.

486
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,827
Ten,

487
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:53,226
nine, eight...

488
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,860
Oh ! Oh !

489
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,794
Oh !

490
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,460
Are you all right ?

491
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:03,560
Can you breathe ?

492
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,694
Hey, how many fingers
am I holding up ?

493
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm okay.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

494
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,493
I don't understand
what happened.

495
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,994
You know what
that proves ?

496
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:13,961
That you guys
are idiots.

497
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:17,126
That a blast that strong
wasn't necessarily a bomb.

498
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,961
Most likely,
somebody killed
Lisa Winokur

499
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:21,460
then started a fire
to cover up their crime.

500
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:24,093
Without knowing
there would be a
huge explosion.

501
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,694
That's good, guys.
Nice job.

502
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,360
Your theory of the crime
is that Antonio Ramos
started a fire

503
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,860
to cover up a rape
and murder.

504
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,493
DNA matches the sperm
found in Lisa Winokur.

505
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,101
What do you want
from me ?

506
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:36,972
I want you to have
the kid declared
persona non grata

507
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:38,918
because of his
previous offenses...

508
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:40,564
that gets rid of
diplomatic immunity...

509
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,078
And you can arrest him.
Exactly.

510
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:43,037
Never going to happen.

511
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,304
Right, because Judge Ramos

512
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,037
is such a good,
good friend of
this country.

513
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:47,571
I don't think
you can calculate

514
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,304
just how many American
lives she's saved

515
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,804
by taking a hard line
on the cartels in Colombia.

516
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,671
Obviously, you have orders
from the State Department

517
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,471
to have this whole diplomatic
mess booted out

518
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,237
of the United States
and back into Colombia.

519
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,371
Don't say anything,
just, you know,

520
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:01,905
if I'm right,
just keep breathing.

521
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:05,037
Bogot ? 1998.

522
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:07,337
The Ramos family is leaving
the city for their country home.

523
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,905
Their convoy is attacked.

524
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,437
End to a long, ugly story,

525
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,504
13-year-old Antonio
is running

526
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,538
away from the fight

527
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:15,005
and carrying his little sister.

528
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,070
Only trouble is, he has
to keep going back

529
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:19,437
to pick up pieces of her brain.

530
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:22,304
It's a sad story, but it doesn't
mean the guy can get drunk

531
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:25,771
and kill five people...

532
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:28,500
including an American citizen.

533
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:34,234
Yeah.

534
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,275
Booth, it's Cam.

535
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,187
We know how Lisa Winokur died.

536
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,047
She was strangled.

537
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:43,999
The hyoid is cracked
at the tips, but not burned.

538
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:46,508
Something was around her neck
when the fire got to her.

539
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:47,707
Hodgins found burned fibers.

540
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,074
He's analyzing them now.

541
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,508
I also noticed
a broken finger.

542
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,840
I'm using those words
especially for you, Booth.

543
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,241
Thanks.

544
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:59,274
Also disjunct of acromion
and coracoid with damage

545
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,807
to the glenoid;

546
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:01,974
dislocated shoulder.

547
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,174
The typical injury

548
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:04,807
of a victim on the ground
straining against

549
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:07,007
someone strangling her
from behind.

550
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,641
There was a split

551
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:11,608
in the cartilage
between the T-3
and T-4 vertebrae.

552
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,807
Excuse me.

553
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,208
I thought that might be
from the fire or explosion.

554
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:18,408
But why only those two
vertebrae ?

555
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:19,874
You make a good point.

556
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,007
I'll take another look.

557
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,341
Cam...

558
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:30,074
Cam, has anyone said
anything to you about, um... ?

559
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,575
you know ?
Us sleeping together ?

560
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:35,907
You got to be way more
careful about, you know,
blurting it out like that, okay ?

561
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,608
Voices they carry in
a building like this.

562
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:39,575
There's no one around,
and you brought it up.

563
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,174
Well, I mean, Angela is
practically psychic

564
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:43,041
about this kind of
stuff, all right ?

565
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:44,474
So you can't be
thinking about me

566
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,675
when, you know,
she's around.

567
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,675
Especially not naked.

568
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,974
I'll do my best.

569
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,675
Onyx, peridot
and Peruvian opal.

570
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,241
Probably jewelry.

571
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:54,641
It's an unusual combination,
very expensive.

572
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:58,874
Yeah, well, Lisa Winokur
I mean, she was a waitress.

573
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:01,641
I highly doubt that
her tips would be able to
cover expensive jewelry.

574
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:04,441
Well, a waitress
that's having sex

575
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,974
with a Colombian
princeling.

576
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,641
I mean, you don't buy
expensive jewelry for
a one-night stand.

577
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:11,374
And it may be Antonio was lying
about not knowing Lisa.

578
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:13,441
Exactly.
Yeah.

579
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,748
Angela found a jeweler
named Lawrence Melvoy

580
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,727
who works with
this stuff.

581
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,263
Okay...
I'll start...

582
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,830
All right, great.
Yeah.

583
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,130
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah ?

584
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:36,763
Oh, my God, what happened ?

585
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,229
Is this jewelry yours ?
Definitely.

586
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,797
Are these pieces expensive ?

587
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:42,463
This piece was worth 8,000.

588
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,463
Dollars ?

589
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,596
My work is all original.

590
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:48,030
This one went
to a young woman.

591
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:51,463
Cheap shoes,
expensive watch, you know.

592
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,663
I'm sorry, I don't know.

593
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,363
That combination
means that someone else

594
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,663
purchased this piece
for the young woman.

595
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,763
Could, uh... this be
the woman ?

596
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,064
That's her.

597
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,863
Yeah. I need to know who
made the actual purchase.

598
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,496
I don't know the buyer.

599
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,196
You know how it was paid ?

600
00:24:08,263 --> 00:24:10,329
I have a bank routing number.

601
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:12,463
Ah, that'll do.

602
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,963
Hey, I've had a realization.

603
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,396
Oh, I've never seen you
on the computer before.

604
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,697
I'm, uh... just trying
to find out

605
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:31,630
who bought Lisa Winokur
expensive jewelry.

606
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:34,196
What, me being on the computer...
is that what, your realization ?

607
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:38,630
No. Antonio Ramos could not have
been Lisa Winokur's attacker.

608
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,463
Why couldn't our prime suspect
have committed the murder ?

609
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,363
Antonio's arm has pins in it.

610
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,004
Pins ?

611
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,954
Yeah. So he's maybe 30%
of his normal strength.

612
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,590
No way that's enough to
dislocate our victim's shoulder.

613
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,420
So how ?
How what ?

614
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:54,554
How can you find the jewelry
thing on the computer ?

615
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:55,886
I have a bank routing number

616
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,487
that dead-ends at an offshore
corporate account

617
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:01,953
belonging to a shell corporation
in the Netherlands Antilles.

618
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,220
Isn't that impossible to trace ?

619
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:07,172
No. Since 9-11 all foreign wires
have to register

620
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:11,005
an individual's name
with the State Department.

621
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:13,884
So, I simply access

622
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,929
the State Department database.

623
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:24,454
Aw, hell.
What ?

624
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:28,037
that  ? ? protect someone

625
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:35,218
the computer says
"confidential"

626
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,539
then it's confidential.

627
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,957
I find it best not to
argue with computers.

628
00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:40,924
Were you the one
who authorized the block,

629
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,590
or did it come from
higher up on the food chain ?

630
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:46,429
Go through channels.
Make a request.

631
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:47,557
Go to hell, Alex.

632
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,862
Why are you being
so mean ?

633
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:50,185
'Cause "go through channels"

634
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,495
is just diplomatic
double-talk for "get lost."

635
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:53,567
Can I talk to him ?

636
00:25:52,904 --> 00:25:55,055
Hello, Dr. Brennan.

637
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:56,738
I'm just small,

638
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,627
not invisible.

639
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,924
Under what circumstances,
in general,

640
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,909
would the State Department
block a name like this ?

641
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:04,091
Come on, Alex.

642
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:07,470
Hey, don't be one of them.
Go out on a limb, huh ?

643
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:14,523
Fine.

644
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:18,216
Might be an intelligence asset
or someone under investigation.

645
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:20,405
It could be a request
from Homeland Security.

646
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,138
They just do whatever
the hell they want.

647
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,005
Could be a CIA
shell company

648
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:25,438
masquerading as a bad guy

649
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,105
or a bad guy who's been
compromised.

650
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,739
The IRS could be working
offshore shelters.

651
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,038
It could be someone...
Ha !

652
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:31,272
Ha !

653
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:32,771
He didn't say anything.

654
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:35,771
He was about to say
"diplomatic immunity."

655
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,804
Let's say the boy bought
the girl some jewelry.

656
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:39,672
That doesn't mean he killed her.

657
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,071
It means he was lying
when he said

658
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:42,505
he met her for the first time
that night.

659
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:44,372
Come on, Alex,

660
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,005
this isn't evidence
for court.

661
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,838
I'm just, you know,
collecting names.

662
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:51,071
Please. Like that's going
to work on me.

663
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:55,130
Whoever killed Lisa Winokur
is responsible

664
00:26:55,232 --> 00:26:56,514
for the deaths
of four other people,

665
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:58,932
including a priest.

666
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:01,046
Doesn't the State Department
have to assure those families

667
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,446
they're doing everything
they can

668
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:03,680
to apprehend
the responsible party ?

669
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,279
Are you threatening
the State Department ?

670
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:05,979
No.

671
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:06,680
Yes.

672
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:07,480
What ?

673
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:08,646
That's a great idea.

674
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,780
What's a great idea ?

675
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:10,782
The FBI blackmailing

676
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:11,777
the State
Department.

677
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,035
He has diplomatic immunity.

678
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:15,581
There's nothing you can do.

679
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:17,279
Come on, Alex, baby steps.

680
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:21,796
No offense.

681
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,624
I just got that.

682
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,260
It's baby steps because

683
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:28,209
you're so small.

684
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:32,409
It's probably offensive.

685
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:35,643
Sorry, I can't help you.

686
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,442
Sorry.

687
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:46,075
I brought you
some coffee.

688
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,942
It's late.

689
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:50,509
You said you found
burned silk fibers

690
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,908
on Lisa Winokur's
throat, right ?

691
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:54,376
Yeah, the good stuff, too.

692
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:56,342
Unwound filament.
Probably Chinese.

693
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,409
None of this carded,
combed, or spun stuff,

694
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,875
and definitely not nubbly.

695
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:02,142
What ?

696
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:04,875
You are a man
of odd enthusiasms.

697
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:07,376
I'm checking for
silk neckties

698
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:09,276
on the men at the party.

699
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:10,643
Look at this.

700
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,975
Yeah, that's Antonio

701
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,209
two hours before the explosion.

702
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,676
All the evidence points
towards him,

703
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,542
but Brennan says
with his bad arm

704
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:21,975
there's no way he could have
killed Lisa Winokur.

705
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,709
I know something...

706
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:29,409
and when you know it,
you should know that I know.

707
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,175
But I don't feel
we can discuss it

708
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,442
until you, you know,
know it independently from me.

709
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:38,442
Are you sniffing my hair ?

710
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,942
You called it, baby.
A man of odd enthusiasms.

711
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:48,576
Lisa Winokur's finger is broken.

712
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:51,620
Zackaroni, almost every
bone in her body was broken.

713
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:54,368
This break was
professionally set.

714
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:55,894
It had started healing.

715
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,227
I'd say around
two weeks ago.

716
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:00,894
And before I cleaned
the bones,

717
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,561
I noticed this
metallic sheen.

718
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:06,327
I thought it was
a cheap ring,
but it's aluminum.

719
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:07,894
I think it was a splint.

720
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,494
Do you draw a conclusion
from that ?

721
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,194
I don't really do that.

722
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,660
Which is why I called you.

723
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,361
I don't see how health insurance
forms can help you.

724
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,628
Yeah, I'm going to have
these photocopied, okay ?

725
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:19,727
Sure.

726
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,594
Anthropologically speaking,

727
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,394
a man gives a woman
a gift as a way
of laying claim.

728
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:50,594
As a way of marking her
as his

729
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,427
to the other males
in the community.

730
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:56,394
All I know is, he gave her
nice things.

731
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,027
When he started talking about
breaking it off,

732
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:00,760
we were both surprised.

733
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,094
They were breaking up ?

734
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:06,628
I told her not to give up
that easy.

735
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:09,394
I told her that when it comes
down to it,

736
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:10,760
a man like this,

737
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:13,727
who's rich,
sophisticated,

738
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:16,660
he'll do the right thing by you.

739
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:19,894
You advised your daughter
to get pregnant ?

740
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,860
It sounds bad,

741
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:26,394
but there's no reason for Lisa
to live the life I led.

742
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:32,580
Please tell me my daughter
wasn't murdered

743
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,667
because I told her
to get pregnant.

744
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:41,469
Excuse me.

745
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,634
Bones, can I talk to you
for a moment ?

746
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,224
Um...

747
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,391
Excuse me.

748
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,758
What did you
do to her ?

749
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:56,157
I don't know.

750
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:57,625
Hospital admission forms.
What about them ?

751
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,157
Look at the signature
of the person

752
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,891
who dropped Lisa off
at the emergency room.

753
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,785
Juan Vasco Ramos.

754
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,617
That's Antonio's father.

755
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:06,175
Lisa was having an affair

756
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:08,141
with the Judge's
husband, not her son.

757
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,575
And he was leaving her.

758
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:10,642
How do you know that ?

759
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,308
She advised her daughter
to get pregnant when

760
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,741
it looked like Juan Ramos
was about to dump her.

761
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,941
Yeah, Lisa sees
the boy drunk,

762
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,408
decides to seduce him...

763
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:22,642
Has unprotected sex in an
effort to get pregnant.

764
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,008
Dad finds out, and suddenly
the troublesome girlfriend

765
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:26,808
is worth killing.

766
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,233
She's worried that her advice
got her daughter killed.

767
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,303
Yeah, she's
probably right.

768
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,278
I'll tell you what,
I'm going to call Radziwill,

769
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,694
and have him bring Dad in
for questioning.

770
00:31:35,132 --> 00:31:36,664
Oh, you know what...

771
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,198
I should leave you
alone more often.

772
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:46,931
Good morning.

773
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,031
Where's Juan Ramos ?

774
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,859
He declined your invitation.
He decided to go

775
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:52,209
back home
to Colombia.
What airline ?

776
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,801
Why ? You can't do
anything anyway.

777
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,768
He killed five people.

778
00:31:56,835 --> 00:31:59,868
Yes, yes, let's not go through
the mortality list again.

779
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,868
I need to know what airline.

780
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:06,935
Private jet out
of Kent Island Airport.

781
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:09,636
<i>Even if we get there on time,</i>

782
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,768
how are we going to stop
them from taking off ?

783
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,835
All right, call Hodgins.

784
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,202
What can Hodgins do ?

785
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,535
I mean, this isn't
about evidence.

786
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,202
Just give him a call.

787
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:22,235
Bugs, slime, particulates,
what's your poison ?

788
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:23,901
Hodgins, just listen.

789
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:26,068
Don't say anything.
Just do as I ask.

790
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,335
You there ?

791
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:29,968
You told me not
to say anything.

792
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,168
Look, okay, listen to me.

793
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:32,868
All right, I need
you in your craziest

794
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:35,569
most paranoid conspiracy mode

795
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:39,502
to call the FAA and tell them
that a private flight to Bogot ?

796
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:42,068
is about to leave
Kent Island Private Airport

797
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:44,935
and is carrying aliens
or terrorists or, you know...

798
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:46,235
You know what to do.

799
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:47,669
Now, do you got any questions ?

800
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:48,768
Just one.

801
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:50,302
Full-court press ?

802
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,435
No holds barred,
maximum effort ?

803
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,235
Just stop the plane
from taking off.

804
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:58,835
FBI.

805
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:00,469
Everybody out of the plane.

806
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:01,736
Hodgins really came through.

807
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:03,935
That plane ain't going
anywhere real soon.

808
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:06,002
What will happen
to Hodgins

809
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,736
if the State
Department finds out ?

810
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,661
You know what ?

811
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,644
that they don't find out

812
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:22,292
The FAA got a call saying Judge
Ramos' plane had been targeted

813
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,020
by the National Liberation Army,

814
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:26,067
a terrorist organizationin Columbia.

815
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,873
And you took it
seriously ?

816
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,139
The caller used a highly-
classified code phrase,

817
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:31,573
which established the
threat as authentic.

818
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,706
Really ?

819
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:33,940
A highly-classified code phrase

820
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:37,506
known only to a gold-plated
asset inside

821
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,472
the terrorist
organization.
If it weren't,

822
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,040
I might suspect
you had something to do with it.

823
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,439
Booth,

824
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:45,105
you seem to have
trouble accepting

825
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:46,606
that there is
absolutely nothing

826
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:48,706
you can do in these
circumstances.

827
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:51,506
Well, Juan Ramos just,
you know, flying out of here--

828
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,940
this whole diplomatic
immunity thing--

829
00:33:53,006 --> 00:33:54,806
the whole thing just stinks.

830
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,673
You should think it stinks,
too, Mr. Radziwill.

831
00:33:58,317 --> 00:33:59,451
Put together your evidence
package.

832
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:00,917
Submit it to State.

833
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:02,783
We'll present it
to the Columbian authorities,

834
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,650
let them decide whether
or not to levy charges.

835
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:06,689
Wait, wait. That's our
only option ?

836
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:09,134
Hope that a foreign government
will lay charges

837
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:10,832
based on a forensics-heavy
investigation

838
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:13,277
done by American law enforcement
on another continent ?

839
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,745
Unless you can persuade him

840
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:18,651
to give up diplomatic immunity,
yes, it's our only option.

841
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:20,863
How long have we got to do that ?
About as long as

842
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:24,083
it takes to take apart a plane
and put it back together again.

843
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:25,505
Maybe
24 hours.

844
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:26,771
<i>You're the one who said</i>

845
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:29,004
you have to be kept up
to date on everything.

846
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:31,271
When I said "everything,"
I might have been a bit too...

847
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,505
You tend to be
very literal.

848
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,538
Thermal dislocation
can be extremely deceptive.

849
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:38,338
Typically, heat causes short
bones to move at the ends.

850
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,904
These were split
in the middle.

851
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,138
What ?

852
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:45,438
Brennan !

853
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:46,572
Whoa. What'd I do ?

854
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:48,505
T-3 and T-4
are behind the lungs.

855
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:50,971
This is why we have
to communicate more, because...

856
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:53,704
I have a cell phone,
Dr. Saroyan.

857
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:55,737
I found evidence
of a perforation

858
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,438
in the membrane
of her lungs.

859
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:01,038
That could be connected to the
T-3 and T-4 vertebrae damage.

860
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:02,338
Exactly
what I thought.

861
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:03,638
Could it have
been pierced

862
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:04,871
by a rib
during the attack ?

863
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,971
The ribs were not
broken pre-explosion.

864
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,572
The vertebrae
were pushed apart,

865
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:11,538
so they'd slide across
the lung surface.

866
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:13,837
That would
cause a tear.

867
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,338
No, this is
definitely
a puncture.

868
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,938
Whatever pierced
the membrane

869
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:18,171
was forced
through the vertebrae.

870
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:19,205
A knife ?

871
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:20,238
Zack ?

872
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:21,538
No cuts on the bone.

873
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:23,205
Something softer than a blade.

874
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,538
To reach the lung
from the back

875
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,205
means moving through
the epidermis,

876
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:29,737
dermis, hypodermis,
subcutaneous fat

877
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,837
and three layers
of thoracic muscle fiber

878
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:33,572
and connective tissue,
not to mention

879
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:34,871
splitting
those vertebrae.

880
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:36,938
That requires
a great deal of pressure,

881
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:39,904
suggesting the force of a leg,
not an arm.

882
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,837
It's as though Juan Ramos
drove something

883
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:45,572
into Lisa Winokur's back
with his foot.

884
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:47,071
Like a golf tee ?

885
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:48,904
A golf tee ?

886
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:50,271
That makes no sense.

887
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:52,138
I'm not sure
what we're
looking for.

888
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:53,505
A sharp
implement.

889
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,171
He has a pen in his pocket.

890
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:57,505
Wait. How would he
force a pen...

891
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,305
through her back with his foot ?

892
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:02,605
Judge Ramos is five-foot-nine ?

893
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:04,538
Yeah.
Why is she

894
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:08,737
the same height
as her husband ?

895
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:10,238
Three-inch stiletto heels.

896
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:13,538
We assumed the killer
was six feet tall

897
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,471
and a he, but what if it was
a five-foot-nine woman

898
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:18,538
wearing three-
inch heels ?

899
00:36:18,605 --> 00:36:21,138
Could Judge Ramos
have driven her heel

900
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:23,004
<i>into Lisa Winokur's back</i>

901
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:25,004
as she strangled her ?

902
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,205
Judge finds out that the
waitress is having sex with

903
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,837
both her husband
and her son

904
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:30,837
trying to get pregnant,
that's motive for murder.

905
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:33,638
Also, before the fire,

906
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,971
she has a beautiful
silk wrap on.

907
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:38,638
Afterwards, it's gone.

908
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:40,672
That's what she used
to strangle Lisa Winokur.

909
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:41,672
Great.

910
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:43,338
It was Judge Ramos. She did it.

911
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,605
Very compelling
evidence.

912
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,672
Excellent, but, you know what ?

913
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:48,971
Too bad. It's useless.

914
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:50,638
Unless...

915
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:51,971
we can find a way

916
00:36:52,038 --> 00:36:54,338
to make Judge Ramos
waive her diplomatic immunity.

917
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,271
How we gonna do that ?

918
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,371
Go grab a cup
of coffee.

919
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:04,004
I'll figure it out.

920
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,572
Get some pie, Bones ?
Let's get some pie.

921
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:07,505
Pie. We're having
coffee and pie.

922
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,605
Cherry pie on Friday.

923
00:37:12,971 --> 00:37:16,471
Oh, yeah, baby...that's
what I'm talking about.

924
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:17,737
Wow.

925
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:22,205
Hey, love is in the
purified and ionized lab air.

926
00:37:22,271 --> 00:37:24,171
Why should we resist ?

927
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:25,871
Go.

928
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:30,904
A woman like Judge Ramos
who stood up to drug cartels,

929
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:32,338
who always did
the right thing,

930
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:35,305
it's hard to imagine her
killing another human being.

931
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,405
Bones, she's a strong woman.

932
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,104
That's why she stood up
to the cartels,

933
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:40,238
you know, live on after
her daughter was killed.

934
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:42,205
Hey, look,
her point of view,

935
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:44,505
Lisa Winokur was
threatening her family.

936
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,371
So...she snapped.

937
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,338
Will she get away with it ?

938
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:50,238
Yeah.

939
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:53,038
I think she will.

940
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,704
Okay, we all
got together...

941
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,572
well, Zack wouldn't help
until I threatened him...

942
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:59,938
but the rest of us.

943
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,438
The blowback pattern

944
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,605
shows that Lisa
Winokur's killer

945
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:05,471
was six feet tall...
Antonio Ramos

946
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,071
is six feet tall.

947
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:10,438
Lisa Winokur had
sex immediately
before her demise.

948
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:14,205
DNA tests show it was
with Antonio Ramos.

949
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:17,572
Lisa Winokur was strangled
with a silk ligature.

950
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:19,938
Antonio Ramos
favors silk ties.

951
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:22,704
Why are you manipulating
the facts to make it sound

952
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:23,904
like Antonio was the killer ?

953
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:24,904
It's okay, Bones.

954
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,171
Let her... Let her continue.

955
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,138
Because of
his broken arm,

956
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,837
Antonio Ramos was forced
to place his foot

957
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:32,938
on Lisa Winokur's back,

958
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:33,938
damaging her vertebrae.

959
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,238
You are fabricating

960
00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:37,405
this scenario by
misrepresenting the evidence

961
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:39,572
and omitting key facts.

962
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:41,737
It's a bluff.
Cops do it all the time.

963
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:45,171
So you think if we frame
Antonio, Judge Ramos will...

964
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:48,572
confess to save her own son.

965
00:38:48,638 --> 00:38:49,771
What mother wouldn't ?

966
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:51,871
Bones ?

967
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,038
No.

968
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:54,104
No.

969
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:55,505
It's no different than lying

970
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,238
to a criminal
to get a confession.

971
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:59,871
Or having Hodgins call the FAA
with a fake terrorism tip.

972
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,804
<i>He did what ?</i>

973
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,938
Oh, what ? Now, suddenly
there's a line here ?

974
00:39:04,004 --> 00:39:05,038
You can't allow this.

975
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:06,104
I'm 100% against this.

976
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:08,096
Seeley, you hate
diplomatic immunity.

977
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,104
Well, I'm against it
when it's interfering

978
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,800
with my murder investigation,

979
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,133
but the world's
bigger than that.

980
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,000
What are you talking about ?

981
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:16,234
We cheat diplomatic immunity
here in DC,

982
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,933
we catch a murderer,
that's great.

983
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,234
They do it in Upper Kamikazistan

984
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,933
and our boys end up
on a red-hot spit

985
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,067
over a slow fire.

986
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,366
There's no such place
as Kamikazistan.

987
00:39:25,433 --> 00:39:27,234
Okay. Bottom line is,
we ignore diplomatic immunity

988
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,900
and the rest of the world
finds out,

989
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,666
it's open season
on Americans, so--

990
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,234
you know what ?

991
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,366
Thanks for the effort,

992
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:35,366
and the fake file, but...

993
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,466
Let's just remember,
okay, that...

994
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:38,933
we're the good guys.

995
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,566
Oh, I'm gonna need that
real evidence file, too.

996
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:42,833
Okay.

997
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:50,900
Even if this were true...

998
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:51,900
It's true.

999
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:53,933
My family and I have
diplomatic immunity.

1000
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,334
That's politics.

1001
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:58,234
A woman like you,
a judge, a prosecutor,

1002
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,466
who's given up their whole life

1003
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,234
for justice,

1004
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,766
you can't live with what
you did to Lisa Winokur.

1005
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,167
What next ?

1006
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:13,700
The FBI formally hands
this evidence over to me.

1007
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,167
I present it
to the ambassador.

1008
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:16,600
He presents it to the
attorney general

1009
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,234
of Colombia.
And the State
Department

1010
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,399
gets what it wants,

1011
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,833
what you've been
working for all along...

1012
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,933
This mess in another country.

1013
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,766
All parties played by the rules.
That's diplomacy.

1014
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,566
Still,

1015
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:33,100
speaking outside
of my role

1016
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,666
as a member of the
State Department,

1017
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,366
the attorney general of Colombia
is not a friend to you.

1018
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:38,566
No.

1019
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:39,800
He is not.

1020
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:41,967
This evidence is
political ammunition.

1021
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,733
I mean, there will
almost certainly

1022
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,334
be a trial,
and he would

1023
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,800
most certainly want you in jail,
which would mean...

1024
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:50,466
The cartels have been trying
to kill me for years.

1025
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:54,267
In prison, they would
succeed on the first day.

1026
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:57,466
They'll torture
and kill you.

1027
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:00,800
Might I make a suggestion ?

1028
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,466
Waive your diplomatic immunity.

1029
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:06,300
And be tried fairly,
here, in the United States.

1030
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:17,399
What's it gonna be, Judge ?

1031
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:22,399
I turn this evidence over
to an American prosecutor ?

1032
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:23,933
Or Mr. Radziwill ?

1033
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,167
I waive
diplomatic immunity.

1034
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:55,267
Well... look at them
down there, huh ? Ha !

1035
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:57,933
Probably falsifying evidence.

1036
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,600
I'm not sure I can totally
trust Dr. Saroyan after that.

1037
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,600
You know, Bones,

1038
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:06,933
Cam's a cop at heart.

1039
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,267
She, uh... she just wants
to catch the bad guys.

1040
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:13,700
There are a lot of gray areas.

1041
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:15,733
Not for you.

1042
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,234
You did the right thing.

1043
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,433
Yeah.

1044
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,600
It worked out, is all.

1045
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,200
You did the right thing.

1046
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:30,334
Uh-oh.

1047
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,167
Well, shouldn't we do something ?

1048
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,499
You kidding ?

1049
00:42:38,566 --> 00:42:41,300
Hodgins being abducted

1050
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:42,967
by men in black ?

1051
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:45,000
It's a dream come true.

1052
