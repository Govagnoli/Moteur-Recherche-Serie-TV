1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:03,313
As far back as 1938,

2
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:06,116
the director of the FBI,
J. Edgar Hoover,

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:09,435
wrote to the then-curator
of the Jeffersonian Institution,

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:13,622
Professor Daniel Payne, to
aid in the evaluation of

5
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:16,374
specimens Hoover thought
to be irrefutably human.

6
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:17,889
This was the result.

7
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:26,633
Despite this early disagreement, the FBI and
the Jeffersonian have forged a mutually beneficial,

8
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:32,028
if someone tense relationship,
which survives to this day.

9
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:33,252
Thank you.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,897
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

11
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:40,674
Are there any questions?
Yes?

12
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:43,487
How much money have you made
from your book?

13
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:47,348
I don't really know. I haven
accountant and an agent...

14
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:51,267
That's not really the kind of question we're
looking for from an anthropology student.

15
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,233
Yes?

16
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:55,039
Did you get your agent
before or after you wrote the book?

17
00:00:55,074 --> 00:01:00,990
People, Dr. Brennan is an accomplished forensic
anthropologist who writes books on the side.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,056
I have a question

19
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:06,316
regarding the role of the FBI in your book.
Who do you base brilliant and insightful

20
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,317
Special Agent Andy Lister on?

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,858
Oh, for God's sake.

22
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:12,104
'Cause, you know,
pretty sure it was me.

23
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:14,012
What are you doing here, Booth?

24
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:18,081
Local police got an anonymous call
saying that there were human remains

25
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:21,735
in a field behind a mall
out in the suburbs.

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,123
I did an anthropological profile
of the suburbs as a grad student.

27
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:29,690
The whole notion of a created community; a modern
utopia with its own mores and rules--

28
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,691
it's fascinating.

29
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:32,099
Fascinating to who?

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,938
- To whom.
- Whom...

31
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,390
You gotta be kiddin' me.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,356
What? My publishers
gave it to me.

33
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,547
Gave it to you?

34
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:42,498
Yeah. Book sales are pretty good.
It's supposed to be a nice car.

35
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:44,322
- Gave it to you?!
- Yeah!

36
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,667
Well, why'd you
park crooked?

37
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,537
Well, the guy said
to always park it like that.

38
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,626
He's wrong. Makes you look
like an idiot.

39
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,053
How about I drive for once?

40
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,484
No, I cannot show up at
a crime scene in that.

41
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:56,200
Why?!

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,163
Because it would detract from
the gravity of my FBI presence.

43
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:02,178
Especially if
you parked crooked.

44
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:06,651
Why is the FBI involved in the search for
human remains behind a suburban mall?

45
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,519
'Cause this boy is missing.

46
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:12,602
A child.

47
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:13,799
Yeah!

48
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:20,223
Anonymous call came in a couple
hours ago. No sign of him yet.

49
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,667
How do you know it wasn't a prank?

50
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,443
You have to come right away!

51
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:29,272
There's, like, a dead kid here, all ed arotty!
It's in a field behind Clayton Hills Mall.

52
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:30,273
you better come!

53
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:31,566
That ring is true.

54
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,581
Why anonymous?

55
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,985
Kids come here to party,
misbehave...

56
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:39,038
Adolescents and pre-adolescents
tend to seek out their own space

57
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:43,064
to establis their own society;
to counter parental influence.

58
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:45,214
You mind if I make
an observation?

59
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,582
No, of course not.

60
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:51,051
In your book, the cops come off as
very one-dimensional. Why is that?

61
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,383
You mean two-dimensional.

62
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:56,249
One-dimensionality exists only in theory,
as a mathematical value.

63
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,082
Okay.

64
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,232
Really looking forward
to your next book.

65
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:05,495
PDid you bring
the thermal imager?

66
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,914
I don't think
we need it.

67
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,824
It mak me look like
e Great Gazoo.

68
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:12,499
I don'know what that means,
but we definitely need it, Zack.

69
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:19,409
How's it going there,
Darth?

70
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,619
Anything on Saturn?

71
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,515
Aw, please tell me you've seen
at least one Star Wars movie.

72
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:28,642
When I was seven.
And leave Zack alone.

73
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,178
Can we please hurry up?
It's stuffy in here.

74
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:34,324
I should be able to see any heat residue
released from decomposing bodies.

75
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:37,115
Party Central.

76
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:42,927
Because suburbs are so homogeneous, adolescents
tend to rebel in predictable and uniform ways:

77
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:46,966
Fire, ilcit substances,
wayward behavior...

78
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:50,328
You think that wayward behavior would
include abducting a six-year-old child?

79
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,845
That's pretty extreme. Adolescents
are more likely to drink alcohol

80
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:57,246
and listen to culturally inappropriate
music at high volum

81
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,160
I'm picking something up.

82
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,158
Oh, my God...

83
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,950
What?

84
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:07,064
Why'd you stop?

85
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,727
You can turn on
your flashlight.

86
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:12,332
Aim it over here.

87
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:28,886
Bones 1x05
A boy in a Bush

88
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:32,741
Trancript: cfsmp3
Sync: Narkond


92
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:57,144
Before proceeding with maceration,
any general observations?

93
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,128
Zack?

94
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:02,907
Epiphyses fusion puts the age at 
approximately six to ten years

95
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:04,938
though the stature
suggests younger.

96
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,735
Good. I concord.
Cause of death?

97
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,544
Blunt trauma to the chest.

98
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,948
Are you all right?

99
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:17,839
He... he's so small.
That's all.

100
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,246
Go on with your
work; I'm okay.

101
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,839
The remains were significantly degraded
by insect and animal activity--

102
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,312
mostly dog and rodent.

103
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,313
Despite the condition of the body,
he's been dead only 36 and 48 hour

104
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,752
These were found a few
yards from the body.

105
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:35,735
Noce thatithey are in perfect condition.
What does that tell you?

106
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,949
The victim wasn't wearing them
when he was killed.

107
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,460
Which suggests he was
sexually assaulted.

108
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:43,148
I'm done.

109
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:49,503
I think we have a match.

110
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,781
The clothing matches.

111
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,942
It's Charles Gregory Sanders.

112
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:02,249
On behalf of the FBI, we're extremely
sorry for the loss of your son.

113
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:05,519
And I have a few questions,
I mean only if you're up to it.

114
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:09,530
You have two other sons?

115
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,463
Foster sons...though I try not
to make the distinction.

116
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:16,269
Sean and David Cook.
They are brothers.

117
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,033
I live right next door.

118
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:19,646
Charlie was your own?

119
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,463
Yes...Charlie was mine.

120
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,651
What about Mr. Sanders?

121
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,844
We divorced shortly before
Charlie was even born.

122
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,750
He works overseas.

123
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,798
He doesn´t even send
child support.

124
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:36,864
You mind if ask how you afford
this nice neighborhood?

125
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:42,138
Child Services wouldn't allow
a single mother to foster

126
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,792
if she worked...

127
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,856
I live off the proceeds of a generous
trust fund my parents set up long ago.

128
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:53,803
And the day that Charlie disappeared,
all three boys went to the park.

129
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:57,633
It's two blocks away. It's a very safe
neighborhood. They walk farther to school.

130
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,045
We all keep an eye out
for each other around here.

131
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,406
People are good neighbors.
Take an interest.

132
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,412
Mom?

133
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:05,614
In here, Skyler.

134
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,015
This is my son Skyler.

135
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:10,102
Dad told me to bring the boys back.
We've got to go on a job.

136
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:11,608
There's nothing
to do here.

137
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,162
Our video game's broke.

138
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:17,887
Sean, David, This is Agent Booth.

139
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,594
He's going to find out
what happened to Charlie.

140
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:21,843
How you gonna figure it out?

141
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,177
Oh, I'm in the FBI.

142
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,513
We always figure it out.

143
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:31,059
Boys, I mean, if it's all right with your mother,
maybe I could help you out with your video game.

144
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,309
This are invitations
to a banquet.

145
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,279
You called a special meeting
to invite us to a party?

146
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:49,482
Don't think of it as an invitation,
consider it a summons.

147
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:51,132
It's for donors.

148
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,492
Meet and greet,
press the flesh, butt-kiss...

149
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:58,117
I don't like it any more than you do,
but these people fund our rrch,

150
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:01,801
and all they want in return is to rub elbows
with a scientist every once in a while.

151
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,305
Can't make it.

152
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:04,260
Yeah, me, neither.

153
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:06,011
I have a date
that night.

154
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:07,969
You don't even know
when it is.

155
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:10,682
yes, Mr Addy?

156
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,430
What kind of food
will there be?

157
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:16,266
When I said you should think of this
invitation as a summons, I understated.

158
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:20,757
It's a subpoena. A grand jury subpoena.
Ignore it at your own peril.

159
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,812
You´re not gonna fire us
if we don't go.

160
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:28,030
No, not fire you, but I can move your
parking spot to Lot M. Enjoy the shuttle ride.

161
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,517
The shuttle smells like feet.

162
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,414
I know when I'm beat.
I'm in.

163
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:34,570
What the hell?
It's a party.

164
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:35,627
Do I have to wear a tie?

165
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:38,496
Formal wear. I've arranged for a limo
to pick us up from here.

166
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:41,651
Not me. I'm not afraid
of parking or feet.

167
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,845
Wait... you drive me to work.
You can't just think of yourself.

168
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:49,757
Repercussions and consequences, Dr. Hodgins.
I'm your boss and you will go tthis banquet.

169
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,779
Do you know what you're doing?

170
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,797
I can fix anything.

171
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:02,897
Cool

172
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,821
So, you guys, uh...
you guys have girlfriends?

173
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,536
- I do.
- Her name is Leila.

174
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,807
Leila? Leila...

175
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,996
I thought you were going to
ask us questions about Charlie.

176
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:17,317
Yeah, so which one of you puny mortals
wants to challenge me first?

177
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:18,428
Oh, me!

178
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,592
You about to clean the bones?

179
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,741
Yes. I'm warming up
the boiler now.

180
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:33,845
Something wrong?

181
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,162
These are the smallest remains
I've ever worked on.

182
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:42,830
That's a valid observation, Zack,
but it's not helpful to the investigation.

183
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,714
Sorry, Dr. Brennan.

184
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,866
I was at Waco. Br Davian
compound.

185
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:56,200
I helped identify children
who had been killed in the fire.

186
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:59,921
17 of them.

187
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:02,563
So, you're saying
I'll get used  it?

188
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,752
No...I'm saying
you'll never get used to it.

189
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:10,501
We're primates. Social creatures. It's coded
into our DNA to protect our young,

190
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,345
Even from each other.

191
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,154
So I'm always
going to feel terrible?

192
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:22,108
What helps me is to pull back emotionally.
Just... put your heart in a box.

193
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:26,514
I'm not good with metaphor,
Dr. Brennan.

194
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:30,473
Focus on the details.

195
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:32,162
Details-- yeah, I can do that.

196
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:38,245
No trauma to the skull,
no compound fractures.

197
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,130
Charlie was not beaten to death,
or dismembered.

198
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,239
It helps not to refer
to the victim by name.

199
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:50,595
Green stick fractures on ribs
four, five, six and seven,

200
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:54,878
and the sternum is snapped transversely
from the tip to the xyphoid.

201
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:56,486
Okay, what does
that indicate?

202
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,776
The victim's chest was struck
by a heavy, blunt object.

203
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,323
Are you completely certain
we've learned everything we can

204
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:04,398
from the body at this stage
of decomposition?

205
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:06,778
I've been over everything
at least three times.

206
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:08,871
Smell the mouth.

207
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,794
Anything behind the typical
smells of decomposition?

208
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,453
Some kind of chemical?
Chloroform?

209
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:22,743
Something used
to render the boy unconscious?

210
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:26,103
Take samples from the mouth,
jaw, sinuses and...

211
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:28,852
what's left of the esophagus.

212
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:33,492
Kids make it harder, Zack.

213
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,863
All right, look,
you beat me bad!

214
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,219
No wonder you don't
have a girlfriend!

215
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,000
David!

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,920
It's okay, Mrs. Sanders. That's all right.
No, I do have a girlfriend.

217
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,338
She pretty?

218
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:51,983
Nah. She's butt-ugly.

219
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,916
She's got one glass eye,
and ugly back teeth.

220
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:59,026
Now, was Leila with you the day
that Charlie disappeared?

221
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:03,205
Uh... yeah, actually. We stopped and
played some video games at the arcade.

222
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:06,024
That must've been before you and
Charlie went to the park.

223
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,775
You didn't go to the mall
that day, David.

224
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:11,920
Sean?

225
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,486
Don't ask Sean, Mom.

226
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:18,272
You met Leila at
the mall, didn't you?

227
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,706
You left Charlie with
Sean at the park.

228
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,451
Well, just for a few minutes and
ten they came back to the mall.

229
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:27,381
David!

230
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,685
Sean let go of his hand for a second
Charlie was gone like that!

231
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,186
And then we came
straight home!

232
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:37,838
Charlie wasn't taken from the park,
he was snatched from the mall.

233
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,439
We've been looking in the wrong place

234
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:43,268
Come on Son.

235
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:55,664
What's with
the rubber band?

236
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:00,070
Methyl oxide vapor in this chamber
will bind whatever compound

237
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,959
Charlie breathed in
before he was killed.

238
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,174
Ouch!

239
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:07,442
It's an anger management tecnique, right?

240
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:09,719
The key there is management.
This is what I'm doing.

241
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:11,726
Managing my anger.

242
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:16,718
There'll be a color change. Red for pnictogens
and chalcogens and blue for halogens.

243
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,861
I get that you're
a little off-kilter.

244
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:22,550
Mad at the government, conspiracy of
dunces-- all that.

245
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:26,118
Maybe even furious that you've had
to mount a littly's jawbone inside a box

246
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,080
to find out
what killed him.

247
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:31,768
Wh I don't get is why going to a
banquet makes you angry.

248
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,033
Halogens it is.

249
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:38,261
I'm going to scrape off the particles
and see if the mass spectrometer

250
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,262
can identify what type
of halogen.

251
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:43,655
Anger is only
turned inwards.

252
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,761
There are 20 surveillance cameras taking stills
every two seconds throughout the mall,

253
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,225
including access corridors
and parking lots.

254
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,986
I concentrated on the ones
aimed at the public concourse.

255
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,112
Okay, 10,000 people a day
go through that mall.

256
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,762
How we going
to find one small kid?

257
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:09,378
Angela designed a mass
recognition program

258
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,448
to apply body types
to skeletal remains.

259
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,284
Endomorph, ectomorph, mesomorph--
that sort of thing.

260
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,741
I modified it to scan
two-dimensional images.

261
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:22,180
In this case, we're looking for body masses
roughly congruent with Charlie, Sean and David

262
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:24,134
There's David.

263
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,163
You're actually one of them, aren't you?

264
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:27,905
One of who?

265
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:32,884
The squint. You look normal, and you act
normal, but you're actually one of them.

266
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:36,804
This whole mass recognition program
was Brennan's idea.

267
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:39,485
I'm completely
normal. Really.

268
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:42,524
Yeah. Maybe before
you got this job but, well...

269
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:44,928
I see Charlie.

270
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:49,493
Whoa. That's him, all right.

271
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,197
Oh God

272
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:53,187
Ang...

273
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:55,162
are you okay?

274
00:14:55,162 --> 00:15:00,183
These are probably the last pictures
of this little guy alive.

275
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,013
Why is he alone?
Why isn't anybody with him?

276
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,996
Sorry. Max resolution
is X-40 by 480 pixels per inch

277
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:14,884
He's not alone.
Someone's calling him over.

278
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,304
Can't you just zoom in?

279
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,010
The fewer pixels that make up an
image, the more

280
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,570
the picture degrades
once we zoom in on it.

281
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,359
Did that sound too squinty?

282
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:25,530
Any way to enhance it?

283
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,516
Well, I wouldn't bet a date
with Colin Farrell on it.

284
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:30,231
I know him. He's funny.

285
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,717
Funny is Will Ferrell, sweetie.
Hot is Collin Farell.

286
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,838
Look, the kid was definitely
moving towards someone, all right?

287
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:40,354
He wasn't struggling, he wasn't
trying to get away. You know, I wanna add

288
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,558
the neighborhood kids...Skyler and Nelson
to the list of possible suspects.

289
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:47,678
I have one other angle, but our
bad guy is still obstructed in it.

290
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,307
Who the hell are you?

291
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,811
Are you thinking of leaving the
Jeffersonian?

292
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:13,905
I'm not really this person.

293
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,631
What person?

294
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,412
I'm not like you.

295
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:21,415
I'm not driven by the need
for justice and all that.

296
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,830
I'm a good-time girl.

297
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:26,740
We have good times.

298
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:31,692
Cracking jokes over murdered skeletons
is not good times.

299
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,438
I know it's harder on you
than it is for the rest of us.

300
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:37,117
No, it's not.

301
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,016
Why?

302
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,103
Because you look
at their faces.

303
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,069
We look at everything else.
It's more clinical for us.

304
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:48,719
For you it...

305
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:52,874
it's personal. When we see a
murdered child...

306
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:56,115
Honey, I...I'm...No offense.

307
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,444
I'm really not up for one of you
"It takes a village" anthropology lessons.

308
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,512
This is the longest
I've ever had a job.

309
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:07,106
That's because of you.

310
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,985
If this is about hours or time
to do your own art, then...

311
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,870
Just let me work on it, okay?

312
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:18,275
I'm an artist.

313
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,770
I used to draw naked guys.

314
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:23,508
Now I draw dead guys.

315
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,938
Just don't decide anything
without talking to me.

316
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:30,937
Of course I won't.

317
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:49,353
I'm afraid Angela
might quit.

318
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,638
Amazed she stuck it out
this long.

319
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:52,247
Why?

320
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,055
Oh, because she's human.

321
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:56,643
I'm sorry, Bones,
it's just that, you know,

322
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:02,166
uh, Angela didn't get the same training
that the rest of you got on, uh, Planet Vulcan.

323
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:03,856
I don't know
what that means.

324
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,056
She's more sensitive.

325
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,197
- Who's more sensitive?
- Angela.

326
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:09,326
She like puppies and kitties and
ducklings and,

327
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:13,525
you know, Jell-O shots,
and, you know, dancing on bars.

328
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,940
I know that. She´s my best friend.

329
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,233
And Angela's not the only person
in the world who likes baby animals.

330
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,361
I never got the big attraction.

331
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:24,880
I rest my case.
She's more sensitive.

332
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,319
We cross-referenced the length and density of
Charlie's leg bones with other children his age.

333
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,259
The victim, I mean.

334
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,841
The thing to do is concentrate
on the details.

335
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:42,365
Let's do that.

336
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,516
We found some abnormalities.
They're bowed and abnormally short.

337
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,429
Also, the victims bones show freezing
of the joints at the hip and knee.

338
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,023
What you saying
Charlie was crippled?

339
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:54,061
The victim was disabled, yes.

340
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,322
His mother never mentioned that.

341
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:59,710
The ribs are broken in two places,
which is not typical of blunt foce trauma.

342
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,893
How do you explain that?

343
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:04,941
I attribute it to his medical condition and
the corresponding brittleness of his bones.

344
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:07,043
I agree. What is that condition?

345
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:10,901
It looks like scoliosis.
A bend in the spine.

346
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:16,563
I think it's more
than that, Zack.

347
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:20,551
There are multiple calcified lesions
on the posterior thoracic vertebrae.

348
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,090
That plus Charlie's short stature

349
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,137
and the asymmetric length  his legs.

350
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,068
Margaret Sanders may not be
Charlie's biological mother.

351
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:31,593
What?

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,143
Test the bones for X link type of
hypophosphatemia and Coffin-Lowry syndrome.

353
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,009
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, hold on.

354
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:42,766
USimmer down, just back up to
the part where she's not his mother.

355
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:46,137
Dr. Brennan is having me check
for hereditary genet defects

356
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:48,321
which are always passed
from mother to child.

357
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,767
If Charlie had one, then Margareth
Sanders is not his mother

358
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,152
How can you say that?

359
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:02,614
Charlie suffered from a hereditary genetic
disorder called hypophosphatemia.

360
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:04,832
Charlie's real mother
would have the same disease.

361
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:05,779
You do not.

362
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,565
Never say I wasn't Charlie's
real mother because I was.

363
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,326
Biological mother, then. Mrs. Sanders, you
are not Charlie's biological mother.

364
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,299
You want to explain that to us?

365
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,278
I can't have children. That's why
my husband left me.

366
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,063
So, I took in foster kids.

367
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,988
- Like Sean and David Cook?
- And Carlie.

368
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:32,350
Though his name was Nathan.

369
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,447
I got him as a baby down in
Pittsburgh. Ten days old.

370
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:43,894
His mother was arrested on drug charges,
and Child Services brought him to me.

371
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:49,267
Three weeks I had him.
Then the charges was droped.

372
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,908
And you kept him?

373
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,321
I gave him back.

374
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,729
But it nearly killed me.

375
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:03,643
I stayed in touch. I bought him things.
Formula, a stroller.

376
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:07,115
I wanted to make sure
he was all right.

377
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:09,974
Nathan what, Mrs. Sanders?

378
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,309
Nathan Downey.

379
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,445
His mother was a drug addict
named Jeannine.

380
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,418
Christmas Day, I found her dead
on a kitchen floor.

381
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:26,165
A needle stuck in her arm, and I could
hear Charlie crying upstairs.

382
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,745
So, I went up.

383
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,405
And you took him home?

384
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:35,791
I look him in the eyes and I promised him
I would never leave him alone again.

385
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,653
And he spped crying.

386
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:42,769
I expected every day for
Child Services to come looking

387
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:45,965
He would have ended up
back in the system anyway.

388
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,077
I meant to keep him safe.

389
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:54,642
And love him.

390
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,081
And now, he's dead.

391
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,204
Okay, I had to arrest her.

392
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:06,129
The story checked
out-- the overdose.

393
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,831
She confessed to kidnapp

394
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:11,564
Margaret Sanders did nothing more than
respond to the anthropological imperative.

395
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,633
She saw an orphan
and reacted.

396
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:17,608
This is not a National Geographic study, okay?
This is the suburbs.

397
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,877
Why would she kill the boy?
She obviously loved him.

398
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:23,735
There are situations, right. The kid gets sick,
he doesn't turn out to be what she wanted.

399
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:29,044
I bet that you could give me a dozen examples
of societies that have kild their own young.

400
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:33,106
Well, what about Sean and David Cook?
Where do they go now?

401
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:34,789
Back into the system.

402
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,449
Do you have any idea how bad
the foster care system is?

403
00:22:37,484 --> 00:22:38,304
Do you?

404
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,090
What do you want to do, hmm?
Do you want to kidnap them,

405
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,507
the way she kidnapped Charlie?

406
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:45,365
I want you to let them go home
Margareth Sanders.

407
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,204
It's not gonna happen.

408
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,281
Try redigitizing
and resizing.

409
00:22:56,281 --> 00:23:00,361
I did. The extrapolation
protocol got confused by the spread.

410
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,734
You know Hodgins better
than anybody else.

411
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:06,091
So, why is he so bent out
of shape about this banquet?

412
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:07,185
What makes you say that?

413
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:12,069
Because every time someone mentions it, he starts
snapping that rubber band around his wrist.

414
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:15,013
I mean, what makes you think I know
Hodgins better than anyone else?

415
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:16,303
You're roommates.

416
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:17,985
I live above his garage.

417
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:19,227
But you see a lot of each other.

418
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:20,275
Not really.

419
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,568
He drives you to work.

420
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,270
I've never been up
to the main house.

421
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,441
The main house?

422
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:29,448
It's at the opposite end of the driveway
on the other side across from the pond.

423
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:32,793
Okay, anything on the identity
of Charlie's abductor?

424
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:35,511
I can't clear up
this image any more than it is.

425
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:38,354
Tell Booth what you told me
about living in Hodgins's garage.

426
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:42,707
There's a bedroom, living room, kitchen,
another bedroom, a then, two bath...

427
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,601
Great. Quite a garage.
Can we focus on the case?

428
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,763
How many cars does he have
in that garage?

429
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:50,323
Including the antique ones,
about 12. And a boat.

430
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:55,039
Zack has never seen the main house, because
the tennis courts and the pond block the view.

431
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,666
Well, he must be one
of those Hodginses.

432
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:58,916
Who are those Hodginses?

433
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,024
The Cantilever Group
Hodginses.

434
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:03,019
Oh my God

435
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:06,583
The same Cantilever Group that generates
more GNP than Europe?

436
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:10,807
Get this. They are the single biggest
donors to the Jeffersonian Institution.

437
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,286
Ha. Makes Hodgins your boss.

438
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,356
What do you guys even talk about
when he drives you to work?

439
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:22,855
I mostly sleep. Hodgins mostly
yells at the radio.

440
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,858
Okay, if you can't see the guy's face,
maybe you can grab a reflection

441
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:28,413
That's a workable idea.

442
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:33,018
Oh, I'd say thanks, you know, if you didn't
say it like it was some kind of a miracle.

443
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:43,226
Chem lab mass spectrometer identifies the
particulates in Charlie Sanders' mouth as fluoride.

444
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,697
- I recognize that look.
- What?

445
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:48,618
You're writing another book.

446
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:52,304
When you write, you get this stunned look
on your face, like you stuck a fork in a toaster.

447
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:53,589
Am I this one, too?

448
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:56,288
You weren't in the last one.
Fluoride? At what concentration?

449
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:57,962
It's too high
for toothpaste.

450
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,542
Put together a list of...

451
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:03,641
Put together a list of anything that could
conceivably contain fluoride at those levels.

452
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:05,320
All right. Do you have time for this?

453
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:07,260
Oh! He gave me a car.

454
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,792
Nice! Who?

455
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:12,462
My publisher. Now I feel like I have to earn
it by writing another book.

456
00:25:12,462 --> 00:25:16,878
Fight coercion in all its forms. You don't
write the book, I don't go to the banquet.

457
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:18,983
Solidarity.

458
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:24,599
Angela has a face
for the abductor.

459
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:32,008
I looked on both cameras.

460
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:34,926
This one offered up
more reflective surfaces.

461
00:25:34,926 --> 00:25:36,081
Right at the door.

462
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:37,831
Olhe isso.

463
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:40,618
The abductor's face.

464
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:42,848
By polarizing the image,
the computer can

465
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:46,860
interpret the spaces and the dark gaps
and fill in the missing pieces.

466
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:49,400
Wait, that doesn't
look like an adult.

467
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,913
When I repolarize
the image...

468
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:59,409
Sean Cook.
The victim's foster brother.

469
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,036
Where were you taking
Charlie, Sean?

470
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:10,422
I brought him to the mall
to see David.

471
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:14,383
I know you brought him to the mall,
but we got a picture of you...

472
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:17,455
leading him out of the mall.

473
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,104
Have you seen much
of this ki of thing?

474
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:27,969
I'm a juvenile prosecutor. I wish I could
say kids killing kids was rare.

475
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,119
Where were you
taking him, Sean?

476
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,151
When can I talk
to Margaret?

477
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:34,900
After you answer my questions.

478
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,139
Can he do that?
Lie to a kid?

479
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,955
We're after a child
killer, Dr. Brennan.

480
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,650
If the child advocate in there doesn't complain,
I sure as hell won't.

481
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,055
What's the point of having a child advocate
if he doesn't advocate for the child?

482
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:51,882
I get the impression you're confused as to
what side you're on, Dr. Brennan.

483
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:54,377
Sean.

484
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:57,935
- You know what that is?
- A scar?

485
00:26:57,935 --> 00:27:03,535
Yeah. I got it, uh, when I was playing
soldier with my brother, Jared.

486
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:04,489
Did it hurt?

487
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,972
Yeah, it hurt.
But it was an accident.

488
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,350
You got any scars?

489
00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:17,826
My dad did it with a cigarette.

490
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:20,413
He shouldn't have done that.

491
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,122
Margaret didn't do
anything like that.

492
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,914
I love Margaret.

493
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:32,212
What I nd to know is if Charlie
had some kind of an accident.

494
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,020
Sean?

495
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:37,933
Maybe we can just take a break.

496
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:39,753
Sean?

497
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,808
He's not being
aggressive enough.

498
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:45,740
Foster kids are powerless.
They're treated like garbage.

499
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,670
You're in a position to do something about it and
all you say is, "He's not being aggressive enough?"

500
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,125
Dr. Brennan, you know this boy may very well
have beaten a child to death with a rock

501
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:09,277
How long have we
known each other?

502
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,800
Do people really
ever know each other?

503
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:14,874
How come you never invited me
over to your house?

504
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,792
Oh, I didn't pick up
that kind of vibe off you.

505
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,671
I thought we were close-- all of us.
What else don't I know?

506
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:23,462
Is Zack
from another planet?

507
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,609
Oh, come on, that one is obvious.

508
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,334
You're rich.

509
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:32,068
You single-handedly own
the Cantilever Group.

510
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:34,376
Don't deny it.
I know.

511
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,730
Who else knows?

512
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,524
Zack. Booth.

513
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,806
Don't tell Brennan.

514
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:44,759
Why don't you want us to know
that you are actually our boss?

515
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,044
I don't want to be anybody's boss.
I never did. Please respect that.

516
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,361
What's up with Angela?

517
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:59,828
It's... job pressure.

518
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:04,301
Fluoride at lower concentrations is used
in tooth paste, instant tea

519
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:09,014
and is added to our drinking water, which, I might
add, can cause a range of conditions, brain damage...

520
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,050
Which has nothing to do
with the case at hand.

521
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:17,720
The concentrations found on our victim might come
from wood preservatives, paint thinners,

522
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,348
car wax, or various other
industrial products.

523
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:21,260
Okay.

524
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,670
Did Angela say anything to you
about quitting her job?

525
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:24,911
No.

526
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:28,668
But we hardly know anything
about each other.

527
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,867
Bones. I thought you'd
like to know...

528
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,523
Sean and David
are in emergency care.

529
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:51,065
Pulled some strings, you know, to make
sure they... they get to stay together.

530
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:53,363
That's good. Thanks.

531
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:54,350
It's the best
I could do.

532
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,475
Yeah. I understand.

533
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:59,835
Oh... you know, you say you understand
but you don't, not really.

534
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:04,221
I mean, if you don't like the rule,
you ignore it, right? I can´t have that

535
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,353
And if you wto do this...

536
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,714
- Do what?
- Work on cases.

537
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:14,265
You know, with me, outside the lab. If you want to
do that, I need to know that you will respect the law.

538
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:18,879
Tell you what. If I can't respect the law,
I can at least respect you.

539
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:25,380
Oh... Yeah, that'll work, too.
It kind of comes out of nowhere, but...

540
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,390
Look what you did.

541
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:30,800
It's a pencil.
I'll get you a new one

542
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,633
The victim was killed
by trauma to the chest,

543
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,236
but the ribs are broken
in two places, not just one.

544
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:41,460
Probably because of the brittle bones,
because of the... his disease.

545
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,664
Well, that was my assumption,
but there's another explanation.

546
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,944
Whoa. What's the
other explanation?

547
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:46,880
Compression.

548
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
Wait. Charlie Sanders
was crushed to death?

549
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,207
Yes! Green stick fractures,
vertebral and sternal. See?

550
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:55,250
Hey, Sean Cook outweighed Charlie
Sanders by what, maybe 30 pounds?

551
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,446
How could he have
crushed him to death?

552
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:59,300
Angela, we need to run some scenarios
through the Angelator.

553
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,266
Angela! Booth!

554
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:05,477
Zack has been informed that if
he tells anyone who I am,

555
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:07,801
I will kick him out
on the street like a stray dog.

556
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:10,484
Sadly, there is nothing
I can threaten you two with.

557
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:11,796
Yeah, that's a shame.

558
00:31:11,796 --> 00:31:16,251
What I want out of my life is to come in here
and sift through slime and bugs.

559
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:19,690
Unfortunately, my family is one of those
who secretly run the world.

560
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,193
Paranoia and delusions of grandeur,
all in one package.

561
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:28,058
You call it paranoia, I call it the
family business. Please, coulyou jud  stop?!

562
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:33,839
The reason that I do not
want to go to that banquit

563
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,059
is because the other members of the ruling elite
will make a big fuss about seeing me.

564
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:44,140
My secret will be out, and my life--
this life, that I love-- will be ruined.

565
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:50,272
I'm asking you, please. Please just let me be
Jack Hodgins who works in the lab.

566
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:02,727
Charlie was three feet four inches tall
and weighed 58 pounds.

567
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:03,723
E Sean?

568
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:07,855
Sean Cook is 1.4 meters tall and
weighs 31 kilograms.

569
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:10,912
His brother David
was five eight, 150 pounds.

570
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:13,717
1.75 meters, 68 kilograms.

571
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:18,019
At first, I thought the break to Charlie's
sternum was caused by blunt trauma

572
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,013
because it only ran
along one fault line.

573
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:24,295
But, when Booth broke my pencil, I realized there's
another way to cause the same type of injury:

574
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:26,164
compression.

575
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:29,354
Well, Hodgins found no particulates
that suggested crushing.

576
00:32:29,354 --> 00:32:30,398
Body weight.

577
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:33,512
There has to be enough weight on the victim
to stop the abdomen from moving

578
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:34,765
so no air
can get into the lungs.

579
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:39,112
Prolonged pressure caused the sternum
to snap in half and the ribs to break.

580
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,647
Sorry.

581
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:49,299
Sorry.

582
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:54,408
I entered real-world variables,
taking into account Charlie's size

583
00:32:54,408 --> 00:33:00,284
and the amount of pressure...in the way that
it was broken.

584
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:01,227
What did you end up with?

585
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:03,375
86.2 kilograms.

586
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,135
What's that in American?

587
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,009
190 pounds.

588
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:12,651
Way too much for either of the
Cook kids or Margaret Sanders.

589
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:16,939
I put the neighborhood kid,
Skyler, at about 160 pounds.

590
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:18,301
Well, it can´t be him, either.

591
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:22,235
We should be looking
for a full-grown man.

592
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,507
You have to get Sean to tell you where
he took Charlie when they left the mall.

593
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,717
He won't talk to me.

594
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,204
Let me do it.

595
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:33,859
Uh, no. People are not your
strong point, Bones,

596
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:37,125
and besides, he's not gonna care
how many facts you put in front of him.

597
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,179
Could you just go with me
on this one, Booth?

598
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,760
We're trying to catch a killer.
Let me help.

599
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,702
When was the last time
you even talked to kid?

600
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,793
I know what to say.

601
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,296
- Do you remember me, Sean?
- The museum lady

602
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:54,870
the one who's so smart.

603
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,311
Yeah, I'm pretty smart.

604
00:33:57,942 --> 00:33:59,383
And very modest.

605
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:01,963
Oh, believe me,
she is being modest.

606
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,706
Smart enough to know
that you didn't kill Charlie.

607
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:08,415
You don't have to say
anything, Sean.

608
00:34:09,204 --> 00:34:11,011
Just listen.

609
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:16,836
They give you a garbage bag
to carry all your stuff

610
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:17,837
like they're telling you
everything you own is garbage,

611
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:26,086
and then you have to go to a new school
in clothes that smell like garbage bags.

612
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:31,162
All the regular kids
know you're a foster kid.

613
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:36,537
How do you know what it's like?

614
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:42,038
They bounce you from place to place
and it's never home.

615
00:34:43,854 --> 00:34:47,118
Sometimes the foster
parents are nice.

616
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,619
Like Margaret?

617
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,438
Yeah. And sometimes they
separate you from your brother.

618
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:59,933
It must have beennice with Margaret,
staying with David.

619
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:11,733
We got bunk beds. At night, I knew David
was there. I knew he was guarding me.

620
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,047
Margaret's nice.

621
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:19,589
You'd do almost anything
to stay with Margaret, right?

622
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:24,457
The man you took Charlie to,

623
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:28,080
the man who hurt him,
he's noticed that.

624
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:31,627
He didn't know that he'd
hurt Charlie, but he did.

625
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:34,562
And then he told you that Margare
would blame you--

626
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:38,385
that she'd hate you, but this
man is lying to you, Sean.

627
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,785
I can make sure that you´d
go back to Margaret.

628
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:44,610
How? You work at a museum.

629
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,791
I have a friend at the FBI.

630
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:52,026
If I ask him to, he'll make surethat you
and David get to live with Margaret again.

631
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,837
Dr. Brennan you can't
make promises like that.

632
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:57,650
Yes, I can. He will do it.
My friend will make it happen.

633
00:35:57,685 --> 00:35:58,783
Oh, man.

634
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,830
But you have to tell me--
who hurt Charlie?

635
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:06,621
I'm gonna need your help to keep
the promises she made to that boy.

636
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,444
Hey, I-I-I,
I can't promise...

637
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:13,192
Mrs. Charlto my people and your people
are gonna have to make this happen.

638
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:19,538
What if Margaret doesn't want me anymore?
Charlie wasn't her biological son either.

639
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:24,288
Charlie wasn´t her biological son either.
Charlie was just like you

640
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,426
Someone that Margaret chose to love.

641
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:36,615
I don't think we should let that man take you
and David and Charlie away from Margaret, do you?

642
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:39,912
We should stop him.

643
00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:42,089
You and I should stop him.

644
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:04,181
She did it.

645
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:05,413
She´s got his name.

646
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:27,792
Edward Nelson you´re under arrest
for sexual assault and murder of Charlie Sanders

647
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,614
- Boys.
- Mom.

648
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,548
We have him cold.

649
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:08,114
The insecticide he was using on the termites
matches the fluoride concentration perfectly.

650
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:10,161
Skyler's dad admitted everything.

651
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:13,359
Don'tell me. He said crushing Charlie
to death was a mistake.

652
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,903
He never abused Sean Cook. He just
used him to get near Charlie.

653
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:21,907
It played out just like you said. He had Charlie
out in that field. Some teenage kids, they come by.

654
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:26,250
So, he knelt on Charlie to keep him from
crying out. Sean got scared.

655
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,352
He ran back to his brother.

656
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:32,229
Charlie was small and weak. His sternum collapsed.
You think he abused any other kids?

657
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,533
Yeah.

658
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,209
Probably own son.

659
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,105
You report that
to Child Services?

660
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:40,917
Try to get the kid some help.

661
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,019
And I'm sorry.

662
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:46,379
For what?

663
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:50,097
You have personal experience
in the system.

664
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:58,864
I was a foster child
until my grandfather got me out.

665
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:03,752
Yeah, when you said, um, they'd
take you away from your brother,

666
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:06,784
I kind of had the feeling you
weren't talking about David Cook.

667
00:40:08,257 --> 00:40:14,200
Booth... I'll tell you all about it one day.
But tonight, I have to get dressed for a party.

668
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,638
Okay, Bones.

669
00:40:17,638 --> 00:40:22,434
By the way, there's a huge ding on my passenger-side
door because you told me  not to park it at an angle.

670
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,811
Okay, that's just mean!

671
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,105
I...

672
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:30,754
You're mean.

673
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,202
All right.

674
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,775
That is t a tuxedo,
Dr. Hodgins.

675
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:41,581
I am not going, Dr. Goodman.

676
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:43,505
You are going.

677
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:46,787
When we arrive, the donors will
all bering wearing name tags.

678
00:40:46,787 --> 00:40:48,517
What do we talk about?

679
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:50,265
Your work, of course.

680
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:54,368
Zack's work consists of
removing flesh from corpses.

681
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,550
Hodgins dissects bugs that have
been eating people's eyeballs.

682
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,526
Leave me out of it.
I am not going.

683
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:01,232
And how do you
see your job?

684
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,963
I draw death masks.

685
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,291
Is that really how you see it?

686
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:09,534
Don't you?

687
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,010
You are the best of us,
Ms. Montenegro.

688
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:15,573
You discern humanity in the wreck
of a ruined human body.

689
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:19,812
You give victims back
their faces, their identities.

690
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:23,923
You remind us all of why
we're here in the first place.

691
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:27,674
Because we treasure human life.

692
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,244
Oh, for God's sake.

693
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:34,665
What happened?

694
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,016
Apparently, all Angela needed was to hear her
job description in a deep African-American tone.

695
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,055
Mr. Addy...

696
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:45,139
Dr. Goodman, we need Hodgins in the lab tonight.
F.B.I. needs this analyzed by morning.

697
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,485
Uh, I-I'm gonna
get right on it.

698
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:51,306
Wait a minute.
What case file is this?

699
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:52,557
Am I supposed to know about it?

700
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,015
Booth mentioned it to me earlier today.

701
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:58,141
That's good enough
for me.

702
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:02,185
Fine. You're off the hook,
Dr. Hodgins.

703
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,792
Let's not keep
the limo waiting.

704
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,083
Thanks.

705
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,141
You look nice.

706
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:19,691
Better than nice.
You look, uh,

707
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:23,795
very...

708
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:26,916
Thanks.

709
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:30,547
Bones, how did you know I was
going to keep your promise?

710
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:31,384
What promise?

711
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,763
To get Sean and David back
with Margareth Sanders.

712
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,242
Maybe I was lying

713
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:39,104
to cat the bad guy.

714
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:41,078
I learned that trick from you.

715
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:44,066
The end justifies the means.

716
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:48,782
Booth.

717
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:52,126
I knew you'd back me up.

718
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:55,730
I knew you wouldn't
makee a liar.

719
00:42:56,596 --> 00:42:57,834
Hmm. How'd you know?

720
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:00,295
Because you want
too to heaven.

721
00:43:00,855 --> 00:43:02,783
But you don't believe in heaven.

722
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:05,101
But you do.
