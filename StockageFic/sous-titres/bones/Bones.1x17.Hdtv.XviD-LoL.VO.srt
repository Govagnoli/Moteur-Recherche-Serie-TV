1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,133
victim stabed

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,066
upward of 30 times.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,412
Every rib is marked--

4
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:05,479
vertebra sternal,
vertebra costal...

5
00:00:05,546 --> 00:00:07,346
What kind of weapon?

6
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:10,213
Ooh, vacations in the desert.
It's like lunching at the dump.

7
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,546
Uh, pointed
with no cutting edge,

8
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,780
like a giant ice pick.

9
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:18,113
Whoa, Angela.

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,646
Or a sharpened screwdriver.

11
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,379
We warned her about the sun,
right?

12
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:24,379
We told her cover up,
avoid melanoma.

13
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:25,780
Who's the guy?

14
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:26,980
Her boyfriend,

15
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:27,946
Kirk.

16
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:29,247
Angela has a boyfriend?

17
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:30,679
Every year for three weeks,

18
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:33,412
Angela has a boyfriend
and a vacation.

19
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,579
Whoa, whoa, playing house
in a post-boho,

20
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:38,412
rustic artist cabin
in the desert

21
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,013
with her overpaid,

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,646
pseudo-celebrity photographer
boyfriend,

23
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:43,213
that is not a vacation.

24
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,546
Eight months to a year dead,
correct?

25
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,846
Yeah, yeah, pupal
casings, maggots,

26
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:49,646
blah, blah, blah,
eight months to a year.

27
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:51,080
Angela, we're betting.

28
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,046
Are you using Crisco

29
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:54,312
or butter for sunscreen?

30
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,013
Hey, Brennan,

31
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,546
could I talk to you
in private, please?

32
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,946
You're going to think I'm crazy.

33
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,613
What's up, boyfriend trouble?

34
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,279
No, I-I-I'd just send it to you,
but the sheriff won't let me.

35
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:10,613
Send what?

36
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,446
Somebody left a human skull
in a box

37
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,279
on the sheriff's porch.

38
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:18,346
He says it was probably a Navajo
who respects the dead,

39
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,279
but doesn't want to get
pulled into the whole

40
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,546
white justice system.

41
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:23,980
The thing is, is that Kirk

42
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:25,913
went out into the desert
five days ago

43
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,813
on a photo shoot,
and he hasn't come back.

44
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,013
Nobody can find him
or his guide.

45
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,846
You think the skull is Kirk's?

46
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:33,080
No. No.

47
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:35,746
Kirk's always going out
into the desert

48
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,379
for days at a time.

49
00:01:37,446 --> 00:01:40,113
You're really sending me
mixed messages, Ange.

50
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,379
Yeah, well, I'm freaking out,
I guess.

51
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:43,746
I'm sorry.
Look, you know, I'm sorry.

52
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:45,180
I shouldn't have called.

53
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:46,713
Pretend I didn't call.
I'll just...

54
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,247
I'll talk to you
when Kirk gets back.

55
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:49,913
Sorry.

56
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,147
You're taking a vacation
in the desert with no notice?

57
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,080
I don't get the attraction,
I really don't.

58
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:58,880
Snakes,
scorpions...

59
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,780
It should only be
for a few days.
Buzzards and snakes.

60
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,546
What about
the stabbing victim?

61
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:03,412
Zack identified
the weapon and the victim.

62
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,946
Our job is done.

63
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,346
MONTENEGRO:
 <i>I mean, it's not</i>

64
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,479
like I actually think that
the skull is Kirk's.

65
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:16,646
But I mean,
if you could

66
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:17,846
just look at it

67
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:20,046
and just tell
me it isn't,

68
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,479
then I could stop worrying about
him being dead

69
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:24,746
and just be mad at him
for being a flaky artist.

70
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,579
You won't get
anything out here.

71
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:29,980
We're about 100 miles past

72
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,980
where Jesus lost
his sandals.

73
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,379
I assume that's a way of saying
"we're extremely isolated."

74
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,013
Yeah, it's why
we come out here

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,880
every year.
It's like you stand

76
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,646
still and the whole universe
just comes at you.

77
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,546
At 110 degrees.

78
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,412
You know, Kirk was out
with a good guide,

79
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,780
our friend Dani.

80
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,546
I mean, he said he'd be back,

81
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:50,247
he said we'd go out
for nachos and beer.

82
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:53,346
And this is a man who's serious
about his beer.

83
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,813
I got the Navajo police
looking between

84
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,746
Dona Ona Canyon
and the Otero Bluffs.

85
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,613
Ben, Dr. Brennan is
a forensic anthropologist

86
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,080
with the Jeffersonian
Institution.

87
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:08,646
I spend
most of my time

88
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:10,479
helping the FBI conduct
murder investigations.

89
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:12,312
Angie, I kind of
got my hands full

90
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,379
getting searchers out
to look for Dani and Kirk.

91
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,980
The state police said that
they would lend us a chopper,

92
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,813
but only if we narrowed
down the search area.

93
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,513
They got to be
running low on water.

94
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,279
I don't give them more
than a couple of days.

95
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:27,513
Ben, if you could just
show Dr. Brennan the skull.

96
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,980
Or point me toward
the morgue.

97
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,980
Welcome to
the Merville County morgue.

98
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:56,446
Prominent brow ridge indicates
the victim is male.

99
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:57,646
You mind?

100
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,379
Be my guest.

101
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,646
Oh, no, she wants the plate,
Ben, not the muffin.

102
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,980
Cranial shape and nasal features
suggest Caucasian.

103
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,880
Died in the last several days.

104
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:14,180
Critters been at it pretty good.

105
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,247
Pattern of basilar
suture fusion puts age

106
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:17,513
30 to 35.

107
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,046
Well, it doesn't look like Kirk.

108
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,379
Doesn't look like anyone, Angie.

109
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,780
Putrascine.

110
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,846
Early stages of decomp.

111
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:32,080
Cause of death?

112
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,813
A man gets caught
unawares

113
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,813
out in the desert, he could be
dead in a few hours.

114
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,913
Uh-oh.
What?

115
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,013
Base of the skull here

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,013
detached from the spinal cord.

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,913
See these little bevel marks?
Perimortem contact: gunshot.

118
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,412
It wasn't the desert who caught
this man unawares.

119
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,813
It was someone with a gun.

120
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:09,679
 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com</font>

121
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,583
MONTENEGRO:
 <i>You can't say that it's Kirk.</i>

122
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,451
I know.

123
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,750
You want some tea?

124
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:39,117
I'd rather have a beer.

125
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:51,650
This woman modeling
in these pictures,

126
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,217
is this Dani?

127
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,284
Yeah.
Dani Weber.

128
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,251
It's Kirk's guide in the desert.

129
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:59,583
She's beautiful.

130
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,884
Dani has lived her whole life.

131
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,383
You know, Ben says

132
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,318
that she knows the desert
better than anybody.

133
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,350
Look, there's no way
that she gets lost

134
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,851
or she runs out of water.
There's just no way.

135
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:11,151
No.

136
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:13,284
What?

137
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,450
Brennan, if you hug me
and you be all caring

138
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:17,417
it's because you
think Kirk is dead.

139
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,650
Or because he was
sleeping with Dani.

140
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:22,717
No, it's because...

141
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:25,750
I'm sorry that
my friend is upset

142
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:28,084
because someone
she loves is missing.

143
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:29,750
( <i>sighs</i> )

144
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,417
All right.

145
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,383
I can buy that.

146
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:39,284
You know,
if you don't mind,

147
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,117
I'm just going to head to bed.

148
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,884
Good night.

149
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,017
( <i>whistling</i> )
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

150
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:49,884
Booth.

151
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,650
How far are you from Dulles?

152
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:53,450
As far as your office is
from Dulles.

153
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:54,650
Why are you in my office?

154
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,151
I need your findings

155
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:57,684
on the Richmond case.
Listen, Zack,

156
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,517
he won't tell me where they are
unless you give him

157
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,884
permission.
There's a 9:15 flight to Denver.

158
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,884
Then there's an 11:35 flight
to Santa Fe.

159
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,350
You'll have to run to make
the connection.

160
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,517
Forget it.

161
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,251
Booth, please.

162
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:11,750
Angela's boyfriend is missing.

163
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:13,650
Maybe dead.

164
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,717
It took all of my charm...

165
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,684
just to get the sheriff
Your charm, oh boy!

166
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,650
to let me look at the skull.

167
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:22,017
When I asked him to let me send
the skull to the Jeffersonian,

168
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,750
he told me I am not a cop

169
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,017
and that I don't have
any jurisdiction.

170
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,684
Which is true.

171
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,450
Okay, what, look...
what do you want me to do?

172
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,717
I want you to get federal
on his ass.

173
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:41,851
( <i>door bangs</i> )

174
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:47,617
Hey. There you go.
Hey.

175
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,251
You know, people
in the desert

176
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,450
don't have
actual addresses.

177
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:51,750
What's up with that?

178
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,483
Booth, you made it.
Yeah.

179
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,383
You know, I'm touring the
hottest places in the universe.

180
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,650
Next stop-- here you go--

181
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,251
hell.

182
00:07:58,318 --> 00:07:59,784
I'm not really awake yet.

183
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,318
Last night

184
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:03,917
before I left,
I used my FBI powers

185
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,650
to force the sheriff
to send the skull

186
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,017
back to the Jeffersonian.

187
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:08,450
I talked to him this morning.

188
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:09,917
Ooh, seems a little resentful.

189
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:11,184
What time is it?

190
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,784
Let's go.
Drink that on the way.

191
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,851
Wha-- on the way where?
You know, to go

192
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,483
check out the model,
guide, whatever's

193
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,717
place.
Dani.

194
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,151
Can I come with you?

195
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,417
No, no, we can ask
tougher questions

196
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:22,584
if you're not there.

197
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,017
Wait outside

198
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:26,017
while I get dressed.
No.

199
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,884
Uh-uh. Sun's been up
for an hour out there.

200
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,318
It's already the surface
of Mercury.

201
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,684
I can stand here
and close my eyes,

202
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,817
eat my doughnuts,
best I can do.

203
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,318
What tougher questions
can we ask

204
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,917
without Angela being here?

205
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,151
Things like, did her
boyfriend run off

206
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,817
with a model,
guide, whatever?

207
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,117
Angela and I
discussed this.

208
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:52,218
She said it couldn't happen.

209
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:54,318
Okay, no offense to
Angela, but she doesn't
really know this guy.

210
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:56,184
She's only with him, what,
three weeks out of the year.

211
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,617
No offense to you, but you're
a stodgy traditionalist

212
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:00,483
when it comes
to relationships, buddy.

213
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,617
Stodgy? Stodgy?

214
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:04,017
Okay, okay, here's the deal.
Yeah, stodgy.

215
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,650
Here's the deal, Bones.

216
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,584
We found out that the skull
isn't Kirk, we go home,

217
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,417
we let the locals
handle it, okay?
Yeah, of course.

218
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,051
BOOTH:
Yeah, you say "of course,"

219
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,117
but then you get all
caught up in it.

220
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,517
And then... What?

221
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,483
Oh.

222
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,483
What do you want?
BOOTH:
FBI.

223
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,417
We're looking for
Dani Weber.

224
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,851
Who are you?

225
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,517
Yeah, I'm the guy
holding the big gun.

226
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:24,017
Yeah, on a federal agent,

227
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,584
which I've been
very nice about so far.

228
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,117
Let's rush him.
He can't shoot us both.

229
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,784
How about I just show him

230
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,483
my badge, so we both
survive, all right?

231
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:32,750
See?

232
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,984
Name's Alex Joseph.

233
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,417
This is me and Dani's place.

234
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:37,884
Where's Dani Weber?

235
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,218
Missing...

236
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:40,650
in the desert for
almost a week.

237
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:42,350
I've been looking for her.

238
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,917
You point your gun
at everybody who comes by?

239
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,517
Maybe I'm nervous.

240
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,817
BOOTH:
Anything in particular

241
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,084
you might be nervous about?

242
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,350
Maybe something
Dani got caught up in.

243
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,884
Nothing I can think of.

244
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:52,717
Could we look
in the trailer?

245
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,784
Not without a warrant.

246
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,151
You have a problem
with law enforcement?

247
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:57,350
You could say that,

248
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,417
I guess.

249
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:06,750
Model runs off with
handsome photographer,

250
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,051
jealous boyfriend with a gun
finds them in the desert...

251
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:10,350
He's definitely twitchy
about something.

252
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,817
What if he's escaping

253
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,450
out the back door?

254
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:15,951
You don't spend a lot of time
in trailers, do you?

255
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:22,417
Whoa.

256
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:23,318
What?

257
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,917
That's Sheriff Dawes.

258
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,650
Yeah, he definitely
has a problem

259
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,717
with law enforcement.

260
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,417
( <i>chuckles</i> )

261
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:33,251
( <i>music playing,</i>
 <i>muffled through earpieces</i> )

262
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:37,284
Dr. Brennan doesn't like
us to listen to music
while we're working.

263
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,450
Dr. Brennan is not here.

264
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:42,084
She thinks the work deserves
our full concentration.

265
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,617
I need the skull now.

266
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,284
Well, I'm still finding
particulates.

267
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,450
And since you're only
Dr. Brennan's assistant,

268
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:50,450
without her, you don't carry all
that much weight around here.

269
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,218
I'm telling Dr. Goodman.

270
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,517
( <i>music playing</i> )

271
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,218
Why didn't you mention your
relationship to Dani Weber?

272
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,017
BOOTH:
Dani Weber dropped you
for the photographer,

273
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,051
the Indian guy, or both.

274
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:05,517
Moron.

275
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:06,917
Dani's my sister.

276
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:08,318
Half sister.

277
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,151
Mostly I raised her.

278
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:11,717
You can check with Angie.

279
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,051
Okay, well,
I got that one... wrong.

280
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,584
I pretty much
don't like the look

281
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,284
of your sister's boyfriend,

282
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,684
Alex Joseph.

283
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,650
( <i>scoffs</i> )
Assault.

284
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:19,884
Narcotics.

285
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,717
He bootlegs
for the reservation.

286
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:24,184
Yeah, Dani could do better.
Any chance that

287
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,483
Dani got caught up in something
ugly because of him?

288
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,318
Until I find otherwise,
I'm assuming

289
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,051
that Dani and Kirk
are lost in the desert.

290
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,051
Alex Joseph-- is he bad enough
to hurt 'em

291
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,550
if he finds 'em out
in the desert together?

292
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:37,184
It's on my list of nightmares,
yeah.

293
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:39,051
( <i>phone rings</i> )
Brennan.

294
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,350
DNA results are in.

295
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,284
The skull is definitely
Kirk Persinger.

296
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:47,851
Poor Angela.

297
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,318
HODGINS ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Also, the hair test's

298
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,017
 off the charts for
 <i>Lophophora williamsii-</i>
derived mescaline.

299
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:53,584
What's that?

300
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,550
Peyote.

301
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,784
Anything on the cranial scoring?

302
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:59,117
ADDY:
I haven't really had a good
crack at the skull yet.

303
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:00,784
Hodgins hogged it.

304
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,984
The markings traced to
several desert dwelling

305
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,884
species-- it seems 
a full-grown male coyote

306
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,750
did the most work on it,

307
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:08,784
but one with
a malformed jaw.

308
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:10,784
Very unusual bite
formations.

309
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:15,017
Ask Dr. Goodman to find
a naturalist.

310
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:15,984
Kirk Persinger?

311
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,251
Yes.

312
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,350
They found traces
of peyote.

313
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,917
BOOTH:
Drug-related.

314
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,383
Shot to the spine,
execution-style.

315
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,218
So, Sheriff, do you
still think this is

316
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,517
a simple
missing persons case?

317
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,684
I have to tell Angela.

318
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:36,684
Listen, Sheriff, um,

319
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,184
sorry for
the concern

320
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,184
you must be feeling
for you sister.

321
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:52,051
I will call the FBI
office in Albuquerque,

322
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:53,984
and I will officially take
over the investigation.

323
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:55,483
I won't do that.
Why?

324
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,550
Desert dwellers
are very insular.

325
00:12:57,617 --> 00:13:01,017
Mongolians,
Bedouins of the Sahara,

326
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,750
the Himba of Kalana.

327
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:05,784
Good hosts but extremely
distrustful of outsiders.

328
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,251
Bone, this is the
United States of America.

329
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:08,417
It's not outer Mongolia.

330
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,117
The only reason

331
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:12,817
Sheriff Dawes talks to us at all
is because we know Angela.

332
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,851
Alex Joseph held a gun on us.

333
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,817
I'll admit, I've met
friendlier people.

334
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:19,817
If a bunch of outsiders
come in from Albuquerque

335
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,483
led by an outsider from D.C.,
I promise you

336
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,284
the people here will close ranks

337
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,550
and shut up
until we go away.

338
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:28,450
Then they'll take care of it
in their own way.

339
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,051
Okay, who are
you, Dr. Phil?

340
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:32,984
Who is Dr. Phil,
some kind of expert?

341
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:34,784
He likes to think so.

342
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,750
Okay, look, I'll take what
you say under advisement.

343
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,550
In the meantime, we
need to go find out

344
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,417
who supplied Kirk
with his peyote.

345
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,750
Well, how are we going
to do that?

346
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:45,051
Talk to his girlfriend.

347
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:49,383
BRENNAN:
I am so sorry, Angela.

348
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,584
We both are.

349
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,984
I knew it was Kirk.

350
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,784
That's why I called you.

351
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,284
We have to find out

352
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,951
what happened to Dani.

353
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,717
Angela, I'm going to have
to ask you a couple

354
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,251
difficult
questions, okay?

355
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:05,584
What-what can you tell me

356
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,750
about Kirk's drug use?

357
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,517
Kirk didn't do drugs.

358
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:14,017
Well, Hodgins found
peyote in his hair.

359
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,117
I thought...

360
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:18,184
I thought
that you meant drug drugs.

361
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,218
The peyote
wasn't recreational.

362
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:23,184
Kirk took part
in some Native Indian rights.

363
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,617
While high on drugs?

364
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:25,951
( <i>sighs</i> )

365
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:28,017
Did you do peyote with Kirk?

366
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,951
The peyote has nothing
to do with anything.

367
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,617
Angela,

368
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,717
you may have come in contact
with Kirk's killer without even

369
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,450
realizing it.
( <i>sighs</i> )

370
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,684
Who was his connection?

371
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,450
( <i>sighs</i> )

372
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,318
He's Kirk's friend.

373
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,251
I need the name.

374
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:49,650
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Wayne.

375
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,284
Wayne Kellogg.

376
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,284
He's an important local artist.

377
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,251
( <i>sighs</i> )

378
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:09,017
MAN:
 <i>I don't deny</i>

379
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:10,851
having participated
in the peyote ritual

380
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,151
on several occasions.

381
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:13,917
Utterly spiritual experience.

382
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:15,817
You're not Indian.

383
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:18,318
Not by birth, no,
but as you can see
from my artwork,

384
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,684
I have a deep
spiritual connection

385
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,318
to the Navajo.

386
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,251
You sell a lot
of your work?

387
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:25,483
I sell very well overseas,
enough to keep this place

388
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,584
and a beach house
in Los Angeles. Why?

389
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,051
Why not buy Navajo art
created by actual Navajos?

390
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,350
BOOTH:
Peyote is only legal
if you're a member

391
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,117
of the Native American Church,

392
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,750
which means, you and Kirk
bought it illegally.

393
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,450
Buying illegal drugs
involves drug dealers.

394
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:41,584
I mean, you can follow my train
of thought here, can't you?

395
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,851
Look, I realize
Kirk's missing.

396
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,750
Kirk's not missing.

397
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:46,884
He's dead.

398
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:49,717
What about Dani?

399
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,884
Dani Weber remains
unaccounted for.

400
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:55,750
God, this <i>is</i> terrible.

401
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,750
I need the name
of your drug connection.

402
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,717
No.

403
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,218
I'm sorry.

404
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,318
These people trust me.

405
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:05,084
I understand the difficulty

406
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,550
in finding the peyote plants
miles out in the desert.

407
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:08,984
Secret places

408
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,117
passed on from generation
to generation.

409
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,417
Mr. Kellogg,
is that your vehicle?

410
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,117
Yes. Why?

411
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:19,617
BRENNAN:
Alex Joseph borrowed
that Humvee.

412
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:21,884
Wait. Alex Joseph
didn't go out

413
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:24,218
to the desert
to look for Dani Weber.

414
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,450
He went out
to look for peyote.

415
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,817
I never said that.

416
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,383
Mr. Joseph?

417
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,251
It's FBI again.

418
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:39,617
Like to ask you
a few more questions.

419
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,550
Booth?

420
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,333
BOOTH:
Oh, come on, Sheriff.

421
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,367
Come on, even out
here you know how the
drug world works, huh?

422
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:03,899
Kirk is found dead.

423
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,367
Joseph is beaten
to a pulp.

424
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,966
It's all connected.

425
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,233
My first priority
is to find Dani.

426
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,333
You find Kirk's murderer,
we probably find Dani.

427
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,700
Maybe Dani is the murderer.

428
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,300
What? I got to ask.

429
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,667
Dani never hurt anybody
in her life.

430
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,367
Except maybe herself.

431
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,133
BOOTH:
You know,
another thing

432
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,267
I have to consider--
maybe Dani, you know,

433
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,833
calls up her, uh,
brother the sheriff

434
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,500
and says, you know,
"This photographer

435
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,166
"raped me.
What do I do now?"

436
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,533
What you're proven

437
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,267
right now--
you don't know anything

438
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,667
about the people
that live around here.

439
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:36,433
Hmm. Joseph met us
with a rifle.

440
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,833
Maybe because
he was afraid

441
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,433
it was you coming around

442
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,667
the corner
of that house.

443
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,367
Alex Joseph is unconscious.

444
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,766
You maybe can talk to him
when he wakes up.

445
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,400
Me-- I'm going

446
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,433
to help the search parties
find my sister.

447
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:55,899
WOMAN:
 <i>Thanks to Fish and Wildlife,</i>

448
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,133
most of the coyote packs
in this region have

449
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,567
at least one member
wearing a GPS collar.

450
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,500
BOOTH ( <i>over phone</i> ):
You can find one coyote

451
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,233
with a wonky
jaw in the desert?

452
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,033
What we do here is process

453
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,734
information from rangers,

454
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,100
amateur naturalists,

455
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,133
conservationists,
even school groups.

456
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,734
The Desert Coyote Packs Range
is not huge.

457
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,766
Perhaps ten square miles.

458
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,500
The pack is typically

459
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,600
three to eight animals
led by the alpha mating pair.

460
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,267
Wow.

461
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,133
BOOTH:
Why wow?

462
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,267
GOODMAN:
Professor Inez has found
your coyote,

463
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,000
but he's-he's way out
in the desert.

464
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,467
Three pups,

465
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,533
three females, two males--

466
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,467
including the leader
with the wonky jaw.

467
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,467
With eight coyotes
going at a cadaver.

468
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,799
Wow. You know, we're talking
needle in a haystack,

469
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,467
you know, finding the remains.

470
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,634
Mamas and the pups
feed together,

471
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,166
so I'd expect rib cage
and smaller bones

472
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,766
to be
in a concentrated area.

473
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,267
But the males move away
from each other

474
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,600
with the larger pieces.

475
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,367
No more than a half a mile.

476
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,300
Three weeks a year.

477
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,267
I mean, 15 weeks in total.

478
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,700
You think that's crazy.

479
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,467
Well...

480
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,600
it's not typical,
that's for sure.

481
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,567
And if he was
yours, 100% yours,

482
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:13,700
for three weeks
a year, that's...

483
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,866
It's more than I've ever had.

484
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,100
Kirk's photographs

485
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,066
show the world as a more
beautiful place than it is.

486
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,899
A-A better place.

487
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:32,333
He made me feel like
it was my real home.

488
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,333
That I belonged there...

489
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,766
with him.

490
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:42,267
He's the guy
I compare all other guys to.

491
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,066
Now he's gone, and I-I feel like

492
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,367
I can't even breathe, sweetie.

493
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:51,634
I can't even take a breath.

494
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,500
You think it's possible

495
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,799
that Dani's still out there?

496
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,367
Could she still be alive?

497
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,734
I don't know.

498
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,066
There's no crime scene, and...

499
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:06,467
we're not even sure where the
rest of Kirk's remains are.

500
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,766
Well, I want to help you
look for her tomorrow.

501
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,899
You sure?

502
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:11,899
Yeah. Dani was our friend.

503
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:14,700
I have to help find her.

504
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,734
Please?

505
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,734
Thank you.

506
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,500
( <i>sighs</i> )

507
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,933
I love the desert.

508
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,066
Or I used to.

509
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,166
Nothing looks the way it should.

510
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,267
Stuff that's far away
looks near, stuff that's near

511
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,433
looks far.

512
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,933
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah, well,

513
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,100
you can't trust your eyes
out here.

514
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,734
Not your eyes alone.

515
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,333
You know, Kirk said

516
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,866
that if you stood still
long enough,

517
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,100
that the desert would actually
speak to you.

518
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,033
Show you some kind of truth.

519
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
That ever happen to you?

520
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:01,333
No, but he really believed that.

521
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,766
Alex Joseph woke up.

522
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,066
Good.

523
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,066
You think whoever beat him up

524
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,866
had something to do
with Kirk Persinger's murder.

525
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,267
Yeah.

526
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,233
Nope.

527
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,799
How can you be so sure?

528
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,899
You were the one
that beat him up?

529
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,734
No.
Okay.

530
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,367
Well, uh... do you
know who did?

531
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,200
These guys.

532
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,600
Or guys just like 'em.

533
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,500
Why?

534
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:34,933
Peyote ritual.

535
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
These people take it seriously.

536
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,400
It's their religion.

537
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,100
A guy like Alex Joseph starts

538
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,966
selling it to white guys
like Kellogg and Kirk,

539
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,634
they don't like it.

540
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,066
Aren't you going
to arrest any of them?
No.

541
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,233
But I might deputize a couple.

542
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
You know, Sheriff,
I get how you people

543
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,000
handle things out here,
but I got ask you--

544
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,100
I mean, if they'd
beat up an Indian

545
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,866
for selling peyote,
what the hell

546
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,100
are they gonna do to Kirk
for taking it?

547
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,734
Nothing. Kirk's a white man.

548
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,833
The way they see it,
he's my responsibility.

549
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:07,400
MAN:
Hey! I got
something here!

550
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,966
Ange, they found
some bones over here.

551
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,667
It might be Kirk.

552
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,833
It is Kirk.
This is his camera.

553
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:37,100
Are you sure?

554
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,333
No, no, no.
Don't, don't.

555
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,899
There could be
exposed film in there.

556
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,799
It's cracked.

557
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,766
Can't let anymore light in,
it'll damage the film.

558
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,667
Maybe Kirk was right.

559
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,400
This could be a good way

560
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,267
for the desert to tell us
what happened to him.

561
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,766
Photograph of his murder.

562
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,966
This camera is going straight
to the State Police Crime Lab.

563
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,966
Angela is better
at developing film

564
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:12,000
than anyone in Santa Fe.

565
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,766
MONTENEGRO:
Plus I can use
Kirk's equipment.

566
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,866
It's top of the line.

567
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,400
Yeah, and we won't have

568
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,666
to wait
for the results, Sheriff.

569
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:19,467
BRENNAN:
With your sister maybe

570
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,333
still alive out in the desert,
every hour counts.

571
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:25,467
Can't do it.

572
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,800
Booth...

573
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,833
Yeah, you know,
according to Homeland Security,

574
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,599
Kellogg sold exactly $120,000
worth of art overseas.

575
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,966
What's that
got to do with anything?

576
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,766
BOOTH:
Well, it sure as hell doesn't
buy him a beach house

577
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,100
in Los Angeles, now does it?

578
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,200
He lied.

579
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:42,467
 Let's go check him out.

580
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:44,233
What will we be looking for?

581
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,966
BOOTH:
You know, what we
always look for.

582
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:46,833
You know, something
that doesn't fit.

583
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,133
Something that, you know...

584
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,699
Something.

585
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:56,100
I can't believe that you
think that I am a suspect.

586
00:23:56,167 --> 00:24:00,200
Angie, not to speak ill
of the dead, but, uh...

587
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:01,800
a woman like you,

588
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,733
you're worth
more than

589
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
three weeks a year,
you understand?

590
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:06,833
You think I murdered Kirk

591
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,800
because he didn't
give me enough time?

592
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,367
I'm just a lawman.

593
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:12,033
People are people.

594
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,467
Ben, Kirk wasn't the one who put
limits on our time together.

595
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:18,133
He wanted me to marry him,
and he deserved more,

596
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
and better.

597
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:23,000
Please, Ben, I want
to help find Dani.

598
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,133
And there could be
evidence on this film.

599
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,133
Just let me do what I do
better than anybody else.

600
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,033
Thank you.

601
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,033
Angie...

602
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,267
Maybe he deserved more,
not my place to say,

603
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,966
but he couldn't
have done better.

604
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
No man could.

605
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,900
I haven't attained
anything like the success

606
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:06,033
Kirk has,
but I do all right-- why?

607
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,200
You have a beach house.

608
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,800
I applied for a warrant

609
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,033
to check for your
assets, your tax returns.

610
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,566
I told you,

611
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:15,233
I do well in Europe,
Germany especially appreciates

612
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,067
Native-themed work.

613
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,534
Kirk Persinger's remains were
found way out in the desert.

614
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,966
What's that got to do with me?

615
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,566
Oh, because you have a vehicle

616
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:23,866
that's capable
of going out that far.

617
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:26,833
A vehicle I often loan out.

618
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,866
What are these?

619
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,000
Engraving plates.

620
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,800
Please don't
touch them.

621
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,000
The oils on your skin

622
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,367
will comprise
the integrity.

623
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:35,966
Why would I kill Kirk?

624
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,800
Maybe because, you know,
you had a little thing,

625
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:39,933
you know, for Dani.

626
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,900
Or maybe because you
were jealous of Kirk's

627
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:43,233
artistic success.

628
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,367
These aren't Native designs.

629
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,133
Bones, I'm working
a line of inquiry here.

630
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,467
BRENNAN:
All of your work

631
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,133
is stolen from Native designs.

632
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,367
These are floral.
It doesn't fit.

633
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,233
Not stolen.

634
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,434
Inspired by.

635
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,833
And that piece
is commissioned.

636
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,267
Another way I make money.

637
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,534
Hi, Angela.

638
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,300
Well, most of the film
was wrecked,

639
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,267
but I developed
a few usable images.

640
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,000
That's great.

641
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,566
No, no, because Ben got me
to make a couple of prints

642
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,833
and then he bolted with them
and all the negatives.

643
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,000
Sheriff Dawes took off
with the negatives.

644
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,633
What'd she find on them?

645
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,933
Did you recognize
anything?

646
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,300
Dani in the desert,

647
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,133
and that's all.

648
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,467
I have no idea

649
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:23,167
what he got so excited about.

650
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,833
Nothing that meant
anything to Angela.

651
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,367
We'll go take a look
for ourselves.

652
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:27,267
Talk to you again.

653
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,800
I wanted to show these
photographs to Alex Joseph.

654
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,133
I don't need your permission.

655
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Why Joseph?

656
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,966
Angela says
there are only

657
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,599
a few partial photos of
your sister in the desert.

658
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,000
That's right.

659
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,267
The only person
that knows the desert

660
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,733
as good as Dani is Joseph.

661
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
This formation here,

662
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:45,633
I'm not familiar
with it.

663
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,200
There's nothing like
this anywhere near

664
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,300
where we found Kirk's remains
or the camera.

665
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:51,500
Well, he was killed
somewhere else and moved.

666
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:54,434
If we find that outcropping,
maybe we find the place

667
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,467
where Kirk was killed
and maybe we find my sister.

668
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,100
Did Joseph recognize the rock?

669
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,699
Yeah.
Where?

670
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:02,000
It's easier I take
you than explain.

671
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,666
Whoa, whoa, okay,
if Joseph is a murderer,

672
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,233
he's just sending you
on a wild-goose chase.

673
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Well, then we know
he's the murderer

674
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:10,866
and all we've wasted is a tank
of gas in a goose chase.

675
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,233
How far out are we going?

676
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,534
A ways.

677
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,900
One week in the desert and
there's nothing but bone left.

678
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:25,267
HODGINS:
Same guy?

679
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,333
Looks like it.

680
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,599
Uh, I think

681
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,233
it would be better

682
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,500
if I went over the bones
for particulates

683
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,566
before you start
your thing.

684
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:32,966
I disagree, and you
can't have them

685
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,699
unless I release them to you.

686
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,800
You're gonna have to do
the "boss thing," boss.

687
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:40,300
Sir, Dr. Brennan needs
to know how this man died,

688
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,233
which is my territory,
more than when

689
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,200
and where he died.

690
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:44,866
Dr. Hodgins?

691
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,666
Even I can see he got shot
in the back of the head.

692
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,000
What Dr. Brennan needs
is the murder scene.

693
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,000
It's the desert.

694
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,200
Insects and particulates

695
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:51,666
aren't going
to narrow it down

696
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:53,400
any more than that.

697
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:54,666
We won't know that until
I look at the particulates.

698
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,233
Dr. Hodgins will have access
to the bones first, Mr. Addy.

699
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,933
That's the wrong decision.

700
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,866
BRENNAN:
My lungs are going to come
out through my throat.

701
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,233
You know, where I come from,
when you say

702
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,267
you're driving a ways,
you know, it means 45 minutes.

703
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,866
Out here,
it means four hours.

704
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:25,666
We've been driving five.

705
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,566
I maybe should have
said <i>quite</i> a ways.

706
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,733
There it is.

707
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,933
BOOTH:
Well... that it?

708
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
Yeah,
I think so.

709
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,534
Different time of day.

710
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,367
You people look for the exact
spot the pictures were taken.

711
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:54,733
I'm gonna take another
circle in the truck.

712
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,233
Looking for your sister?

713
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,400
I think we want to go
south slightly.

714
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,167
Maybe southwest.

715
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:02,766
You can tell from the shadows?

716
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,133
Yeah, and the angle
on the outcropping.

717
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:09,933
Where's he going?

718
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,233
He's looking for his sister.

719
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,300
Either of you two
bring any water?

720
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:20,367
Why?

721
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:22,000
You worried?
Yeah.

722
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:23,699
About what?

723
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:27,333
Because we are way past
where Jesus lost his sandals.

724
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,300
And I don't hear
the truck anymore.

725
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,167
No cell phone service.

726
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,534
No water.

727
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,133
How long do you think
we'll survive out here

728
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,133
if the sheriff
doesn't come back?

729
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,633
Three days, max.

730
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:50,900
Well, how far are we
from the highway?

731
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:52,400
Five days, minimum.

732
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,400
I don't like that math.

733
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:56,900
Wait a second.

734
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:01,333
BOOTH:
Kirk's?

735
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,033
It looks like it, yeah.

736
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:09,599
Yeah... distributor's smashed.

737
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:10,933
That's it.

738
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
All the wires
are pulled out.

739
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,000
It doesn't make sense
that the sheriff brings us

740
00:30:15,067 --> 00:30:17,633
to the scene of the crime and
then leaves us to die, does it?

741
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:18,800
One godforsaken

742
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:20,367
part of the desert just as good

743
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:22,000
as another godforsaken
part of the desert.

744
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,633
We don't even know

745
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,534
if Sheriff Dawes actually
called Alex Joseph.

746
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,133
I mean,
for all we know,

747
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,367
he could have done
all this himself.

748
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,300
Could Dawes do that, Ange?

749
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, I always thought
Ben Dawes was a good man.

750
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:36,833
It would take a lot
to change my mind.

751
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,599
Well, like, being
left to die in the desert?

752
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,400
BOOTH:
These tracks here,

753
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:42,666
they don't match the sheriff's
vehicle, they're too wide.

754
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,167
Humvee maybe?

755
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,633
This is blood, I think.

756
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:50,400
The victim

757
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,800
was kneeling here.

758
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:52,833
Bones.

759
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,966
Sorry.

760
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:02,400
He was dragged this way,
then the blood trail ends.

761
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,333
He was thrown
into the Humvee.

762
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,100
We've got to be 200 miles from
where we found Kirk's bones.

763
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,800
You think the murderer drove
that far to drop the body?

764
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,434
Where are you going?

765
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,300
Boo... Hey.

766
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:16,933
Yup, tracks,
they stop right here.

767
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
BRENNAN:
What here?

768
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:19,666
There's no here here.

769
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:20,800
Landing strip, huh?

770
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:22,300
I knew this was about drugs.

771
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,100
( <i>Booth groans</i> )

772
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:27,300
Mexico's about
80 miles that way.

773
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,100
Oh, yes.

774
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:37,966
Only Angela could get a ride
in the middle of nowhere.

775
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,633
Any signs of your sister?

776
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:44,633
She's been out
there a week.

777
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:47,267
She could still be alive if she
had a few canteens of water.

778
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,933
Humvee tracks, Sheriff.

779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,333
Alex Joseph?

780
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,167
Catches Kirk and Dani
out here...

781
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:55,300
Sandy, this is Dawes,
do you receive me?

782
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,699
Loud and clear on the satellite,
Sheriff. Where are you?

783
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,699
Hell and gone.
Listen, Sandy, I need

784
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,133
a deputy down
at the clinic,

785
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,033
slap some cuffs on Alex Joseph.

786
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,766
Alex Joseph took off, Sheriff.

787
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,333
We got no idea where he went.

788
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,100
Kellogg's Humvee.

789
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,866
Sandy, go collect

790
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:11,367
Wayne Kellogg's
Humvee and we'll

791
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:12,434
see you in a few hours.

792
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,434
Any blood stains

793
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,800
should flare a bluish-green

794
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,133
when the luminol hits them.

795
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,633
Nothing.

796
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,599
Well, we know that Kirk's body
was put into the Humvee.

797
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,599
Tire treads match.

798
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,833
It's clean.

799
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,467
Give Kellogg
his truck back.

800
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,733
Tell him sorry

801
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,300
for the inconvenience.

802
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,233
Try the hood.

803
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,666
You think they tied Kirk's
bloody, dead body

804
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:40,200
to the hood like an elk

805
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:43,833
then drove him 200 miles
before dumping him for coyotes?

806
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,300
Even out here,
people might notice.

807
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:46,566
Right there.

808
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,233
????

809
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,146
Zack?

810
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:09,346
Yes, Dr. Brennan?

811
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:11,313
I need to know if Kirk's bones

812
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,880
show more damage than can be
explained by animal activity.

813
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,847
Preliminary analysis indicates
that the pubic rami

814
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,546
are fractured,
and the left hemipelvis

815
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:20,147
is severely displaced.

816
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:21,080
Congruent with a fall?

817
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:22,346
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

818
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,546
Were the remains found
at the base

819
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:24,646
of a cliff?

820
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,346
He wasn't driven 200 miles.

821
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:28,047
He was driven a
couple hundred yards.

822
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:29,747
Loaded his body in
the airplane...

823
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:31,446
( <i>clucks tongue</i> )
then tossed it.

824
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,180
Zack, I'm not happy
with how long

825
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:34,780
it took you to get
back to me on this.

826
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,480
We'll talk about it
when I get back.

827
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:38,413
Sorry, Dr. Brennan.

828
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:42,713
HODGINS:
You could have told her
it wasn't your fault.

829
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,880
( <i>sighs</i> )

830
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:48,913
I still have some work
to do here.

831
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,646
If they dumped Kirk's body
from a plane,

832
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:57,813
then they could have done
the same to Dani.

833
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,913
Yeah, well, Kirk was
dead when they
tossed him, right?

834
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,747
Absolutely. And I saw no
evidence of a second
murder at the site.

835
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:05,713
Which leaves me hoping either
my sister is kidnapped

836
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,180
by drug dealers or dying
somewhere in the desert.

837
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,114
Kidnapping's a
federal offense.

838
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,214
It's an FBI matter.
I can help you,
if you want.

839
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,480
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )
Brennan.

840
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:16,114
Dr. Brennan,
those cell phone photos

841
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,780
you sent me of engravings...

842
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,180
Kellogg said it was a
commissioned work.

843
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:21,413
I think these
are engravers' plates.

844
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,947
For what?
Currency.

845
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:25,613
To be exact, I believe
these are dyes

846
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,246
for the Venezuelan
500 bolivar bill.

847
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:29,580
Dyes? Counterfeiters' dyes?

848
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:31,379
Yes.

849
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:34,379
Did you say
"counterfeiters."

850
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,446
 <i>I got a warrant here</i>

851
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:39,379
to search your client's studio
for engraving plates.

852
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:42,214
Well, as Mr. Kellogg's
attorney, I can advise you,

853
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,813
you're certain to find some.

854
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,713
I'm an engraver.

855
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,446
Larry, did you
tell Wayne about
how when someone dies

856
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:50,214
during the commission
of a felony,

857
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,646
everyone involved
in that felony

858
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:53,947
is charged with murder?

859
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:55,446
Counterfeiting is a felony.

860
00:34:57,114 --> 00:34:59,913
My client will confess to

861
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,713
the counterfeiting charges,
in return for

862
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,480
immunity from the murder charge.

863
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,613
Not good enough.
He will also provide

864
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,980
the time and place
of the next pickup
out in the desert.

865
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:12,246
You'll be able to arrest
the actual murderers.

866
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:14,246
When Sheriff Dawes says
"not good enough,"

867
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,947
he means his sister, Larry.

868
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,413
My client doesn't know
anything about Dani Weber.

869
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,080
What <i>does</i> he know?

870
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,013
One week ago, I arranged to meet
some associates

871
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,214
at an airstrip in the desert

872
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:30,913
to pass on
some commissioned artwork.

873
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,546
He means counterfeit plates.

874
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:35,114
As the plane landed,
my associates

875
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,147
noticed two people
spying on them

876
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:40,546
from a vantage point
above the airstrip.

877
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:42,613
They became very agitated.

878
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,947
They commandeered my vehicle,

879
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,480
and they drove
up the hill.

880
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:49,013
I got my Humvee,
then I drove up there.

881
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,446
But I didn't see anything.

882
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:54,114
Like blood on the hood
of your vehicle?

883
00:35:56,713 --> 00:36:00,446
Well... the fact remains
that agreeing to this deal

884
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:03,279
is the only way that
you're going to catch
the actual murderers.

885
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:06,580
You know where to find me.

886
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:10,047
Wayne, I need to know if they
loaded Dani on that plane.

887
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,279
I never saw Dani.

888
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:14,747
BOOTH:
Easy, Sheriff.

889
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,780
That's my sister. My sister! 

890
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:19,880
I am truly sorry
about Dani, Ben.

891
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:24,114
Truly sorry. But I don't
think Wayne knows anything.

892
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,947
Come on, Dawes.

893
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:27,047
Easy.

894
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:28,980
Come on.

895
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:38,013
I guess we're gonna have
to take that deal, right?

896
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,446
I was trained as an Army Ranger.

897
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:44,680
That mean anything to you,
Sheriff Dawes?

898
00:36:44,747 --> 00:36:48,813
I'd be more than happy
to go back out to
that crime scene,

899
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,379
see if there's anything
we haven't missed.

900
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:53,513
Appreciate it.

901
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,114
If you expect to win
arguments around here,

902
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,413
you will need
at least one doctorate.

903
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,346
I am Dr. Brennan's
grad student.

904
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:03,214
I'm aware.

905
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:04,813
Once I get my doctorate,

906
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,446
she will take on
another grad student.

907
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:08,080
My job here will go
to that person.

908
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:10,646
You have a first-rate mind,
Mr. Addy.

909
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:13,013
You can't assist
Dr. Brennan forever.

910
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:20,147
I really hope
this is necessary.

911
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:21,913
He's comfortable here.

912
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,780
He's enamored
with Dr. Brennan,

913
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:25,646
and he's stopped working
on his thesis. It's necessary.

914
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,546
It's just...
( <i>sighs</i> )

915
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:28,980
I like the guy.

916
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,780
So do I.

917
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:33,747
Which is why we must think of
what's best for him.

918
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:35,646
It's time for Mr. Addy
to grow up.

919
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:42,513
So, you say Dani knows
the desert pretty well?

920
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,214
That's right.

921
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,446
If it were you here
stranded, which way
would you go?

922
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:50,147
Highway's about
a five-day walk that way.

923
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,546
Mexico is three days
that way, and...

924
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:54,513
that way's two days to a ranch.

925
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,847
You might find some stock water,
but I wouldn't count on it.

926
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:58,546
And the terrain is rougher.

927
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:00,246
So, it all depends on
how much water she had.

928
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:02,646
Is there any way
to know?

929
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:06,180
All right, look, we'll
take a point off this
compass, all right?

930
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:09,080
Walk out in a straight line
for 15 minutes,

931
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:10,513
we look for tracks.

932
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,747
Good?

933
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:22,646
* *

934
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:52,214
* *

935
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,080
* *

936
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,214
You all right?

937
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:33,379
* *

938
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:37,379
Dani went that way.

939
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,480
Okay.

940
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:53,847
* *

941
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,913
* *

942
00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:32,214
Ready to go home?

943
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,379
Yeah.

944
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,646
You're not coming
back again, are you?

945
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:45,780
No.

946
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:48,379
Never.

947
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:52,980
He loved me.

948
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:55,147
For three weeks a year.

949
00:40:55,214 --> 00:40:57,513
No.

950
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,114
He loved me all the time.

951
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,013
I was the one who could only
manage three weeks a year.

952
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:09,313
Oh, I'm afraid that I...

953
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm just afraid that I don't
have a generous heart.

954
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:13,546
I'm afraid

955
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,379
that I won't...

956
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:18,813
have the chance that I had
with Kirk ever again.

957
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:21,747
You will.

958
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,680
How can you be so sure?

959
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:30,279
Because nothing in this universe
happens just once, Angela.

960
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:32,313
Nothing.

961
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:34,780
Infinity goes
in both directions.

962
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:39,580
There is no unique event,
no singular moment. 

963
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:43,313
I don't know what that means.

964
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:45,913
It means
you will get another chance.

965
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,980
You promise?

966
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,646
From your heart?

967
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,913
Better.

968
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,813
From my head.

969
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,313
And yes,

970
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:01,913
Ange, I promise... 

971
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,947
from my heart...

972
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:05,913
you will get another chance.

973
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,346
* *

974
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:14,180
Well, Dawes and his deputies,
they caught the counterfeiters.

975
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:16,379
Dani gave a statement saying
that it was Kellogg

976
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,246
who pulled the
trigger on Kirk.

977
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:20,379
Dani knows that you saved
her life.

978
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,379
You pointed that helicopter
in the right direction.

979
00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:24,114
Obviously, you
subconsciously

980
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,013
sifted through
the rational facts

981
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,013
of the case
and processed

982
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,847
the most likely scenario.

983
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,613
I'm sure that's it.

984
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,413
Yeah, what else could it be?

985
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,379
Well, it's the only
rational explanation.

986
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:37,180
Are you guys
making fun of me?

987
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:38,513
( <i>sighs</i> )

988
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,379
You know, let's go back home.
You know?

989
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:43,147
Where there's water, shelter
and living things.

990
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:45,246
Come on!

991
00:42:54,246 --> 00:42:57,279
* *
