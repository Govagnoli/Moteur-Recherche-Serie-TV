1
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:11,717
God, I can't deal with any more
kids poking at me.

2
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:13,821
At least you get the kids.
I get their dads.

3
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,698
Letches all want me
to sit on their laps.

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,657
I don't much care for the way Santa
is gawking at you either.

5
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:22,216
Don't do that.
You're too pretty to smoke.

6
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,393
Next you're going to tell me,
it'll stunt my growth.

7
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:25,937
Be nice now, it's Christmas.

8
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,107
- What's that smell?
- What do you want?

9
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:31,342
It's the back of a mall.

10
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,919
I have a very sensitive nose.

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,309
Don't walk. Why are you walking?

12
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:38,729
Let's just sit.
It's coming from over here.

13
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,055
There's something.

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,703
Probably old hot dogs or a dead cat.

15
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,787
No, no, no, don't touch.

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,189
Let me.

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,152
Jail's not too bad.

18
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:05,704
I get meals with your brother. We go
out on these work details together.

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,958
You haven't asked me why
I'm strapped in these chains.

20
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:10,105
Well, you're in jail.

21
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,815
No, I'm in dress rehearsal for
a Christmas Carol.

22
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,167
You're Jacob Marley?

23
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:19,748
I wanted to be Scrooge, but some triple
homicide in Cell Block H got the part.

24
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,463
You don't want to know how.

25
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,763
What are you gonna do for Christmas?

26
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:27,345
I'm doing what I always do.
I'm going on a trip.

27
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:28,646
To New York?

28
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:31,914
Peru. National Geographic found
a new step pyramid

29
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:34,589
at an ancient ceremonial site
known as El Brujo.

30
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:36,508
1,500-year-old skeletons.

31
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,534
Part of a very mysterious culture
called the Moche.

32
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:41,796
Well, unless they're elves,
it's not very Christmassy.

33
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,348
No, they aren't elves.

34
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:45,866
You know what I'd like?

35
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:49,526
I'd like to spend another
Christmas with kids...

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,005
with a family, with a tree.

37
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:54,843
You're in jail, Dad.

38
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,528
So is Russ.

39
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:58,935
Mom's dead.

40
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,666
And Christmas is overrated anyway.

41
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,581
People expect it to be so perfect,
and it never is.

42
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:09,110
I'm really looking forward to
the skeletons in El Brujo.

43
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:12,056
Christmas and skeletons
do not go together.

44
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,930
I remember the Christmas you and Mom...

45
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,250
gave me the toolbox.

46
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,618
That was great.

47
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:22,266
Yeah, except that
the toolbox was for Russ.

48
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,653
But you decided that it was yours,
and he let you have it.

49
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,006
He did?

50
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,007
Yeah.

51
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:32,377
I hope some day that, uh...

52
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,321
we can all have Christmas
together again.

53
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,341
- I doubt it, Dad.
- Lie to me. I can pretend.

54
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,969
I've got to go look at a dead person.

55
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:43,270
You never were any good
at sugarcoating anything.

56
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:53,755
You've got that sad little

57
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:56,764
girl look on your face after
you've been with your dad.

58
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,098
No, I don't.

59
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:02,292
He wishes we could spend
Christmas together with Russ.

60
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,402
Do it.

61
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,040
They're both in jail.

62
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,304
It's impossible.

63
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,042
What are your plans?

64
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:11,542
I'm thinking of driving the truck
right off the bridge.

65
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:14,463
I'm being melodramatic and self-pitying.

66
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:15,573
You love Christmas.

67
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,751
I love it, you know, when I have Parker.

68
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:22,460
This year, he's going skiing in Vermont
with Rebecca and Captain Fantastic.

69
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,454
Who's Captain Fantastic?

70
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,164
It's her boyfriend.
Commands a Coast Guard cutter.

71
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,961
His last name isn't literally
Fantastic, is it?

72
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,371
Might as well be.

73
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,325
You know they have a
trailer at the jail.

74
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,033
Mostly for conjugal visits.

75
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,551
Captain Fantastic is in jail?

76
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,631
No, your dad.

77
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,588
You could give him what
he wants for Christmas.

78
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,570
- Pull a few strings.
- I'm not a string puller.

79
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,565
- I've seen you pull some strings.
- My father is a murderer and a thief.

80
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:48,531
Murders and thieves...
they get Christmas, too.

81
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,146
In fact, it's kind of the point.

82
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,681
Well, I have other plans.

83
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,649
Whatever they are, skeletons
and Christmas do not mix.

84
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,965
That's exactly what my father said.
Where are we going?

85
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:02,215
Early Christmas present for you, Bones.

86
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:03,605
Dead guy in the sewer.

87
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,814
Cold enough as it is.
Let's get this done here.

88
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,269
Great.

89
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:15,919
Had to be Santa.

90
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:18,381
You'd thinks someone who could
squeeze up and down chimneys

91
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:19,861
would find the sewer a snap.

92
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:21,145
Rats got to him.

93
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:24,644
Like huge bacterial count,
unseasonably warm weather...

94
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,596
explains why the rats found
him so digestible.

95
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,483
He was washed down through
the sewer system.

96
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,912
I mean, look at all the stuff
that's around him.

97
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:33,666
Uphill is that way.

98
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:36,758
Busiest shopping district during
the busiest shopping season.

99
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,039
Maybe he worked up there.

100
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:40,951
Or he was pushed out of
a low-flying sleigh.

101
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:43,448
Cynicism from you at Christmas?

102
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:45,438
- What happened?
- Nothing.

103
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:48,009
Rebecca is taking Parker to
Vermont for the holidays.

104
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,272
That sucks majorly.

105
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:50,625
It does suck majorly.

106
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:53,408
So what do you say we just get
back to our dead Santa here.

107
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:54,926
He's not Santa, Booth.

108
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,783
He's a dead man in a costume.

109
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:59,625
Well, the beard looks
real and he's pretty fat.

110
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,135
Which doesn't make him Santa.

111
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,842
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

112
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,187
Aw, three days before Christmas
and somebody kills Santa.

113
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:19,828

--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

117
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,581
We'll send his gloves
to the FBI crime lab,

118
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,109
see if they can get any fingerprints
from the inside.

119
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:47,878
Damage here on
the left side of the skull

120
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,106
suggests a strong blow to the
left temporal bone.

121
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:51,999
So Santa was definitely murdered.

122
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,139
Someone did not like their present.

123
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,760
There's copious insect activity
from the sewer.

124
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:00,422
I'm intrigued that the Santa myth
survived so far into modern times.

125
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:02,463
Children, Dr. Addy, it's for children.

126
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,261
These duds are not
department store issue.

127
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,546
This is real ermine.

128
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,015
It's a hand-tailored suit.

129
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:10,580
Which I'd like to get off of him after
you two finish your scraping and...

130
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:16,004
Not that that isn't all
very, very important.

131
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,668
What Santa is supposed to do is
clearly impossible.

132
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,286
He keeps a list, checks it twice,
what's the big deal?

133
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,379
If you take into account all
believers of the myth,

134
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:26,539
factor in time zones, rotation of the
Earth, assume Santa travels east to west

135
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,722
he'd have to make approximately 822.6
visits per second to reach every child.

136
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,532
So Santa parks his sleigh,
unloads presents,

137
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,904
fills stockings, eats snacks,
gets back into his sleigh

138
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:39,151
and is on to the next house in
about one-one-thousandth of a second?

139
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,071
Children have to be stupid
to accept that.

140
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:44,351
Okay, first of all, children are not
stupid, they're just children.

141
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,888
Second, Santa is magic.

142
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,379
Let's identify the victim, shall we?

143
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,380
There's an ellipsoid aperture
in the mandibular left canine

144
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,956
and first premolar, consistent
with pipe smoking.

145
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:03,982
Plus, traces of residue on the canine...

146
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,505
could this be clay?

147
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:08,047
Santa is often portrayed
smoking a clay pipe.

148
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,203
All right, all right, very funny boys.

149
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,381
Come on, where's your holiday spirit?

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,409
Based on the degree of
bloating and purge fluids,

151
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:18,972
I'd estimate time of death between
72 and 96 hours ago.

152
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:21,409
Check the sewer sludge and bugs
and give me a confirmation.

153
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:24,605
Phorid fly maggots, third instar.

154
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:28,193
And they appear to have
been well-fed as well.

155
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,943
Santa was around some other
food source before he died.

156
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,437
My bet's on milk and cookies.

157
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,611
This is not Miracle on 34th Street.

158
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:36,654
We're not saying this is
actually Santa Claus.

159
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,729
We're merely anatomizing the evidence.

160
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:41,274
Okay, it's still rough, but...

161
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,510
this might help.

162
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:48,542
Dad wants to spend Christmas
with the family.

163
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:52,348
So how are you going to arrange it,
bust me and Dad out?

164
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:55,131
There are trailers for conjugal visits.

165
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,113
We might be able to use one of those.

166
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:01,168
And I talked to Amy and she said she
could bring the girls down to see you.

167
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,157
You shouldn't have done that.

168
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,018
Amy said the girls
had been asking about you.

169
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,430
I lied to them, Tempe.

170
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:10,306
The girls don't even know I'm in here.

171
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,329
They think I went overseas to work.

172
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:14,507
You're deserting them, just like Dad.

173
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,568
You think it would be better
for them to find out

174
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:19,122
that the guy they think is so wonderful
is actually a criminal?

175
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,258
When I found out Dad was not dead,
I was happy

176
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,729
- even if it turned out that he was...
- A murderer?

177
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,700
You are not a murderer, Russ.

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,205
It doesn't sound like a good
Christmas present to me.

179
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,934
- You could explain it...
- No, Tempe, it's not going to happen.

180
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:47,202
Can't you sleep on your own couch?

181
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,341
I'm just waiting for the squints
to find out something.

182
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:52,741
How'd it go with Russ?

183
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,571
He says he doesn't
want the girls to come.

184
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,605
Your Dad... he wants the whole
Christmas package, you know,

185
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:59,792
the tree, the kids, the presents,
the whole shebang.

186
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,853
Well, the whole shebang is impossible.

187
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,315
Christmas is about making
the impossible happen.

188
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,330
You mean like you spending
Christmas with Parker.

189
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,337
Okay, you know what, that hurt.

190
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:13,396
Wake me up when the squint squad
finds out something.

191
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,288
Victim appears to have odd-shaped
remodeling on his sacrum,

192
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:21,724
with a sclerotic margin
around the injury.

193
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:23,635
Some kind of old injury?

194
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:27,232
Two small indentations here,

195
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:31,626
consistent with trauma from impact
with some sort of cloven-hoof?

196
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,638
Cloven, like a reindeer?

197
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,392
Oh, thank God you're here.

198
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:39,353
This is so wasted on me alone.

199
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:42,367
Evidence is evidence whether
anyone is there to hear it or not.

200
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,780
Our victim was kicked by a reindeer.

201
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,883
Oh, get the hell out of here.

202
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,610
The sacrum.

203
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,715
Wait, wait.

204
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:54,597
The evidence actually adds up to
an old fat man

205
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:58,017
with a white beard and a custom-made
Santa suit who smoked a clay pipe

206
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,420
and got kicked in the ass by a reindeer?

207
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:10,147
FBI lab got partial prints off the
gloves and AFIS found a possible match.

208
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:13,347
Apparently, our victim worked for
the school board.

209
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:14,482
As a teacher?

210
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:15,626
No.

211
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,121
He was a Santa Claus.

212
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:18,545
A Santa Claus?

213
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,742
Or the Santa Claus?

214
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:22,111
Check out his name.

215
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,033
"Kristopher Kringle."

216
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,288
According to AFIS, it's his legal name.

217
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,840
- There's the old Dutch "Sinterklaas..."
- Watch out!

218
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,909
- I'm looking.
- You're going to get hit by a car.

219
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:34,552
He had a partner named Black Peter, who
carried a whip to beat naughty children.

220
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,722
Myths are traditionally used to
control behavior.

221
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,576
For instance, the story of Moses
bringing the Ten Commandments...

222
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,562
You're equating Moses to Santa?

223
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:45,053
Well, Santa is usually considered
more jolly, but...

224
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,586
Okay, great. We're looking
for 223 Hudson.

225
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:50,391
I'm sorry you can't be
with Parker, Booth.

226
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,927
What are you going to do, right?

227
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,547
He's got to face the facts sometime.

228
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,465
She shouldn't take him away,
not at Christmas.

229
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:57,096
Not the way he feels about you.

230
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,749
Oh, my God.

231
00:10:58,816 --> 00:10:59,717
What?

232
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,782
He lives in a toy store.

233
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,055
Watch out for reindeer.

234
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,173
Really funny.

235
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,073
Parker would love this place.

236
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:26,792
Look at this!

237
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,195
Gingerbread...

238
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,530
he's got the train.

239
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:44,528
This might explain the reindeer kick
to Kringle's sacrum.

240
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:55,293
Ha! You got to be kidding me.
Bones, look at this.

241
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:58,405
This guy was committed.

242
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,354
Or should've been.

243
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:16,471
Hey, Bones.

244
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:18,804
Check this out.

245
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:21,128
Hidden compartment.

246
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:30,119
Looks like Santa was planning on
buying a lot of toys.

247
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,340
Kris rented this place
from me for six years.

248
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,009
Do you know where he lived before that?

249
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,754
Actually, that wasn't my first question.

250
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,057
He wrote his previous
address on the lease.

251
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:47,421
North Pole?

252
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,813
Aw! Come on with that.

253
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,416
It turned out to be a good question.

254
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:51,964
You actually accepted that address?

255
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,539
Are you kidding? How many guys
want to live above a toy store?

256
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:55,724
It's noisy.

257
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,841
And Kris gave me first and last
month, up front, in cash.

258
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,946
Kris Kringle, from the North Pole,
lives above a toy store...

259
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:05,842
this is further evidence that
our victim is, indeed,

260
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,657
the mythic figure known as Santa Claus.

261
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,284
Mythic, coming from the Latin "myth,"

262
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,051
meaning he doesn't actually exist.

263
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,098
No, from the Greek mythos,
meaning "word."

264
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,317
- He does not...
- This, right here...

265
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:21,184
What can you tell us about
Mr. Kringle's personal finances?

266
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,878
Like I said, he always paid cash.

267
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:23,954
Where did he work?

268
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,654
An employment agency called Temp
Time, on 7th, by the Convention Center.

269
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:30,051
- Ha! Couldn't have been Santa.
- Why?

270
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,254
Because Santa wouldn't have
worked at a temp agency.

271
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:33,708
Why not? His work is seasonal.

272
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,804
- It doesn't...
- He wouldn't...

273
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,075
Kringle pay his rent on time?

274
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:42,054
Always, at least,
until the last couple of months.

275
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,532
Really? 'Cause, you know what?

276
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,384
Obviously, he wasn't short on funds

277
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:48,150
with all the money we found in the
secret compartment of his drawer.

278
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,477
Son of a bitch.

279
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,493
1,200 bucks of that is mine.

280
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:55,033
All of this is rumpled, small bills,
except for these...

281
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,451
eight $50 bills.

282
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,746
Brand new, with sequential
serial numbers.

283
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,949
I don't know about any of this...

284
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,074
Did you, uh...

285
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,878
guys have some kind of a disagreement?

286
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,504
Is that why he was holding out on you?

287
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,686
No. No.

288
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:08,525
No.

289
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:15,115
Maybe. Kris gave me some ideas on a toy,

290
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:16,905
which I patented and...

291
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:17,848
It sold?

292
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:21,863
Somebody took a picture of TomKat's
kid with it, so it sort of took off.

293
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:24,951
Wow. Kringle could have sued
you for a chunk of that cash.

294
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,187
He never actually told me
he wanted a cut.

295
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:29,654
Maybe... he just stopped
paying his rent.

296
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:36,681
Thinking of Parker?

297
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,482
No.

298
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,869
- Thinking about your dad?
- No.

299
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:44,309
Russ.

300
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,751
You can't blame him for not wanting
those girls to know the truth.

301
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:48,970
He's living a lie.

302
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,297
You'd never do that.

303
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,555
Well, not never.

304
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:52,601
I mean, I'd...

305
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:55,439
I lie to Parker,
especially this time of year.

306
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:56,495
What about?

307
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:57,986
I tell him that Santa's coming.

308
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:58,791
Really?

309
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,098
It's Santa Claus!

310
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,494
The Santa myth is based on blackmail:
Be good or you won't get any presents.

311
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:06,014
No, it's not a lie-lie, Bones.

312
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,142
It's more like everybody agreeing

313
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,470
that up to a certain age, kids
deserve to live

314
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:11,881
a different kind of truth.

315
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,533
By that reasoning, what we should do

316
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,637
is figure out a lie Russ
could tell the girls

317
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,263
so they wouldn't know he was in jail.

318
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,042
That is a brilliant Christmas idea.

319
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:23,865
It was intended to be a scathing
and incisive comment.

320
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:26,661
Give Russ civvies,
the girls think he's flown in

321
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,231
especially to visit his father
in jail at Christmas.

322
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,694
Where would we say he's been?

323
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,282
Building a bridge in... Addis Ababa.

324
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:38,403
Addis Ababa is the landlocked
capital of Ethiopia.

325
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,335
Fine. You know what?
Just make up your own lie.

326
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:42,029
I don't believe in lying to children.

327
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,783
You just want to go to Peru
without feeling guilty.

328
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:48,170
You need to accept that you won't
have Parker this Christmas.

329
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,797
I am no tenjoying this holiday
season at all.

330
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,983
Yeah, well, neither am I.

331
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,473
The shadow on the X ray is
a slight depression

332
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,335
of the outer endocranial table.

333
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:05,137
Fracture's levered inward.

334
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:07,190
There are no signs of remodeling.

335
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:12,147
This localized staining suggests

336
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,671
that his superficial temporal
artery was punctured.

337
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,303
Very likely the cause of death.

338
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:18,314
So Santa was conked on the head.

339
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:19,812
The question is: With what?

340
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,557
I'll run it under the scanning
electron microscope.

341
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,879
So... what are you doing for Christmas?

342
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,376
Going home to Michigan.

343
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,440
What about you?

344
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,206
Family cruise.

345
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,424
Sounds nice.

346
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,747
You'd think so.

347
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,637
Let me know what you find.

348
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:37,810
Kris is dead?

349
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:39,089
Afraid so.

350
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:42,610
Man, I had bad feeling
something was wrong.

351
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,621
I mean, it's not like Kris to miss work.

352
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,207
Especially not this time of year.

353
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,705
I called him a hundred times.

354
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:48,606
Twelve.

355
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:50,094
Twelve times.

356
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,769
We listened to his answering machine.

357
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,680
There are a lot of Santas here.

358
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:55,897
Yeah, but Kris was my numero uno.

359
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,785
I mean, all the guys knew that here.

360
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,518
In fact, if it wasn't for him,

361
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:02,087
I never would've thought about
getting into the Santa business.

362
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,517
Christmas is not going to be
the same without Kris Kringle.

363
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,813
Anthropologically, what exactly
would it mean

364
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,540
to be a Numero Uno Santa Claus?

365
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:10,885
Well, Kris got the best gigs.

366
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:12,896
Any of the other Santas...
They get jealous?

367
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:14,357
Jealous enough to kill?

368
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:15,233
Come on.

369
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,813
Is this about Kris?

370
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,507
Did something happen to him?

371
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,073
Who are you?

372
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:23,122
I- I'm... Jeff Mantell.

373
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,599
What happened to Kris?

374
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,063
Kris was murdered.

375
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,124
Everybody!

376
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:33,136
The dead Santa on the news...

377
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,877
it was Kris.

378
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,166
What can you tell me about Kris?

379
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,626
Kris made a guy proud
to wear the uniform.

380
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,709
Sure he did!

381
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:45,783
That's the truth.

382
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,291
Was-Was Kris murdered?

383
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,012
Um, all the Santas just need
to take a step back.

384
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:51,999
Any help you need, guys,
anything at all.

385
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,201
Why are you limping?

386
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,916
Oh, my shins. You want to see them?

387
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,692
No... Why would I
want to see your shins?

388
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:59,528
Children get to a certain age
and they think it's hilarious

389
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,247
to kick Santa in the shins.

390
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:02,791
That's... I, uh...

391
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:05,170
I'd like to talk to anyone who
knew Kris personally.

392
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:08,275
I only met Kris at the diner down
the street a couple of weeks ago.

393
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,446
Whoever smells like the wet sweater,
really needs to take a step back.

394
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:14,686
I was out of work, late on my alimony,
and the man saved me.

395
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,188
He got me this job.

396
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,566
Sad, but familiar tale with Kris.

397
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,676
Typical Kris.

398
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:21,352
Always looking to help out.

399
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:22,776
Anybody know of any trouble?

400
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,691
- Or arguments?
- Differences of opinion?

401
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,110
I can't even imagine that.

402
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:28,981
No, the man was truly,
sincerely... jolly.

403
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:31,104
We couldn't find a record
of his bank account.

404
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:32,940
Oh, well, I cash Kris's checks.

405
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:36,040
What would Mr. Kringle do during
the three other seasons?

406
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:38,475
Well, Kris was my only
full-time, temp Santa.

407
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:41,851
You know, sometimes for the odd
ad campaigns who need a Santa.

408
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,133
Car dealerships, ice cream parlors.

409
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:46,802
Sometimes hospitals had
Christmas in July.

410
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:50,925
Ironically, the only night Kris wouldn't
work was Christmas Eve.

411
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,440
His special night.

412
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,754
His night to deliver toys and
goodies around the world.

413
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,477
We'd always tease him about that.

414
00:18:58,535 --> 00:18:59,904
He never denied it.

415
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,825
The maggots in dead Santa's collar

416
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:08,696
fed on high concentrations of
non-sulfated chondroitin

417
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:11,742
glycosaminoglycans and
N-acetylneuramic acid.

418
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,116
This is why Booth hates talking to you.

419
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:17,671
It's the regurgitated saliva of
male Aerodramus fuciphagus.

420
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,390
Wait, Booth hates talking to me?

421
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,610
Not you specifically... Lab people.

422
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,526
What's Aerodramus fuciphagus?

423
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,500
The main ingredient in Bird's Nest Soup.

424
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,742
It's a rare Chinese delicacy,
made from the nests of swiftlets.

425
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,443
It's more like bird spit soup,
if you ask me.

426
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,361
So our victim was in China?

427
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,761
I'm thinking Chinatown is more likely.

428
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,375
But I also found similar traces of

429
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:45,059
the same stuff on the back of
Santa's pants, mostly on the rear end.

430
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,286
He sat in it?

431
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,382
Yeah, let's hope that's
how it got there.

432
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,013
How common is this dish?

433
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:53,531
A single kilogram of white swiftlet
nest cost two grand.

434
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:55,073
Let's see who makes it here in DC.

435
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,293
Done and done.

436
00:19:56,873 --> 00:20:00,396
These people all seem pretty upset
to have lost one of their own.

437
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,282
I mean, they keep referring
to "the uniform"

438
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:04,468
like soldiers or cops.

439
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,305
According to Hodgins, Kris Kringle
was probably killed

440
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:11,747
in or near a restaurant called
"Kum Jug Yuen" up in Chinatown.

441
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,100
- How'd he figure that out?
- Do you really want to know?

442
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:15,640
- You tell me.
- No, you don't.

443
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,824
I'm gonna trust you on that.

444
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,270
If you don't mind, I have a meeting
with Caroline Julian

445
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:20,700
at your office in ten minutes.

446
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,677
Is it about the trailer for
your dad's Christmas?

447
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,855
You think she'll help?

448
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,032
Caroline's a lawyer...

449
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:27,602
She'll help, but she'll ask you
to do something in return.

450
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:28,692
That's fair.

451
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,043
Yeah, hold that thought.

452
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:36,606
I thought you were going to
Brazil for Christmas.

453
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:37,424
Peru.

454
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:38,650
Whatever.

455
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:42,194
It's south of the equator, doing bone
things with bone people.

456
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,707
I checked with the people at the jail,

457
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:47,978
and for my father to get
the conjugal trailer,

458
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:51,725
the prosecutor in charge of his case has
to submit a written recommendation.

459
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,586
You're the prosecutor in
charge of his case.

460
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:59,069
I'm aware of that.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

461
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,802
So... will you?

462
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,959
You going to Brazil and all,

463
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:09,689
what's the use of Max being in that
conjugal trailer all by himself?

464
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,825
Well, I'm trying to persuade
my brother to celebrate

465
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,549
Christmas with his family in there, too.

466
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,970
A yuletide gathering of
the Brennan criminal element.

467
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:18,264
What do you mean "trying"?

468
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:21,117
Russ doesn't want his stepdaughters
to know that he's in jail.

469
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,755
How do you persuade them otherwise

470
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,225
if they're actually having
Christmas in the jail?

471
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,257
One other thing, the warden
says "no Christmas tree."

472
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,337
That's right.

473
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,247
Three years ago, somebody made
a shiv out of the star.

474
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,560
Now, no trees or ornaments of any kind.

475
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,273
Isn't that a little dreary?

476
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:39,252
Hey, don't kill people,
don't get sent to prison,

477
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,823
have a Christmas pageant in your
own home every year.

478
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:44,860
So, will you?

479
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:47,029
I will.

480
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:48,769
You will?

481
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,950
Thank you.

482
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,296
On one condition.

483
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,468
Booth said you'd say that.

484
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:55,609
Did he say I'd ask you to kiss him?

485
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:58,016
No.

486
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,685
Well, are you?

487
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,386
No cheeks, no noses, right on the lips.

488
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:05,660
People kiss people on the nose?

489
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,052
I want you to kiss
him under some mistletoe.

490
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,135
Kiss Booth?

491
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,662
That's right, cherie.

492
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:14,701
Why?

493
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,672
Because it will amuse me.

494
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:18,678
Why?

495
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:22,979
Because you're all "Dr. Brennan" and
"Special Agent Seeley Booth"

496
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:26,417
and it's Christmas and I have a puckish
side that will not be denied.

497
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,218
Puckish?

498
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,345
What's the matter?
You don't think I can be puckish?

499
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:31,374
I never thought about it until now.

500
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:33,405
You want me to write that letter,

501
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:36,417
you kiss Booth on the lips,
for no less than

502
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,620
one-steamboat, two-steamboat...

503
00:22:38,662 --> 00:22:40,048
five-steamboats.

504
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,387
That's blackmail.

505
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:42,551
That's correct.

506
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:43,829
That's unethical.

507
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:46,392
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

508
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:48,310
What about a tree?

509
00:22:48,394 --> 00:22:50,179
No Christmas tree. No way.

510
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,624
Not even if you squeeze his buttocks.

511
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,655
I don't know.

512
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,630
Couldn't I just... take you out
to dinner some time?

513
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:01,954
You kiss Seeley Booth on the lips

514
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:04,908
and I'll make sure your daddy
has his dream Christmas.

515
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:09,404
No tree, mind you, but otherwise, as
good as an accused murderer can expect.

516
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,144
Look, you ever see this man before?

517
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:22,513
Santa Claus?

518
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,741
No, this isn't actually Santa Claus.

519
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:27,315
The guy that's wearing the Santa outfit
in this picture.

520
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,084
Have you ever seen him?

521
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,441
Can I see your I. D. again, please?

522
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
- Booth.
- What?

523
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:35,354
Your kid like roaches?

524
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,713
Gromphadorhina, man, hissing roach.

525
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,406
Hey, grab me this container?

526
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,363
This is a great pet, man.

527
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:42,619
Perfect Christmas gift.

528
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,706
No. Did you find the
bird's nest maggots yet?

529
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,941
Still looking.

530
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:47,389
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

531
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:50,601
Whoa, whoa, pal,
I am the cops, all right?

532
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:54,699
Any fights out here back in
the alley in the past four days?

533
00:23:54,757 --> 00:23:57,281
No, I don't come out
here since I quit smoking.

534
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,370
It stinks.

535
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,089
It's the cycle of life, my friend.

536
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:01,671
Quite beautiful if you get into it.

537
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:04,595
Okay, you go back inside.

538
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:06,043
But tell the rest of your staff

539
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:08,464
I'll be in in a few minutes
to ask them some questions.

540
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:13,865
Hey, pal, you better hope I don't report
this to the health department.

541
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,223
Pay dirt.

542
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:20,764
Fannia, Musca and Phoridae.

543
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:24,749
That is the exact maggots
I found on Kringle's suit.

544
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:27,048
It means this is where he was killed.

545
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,493
So if he was killed here...

546
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,151
then he was probably...

547
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:36,231
dragged over here...

548
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:40,550
to this grate and dumped
down this sewer.

549
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,770
An ignominious end for
Father Christmas, huh?

550
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,627
Whoa.

551
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:45,940
Whoa what?

552
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,927
They were near the bottom.

553
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:54,897
No cash, just I. D. s and credit.

554
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:57,229
Probably dumped there by pickpockets.

555
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,143
You found cash in Kringle's
apartment, right?

556
00:24:59,194 --> 00:24:59,944
Right.

557
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:02,299
Maybe he picked one pocket too many.

558
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:04,844
Well, we're going to find out
the owners of these wallets,

559
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:08,173
and see if they know any
Santa pickpockets.

560
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:10,665
Booth, help me out of here?

561
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,566
See you later.

562
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,891
Oh, come on...

563
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,615
Vermont is gonna be great, buddy.

564
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:22,668
Snowboarding.

565
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:25,515
- Just like when we went to Liberty.
- Mom says better than Liberty.

566
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:26,899
Well, she's right.

567
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:28,252
Can't you come?

568
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,981
If you tell Mom that I don't want to go,

569
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,750
then we could spend Christmas together.

570
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,127
Like we always do.

571
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:40,264
It's not gonna happen this year, buddy.

572
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,638
When you get back, me
and you, we'll have

573
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,749
our own Christmas, just the two of us.

574
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,494
Without Captain Fantastic.

575
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:50,056
We shouldn't call Brent
"Captain Fantastic" anymore.

576
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:51,506
Why? You do.

577
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,357
- Well, I won't anymore.
- But it's funny.

578
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:54,776
No, it's disrespectful.

579
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:59,576
And if your mom likes someone, we
should respect that and like them, too.

580
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,130
Is that true?

581
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:02,508
You like Brent?

582
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,570
Yeah, I do.

583
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,311
Are you going to be all
alone at Christmas?

584
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,731
Me? No. I'm not going to be alone.

585
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:11,599
I'll be with Bones and all our friends.

586
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,721
- I'm going to Peru.
- See? We're all going to Peru.

587
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,273
You're having Christmas in Africa?

588
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,139
- Actually, Peru is...
- Is Africa.

589
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:18,406
Isn't that right Bones?

590
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,894
Okay? I'm going to be just fine.

591
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:22,389
So come on, go wash up

592
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,872
before your mom gets here
to pick you up, all right?

593
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:26,094
I love you.

594
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,483
I love you too, buddy.

595
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:29,812
Go ahead.

596
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,638
You lied a lot to him.

597
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:35,883
It's the magic of Christmas, Bones.

598
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:45,223
So you want to tell me what happened?

599
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:47,077
I'd just come out of
the check cashing place

600
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,013
and I was off to do some
Christmas shopping.

601
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:50,718
When you were mugged by Santa.

602
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:51,776
Not mugged.

603
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,004
It was just a bump as I was
walking out of the place.

604
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,983
I said excuse me, he ho-ho-ho'd,
we went our separate ways.

605
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,852
When did you realize your
wallet was missing?

606
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,263
An hour later at the PriceCo.

607
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:03,141
I'm in the check-out line,
I'm going to pay and it's gone.

608
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:06,337
Naturally you went back the next day
and you beat the crap out of him.

609
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:10,977
I asked for my wallet back, Santa plays
all dumb and then it got physical.

610
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:12,817
It was 900 bucks, man.

611
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,855
Mr. Moussa, there are hundreds of Santas
in the DC area this time of year.

612
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:17,995
Come on

613
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:21,933
You and I are trained
law enforcement officers.

614
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,060
I got the right guy.

615
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:25,187
If it was him, he definitely
deserved a beating.

616
00:27:25,256 --> 00:27:26,288
It was him.

617
00:27:26,338 --> 00:27:28,718
And he got off lucky, because
of my self-control.

618
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:30,671
This guy, he ruined Christmas.

619
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:33,266
Egyptians... they celebrate Christmas?

620
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:36,091
I am not Muslim, Agent Booth.

621
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,203
I am Coptic.

622
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:40,401
Me, my wife, my children,
we all celebrate Christmas.

623
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,648
Except for maybe not this year
because this guy took my money.

624
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,409
And what did you do to him?

625
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:48,407
I hit him.

626
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,483
I'm not proud of that.

627
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:53,473
No pushing? No tussling?

628
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,853
Just popped him once in
the schnoz, that's it.

629
00:27:55,937 --> 00:27:57,518
You didn't roll around in the alley?

630
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,208
What alley? We were in front
of a big box store.

631
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:03,023
You didn't mean to kill him.
You just shoved him down that manhole.

632
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,904
I- I knocked him down,

633
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:07,131
the people, they don't know why,
they don't understand,

634
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:10,947
they're looking, maybe they think
I'm a terrorist, so I get out of there.

635
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:13,955
Right.

636
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,033
Do I need a lawyer?

637
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:25,030
Bones, PayFast Check Cashing confirms
cashing Moussa's paycheck.

638
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,663
The teller gave him 900 bucks
in all crisp new 50's.

639
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:29,734
Kringle had new 50's in his dresser.

640
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,406
Yup, and the serial numbers match.

641
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:33,459
Suggesting Kringle is our pickpocket.

642
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,832
Uh-huh, so we're getting a warrant
to analyze Moussa's clothing.

643
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:40,019
If there's bird soup goop on them,
we'll know he's our killer.

644
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:41,747
What is with the mistletoe?

645
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:44,023
I was going to talk to you about this.

646
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:46,353
Caroline wants us to kiss
under the mistletoe.

647
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:47,167
What?!

648
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,390
It's the only way she'll make
Christmas for my family.

649
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:50,454
By having us kiss?

650
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:51,377
Yes.

651
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:52,767
Why?

652
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:55,446
- Because she's feeling puckish.
- Puckish? What's that mean?

653
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,769
She's gonna be here any second.
Do you want some gum?

654
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,129
No, my breath is just fine.

655
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,470
All right, look, I'll have
a talk with Caroline.

656
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:02,278
No.

657
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:03,878
No?

658
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:06,115
I'm only telling you out of
professional courtesy.

659
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:08,201
- What?
- So that you won't be surprised.

660
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,387
When you say kiss,
you mean like kiss-kiss?

661
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:11,539
Like on both cheeks?

662
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:12,751
No, the lips.

663
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:16,024
Like brother and sister, colleagues.

664
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,939
French people meeting on the street.

665
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:19,450
Caroline's feeling puckish, huh?

666
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:20,798
It means playful and impish.

667
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:21,891
Congratulations.

668
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:24,207
I hear you have a suspect
in the Santa slaying.

669
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:27,487
Yeah, looks like the Easter Bunny
has nothing to worry about.

670
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,123
Did you talk to the judge
about the trailer?

671
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:31,608
Yes, I did.

672
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,315
What about your end?

673
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:35,994
Well, look at that.

674
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,175
Mistletoe.

675
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,697
You take a step to your right...

676
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:41,067
you'll be right under
that cute little sprig.

677
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,581
Was that enough steamboats?

678
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,195
Plenty.

679
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,656
A whole flotilla.

680
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:04,919
I don't know what that means, but, um...

681
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,405
Merry Christmas.

682
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,159
It was like kissing my brother.

683
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,053
You sure must like your brother.

684
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,096
She does.

685
00:30:12,171 --> 00:30:13,080
I do.

686
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,139
The trailer is all arranged.

687
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:18,071
You're good to go, cherie.

688
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,170
Merry Christmas.

689
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,362
I'm sure she feels really
foolish right now.

690
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:32,754
Well, hey, I really should...

691
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:35,051
I should get back and see if

692
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,773
the forensic guy has got anything
yet on Moussa's...

693
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:41,462
That's a good idea.
Yeah, I've got stuff...

694
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:42,512
to do, too.

695
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,377
The... for... with bones.

696
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:46,497
I understand completely.

697
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:50,970
Thanks for the gum.

698
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,312
How you doing?

699
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:58,731
Some metallic flakes
imbedded in the bone.

700
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,566
Trying to help Zack determine
what kind of weapon was used.

701
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:05,521
You know, this is our first
Christmas as a couple.

702
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:08,212
Aw, too bad Santa's dead.

703
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:13,128
I thought that we could make
Christmas decorations for our tree.

704
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,704
Is that too corny?

705
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,257
It's what my family did
when I was little

706
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:20,706
and I always thought, you know,
when I had my own family, that

707
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,233
I'd carry on the tradition.

708
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,798
Are two people a family?

709
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,972
Isn't that how every family starts?

710
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:30,762
Then I think us making decorations
is just corny enough.

711
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:38,647
I don't understand, has there
been some kind of crisis?

712
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:39,975
Yes, I have a crisis.

713
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:41,543
Bones, it was just mistletoe.

714
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:44,836
Not the kiss. That was nothing.

715
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,474
- You kissed?
- Mistletoe!

716
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,814
That's not the crisis.

717
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:48,878
Was there tongue?

718
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:50,847
You know what, get your own sex life.

719
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,320
That has nothing to do with sex.

720
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,371
- Nothing.
- No.

721
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:55,068
There was no... It was mistletoe.

722
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:56,328
Totally sexless.

723
00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:57,974
I'm all ears.

724
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,500
Just take your hat off there.

725
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:05,385
Booth, who is a very honest person,

726
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,238
says that at this time of year,

727
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,984
deception is necessary for
the happiness of little children.

728
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,115
- I'm being misquoted.
- Booth is absolutely right.

729
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:14,157
She got the gist.

730
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:16,263
Yeah, there's a fictional
element to Christmas.

731
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:19,069
You mean the whole
"Birth of a Savior" rigmarole?

732
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,329
It is not rigmarole.

733
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:21,902
- How do you know?
- Dr. Brennan.

734
00:32:21,944 --> 00:32:24,544
It's-It's the, uh, feeling of Christmas.

735
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:26,300
What people call "The Christmas Spirit."

736
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:30,193
It's a kind of dream or hope that
we carry with us from childhood.

737
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:32,868
- But as adults...
- Are you including you in that?

738
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:37,292
As adults, we're imbued by
the pragmatic routines of life,

739
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,693
which makes difficult for us to regard
anything with childlike wonder.

740
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,988
But, you know,
it's all right for us to try.

741
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,783
We put on silly hats and

742
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:46,844
drape trees with sparkly lights and

743
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:49,406
wrap gifts in garish paper,
and that's good for us.

744
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:51,862
It's not only all
right to allow children

745
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:54,949
the transient experience
of innocence and joy,

746
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,576
it's our responsibility.

747
00:32:58,287 --> 00:32:59,429
Okay.

748
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:01,003
Okay?

749
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,710
I found that very helpful.

750
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:05,769
What do you think I've been saying
for the past four days?

751
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:10,617
You're going to help me
lie to the girls?

752
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:14,752
Apparently, it's not morally
wrong to lie at Christmas.

753
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,166
What if they know I'm lying?

754
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:19,688
Apparently, sometimes
lying is a kind of gift.

755
00:33:19,746 --> 00:33:22,016
I'm hazy on the rules, but the idea is

756
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,877
even if they know you're lying,
they know you're doing it out of love.

757
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,496
Where are you getting this? Because,

758
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,607
I'm in jail, and I'm getting
better advice.

759
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,404
Look, Russ, we have a plan.

760
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,741
I bring you some civilian clothes,

761
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:36,444
the girls think you popped
in from Addis Ababa.

762
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:37,516
Addis Ababa?

763
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:38,994
What did you and Amy tell them?

764
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:40,354
We said I went to Burma.

765
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:41,309
Burma?

766
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:43,947
Who cares where we chose?
Burma's on the other side of the world.

767
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:45,474
Burma doesn't even exist anymore.

768
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:47,431
- What happened to it?
- It became Myanmar.

769
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,796
There's another problem
with the trailer.

770
00:33:51,307 --> 00:33:52,350
No Christmas tree.

771
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,238
Why?

772
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:55,008
Shank material.

773
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,635
- Is it important?
- Christmas with no tree?

774
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:00,179
It's a disaster. Forget it.

775
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,981
They're young, Russ.

776
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:04,022
They believe in Santa Claus.

777
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:06,045
They believe in you because

778
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,355
you love them, and
they'll sit in your lap

779
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:10,950
they'll open their presents
and they'll believe in you

780
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:14,098
and Burma and maybe
they won't notice that there's no tree.

781
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:18,195
Look, Amy will be there, Dad will be
there, the girls will be there.

782
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:19,138
And you?

783
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:20,846
I was going to, but...

784
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,485
we're not the only people
getting the trailer ans

785
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:26,950
I thought it would be in the afternoon,
but now it's Christmas Eve and...

786
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:29,420
I gotta be on that plane.

787
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:31,068
To Peru?

788
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,310
Tempe, Dad wants us all.

789
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:37,669
You're one of us.

790
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,368
You found what killed Kris Kringle?

791
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:45,859
- We know what it was made of.
- And we know the shape.

792
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:50,400
Something crescent-shaped and brass?

793
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:54,452
I couldn't find anything this shape,
but by making a slight paradigm shift...

794
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:58,223
- The paradigm shift was my idea.
- And slightly change the angle...

795
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,259
A circle, not a crescent.

796
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,412
I believe the mark left on
Kris Kringle's skull

797
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:05,016
was the result of being struck
with a circular object

798
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:07,306
approximately 15 centimeters
in diameter.

799
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:08,575
Six inches.

800
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:09,559
A bell.

801
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,216
A brass bell.

802
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:14,082
Meaning he was probably
attacked by another Santa.

803
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,525
Everybody have your bells?

804
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:20,057
Aw, right, right!

805
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:21,584
Enough! Stop!

806
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,141
You can tell the elves they can go now.

807
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,636
Elves go for coffee.

808
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:28,745
See you later.

809
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,386
What's the use of Elves without Santa?

810
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,837
- Those bells are all the same.
- Yeah, I buy 'em in bulk.

811
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:35,554
- I sell them to the Santas for cost.
- Is that Kris's idea?

812
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,805
Yeah, how did you know?

813
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:38,285
Just getting a feel for the guy.

814
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,466
We have a warrant here
to inspect your bells.

815
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,761
Inspect our what?

816
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:43,822
Bells, Larry.

817
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:44,746
Uh, why?

818
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:46,919
Agent Booth and I are gonna
swab each of your bells

819
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:49,506
with a cotton ball soaked
in phenolthalein.

820
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,595
Is it gonna sting?

821
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:52,522
Bells, Larry. She said bells.

822
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:54,212
You need a hearing aid, Larry.

823
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:56,344
Why are they antisepticising our bells?

824
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:59,257
Ho, ho, ho, ho, steady there, Santa.

825
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:01,493
Why do you need a warrant
to disinfect a bell?

826
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:02,945
What's the matter there, Santa?

827
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:05,261
They're looking for something
and they're not telling us.

828
00:36:05,302 --> 00:36:06,838
Look, I read the warrant.

829
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:08,319
It's the law.

830
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:10,028
Just give him the bell. so we can go.

831
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:12,572
- Jeff, just show them the bell.
- Come on, give us your bell.

832
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:13,421
No.

833
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,171
Listen, buddy, I'm not going to see
my son for Christmas this year,

834
00:36:16,238 --> 00:36:19,369
so I'm a little annoyed with Christmas
and everything that comes along with it.

835
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,639
So give the lady the bell.

836
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,012
Give her the bell.

837
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,372
Come on, go ahead.

838
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:26,730
Thank you.

839
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:30,064
The brass plating on
this bell is chipped.

840
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:34,482
Oh, look at that.

841
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,611
Okay, Santa, you're under
arrest for murder.

842
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:37,422
What?

843
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,682
This bell is the weapon that
killed Kris Kringle.

844
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,203
No. No, no, no. I didn't kill Kris.

845
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,156
Come on, guys,
we switch bells all the time.

846
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:46,206
Now that's true.

847
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,438
All of our bells are identical,
you know.

848
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,202
We put one down and then
we just pick up another.

849
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:53,493
Okay, just hold on to
your bells there for a second.

850
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:54,579
Any ideas?

851
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:56,293
No.

852
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,073
Come on, think Bones, paint the picture.

853
00:36:58,107 --> 00:36:59,584
It's got to be one of these guys.

854
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:02,488
I mean, half of these guys owe
Kringle the money.

855
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:03,940
One of them's a pickpocket.

856
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:05,388
Gets money from the Egyptian.

857
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,766
- Can we go?
- Cool your jets, Santa.

858
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,906
Go have a cookie and some egg nog.

859
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:13,298
Kringle gets suspicious, he catches
the pickpocketer dumping

860
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,608
the wallet in the Dumpster,
confronts him...

861
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:18,798
- We have to sniff their behinds.
- We have to sniff...

862
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:21,924
- You lost me there.
- Everybody up against the wall!

863
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:25,409
Or, okay, put your hands on the table.

864
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,474
First of all that's my job,
and second... why?

865
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:29,518
They fought.

866
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,744
They rolled around through
the bird's nest soup goop.

867
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,748
- Right. Good thinking. That's good.
- Thank you.

868
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,576
Except for the sniffing
their butts thing.

869
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:38,515
You start over there, I'll start here.

870
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,859
Wait, wait, wait.
You're going to sniff my guys?

871
00:37:44,774 --> 00:37:47,982
Geez. All right, this is officially
the worst Christmas ever.

872
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,365
Don't you need a warrant for this?

873
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,736
- Hey, pal, why don't you just be quiet?
- Turn around.

874
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:03,646
- Bird's nest soup.
- Bird's nest soup.

875
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,247
It's Jeff! He killed Kris!

876
00:38:05,277 --> 00:38:06,612
Jeff killed Kris!

877
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:09,700
Are you going to pull them off?

878
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,019
Fine. Watch this.

879
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:14,703
How do you like it now, Santas?

880
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:16,480
Everybody off.

881
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,975
On your feet.
You're under arrest. Let's go.

882
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,361
The man is a disgrace to his uniform.

883
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:24,689
<i>You better watch out</i>

884
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:26,742
<i>You better not cry</i>

885
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:30,589
<i>You better not pout, I'm telling you why</i>

886
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:34,747
<i>Santa Claus is coming to town.</i>

887
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:14,666
He's fine, Rebecca.

888
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,286
Now just listen.

889
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:22,222
I will get him back to you in time
tomorrow before you leave for Vermont.

890
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:23,787
I hate Vermont.

891
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:25,871
No, I didn't tell him to say that.

892
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,372
He didn't have to find the FBI, he
just went up to a cop on the street and

893
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:35,578
told him he was lost and said
that his dad works at the FBI.

894
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,255
Come on, in you go.

895
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:09,900
That's it. Okay, buddy, here's the deal.

896
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,916
We get to spend Christmas day together,

897
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:14,828
but then I got to take you
to Vermont, understand?

898
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,846
Okay.

899
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:16,998
Will you miss Africa?

900
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,237
Africa?

901
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,500
No. I'd rather spend time with you.

902
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,199
Do we got a tree?

903
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:25,548
We got two trees.

904
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,938
- Two trees?
- Two.

905
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,661
- Why?
- Come on, I'll show you.

906
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:36,041
Here, I want you to try this, honey.

907
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:37,814
Are they having fun?

908
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,815
What are you talking about?
Of course they are.

909
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:44,272
And by the way, this is the best
Christmas that I have had in 16 years.

910
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:45,399
Me, too.

911
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:51,489
Oh, my God.

912
00:41:51,557 --> 00:41:52,572
What's wrong?

913
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:53,616
What is this?

914
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:56,111
It's just a little good cheer I made
under the mattress.

915
00:41:57,278 --> 00:41:59,155
Bones, hey, good news.

916
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:02,213
Turns out I got Parker for
Christmas after all.

917
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,816
Christmas magic, right?

918
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:08,155
Hey, so we figured we'd call and
wish you a little yuletide cheer.

919
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,308
Merry Christmas, Bones.

920
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:11,910
Thanks, Parker.

921
00:42:11,978 --> 00:42:14,724
Hey, if that's Booth, you wish him
merry Christmas for me, will you?

922
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:16,101
My dad says merry Christmas.

923
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:18,825
Listen, Bones,
I got a little something for you.

924
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,353
Oh, I got you something, too.

925
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:21,259
We can,

926
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:22,815
exchange gifts in a couple days.

927
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:25,253
Go to the window and open up
the blinds now.

928
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:26,207
What?

929
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:41,082
Hey... everybody, it looks like
we got our tree after all.

930
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,552
What?! A tree?!

931
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:45,016
Oh, my gosh!

932
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:46,522
So exciting!

933
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,083
Yes!

934
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:49,189
Isn't it pretty?

935
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:50,340
Merry Christmas.

936
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,402
I love my gift, Booth.

937
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,460
Merry Christmas, Bones.
