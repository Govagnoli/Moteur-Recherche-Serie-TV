1
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:17,926
Thanks, Kevin,
another great performance.

2
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:19,973
But open Mike night is just beginning.

3
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,143
So let's hear it
for the beautiful and persistent

4
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,890
Emma Von Helberg!

5
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,080
All right, up next,
another checker box regular.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,400
The smooth and smoky voice
of Chris Calabasa.

7
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,540
Should've left that song in the shower.

8
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,401
Couldn't listen to you
butcher it again.

9
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:26,899
All right, Chris.

10
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,300
Bastard took my tune.

11
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,103
Play "Piano Man."

12
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,938
That's original.

13
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:13,900
Every bone appears to be broken.

14
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,500
Bless you.

15
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,980
Thank you.

16
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,905
Pelvic fragments suggest it's a male.

17
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,880
- Are you okay?
- Thank you, fine. Just...

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,499
particles from the cut grass

19
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:30,747
are causing his mast cells
to release inflammatory mediators.

20
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,634
- It's just allergies, Bones.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

21
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,211
Given the degree of decomp,
he's been dead a couple of weeks.

22
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:37,280
Body dump?

23
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Lividity's indeterminate.

24
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,780
How does a former sniper
have a grass allergy?

25
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,999
I mean, wouldn't a sneeze
give away your position?

26
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,799
Bones, okay, I worked in the desert

27
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,180
it was sand, not grass.

28
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,475
It's the crunching
that got my attention.

29
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,980
Well, did you see the body
before it crunched?

30
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,980
It's not my fault. You know, Johnson
grass is eight feet high and dense.

31
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,564
It's like driving in the dark.

32
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,817
You must've been driving fast.

33
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:02,500
I had an internet date.
I wanted to get home to shower.

34
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,864
She's probably still waiting
for me at the Falafel place.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,260
You know, Johnson grass
lets off a ton of pollen, man.

36
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,370
Your eyes could swell up.
If your throat closes...

37
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,247
Allergies, okay? I'm fine.

38
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:15,051
You didn't by any chance
see a head, did you?

39
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:19,087
- The head's missing?
- I don't see it or any skull fragments.

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,630
Sorry.

41
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,580
Well, I've got
some brain matter here,

42
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,790
so he had to have a head
at some point.

43
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:31,700
Found it.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,969
Oh, my date's not gonna believe this.

45
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,880
The blade must've severed
just below the C-5 vertebra

46
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,940
and the force of the impact

47
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,900
propelled the head into the grille.

48
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:46,057
So, presumably, he was killed,
decapitated and mulched.

49
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:49,999
Could it get any worse
for this guy?

50
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,716

54
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:30,280
The bones are dense with
a high degree of robusticity.

55
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,155
That's consistent
with his musculature.

56
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,480
The guy was built.

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,700
He was probably an athlete.
I bet he was hot.

58
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah, well, now he's really not.

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,850
I think he had a cold.

60
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,780
Looks like it was a pretty bad one.

61
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:45,247
No, I found traces
of tea and honey in his stomach

62
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,538
and the remains of a throat lozenge.

63
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,880
Victim's watch. It's totally cool.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,350
Measures heart rate,
calories burned, speed, distance.

65
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,862
Jock-I rest my case.

66
00:05:56,991 --> 00:06:00,200
It's bad enough going to the gym
without getting yelled at by a watch.

67
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,780
My regime is easily
completed in my apartment.

68
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,999
Treadmill for 30 minutes,
a hundred sit-ups,

69
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,820
push-ups and leg lifts and
20 minutes of free weights.

70
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,770
I'm deceptively strong.

71
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:10,907
I'm deceived.

72
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,533
Odontology got a match.

73
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:14,194
Tommy Sour.

74
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,537
He was reported missing
two weeks ago.

75
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,254
I hear someone in there.

76
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:26,923
Hey, break down the door.

77
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:29,092
It hurts my shoulder
when I break down the door.

78
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,429
What is that annoying noise?

79
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,472
You don't just walk in...

80
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,297
I'm sorry, I had my earplugs in.

81
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,752
- Can I help you with something?
- Fbi. Special Agent Booth.

82
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:42,099
This here is dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

83
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,229
- You reported Tommy Sour missing?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:47,080
A couple weeks ago.
He lives in the unit next door.

85
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,152
Can we come in?

86
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,030
Excuse the mess.
I have a show in a month.

87
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,574
You're influenced
by the neo-expressionists.

88
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,827
No, don't even look at that.
That is crap.

89
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,412
There it goes again.

90
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:58,974
I can't focus.

91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,499
That alarm has been beeping
every two minutes

92
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:02,999
ever since Tommy went missing.

93
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,170
- Yeah, you know what? That is annoying.
- Yes. It's why I've got the earplugs.

94
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:08,657
The cops showed up,
I asked them to unplug it. They didn't.

95
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,010
- Maybe you guys could.
- Mr. Matthews, Tommy Sour is dead.

96
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:14,399
Oh, God.

97
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,348
Before he went missing, was there
anything unusual about his behavior?

98
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,183
I didn't know him all that well.

99
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,126
You reported him missing

100
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:24,026
Yeah, well, his mail started
piling up on his front door,

101
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:26,782
and then that damn alarm clock...
it's driving me crazy.

102
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:29,027
This sculpture is very impressive.

103
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,404
Yeah, it's from my pre-alarm
clock period.

104
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,240
What about strangers?
Any new faces around here?

105
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,367
Oh, wait, yeah. Fat Pam.

106
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:40,121
- Excuse me?
- She was one of Tommy's clients.

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,399
I thought you didn't know him
that well?

108
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,965
Well, he was my neighbor.

109
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:45,999
If we took the garbage out,

110
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,921
we saw each other, we'd talk
a little bit. You know what it's like.

111
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,699
Anyway, Tommy was Fat Pam's trainer

112
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,551
at, Valera Wellness.

113
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:56,554
- Must you call her "fat" Pam?
- That's what he called her.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,880
It's not like Tommy was
the nicest guy who ever lived.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
She wasn't really all that fat even.

116
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,000
You mean overweight.

117
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,230
Fat is a deposit found beneath the skin.
It consists of lipids.

118
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,780
Okay, sure.

119
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,817
Pam just wasn't one
of those fitness robots

120
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,599
that Tommy would spend his time with.

121
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:14,280
She started following Tommy
home from the gym.

122
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,600
And she'd sit out on the curb
and watch his place.

123
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:19,648
And then about a month ago,
she showed up middle of the night,

124
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,506
started banging on his door.

125
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,070
Oh, was she angry?

126
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,872
She was wearing a teddy and heels,

127
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:28,711
so I'm thinking "angry"
wasn't her prime emotion.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,130
You're implying that
she was sexually stimulated.

129
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,424
So, were they...

130
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:35,736
you know... did they...?

131
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,512
Did they have sexual intercourse?

132
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,806
If they did, it was
through a locked door.

133
00:08:40,214 --> 00:08:41,349
So... no?

134
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:44,388
- Very good, Bones. OK, let's go.
- Why are you clapping?

135
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:46,289
Thank you for your help.
You're welcome.

136
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,580
Maybe you could go turn the alarm off

137
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:49,922
or just shoot it.

138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,901
C-5 just under the hyoid.

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,080
Seems to be shaved on its front.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,999
Shaved?

141
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,781
Yes, like with a cheese slicer.

142
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,616
Must mean someone slit his throat.

143
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,825
This doesn't look like
it was caused by a knife.

144
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,680
There are no serrations,
even microscopic.

145
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:05,279
What, then?

146
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:09,122
A cheese slicer seems illogical
under the circumstances.

147
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,003
I'll start looking for alternatives.

148
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,980
These people are just trying to
get healthy, Bones. That's all.

149
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,700
There is a fine line
between health and vanity.

150
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:24,099
Well, this obsession
with physical perfection

151
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,102
clouds a society's moral vision.

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,699
You are ogling that woman.

153
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,813
- What? No, I'm not. I'm just...
- Yes, you are.

154
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,299
I'm-I'm just...
admiring her routine.

155
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,899
Hi, I'm the wellness center's
manager, Dr. Jason.

156
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,655
I understand you're with the FBI.

157
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,099
Special Agent booth.
This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan.

158
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:42,000
We're here about Tommy Sour.

159
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,953
- He in trouble?
- He's dead.

160
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,416
That explains
why he's not returning my calls.

161
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,377
You don't seem too upset about that.

162
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,599
Tommy was my most popular trainer.

163
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:57,258
Since he disappeared, I've had to deal
with a lot of angry clients.

164
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,099
You're with the FBI, that means
Tommy was murdered?

165
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:01,999
Look, you wouldn't happen
to know a woman,

166
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,015
a client... of his, Pam?

167
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:07,100
Some people referred
to her as Fat Pam.

168
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,687
I know who you mean. Pam Nunan.

169
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:12,500
She booked two-hour sessions,
paid in cash.

170
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,480
Perfect client until...

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,401
Until?

172
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,000
Until she fell in love with Tommy.

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,999
Then she started to freak him out.

174
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,116
- How so?
- Said she was "too handsy."

175
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,699
She'd rub up against him,

176
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:25,980
even invited him on a Caribbean cruise.

177
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:27,999
Would you happen to have
Ms. Nunan's address?

178
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:28,948
Sure.

179
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
- Booth.
- Yeah?

180
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,464
That does not help the investigation.

181
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:41,812
He's such a cutie, isn't he?

182
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,200
Tommy is such a wonderful person,

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,363
big heart and so devoted.

184
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:48,226
You brought a photo album?

185
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,680
You said you wanted to talk about Tommy,
I figured you'd like to see pictures.

186
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,024
Those pictures are...

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,486
they...

188
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,180
they are taken from
quite a distance, Pam.

189
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,242
He's so shy.
It's one of the things I love about him.

190
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,911
We understand that Tommy
was your personal trainer.

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,729
He was so much more than that.

192
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,082
Before I met tommy,
I was so down on myself.

193
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:12,361
But, Tommy...

194
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:14,502
He's such a sweetheart.

195
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,879
Does Tommy share your affection?

196
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,503
Why do you ask it like that?

197
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,880
Because I don't look like
a scarecrow? Like her?

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,512
Hey. Wha...
what are you coming after me for?

199
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,389
Do-do I look like a scarecrow?

200
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,558
Well, you... I think you look good.

201
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:32,180
Thank you. Like Tommy,
you see me for who I really am,

202
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,775
not scrawny.

203
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:36,899
What...? I am not scrawny.

204
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,880
My body mass index is well
within normal limits.

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,154
Could we talk about Tommy, please?

206
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,532
If he didn't love me,
why would he want to marry me?

207
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,700
Marry you?

208
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,243
He was gonna marry you?

209
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
Tommy's my life.

210
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,176
And I'm his.

211
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:53,207
Whatever you think he's done,
I know he didn't do it.

212
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,199
We're not worried about what he did.

213
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,336
It's what you might have done.

214
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,006
Tommy is dead.

215
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,200
She has body image issues,

216
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,643
which are not congruent
with her actual appearance.

217
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:16,147
She's someone who's slightly large,
who believes she's a very large woman

218
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:19,800
who can convince people
she's only slightly large.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,656
And the way people treat her
convinces her that she's right.

220
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,600
That's interesting.

221
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,799
See, you're only pretending
it's intesting.

222
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,809
It means very little to you.

223
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:30,995
That's true.

224
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:32,832
You have an irrational

225
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,416
prejudice against psychology,
probably because of emotions

226
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:37,980
that are too complicated
for you to deal with.

227
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,999
And I poke and I prod at them,

228
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:43,229
which makes them... real... and painful.

229
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,799
And yet I feel no pain,

230
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,000
just a sort of... disinterest.

231
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,800
So why don't you take your
powers of observation...

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,183
focus them on her.

233
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,784
All right.

234
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,024
She's sorting her trail mix.

235
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,218
- Does that mean something?
- She's nervous.

236
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:04,902
She's trying to control a situation
that's out of her control.

237
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,139
Or she's just bored;

238
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,823
she's been waiting almost an hour.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,455
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

240
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,540
I didn't kill Tommy; I loved him.

241
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:20,044
What's this?

242
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:21,600
I got bored.

243
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,544
Been here over an hour.

244
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,600
I believe that you loved Tommy.

245
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,380
Thank you, Agent Booth, I did.

246
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,900
But I don't believe
that he loved you back.

247
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,307
`Cause I'm not anorexic?

248
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:35,226
- Ms. Nunan...
- Call me Pam.

249
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:38,157
Pam... you were stalking him,

250
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,772
and he was avoiding you.

251
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,399
If he didn't love me,

252
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,680
why would he give me this for Christmas?

253
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
"P-A-M."
Do you know what that spells?

254
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,349
- "Pam."
- That's right.

255
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:53,786
What did you give him
before he gave you that bracelet?

256
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,205
Ah... excellent question.

257
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,666
- Why does that matter?
- Just curious.

258
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,128
A $1,000 gift certificate
to the music center.

259
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:03,380
He loved music.

260
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,646
A thousand dollars.

261
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:06,048
That's generous.

262
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,880
A way to obligate him,

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,621
try and force an emotional connection.

264
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:11,387
It's extremely passive-aggressive.

265
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,318
So do you think she killed him?

266
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,680
Well...

267
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,475
there's no question that she's deluded.

268
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,884
I mean, if she truly believed
that he was gonna marry her,

269
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:22,800
then she was setting herself up
for a tragic ending.

270
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:23,816
Tragic?

271
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:26,402
Well, one way to ensure
that he didn't leave her...

272
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:27,778
would be to kill him.

273
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,822
Tommy had a beautiful voice.

274
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,374
He dreamed of being
a professional singer,

275
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:34,200
and I wanted to support him.

276
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,717
I did everything for him.

277
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:38,873
He was mine.

278
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,709
Tommy was mine,
no matter what anyone thought.

279
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,544
When did you find him?

280
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,380
Last night, he had been
dead for two weeks.

281
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,900
I've been in Florida.

282
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:50,948
Left last month;
just got back two days ago.

283
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,787
I was with mom
and daddy planning the wedding.

284
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:57,600
The wedding with Tommy.

285
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,269
Of course, silly.

286
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,064
I'm just gonna need you to,

287
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:07,599
write down your
parents'number in Florida

288
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,778
so I can confirm your whereabouts.

289
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,600
Thanks.

290
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,204
Who's gonna love me now?

291
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,490
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:24,835
- No, no, no, don't touch her.
- Why?

293
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Thank you, Agent Booth.

294
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,799
The pathology is clear

295
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,900
she's possessive and immoral.

296
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,807
Her emotional connections are forged
through manipulation and delusion.

297
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,893
Once a connection
that tenuous breaks...

298
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,820
So she killed Tommy Sour?

299
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,699
I can't say that, of course, but...

300
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,273
she is a dangerous person.

301
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,058
Thank you. Well...

302
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,287
her story checks out.

303
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,300
She was in Florida when he was killed.

304
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,734
Her parents are devastated that their
future son-in-law, who they never met,

305
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,743
will no longer be her love monkey.

306
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,246
Well, Dr. Sweets
still thinks that she's a killer.

307
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:01,500
Dangerous.

308
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,999
- I think she's dangerous.
- I agree.

309
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,404
Thank you, Agent Booth.

310
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:09,257
All those gifts and taking
pictures from a distance

311
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:12,199
and showing up in the middle
of the night in... a nightie

312
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,680
it's all very dangerous.

313
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,012
Mocking will not change my opinion.

314
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:20,200
I've been mocked many,
many times before.

315
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:24,871
That... came out wrong.

316
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:27,012
Yeah, that's great, Sweets.
Appreciate your help,

317
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:29,099
but you know what,
she has an alibi. See ya.

318
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:32,111
Well... just be cautious of her, okay?

319
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,480
- She's not stable.
- Great. Thank you.

320
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,950
Oh. And remember,
our session on tuesday is at 4:00.

321
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,594
Trust exercises.

322
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,158
You're going to be there.

323
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,455
See ya.

324
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
I got your page.

325
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,200
Vic's tox report just came back.

326
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,900
There were trace amounts
of THC in his bloodstream.

327
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,412
That's why you paged me,

328
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:56,260
because our victim smoked marijuana?

329
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,262
No. Check out the monitor.

330
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,987
His blood was infected with a bacterium.

331
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,203
E. Coli,

332
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:04,071
and given the concentration
in his blood,

333
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,353
I'd say the infection occurred
within hours of his death.

334
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:09,154
- What was the source?
- I'm getting there.

335
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,901
The CDC tracks all E. Coli outbreaks,

336
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,199
and apparently,
the last E. Coli ground zero

337
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,115
was in Virginia at the checker box
restaurant in Alexandria.

338
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,480
The culprit: tainted raw honey

339
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,828
the same kind I found
in Tommy Sour's stomach.

340
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:41,880
Finally! I mean, one more show tune,

341
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,399
and I was gonna start shooting.

342
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,299
He has excellent projection.

343
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,852
I heard him while I was parking.

344
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:49,174
Yeah. Okay, I talked to some
of the patrons here.

345
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,900
Open Mike night is every
monday and tuesday.

346
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,765
Actually, some of these people
think this stuff is good.

347
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:58,118
What's open Mike Night?

348
00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:00,658
It's, you know,
cabaret meets karaoke

349
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:02,776
you know, singers who
want to get discovered.

350
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,037
Will you please be quiet?

351
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,706
Based on the E. Coli in Tommy's blood,

352
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:10,250
he definitely was here
shortly before he was killed.

353
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,031
Pammy said he was musical.

354
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:14,254
<i>Gotta find my corner</i>

355
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,632
This guy is not bad.

356
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,144
- You're kidding me.
- No.

357
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,680
I love his enthusiasm.

358
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,138
Dude. Do I need to get the manager?

359
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,780
Dude, actually, you know what,
that would be great.

360
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,453
Why don't you...

361
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,477
point him out to us?

362
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,899
Up next, the smooth and smoky

363
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,663
Chris Calabasa.

364
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,300
Excuse me?

365
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:48,706
Agent Booth, FBI.

366
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:51,676
Oh, come on,
I told you guys everything I know.

367
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:54,336
I bought the raw honey from a company
out of Maryland.

368
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:57,080
I gave the CDC guy the bill of sale
and the remaining honey

369
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
- What else you want from me?
- No. We're not here about the E. Coli.

370
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,971
We need to speak with you
about Tommy Sour.

371
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,500
We believe he was murdered.

372
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,600
Murdered?

373
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,604
Were you friends?

374
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,800
Well, he was good
for business, talented.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,800
Showed up at every open
mike night since day one.

376
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,658
When I didn't see
him around, I figured...

377
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,233
he got a paying gig, you know?

378
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,432
Anything unusual
about his final performance?

379
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:20,654
No. Everybody loved him, like always.

380
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:23,180
Everybody thinks
they're the next Kelly Clarkson.

381
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,534
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Who's Kelly Clarkson?

382
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,494
American Idol,

383
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:28,764
"because of you."

384
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,200
Because of me?

385
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,364
Never mind, okay?

386
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,099
Just stay here, not up there.

387
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:34,834
So, did he have any enemies?

388
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,756
Yeah. You're listening to him right now.

389
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,383
There was a talent scout here
that night. Tommy stole his song.

390
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,574
Chris had to default to "Piano Man."

391
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:44,803
That hurts!

392
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:47,010
When Chris finished singing,
he pulled Tommy aside,

393
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,753
and they started shoving each other.

394
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:50,725
I told them to take it outside.

395
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,526
They disappeared into the parking lot.

396
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:53,742
Then what?

397
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,564
I don't know. I never saw Tommy again.

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>Oh, love is lovelier</i>

399
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,888
<i>the second time around...</i>

400
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,355
Tommy Sour was a jerk.

401
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:04,296
He'd fill the joint
with his fitness groupies

402
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,326
who'd hoot and holler even
when he sang off-key,

403
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,809
they'd talk through the other acts.

404
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,893
You know what that does
to a singer's self-esteem?

405
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,844
I imagine it'd be quite disheartening
given your need for acclaim.

406
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:16,180
- Bones...
- What? It's a primal human need,

407
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,360
the foundation for royalty...

408
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,339
You know,
you're just gonna confuse him. Go on.

409
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,267
Tommy thought he was gonna make it big.

410
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,358
He showed me a check he wrote
for a million bucks,

411
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,050
said he'd be cashing it by Christmas.

412
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,318
Well, was he any good?

413
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:29,700
Last month he had some
dude videotape his set.

414
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,340
It's up on his MySpace page
you can check it for yourself.

415
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,080
This guy is good.

416
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
<i>Like a friendly home</i>

417
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,200
Thank you, Paula.

418
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,067
Can we just... focus here?

419
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,100
So, the night Tommy was killed,

420
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,376
the two of you got into
an argument over a song?

421
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:47,723
Not just a song, my song.
"Far away" by Nickelback.

422
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:49,910
Tommy knew that
I was saving that for scout night.

423
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,520
- That make you a little angry?
- I didn't kill the guy.

424
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,499
We went outside,
I vented, and Tommy took off.

425
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,834
That was it you just said,
"good-bye, see you later"?

426
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,337
I came back inside... I wanted
to introduce myself to the talent scout.

427
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:02,780
He's back again,
you can ask him yourself.

428
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,480
Yeah, you know what?
I think I will.

429
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,791
Stay here.

430
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,056
Is this guy a star, or what?

431
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:14,268
<i>Oh, love's more comfortable</i>

432
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:15,419
You his agent?

433
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,900
No, I'm just a fan.
You know, a fan of the music.

434
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,480
- So, what label are you with?
- I'm an independent.

435
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,180
Ah, you know, me and my roommate,
we had a band in college.

436
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,600
We weren't half bad.

437
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,781
I mean, all the guys,
they'd sit in the front there.

438
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,308
What are you doing
all the way in the back?

439
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,869
- What's it to you?
- What are you drinking?

440
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,132
Excuse me. Hey!

441
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,249
What the hell is this, doodles?

442
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:38,526
Everything OK here?

443
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:40,548
What do you say we step outside?
Come on.

444
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,959
I want to know
why you're impersonating a talent scout.

445
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,622
I don't know what you're talk...

446
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:47,080
answer the question, or I'll
arrest you right now for fraud.

447
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:48,799
- But I...
- Wait a second,

448
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,679
I get it.
You two are working together.

449
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:53,199
You knew that if there was
a talent scout in the audience,

450
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,559
more singers would show up
at Open Mike Night.

451
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,526
You sell more booze,
you make more money.

452
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,000
I-I just started the rumor.

453
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,106
I asked Mitch to wear a suit,
take some notes.

454
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,499
I didn't do anything wrong
it was just a job.

455
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:06,680
Just a job, right? Give Tommy the idea
that he was gonna get his own contract.

456
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,031
- I didn't hurt anybody.
- You lied to them.

457
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,680
You exploited their need
for attention that's cruel.

458
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,952
- I am not going down for your crap.
- I get it.

459
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,599
Tommy figures it all out,

460
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:18,206
there's an argument,
it escalates, he confronts you.

461
00:22:18,466 --> 00:22:20,336
No. No. I swear it.

462
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,794
Tommy knew nothing about Mitch;
no one did.

463
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,089
You pull this scam again,
and I swear I'll arrest both of you

464
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,967
for conspiracy, fraud and
misrepresentation, you got me?

465
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:30,231
Yes.

466
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,059
Sir.

467
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,280
Come on.

468
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,299
And don't even think about leaving town,

469
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:39,981
'cause both of you are under
investigation for murder.

470
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:42,599
They are?

471
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,048
No, I just don't like them.

472
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,580
- How's it coming, Zack?
- I'm still looking.

473
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,549
The shaving was wafer thin
and conformed to the curvature of the...

474
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,030
I need the bones, man.

475
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,280
As do I, Hodgins.

476
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,972
I need to swab the ligature furrows
for elemental analysis...

477
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,890
Did you know that I sang, too?

478
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,892
- What?
- As a child.

479
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,018
You?

480
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:23,188
My parents felt that singing lessons
would help integrate me socially.

481
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:24,481
- Really?
- Yes.

482
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:25,740
I was quite good.

483
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,599
I received acclaim and a new stature

484
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,319
amongst the parents of my peers.

485
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:31,080
What about your actual peers?

486
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:33,641
My mother said they were jealous
and not to worry about it.

487
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,617
Jealous of your singing?

488
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,997
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm trying,
Zack, but I just... I can't see it.

489
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:18,380
That was... great.

490
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,245
That was... great.

491
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:23,080
Thank you.
I should get back to work now.

492
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,032
Listen, Pavarotti,

493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,380
I need the C-5 vertebra,
the hyoid and the temporal bone.

494
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,980
We need a weapon.

495
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,880
And by ID'ing
the particulates in the wounds,

496
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,867
I can give you more to go on.

497
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,876
Thanks for the concert.

498
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,845
Is there something you need?

499
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:42,880
No.

500
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,604
Oh, no, I'm-I'm just doing
my... just...

501
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:47,059
Thanks.

502
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,199
I get it when a college kid wants
to be a rock star,

503
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,199
but half of those singers were over 30.

504
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,580
Do they really think
they're going to be famous?

505
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,789
The need to stand out
from the crowd is innate.

506
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,482
It's obnoxious.

507
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,653
You were the best sniper
when you were in the army.

508
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,336
I was just doing my job. OK? Well.

509
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:11,421
And that set you apart
from the others.

510
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:15,080
Bones, we're talking about singing
some nightmarish broadway songs.

511
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,425
No, it doesn't matter.

512
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:19,380
Whoever is best has
the status and power.

513
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,806
And becomes a superior mate.

514
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,774
Yeah, I tell you, some of those
people are not gonna be mating,

515
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:24,875
that's for sure.

516
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,786
But they will have
the power and prestige.

517
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:29,022
You enjoy it because
you are a superb agent.

518
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,274
- You think?
- Yeah, of course.

519
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:33,080
Since I am the best in my field,

520
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,029
it would be self-destructive for me
to work with someone who's beneath me.

521
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,999
Oh. Okay, well, that's good.

522
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,380
'Cause, you know,
I have to be honest, here...

523
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,870
sometimes I think that you feel
that you're better than me.

524
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,659
- Objectively I'm more intelligent...
- There you go.

525
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,133
... In certain areas.

526
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:50,923
And in others,

527
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:54,110
I understand my limitations and I...

528
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,383
admire your expertise.

529
00:25:58,679 --> 00:25:59,678
You admire me?

530
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,180
In certain areas of expertise.

531
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:04,399
Well, I admire your expertise.

532
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,226
You know, the whole science thing.

533
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,410
Thank you. I'm an author, too.

534
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,280
I know.

535
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,484
Best selling and that also
gives me elevated status.

536
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,689
Here comes the ego.

537
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,780
No, I'm not saying that society
is correct to elevate me.

538
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,688
I'm not saying that i
deserve the elevation.

539
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,906
I'm just saying that it occurs.

540
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,080
Society should elevate
scholars and teachers,

541
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,780
not actors and athletes.

542
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,380
Yeah, what about cops?

543
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,900
Very important.

544
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,468
Yeah, this is Agent Booth.

545
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,832
It's Pam...

546
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:31,668
Pam Nunan.

547
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:33,503
How can I help you, Miss Nunan?

548
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,355
- Are you available to meet?
- I'm sorry,

549
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,400
how did you get my number?

550
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,887
Your office patched me through.
I said I was your mother.

551
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,724
Yeah, Dr. Brennan
and I can meet with you.

552
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,101
No... just you.

553
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,334
Well, if it's relevant to the case,
Miss Nunan,

554
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:53,680
I think it'd be important
that Dr. Brennan...

555
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,560
I can be at your office
in a half hour,

556
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,280
but you have to meet me alone.

557
00:26:57,704 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm sorry, is this about Tommy?

558
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,658
What else would it be about,
Agent Booth?

559
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,804
Okay. A half an hour.

560
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,940
What did she want?

561
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,509
She wants to see me without you.

562
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,420
Did she say why?

563
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,323
Probably you make
her feel uncomfortable.

564
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:18,224
How so?

565
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:20,978
Well, because you're you and...

566
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:24,137
- You're a well-adjusted woman.
- And a best-selling author.

567
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:26,280
I was on the New York times list
for 18 weeks,

568
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,858
and I won the ed...

569
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,640
Right this way.

570
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,700
I really appreciate you seeing me.

571
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,280
It's my job.

572
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,100
That's precious. It's your job...

573
00:27:45,385 --> 00:27:47,816
- You said you had information about...
- Hockey fan!

574
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,497
I have that same print in my office.

575
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,984
And it's Pam.

576
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,918
I have season tickets to the capitals.
We should go sometime.

577
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,962
Ms. Nunan, about the case...

578
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,069
Seeley, please: Pam.

579
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,341
I need to ask you something.

580
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:02,968
Usually I ask the questions.

581
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:05,262
Are you dating Dr. Brennan?

582
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,889
No. She's my partner.

583
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,349
I see.

584
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,810
Your nephew?

585
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,188
- That's my son.
- You're married?

586
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,750
I'm not. Listen,
I-I'm kinda busy here, Miss Nunan...

587
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:20,932
I brought you something.

588
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,747
- Okay.
- I know you've got a thing for socks.

589
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,083
- How did you...?
- I noticed 'em last time.

590
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:37,428
On the outside,
you're this big, tough FBI guy,

591
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:39,080
but really you're just like me...

592
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,672
unpredictable, like Tommy was.

593
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:42,424
- Please.
- I know.

594
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,274
We shouldn't talk about our old flames,

595
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,500
especially when we're just
getting to know each other.

596
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:49,580
Miss Nunan, you said you had information
about Tommy Sour's murder.

597
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,600
Really? I have faith
you'll find out who killed him.

598
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:55,600
And Tommy wouldn't want me
to grieve forever.

599
00:28:56,531 --> 00:28:58,857
Look at all these commendations.

600
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,975
You're really great at your job,
aren't you?

601
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:06,598
It's one of the reasons'm drawn to you.

602
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:08,658
Ma'am, this is way inappropriate...

603
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:11,661
"Ma'am..." that is so cute.

604
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:14,580
I can't wait to tell my mom
you just said that.

605
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,792
Well, bye for now.

606
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:37,983
What are you watching?

607
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:41,691
Dr. Sweets found
Tommy Sour's MySpace video.

608
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,618
He's got an okay voice,

609
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,645
but he's trying a bit hard,
don't you think?

610
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:47,414
Yeah, there are two types of performers.

611
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:50,075
Presentational singers crave
attention it's ego-driven.

612
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,561
And the representational singer
wants the audience to feel.

613
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,455
It's about evoking
a cathartic experience.

614
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:57,499
- He's showing off.
- Presentational.

615
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,945
Easy on the eyes, easy to forget.

616
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,399
One-hit wonder at best.

617
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,899
Like chumbawamba.

618
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:04,297
Chumba what-a?

619
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,799
"Tubthumbing."

620
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,218
Oh, come on. Are you serious?

621
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:10,595
It's a great song. It's anthemic.

622
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:12,680
So this is all simple psychology to you?

623
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,800
People's actions
are motivated by their need.

624
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,580
When we discover our needs,
we discover who we are.

625
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,484
So, yes.

626
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:21,174
No, society makes us who we are,
not psychology.

627
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:23,191
Society shapes our actions.

628
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:26,661
Culture compels us,
not some toilet training mishap.

629
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,180
- I'm just gonna break you two up.
- You're giving me a headache.

630
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,329
You keep this fighting up,
no one's getting dessert.

631
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,753
We're not fighting.
It's just a collegial debate, right?

632
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:35,829
Right.

633
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,123
How'd it go with Pam?

634
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,500
Wait, you saw her again?

635
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,299
What's the big deal, Sweets?

636
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,170
She just gave me a pair of socks.

637
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:48,716
- What...? It's not funny.
- It's not funny.

638
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:49,999
Then why did I laugh?

639
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,099
Pam Nunan controls
your emotional agenda

640
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,756
through seeming vulnerability,

641
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:55,277
followed by generosity.

642
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,680
It's classic manipulation.

643
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:58,476
Then I'll just mail the socks back.

644
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:01,396
Look. Tommy was about to release a CD.

645
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,023
"I can't do better than you."

646
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:06,198
I wonder if Pam thought
that was meant for her.

647
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:08,862
Yeah, she probably saw secret
messages in all of his songs.

648
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,866
Until I was 13,
I wanted to be the next Cyndi Lauper.

649
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:16,082
I'd say you're kidding,
but I don't think you know how to kid.

650
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:18,997
The other girls and I referred
to her as "rad."

651
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,880
My mother said that I sang just as well.

652
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,085
- As well as Cyndi Lauper?
- Yes.

653
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:26,379
Mothers do that. It's healthy.

654
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,054
No, this wasn't just flattery.

655
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:30,851
My mother told me that I sang
"girls just want to have fun"

656
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,080
better than she did.

657
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:34,262
It was an expression of affection,
Dr. Brennan,

658
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:36,890
not an objective evaluation
of your abilities.

659
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,558
Well, I think you're wrong.

660
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:40,627
Okay, then, go ahead. Belt it out.

661
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:42,915
- No, absolutely not.
- Come on. Give us a few bars.

662
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,280
- Come on!
- I can't just bust into song.

663
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,317
I have to have music and...

664
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,730
an appropriate atmosphere of frivolity.

665
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:53,531
Diva! Forensic genius,
best-selling author,

666
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,283
better than Cyndi Lauper...

667
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,000
Wait, look. Freeze the video.

668
00:31:59,008 --> 00:31:59,855
Look at him.

669
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,998
Tommy's singing to
the woman next to him.

670
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:03,496
The one who shushed us.

671
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,699
Look, his corrugator
muscles are furrowed,

672
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,480
his lips are tight. Teeth clenched,

673
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,047
his mentalis is crinkled.

674
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,759
- The corrugator muscles are...
- We know.

675
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,636
I don't know. I don't know that.

676
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,305
He appears to be very angry,

677
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,183
like "get out of my way" angry.

678
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,684
He plays the guitar.

679
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,926
Yeah.

680
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,813
That's how Tommy died.

681
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,819
The guitar string could
definitely be the murder weapon.

682
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,953
- Because it cut the cheese?
- Because the exemplar wound

683
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:37,866
approximates the tool marks
on the victim's C-5.

684
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:41,287
Yeah, he knew that,
he just wanted to say "cut the cheese."

685
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,626
Okay, Hodgins,
you are the guitar player;

686
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:48,600
Zack, you are Tommy.

687
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,280
Reenactment. Fascinating.

688
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,967
Not for me.
I'm always the one that gets killed.

689
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:56,180
Dude, you're the singer.
Singer was the vic here.

690
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,555
Tommy was strangled
from behind with a wire

691
00:32:58,815 --> 00:32:59,964
or guitar string.

692
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:01,708
And the guitar string was pulled tight.

693
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,393
Slicing his throat and trachea.

694
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:04,628
Of course.

695
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,980
As he lost consciousness,
he fell forward.

696
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,391
Fracturing his chin.

697
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,928
Wait a second. He was a big guy.

698
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:12,902
According to your scenario,
he was passive.

699
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:15,572
Nothing in the data suggests
that he fought back.

700
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,366
Wait a second. Tommy was, he was high.

701
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,660
He was toasted.
That could have dulled his reflexes.

702
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,912
This also explains
the shaving of the vertebra.

703
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,480
A guitar string would slice

704
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,980
a wafer-thin sliver of bone

705
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,625
as Tommy dropped to the ground.

706
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Amazing.

707
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,340
Tommy Sour was strangled, Dax,

708
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,551
possibly with a guitar string.

709
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,380
Now, I know that you didn't like

710
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,847
him singing to your girl.

711
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,766
What the hell you talking about?
My girl's in Texas.

712
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:49,522
- Look at that.
- That's Helen.

713
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,451
We perform together.

714
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,859
You know, she's married?

715
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,369
To someone else?

716
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:58,296
- Why do you look so angry?
- 'CauseTommy was a son of a bitch.

717
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,499
Look, I'm feeling
a little paranoid in here,

718
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:01,999
like I'm being persecuted.

719
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,787
Persecuted? Really? Maybe `cause
you're feeling a little guilty?

720
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,480
A couple of years ago,
I introduced Tommy to my trainer Jason.

721
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,099
Jason runs a wellness center.

722
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,661
He needed personal trainers,
and Tommy was a trainer.

723
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:15,256
Jason? As in Jason Bergman?

724
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:18,000
- Yeah, that's right, man. You know him?
- Yeah, we've met.

725
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,680
Tommy and Jason wanted
to open up a place together,

726
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,780
one they owned.

727
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,525
So they went out, and they got a loan.

728
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,241
Tommy stole the money,

729
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,600
50 grand, man.

730
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,500
Tommy used the money
to produce his own cd.

731
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,732
High-end musicians, arrangements,

732
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:34,800
publicity, the works.

733
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,320
So that's why I'm harboring
the negative vibes, dude.

734
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,180
Yeah, I can only imagine
how Jason feels.

735
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,490
So I contacted the bank.

736
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,935
Dr. Jason's on the hook for
the full amount of the loan.

737
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:46,644
Which we conveniently forgot
when we spoke to him before.

738
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:47,914
All right, Bones...

739
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,900
You're looking for Dr. Jason?
He didn't come today.

740
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,801
I've been calling him,
his cell isn't on.

741
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,883
- Is that unusual?
- This place is his whole life.

742
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,697
You could call him day or night,
he'd always answer.

743
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:58,080
Great, thanks.
Yeah, hi. It's Agent Booth.

744
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,899
I need a bolo
for a Dr. Jason Bergman,

745
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:02,954
wanted for first-degree murder.

746
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:08,600
Oh, Dr. Hodgins.

747
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,399
Dr. B, what's up?

748
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,280
Did you swab the C-5 vertebra
for elemental trace?

749
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,899
I swabbed the C-5 vertebra,

750
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:16,438
the hyoid and the temporal bone.

751
00:35:16,558 --> 00:35:17,999
Analyzing the particulates now.

752
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,955
I'll need your results
as soon as possible.

753
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:21,180
Okay, I'm on it.

754
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,699
How'd it go with guitar guy?

755
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:24,952
Booth doesn't think it's him; no motive.

756
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:26,299
But the wound.

757
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:29,080
It's definitely a wire
or metal string of some kind,

758
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,380
but not from him.

759
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,599
Booth suspects the manager
of the wellness center.

760
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,969
So you're looking for
some wire used in a gym

761
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,478
or by a physical therapist.

762
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:37,316
Yes.

763
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:39,780
Assuming that it was
a crime of passion,

764
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,000
the killer would have used
something handy.

765
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Brennan.

766
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:48,732
Okay, I'll meet you there.

767
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,309
I need those results.

768
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:51,634
Right away.

769
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,161
I quit my job,

770
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:56,080
decided to move out of town. So what?

771
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,000
Officer pulled you over
on the interstate in Ohio

772
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:02,447
You've been traveling nonstop
since yesterday morning.

773
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:03,697
Is that a crime?

774
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:05,100
Maybe.

775
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:08,159
We know about the small business loan.

776
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,599
Then you also know that
I'm the last person in the world

777
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,500
that would want Tommy dead.

778
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,084
With him out of the picture,
I'm responsible for the whole nut.

779
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,497
- What? The nut?
- 50 grand.

780
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,591
I couldn't see another way out.

781
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,900
So you thought you could
hide from the bank.

782
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,305
I'm not married.

783
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,252
I got no close family, so, yeah,
I thought I could disappear.

784
00:36:28,372 --> 00:36:30,641
Just fall off the grid.
You hear about it all the time.

785
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:33,209
I think you were pissed
and you just snapped.

786
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,710
That place was everything to you.

787
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,180
Tommy ruined it for you.
So, you ruined him.

788
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,388
You know what I think, Agent Booth?

789
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:43,299
I think motive without evidence

790
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,127
is like riding a stationary bike

791
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:46,908
you get nowhere fast.

792
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:48,184
Like right now?

793
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,399
Dr. Bergman, did you use any wires

794
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,499
or wire-like instruments at the gym

795
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,041
or in your chiropractic practice?

796
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,087
Any further questions will have
to go through a lawyer.

797
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:03,825
- Hodgins.
- Sorry to barge in.

798
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:05,626
Oh, no, you can't just barge in here!

799
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:07,928
There was elemental
evidence on the vertebra.

800
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:10,223
- You wanted to know asap.
- What's the evidence?

801
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:12,850
It's phyllosilicate minerals
and aluminum oxides.

802
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,280
- Oh.
- Yeah.

803
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,300
- What? English?
- It's clay.

804
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,605
Very good.

805
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:20,608
- I have nothing to do with clay.
- No, you're totally gonna be cleared.

806
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:22,510
You can't say that. This is my place.

807
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:25,613
And there was silver particulates
embedded in the composite.

808
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:27,406
- On his vertebra?
- Yeah.

809
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,207
There's a company called clay global

810
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,244
which infuses sculpting
clay with silver powder.

811
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:33,399
They sell direct via the internet.

812
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,622
And get this,

813
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:36,749
they recently shipped
a package of the clay

814
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,460
to the other unit of
our victim's duplex.

815
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,181
A warrant? Search my place?

816
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,780
He can read.

817
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,599
I'm the one who reported Tommy missing.

818
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,280
- Why would I be hiding anything?
- Because you killed Tommy,

819
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,580
and you reported him missing
to cover your own ass.

820
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,441
No, no. Hey, excuse me.

821
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,217
- What are you doing?
- Oh, are you asking because

822
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:07,300
you have an interest
in forensics, Mr. Matthews?

823
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,270
What?

824
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:11,980
This clay-cutting wire
is consistent with the object

825
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
used to kill Tommy Sour.

826
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,746
I'm testing it for blood.

827
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,300
Just look at.
There's no blood on it.

828
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,030
If the liquid turns blue,

829
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:26,716
it means this wire came
in contact with human blood.

830
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:33,665
- Wait.
- Guess what.

831
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:35,991
You are under arrest for
the murder of Tommy Sour.

832
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:37,612
Wait. You don't understand, OK?

833
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,580
I didn't want to, but the noise was...

834
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,148
- The noise?
- Yeah, you hear it. The alarm clock.

835
00:38:42,891 --> 00:38:45,234
These walls are so thin,
and I needed to work,

836
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:47,194
to concentrate for my show.

837
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:49,980
And Tommy would just sing
at the top of his lungs day and night.

838
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,240
He never ever shut up.

839
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,534
I begged him to lower his voice,

840
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:55,853
to sing quietly, but he didn't care.

841
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:58,680
And that gives you the right
to strangle him into silence?

842
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,580
No, I was just trying to scare him.
He was taking his trash to the alley

843
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,878
and singing at the top of his lungs.

844
00:39:04,138 --> 00:39:05,363
So I went after him.

845
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:07,809
He's bigger than me.
I never thought I could kill him.

846
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,880
He was stoned.
He couldn't fight back.

847
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,380
I just... I pulled on the wire

848
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,200
and he fell down and...

849
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:15,556
and he was dead.

850
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,430
It was quiet. It was finally quiet.

851
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,980
That was great.

852
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,080
Yeah.

853
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,526
What's going on?

854
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,496
Why did you call me here, Booth?

855
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:41,080
Your need to sing in front
of a live audience.

856
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
It's innate, Bones.

857
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,210
No way.

858
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,380
Hey, I got the music, the frivolity.

859
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,800
What else do you need?

860
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,780
Come on, Dr. Brennan.
You can do it.

861
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,094
We're here for you.

862
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,599
You're very controlled, Dr. Brennan.

863
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,143
I think it'd be a good idea
for you to let yourself go.

864
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,280
- Really?
- Yeah.

865
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,426
What about you?

866
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:02,546
I will be singing
"Lime in the coconut" after you,

867
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,228
