1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Or asked me to stop by the archaeology section

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,270
and identify the skull as assyrian, hittite, or egyptian.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm in court today. I need my notes.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,080
There's a photocopy in the file.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,110
No, the last time I read from photocopies,

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,890
the defense lawyer told the jury I was winging it.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,530
Ready? Chop-chop.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,960
I can't find my original notes.

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,060
Photocopy in the file.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,310
No, the last time the defense lawyer told the jury that...

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,380
It was a ploy, it failed; let's go.

12
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,837
I found glass, I found pollen. Which do you want first?...

13
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:24,459
Pollen.

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,360
Perhaps you could swing by archaeology on your way to your...

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,700
No, no swinging.

16
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,970
All right, her height makes no sense and her spine length is whacky.

17
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,850
Dr. Brennan?

18
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,210
Okay, calculate the height off the femur and assume the fire shrunk her spine.

19
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,440
I don't think you should talk so much about other cases on court day.

20
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,550
You might get confused.

21
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,820
One simple question: assyrian, hittite, or egyptian?

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,760
Dr. Brennan?... Five minutes!

23
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:42,240
Bones!

24
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:42,618
What's up?...

25
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,509
Buttercup, if you sign off on these tissue markers

26
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,480
Angela can finish the facial reconstruction.

27
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,660
Why did you say "buttercup"?

28
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,980
"What's up buttercup" is an amusing, rhyming linguistic meme.

29
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,240
This is the latest "Jane Doe" from limbo.

30
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,210
How about this for an amusing rhyming linguine: "see you later, alligator".

31
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,790
Please don't refer to bone storage as "limbo. "Five minutes.

32
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,690
There are thousands of human remains down there, waiting to be identified.

33
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,400
Limbo seems an appropriate name.

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,530
No sign of foul play.

35
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,330
If you have time for this, you have time for my hittite.

36
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
Tissue depth of the cheekbones

37
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,360
and along the jawline looks a little deep to me, but otherwise...

38
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,399
Out of limbo, back on earth, and on our way to court.

39
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:12,630
Thanks.

40
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,400
Oh, Temperance!

41
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,570
David! Hi.

42
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,870
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,770
She has to get to court, so...

44
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,260
Agent Booth, nice to see you again, especially when I'm not in custody.

45
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,650
Listen, I read your manuscript.

46
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,840
And couldn't wait to tell you how great it is.

47
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,060
Thank you. Really?

48
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,530
You read her manuscript?!

49
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,000
Her second novel. "Bone free".

50
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,510
It's kind of like "born free" except no lions.

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,110
Yuck on the title. Am I in it?

52
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,584
No...

53
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:37,815
Definitely.

54
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,650
We have to get to court.

55
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,020
I hope you have your original notes. Because last time...

56
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,500
Told you, Booth...

57
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,300
No! Bones! We don't have time.

58
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,130
All right, listen... uh... three minutes, I'll wait for you in the car.

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,984
So, are you two, uh...?...

60
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,409
Yeah, sort of.

61
00:01:58,444 --> 00:01:59,490
Is that a problem?

62
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
Yeah.

63
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,950
You know, Bones is very literal, so, in the future,

64
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,870
no jokey advice on court day... Okay.

65
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,850
Is something wrong?

66
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:17,780
What's this?

67
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,480
Zack's Jane Doe.

68
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,830
He said that you okayed the tissue markers.

69
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,460
No, that can't be right. That can't possibly be right... you did it wrong.

70
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,810
It's a mistake, Angela.

71
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,810
All right, fine. Sweetie, I'll turn it off.

72
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,210
Zack, the artifact bag from your Jane Doe, do you have it?

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,450
Yes. I also have three...

74
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,240
three bags of soil samples from where the remains were buried.

75
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:20,570
Any of you see Bones? Okay, we're due in court, like...

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,310
Hello, now.

77
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,430
What?

78
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:31,300
This... totally freaked her out.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,520
My theory? Caffeine intolerance.

80
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,070
Yeah, you're going to want to take dr. Brennan off the witness list today.

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,700
No, she can't make it into court.

82
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,910
Thanks.

83
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,660
All right, what's going on?

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,790
That... is Christine Brennan.

85
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,320
Good God.

86
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,780
You just found Bones' mother.

87
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,030
I have to miss court.

88
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,340
I know.

89
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,910
I remember this belt buckle.

90
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,410
I borrowed it without asking...

91
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,390
the first day of high school.

92
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,760
My father had it specially made for my mother because she loved dolphins.

93
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,890
Bones... I'm sorry.

94
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,780
I always knew that for my parents to disappear like that,

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,600
They... they had to be dead. I thought that...

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,390
When it was confirmed I'd feel relief. But...

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,400
It's still bad news.

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,760
You have the file, Zack?

99
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,520
Jane Doe, number 1-29-09-98.

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,700
Where was she found?

101
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,294
Bones, I...

102
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:21,070
What does it say?

103
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,380
In September of 1998,

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,490
a grave-digging crew at the sunset memory cemetery in Salisbury, Pennsylvania,

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,790
uncovered human remains in a completely advanced stage of decomposition.

106
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,930
Is it from a grave?

107
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,200
No, it appears somebody just dug a hole at the edge of the cemetery

108
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,166
and plopped the body in there.

109
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,293
Zack!...

110
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:42,386
Sorry.

111
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,850
The local coroner found no obvious evidence of foul play

112
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,210
and sent the remains, a few artifacts, and soil samples to the jeffersonian,

113
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,420
hoping we could identify her.

114
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,070
Technically, your mother's been at the jeffersonian as long as you have.

115
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,220
Zack!

116
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,170
Sorry, but they both got here in 1998.

117
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:08,930
Dr. Brennan, ms. Montenegro has volunteered to drive you home.

118
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,240
Temperance.

119
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,180
Go home.

120
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,540
It's after midnight.

121
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,220
Well, I was driving by, I saw the lights...

122
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,420
I thought you might like some wong foo's.

123
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,680
You saw my lights from the road?

124
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,590
That is correct.

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,740
All right.

126
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,520
After you gave me your parents' missing persons file,

127
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,870
I- I did some poking around.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,710
You worked on it?

129
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,420
Well, there wasn't much I could do.

130
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,110
There was no evidence, no clear jurisdiction.

131
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:26,600
Listen, Bones...

132
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,100
finding your mother's remains means I can open an official FBI case.

133
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,410
I mean, for the first time, a real investigation can occur.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Three days after my parents disappeared, they found

135
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:50,170
our car at a rest stop, a thousand miles from where we lived in Chicago.

136
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,170
Yeah, I found it in a federal impound lot in Jersey.

137
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm having it trucked to the jeffersonian.

138
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,560
They kept it all those years?

139
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,040
No... no, nobody claimed it.

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,180
Your father was a high school science teacher.

141
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,100
He had no trouble with anyone at work. Then...

142
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,810
your mother, that's a different matter.

143
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,640
She was a bookkeeper.

144
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,120
Mm, she was a witness for the prosecution...

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,630
twice... on evasion charges. That gives motive.

146
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,800
Then there's, uh... your brother.

147
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,090
Russ.

148
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,820
The brother who deserted me.

149
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,120
He's on parole.

150
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,190
He ran a chop shop, processing stolen cars for parts.

151
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,800
It figures.

152
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,280
He says that you blame him for your parents' disappearance.

153
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,550
You talked to Russ?

154
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,780
I called him.

155
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,640
Just asked him a few routine questions. He didn't give me much.

156
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,010
We're going to find out what happened to your mom... okay?

157
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,590
Adipocere and decomp residues in the bagged soil

158
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,850
indicate the body was buried at least five years.

159
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,920
That's congruent with the pH in the soil, climate, and degree of decomp.

160
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,000
No, seven years. It should be seven years.

161
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,490
I'm still going through the soil samples,

162
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,730
but something in there might allow me to be more specific.

163
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,460
She was buried near christmas,1991.

164
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,680
I need the room, guys.

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,400
The whole lab? For what?

166
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,200
It's a cop way of saying "get lost".

167
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,410
What?

168
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
When you first gave me the file on your parents,

169
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,620
I looked back into their lives three to four years before they disappeared.

170
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,670
Jobs, friends...

171
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,070
I looked back a little further and I found out that...

172
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,380
Christine Brennan didn't exist before 1978.

173
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,480
What are you telling me? That...

174
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,280
that this woman isn't my mother? I was born in 1976... obviously,

175
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,270
my mother existed.

176
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,190
Do you know the most common way of creating an identity?

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,850
Getting the birth certificate of

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,860
someone deceased who was born the same year you were,

179
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,830
and take over that identity.

180
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,730
I found a one Matthew Brennan, born and died, 1948.

181
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:10,390
Do you understand?

182
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,880
I don't know what it means. I don't know what any of it means.

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,660
It means that your parents weren't

184
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,560
who you thought they were.

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,660
It means that they were living under assumed identities.

186
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,660
Every minute this is down, I'm losing money.

187
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,700
You want faster work, grab yourself a coffee.

188
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,440
Let me alone, man.

189
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,260
You licensed for this job?

190
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,530
You're a cop.

191
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,400
You know who recognizes cops?

192
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,775
Other cops?...

193
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,040
And crooks.

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,740
I talked to you a couple months ago on the phone...

195
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm Booth.

196
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,070
You gonna ask me some more questions about my childhood...?

197
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,370
You found my mother?

198
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,100
Your sister did the ID.

199
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,190
What about dad?

200
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,930
No.

201
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,930
What do you want?

202
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,130
You remember being anyone else besides, uh,

203
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,965
"Russ Brennan?"...

204
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,219
No.

205
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,490
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you, Russ?

206
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,530
Cops always think I'm lying.

207
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,850
Why don't you just come back to DC, and help out in this investigation?

208
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,070
I got a job, man.

209
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,990
Well, the alternative is, I just cite you for performing

210
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,460
unlicensed repairs on heavy equipment...

211
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,580
get your parole revoked. Tell you what.

212
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,560
You give me a call when you get into town.

213
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,830
Oh, you ask me, this...

214
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,300
this thing here is beyond hope.

215
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,300
Look at that. It works.

216
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,020
I'll see you soon.

217
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,700
What is it?

218
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,920
A clump of cellulose.

219
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,500
It came from the soil samples collected at Brennan's mom's burial site

220
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,040
from the same depth as her bones.

221
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,090
You said you had a giant problem.

222
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,840
I used the laser scanning confocal microscope.

223
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,910
Which one is that?

224
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,320
It looks like an espresso machine.

225
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,410
Now, it showed that this is mass-produced cardboard.

226
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,930
Now, electn dispersion spectroscopy indicates

227
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,430
that the cardboard is coated with ethylenically unsaturated monomers,

228
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,910
which kept it from completely deteriorating.

229
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,200
Hodgins, what's the giant problem?

230
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,610
It's a movie ticket.

231
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
A little UV analysis, some guesswork, I come up with "The Fugitive".

232
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,860
So what's wrong, you don't like Brennan's mom's taste in movies?

233
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,360
The fugitive was the third top-grossing movie of 1993.

234
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,590
Brennan's parents disappeared in December of 1991.

235
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,220
Yet mom's going to Harrison Ford movies almost two years later.

236
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,690
Oh, God, this is giant.

237
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,470
What do I do? Pretend I never found this?

238
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,750
Dr. Brennan?

239
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,500
Yes. Um...

240
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,400
Did you find something in the soil?

241
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,920
Yeah, uh, this was in the soil samples alongside your mother's remains.

242
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,190
A movie ticket?

243
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,310
Rialto theater. 9:00 P.M. Showing of the fugitive.

244
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,360
September 22, 1993.

245
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,650
Well, how did it get there?

246
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,030
Either your mother had it in her possession when she was buried, or

247
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,030
it was somehow buried with her.

248
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,550
Either way, it dates the burial.

249
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,380
No, that's... that's impossible.

250
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,545
My mother disappeared in 1991...

251
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,229
Sweetie...

252
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,570
It's possible mom was buried somewhere else for a year and half, then moved.

253
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,900
No, that- that's not possible.

254
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,090
Maybe it is...

255
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,760
We decided to tell you the truth,

256
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,500
and this is the truth.

257
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,760
You all right?

258
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm pretty sure I just found cause of death. Zack?

259
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Yes, dr. Brennan?

260
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,380
See the discoloration on the inside of the skull?

261
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,590
Left side... extending from the coronal suture,

262
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,170
crossing the supior and inferior temporal lines to the squamosal suture.

263
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,820
Subdural hematoma. Ooh! A big one.

264
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,200
Dr. Brennan?

265
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,610
Probably fatal.

266
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,510
There are no indications of a blow to the outer skull.

267
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,980
Scan the outside of the skull. Look for histological changes,

268
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,070
microscopic modeling.

269
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,040
I don't want to talk to him.

270
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,150
Bones. Bones. All right.

271
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,720
Listen, Zack, if this guy moves,

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,530
shoot him with a tranquilizer dart or something.

273
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,890
I don't actually have a tranquilizer gun.

274
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,870
Hey, Bones... come on.

275
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,650
My mother died of a subdural hematoma.

276
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,020
Bleeding in the brain.

277
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,470
Do you want to proceed rationally, correct?

278
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,010
Chances are the subdural hematoma was caused

279
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,740
by a blow to the head.

280
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,420
All right, you got the how. Now, let's...

281
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,440
let's get the who.

282
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,090
You just told me that your mother was murdered.

283
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,940
I mean, who better to help us than... than your brother?

284
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,740
Mom loved dolphins.

285
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,500
This was mine.

286
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,780
My favorite marble.

287
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,460
What was she doing with that?

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,870
Where did Booth find you?

289
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,500
It's not hard for an FBI agent to find a parolee.

290
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,670
I didn't ask how, I asked where.

291
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,540
Morehead City, North Carolina.

292
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,150
I call, every year, on your birthday.

293
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,300
You never pick up.

294
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,050
Take a hint.

295
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,690
Could I have this, please?

296
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,030
It's evidence.

297
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,890
Of what? It's a kid's marble.

298
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,350
It's the rules. I can't let you have it.

299
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,490
Same old Tempe.

300
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,400
Never met a rule worth breaking.

301
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,470
Same old Russ. On parole.

302
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,680
Angela, I might send Russ in to describe some people to you.

303
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,570
Okay. What people?

304
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,970
Well, some people that a seven-year-old boy might remember.

305
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,830
Well, that's a little vague there, Booth.

306
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,630
The drawing... I mean, that's important. It's more...

307
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,080
I trust your instincts.

308
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,570
When it comes to men?

309
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,460
When it comes to suspects.

310
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,330
Why do you think that

311
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,570
Bones asked her boyfriend,

312
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,010
you know, to, uh, read her book and not me?

313
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,240
You know, maybe- maybe because there was just

314
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,370
too much of me in the story.

315
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,710
Oh, she was embarrassed, you think, may- maybe...?

316
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,440
Booth.

317
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,860
Yeah. I'm on my way. Thanks.

318
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,690
Uh, the family car just arrived.

319
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,160
We on the lookout for anything in particular?

320
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,820
Treat it like a brand-new crime scene... full workup. Let's go!

321
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,930
But tear through the whole car, treat it, and then go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

322
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,960
That's our old car, all right.

323
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,860
The name of my school is scraped off... Woodside elementary.

324
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,130
They said they didn't find anything in the car.

325
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,870
There was a bloodstain, front seat, passenger side.

326
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,120
Guys! Everybody!

327
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,170
I need the space! Now!

328
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,110
What? Now?!

329
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,490
Yeah, now.

330
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,430
Take five, everybody.

331
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,820
Twice in two days.

332
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,420
I had the NCIC database check for a married couple who disappeared in 1978.

333
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,860
Meet Max and Ruth Keenan.

334
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,250
That's mom and dad, all right.

335
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,500
The NCIC database, that's...

336
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,920
that's criminals.

337
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,550
My parents were on a list of federal offenders?

338
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,920
How do you like that?

339
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,960
Guess a criminal nature runs in the family.

340
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,160
You were seven years old, Russ.

341
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,400
Old enough to remember. What...

342
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,540
what is your real name?

343
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,830
What is my real name?

344
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,160
Bones, it's right here in the file.

345
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,830
No! No! I want him to tell me.

346
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,100
What is my real name, Russ?

347
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,660
My name was Kyle.

348
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,640
Your name was Joy.

349
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,330
You are not my brother.

350
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,660
Bones...

351
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,290
He lied about that. What else are you lying about?

352
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
What else are you not telling us?

353
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,870
At first, I thought the worst thing was that they were... missing.

354
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,250
Except dead means no more hope.

355
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,520
My mother was alive for almost two years after they disappeared.

356
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,220
She abandoned me.

357
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,190
You don't know that.

358
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,960
Look, you finally got to slap Russ.

359
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,310
You've been wanting to do that for years.

360
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,990
I worshipped him, you know?

361
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,470
God, he was so cool.

362
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,430
Everyone knew I was Russ Brennan's little sister.

363
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,090
I wasn't... cool or pretty, so, being his sister...

364
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,370
You know that game, Marco Polo?

365
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,860
I'd be sitting in class,

366
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,280
and I'd hear out the window,"Marco!"

367
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,770
It'd be Russ checking in on me,

368
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,600
letting everyone know that I was his little sister.

369
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,190
Did you... "Polo"?

370
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,190
Yeah, sometimes it would be the only word I said all day.

371
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,170
Polo.

372
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:51,280
And then mom and dad disappeared, and...

373
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,580
Russ took off.

374
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,850
Suddenly, no one cared where I was.

375
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,310
I miss that.

376
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,810
Someone caring where I am all the time.

377
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,900
Bones? Bones, you up there?

378
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,780
Come on, let's go, huh? Chop-chop.

379
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,790
I found the agent that was assigned to your parents' case.

380
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,170
I was the FBI liaison on

381
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,740
a bank robbery task force working out of Cincinnati in the mid- to late-seventies.

382
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:33,620
Secret service, state police, ATF, all of us after a pretty bad bunch

383
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,810
of armed robbers working Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa.

384
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,890
You know, excuse me.

385
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,420
Am I to understand that I'm addressing the family of one of these robbers?

386
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,950
Max and Ruth Keenan's children.

387
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,480
Max and Ruth. Yeah.

388
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:55,330
They never really belonged in that crew.

389
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,550
Why?

390
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,700
They worked smart.

391
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,010
Specialized in safe deposit boxes. No guns.

392
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,470
They'd either con their way in, or

393
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,590
case out the place, break back in on the weekend.

394
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,740
Took their time. We never got a handle on the size of their scores.

395
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,770
Why?

396
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:16,110
Well, people keep jewelry and cash in safety deposit boxes.

397
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,210
And a lot of stuff they don't want to report stolen.

398
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,600
None of us understood why standup criminals like Max and Ruth

399
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,150
would join this midwest strong-arm crew.

400
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,810
Links to white supremacists, real dedication to firearms and violence.

401
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,300
Job in Dayton went really bad.

402
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,110
Two innocent bystanders were killed. One state trooper, seven wounded.

403
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,980
When was that?

404
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,960
July 4, 1978.

405
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,800
Never caught 'em?

406
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,670
Not us, no.

407
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,710
Few years later, one of them turned state's evidence for an FBI agent out of Louisville.

408
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,520
Sent the rest to jail.

409
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,880
My understanding is they're all dead.

410
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,660
Our parents were bank robbers

411
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,320
who morphed into a high school science teacher and a... bookkeeper?

412
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,720
Their particular brand of safety deposit break-ins stopped.

413
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,170
At the time, I figured the strong-arm crew killed them for their cut.

414
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,370
Agent Booth?

415
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,700
We found blood in the car.

416
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,920
We expected that.

417
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,780
Yeah, but here's the wrinkle:

418
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,650
We got blood from two separate individuals.

419
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,250
These two dna charts are from the blood in the car,

420
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,390
and these two are from dr. Brennan and her brother.

421
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,240
These three match. And this one does not.

422
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,570
These three people are related?

423
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,210
This is mom, me and Russ.

424
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,590
But this chart... a male, but it's definitely not your father.

425
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,980
Okay, so we'll just run it through CODIS

426
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,600
and the convicted offender index and see what pops up, all right?

427
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,230
So you describe someone to me,

428
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,140
and I draw them.

429
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,960
That's the drill.

430
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,020
Who do I describe?

431
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,010
I don't know yet.

432
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,210
Booth put us together,

433
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,510
so I could charm you into telling me the truth.

434
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,800
Trust me, I got no more truth.

435
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:05,210
You know, your sister is my best friend, so

436
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,070
when she says you can't be trusted, I trust her.

437
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,010
This is you being charming?

438
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,300
Does Tempe really hate me that much?

439
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,250
Russ... she loves you.

440
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,210
It'd be easier if she hated you.

441
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,290
Hate is a lot easier to deal with than love,

442
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,740
especially disappointed love.

443
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,070
You know what's ironic?

444
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,180
Tempe doesn't trust me because I kept a promise.

445
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,010
What promise?

446
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,830
Seven years old...

447
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,360
dad and me in the backyard. This was in Ohio.

448
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,000
My dad tells me,"you're not Kyle anymore.

449
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:47,740
"Forget about Kyle.

450
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,000
You're Russ. "

451
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,390
He says: "If you ever tell anyone...

452
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,990
the police, anyone... "you will be killing your mother and your sister.

453
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,360
"Swear," he says.

454
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,740
"You swear on your baby sister's life you won't tell. "

455
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,170
He makes me say my new name 100 times. Russ Brennan

456
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:12,380
He says it with me: Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan!

457
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,610
Around that time, when Kyle became Russ,

458
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,860
maybe you saw someone.

459
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,900
Maybe you saw someone who scared you.

460
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:29,720
Someone who scared you because you had instincts...

461
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,490
the instincts of a frightened kid.

462
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,380
Was there someone like that?

463
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:41,030
Yeah.

464
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,000
A man came to the house one day.

465
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:51,180
My dad said if I ever saw this guy again,

466
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,350
to grab my sister and hide.

467
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,060
Well, when you're ready,

468
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,850
you'll describe that man to me.

469
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,945
All right.

470
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,400
If you keep bringing chinese food in the middle of the night, we're both gonna get fat.

471
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,600
I know what you've been thinking.

472
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,010
I doubt it.

473
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,720
You've been thinking that your

474
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,250
family is made up of liars and criminals.

475
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,780
And that makes you feel lonely.

476
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,370
There's a story here we don't know yet.

477
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,550
Like what?

478
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,120
Bones, "don't know" means it's a mystery.

479
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,410
What were your parents like?

480
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,090
My parents, uh...

481
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,970
My dad, he, uh...

482
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,380
he drove thuds and phantoms in Vietnam.

483
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,060
Those are fighter jets.

484
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,500
After that, he was a barber in Philadelphia.

485
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,620
And my mom, she wrote jingles

486
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,860
for a local advertising agency.

487
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,000
So they didn't go out at night after you were asleep and rob banks?

488
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,170
Listen, Bones, you know,

489
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,760
parents, uh,

490
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,700
they have secret lives.

491
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,210
If they didn't, they wouldn't be parents.

492
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,280
It is a little late for chinese, isn't it?

493
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,810
Thanks for the meal. See you tomorrow.

494
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,710
Dr. Brennan, is it morning?

495
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,160
No, I couldn't sleep. Why are you still here?

496
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,850
We're all here. No one's leaving until we figure out what happened to your mother.

497
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,300
Thank you.

498
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,050
Don't thank me.

499
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,360
I'm failing.

500
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,390
I've gone over every millimeter of the skull and found no evidence of remodeling.

501
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,750
Which makes no sense, because

502
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,870
any wound that results in a subdural hematoma that big

503
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,860
should leave a mark on the living bone.

504
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,970
What if the subdural hematoma started out much smaller?

505
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,490
And grew over time?

506
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,870
Over the course of, say, a year.

507
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,330
That might explain the gap between the time

508
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,840
my mother sustained the injury and the time she was buried.

509
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,290
Then the blow itself might not have left a mark on the bone.

510
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,350
Show me the surface of the skull directly above the center of the hematoma.

511
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,930
100-times magnification.

512
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,990
Go to 500.

513
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,650
See here?

514
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,610
Microscopic fractures on the osteons.

515
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,870
And is that the result of bleeding into the interstitial spaces?

516
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:43,290
I can map the fractured osteons.

517
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,660
That might lead us to the weapon.

518
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm awake.

519
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,410
Yeah, I can see that.

520
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,760
Caught a break on the DNA in the car.

521
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,830
You know who it is?

522
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,390
Not exactly. See, it's a closed file.

523
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,090
Whoever it is is in the witness protection.

524
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,000
I'll make a request, but they're pretty tight over there.

525
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,710
What if you had a face?

526
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,080
Who's that?

527
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,750
Somebody your father pointed out to Russ when he was seven.

528
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,390
Somebody he's still afraid of.

529
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,950
Hey, you know what? I'm gonna play hardball with witness protection.

530
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,230
If they don't cooperate, I'm gonna put his face in the paper.

531
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,050
Wouldn't you get in trouble for that?

532
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,850
We'll find out.

533
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:36,160
You know what? Sometimes, he is just... whew.

534
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,740
This is the pattern of fractured osteons.

535
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,430
It suggests a blow from the front that grazed the skull.

536
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,420
A bullet?

537
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,580
There would've been particulates left behind by a bullet,

538
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,380
especially fired from a short range.

539
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,400
I isolated the most fractured osteons,

540
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,950
and this pattern emerges.

541
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,460
Looks like the business end of a tire iron.

542
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,910
No, the size is wrong. It's too small.

543
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,590
The weapon was actually chasing the skull when it landed.

544
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,570
I believe that the victim was pulled away at the last second,

545
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,320
so that most of the force was lost,

546
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,420
leaving only the slightest impression.

547
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,130
Bones. I got what I need from witness protection. Let's go for a drive.

548
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,210
Everybody... thank you.

549
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:31,360
I... thank you.

550
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,410
Okay, Bones, just listen to me, okay?

551
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,320
This guy McVicar, he might be a pig farmer now, but

552
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,690
he used to be a mechanic, all right?

553
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,890
With ties to the strong-arm crew that your parents ran away from.

554
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,100
A mechanic, like Russ?

555
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,650
Not like Russ. Russ fixes things.

556
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,510
This guy, he used to kill people.

557
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,600
Can I help you folks?

558
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,500
Ye. Put your hands up.

559
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,030
Do it!

560
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,090
Booth!

561
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,280
Check him for a gun.

562
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,500
What's going on?

563
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,770
He's got a 45.

564
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,590
45. Check his ankle.

565
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,080
He's got a 38.

566
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,890
Thirty-eight. I'm always right.

567
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,950
I'm FBI. I know who you are.

568
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,180
Steve beers, pig farmer.

569
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,600
Vince McVicar, the pig farmer, huh?

570
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,260
You want to talk to Vince McVicar,

571
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,360
you do it through the federal marshals.

572
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,430
I do it through the federal marshals,

573
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,480
I'm gonna have to tell them about a pig farmer who carries two concealed weapons.

574
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,300
Three.

575
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,580
22 in the small of his back.

576
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,290
22. I'm always right.

577
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,700
No, you're not... Yes, I am.

578
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,420
Bones, will you put the gun down?

579
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,540
What do you want?

580
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,720
I'm Ruth Keenan's daughter.

581
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,850
Joy?

582
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,530
Joy Keenan?

583
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,650
Yeah... I can see that.

584
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:10,990
We found your blood in the car.

585
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,420
You hurt lots of people, Vince. You bashed in their heads.

586
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,390
They never proved that, or I wouldn't be in witness protection.

587
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,690
We know how it works, Vince.

588
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,990
You rat out your crew,

589
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,390
everybody loses interest in a few old murders.

590
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,060
My mother was hit on the head.

591
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,580
Ah, I know.

592
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,700
I was there.

593
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,210
32 stitches.

594
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,620
She fought back, huh?

595
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,710
Ruthie fought back, all right.

596
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,130
But not against me.

597
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,700
Then against whom?

598
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,280
Your father.

599
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,860
Why'd he attack you?

600
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,050
Think about it a second, all right?

601
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,730
You and my... my mother?

602
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,780
Me and Ruthie run off together.

603
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,270
Max caught us pulling into a motel outside of Champaign, Illinois.

604
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:04,710
We were nuts about each other, Ruthie and me. Crazy in love.

605
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,440
Let's just skip that part, okay?

606
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,610
Well, he hit Ruthie first.

607
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,910
With what?

608
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,360
Tire iron.

609
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,060
Hit my arm, caught me a roundhouse to the head.

610
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,890
Lights out, baby.

611
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,760
I came to. Ruthie and Max were gone.

612
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,640
Never saw neither of them again.

613
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:35,370
You ask me, Max killed Ruthie, and buried her somewhere and vanished.

614
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,890
Our plan, once we set up...

615
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,650
most likely in Florida... was to bring you down.

616
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:48,374
Your father is a hard man, Joy.

617
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,700
My name is Brennan.

618
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,660
I'm doctor...

619
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,740
I'm dr. Temperance Brennan.

620
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:01,660
I work at the jeffersonian institution;

621
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,980
I'm a forensic anthropologist; I..

622
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,080
specialize in identif...

623
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,310
...in identifying...

624
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,730
...in identifying people when nobody knows who they are.

625
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,960
My father was a science teacher, and my mother was a bookkeeper.

626
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,990
My brother... I have a brother.

627
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,510
I'm dr. Temperance Brennan.

628
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,080
I know who you are. Hey, I know.

629
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,720
It's all right. It's okay, I know. Shh, it's gonna to be all right.

630
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:39,500
No way dad killed mom. No way.

631
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,980
If he caught them together...

632
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,370
No way mom cheats on dad. No way.

633
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,300
A man like McVicar, he lies the way you guys take a drink of water.

634
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,220
He killed people and then he snitched to save his own ass.

635
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,555
You don't believe him?...

636
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,810
No. I don't believe him.

637
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,810
Give me one piece of evidence that doesn't back up his story.

638
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,230
Your school sticker on the back of your parents' car was scraped off.

639
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,140
What does that prove?

640
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,720
The only reason to do that would be to keep you guys hidden; to keep you guys safe.

641
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,534
From McVicar.

642
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:06,200
McVicar performed hits for the crew that your mom and dad ran out on.

643
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,350
What else?

644
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,960
Well, there's a story that tracks for me, but without evidence, it's...

645
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,060
it's just a story.

646
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,560
Tell us.

647
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,350
Your parents go out christmas shopping one day. They spot McVicar...

648
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,950
the hit man, all right? They lead him away from your home.

649
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,560
Scrape off the name of the school, so he can't trace it back to me and Russ.

650
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,930
He takes out your father.

651
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,680
And my mother gets away with a head wound.

652
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,070
She leaves the car a thousand miles away finds friends,

653
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,200
but she can never go back to see you guys

654
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,640
because the crew is still looking for her.

655
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,130
It's just a story.

656
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,450
Fits the evidence.

657
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,080
All right, you know what? The weapons that McVicar had on him,

658
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,580
they're a violation of his agreement with the witness protection program.

659
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm going to take him into custody,

660
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,010
I'm going to get a warrant, I'm going to search his farm.

661
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:51,260
Search for what?

662
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,200
McVicar liked to bash in people's heads.

663
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,170
Maybe we'll get lucky and match the weapon he used on your mother.

664
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,160
It's unlikely.

665
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,110
In that case, we'll still ruin his day.

666
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,450
Tempe, that theory explains why mom never came back for you

667
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,330
during that year and a half before she died.

668
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,640
What's your excuse, Russ?

669
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,480
You're the one that left me.

670
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,070
You needed someone to blame, you chose me.

671
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,670
I was 15 years old!

672
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,100
I was 19!

673
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,990
My parents were gone. My sister hated my guts,

674
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,500
everyone's telling me that she'd be better off in foster care.

675
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,732
You didn't even ask me.

676
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:33,490
I tried, Temperance! You wouldn't talk to me!

677
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,950
You still wouldn't be talking to me if mom's bones hadn't showed up.

678
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,280
And I kept trying!

679
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,550
Every year... every year... on your birthday.

680
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,690
You're the one that gave up.

681
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,830
You turned your back on me and you made yourself a new family.

682
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,830
What's going on?

683
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,680
The FBI delivered all these tools and weapons from the pig farm guy.

684
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,260
We went through them to see if any of them match the mark on your mother's skull.

685
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,790
I got 20 hammers and a dozen hatchets...

686
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,890
The man loves his blunt instruments.

687
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,640
Seven tire irons,

688
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,660
none of them match the wound,

689
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,260
even allowing for shrinkage.

690
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,260
It was 15 years ago. Even if McVicar killed my mother,

691
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,070
what are the chances he hung on to the exact weapon?

692
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,980
Well, it's always like this with McVicar. All right? You know?

693
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,270
Some mook is found with his forehead bashed in,

694
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,550
the FBI goes in the basement, collects about 40 hammers...

695
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,640
and nothing matches.

696
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,030
Always the forehead?

697
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,030
Yeah, that's his signature kill, yeah.

698
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,380
Not that anyone could ever prove it.

699
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,850
You said guys like McVicar get comfortable with a way of killing.

700
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,910
Yeah.

701
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,320
Where did McVicar grow up?

702
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,720
He grew up a farm kid in Iowa. Why?

703
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,380
How do you slaughter a pig?

704
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,280
Why's he here?

705
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,220
He gets nervous, we know we're getting close.

706
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,940
Found this in the barn.

707
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,050
This is a spring-loaded captive-bolt stunner.

708
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,260
The animal is restrained,

709
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,230
this is pressed to the forehead...

710
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,380
What kind of person could use this on a human being?

711
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,720
What kind of person could use this on a pig?

712
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,100
It's the perfect dodge.

713
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,390
Blood, flesh...

714
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,030
it can all be explained.

715
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,860
I think I just became a vegetarian.

716
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,960
So what do you think?

717
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,010
Yeah.

718
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,160
Same shape as a tire iron...

719
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,380
but smaller.

720
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,870
This could be a match.

721
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,330
Before you decide anything, we should talk.

722
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,440
I'd call that nervous, wouldn't you?

723
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,380
There's no way to prove that that's

724
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,460
the exact weapon that killed your mother or anyone else.

725
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,650
You'd be surprised at what she can prove.

726
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,750
I need to speak to you alone.

727
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,620
Forget it.

728
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,740
Booth, it's all right.

729
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,520
It's all right.

730
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,960
You got two ways to look at this.

731
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,940
One is you score a private chat.

732
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,660
The second one is, you attack her, and I'll drill you through the forehead.

733
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,490
How could I possibly attack her?

734
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,520
I'll decide what is and isn't an attack, like, say, a hiccup.

735
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,350
Booth. Come on.

736
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,330
You killed my mother.

737
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,270
Gonna be hard to convince a jury.

738
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,810
I'm pretty persuasive.

739
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,970
I'll put you away.

740
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,070
Here's the thing, Joy.

741
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,540
Two people know what really happened that night:

742
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,110
Me and your father.

743
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,160
You killed him before you attacked my mother.

744
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,900
Then how did I get this scar on my head?

745
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,230
You got a choice, Joy.

746
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,000
You drop the bolt-stunner down the well,

747
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,000
and you'll know what happened.

748
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,200
You put me in front of a jury,

749
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,750
not only will you fail to convict, but

750
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,690
you'll never know the truth.

751
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,880
You can't live with that, Joy.

752
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,920
You can't live not knowing.

753
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,290
I found out what happened to my mother;

754
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,530
I will find out what happened to my father, too.

755
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,530
We're done.

756
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,570
You will never know what happened to your father.

757
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,970
Why are you letting me drive?

758
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,920
It's a reward.

759
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,830
For what?

760
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,750
Totally pissing off a hit man.

761
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,630
Can I read your book?

762
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,880
After it's come out.

763
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,510
Not before?

764
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,200
No.

765
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,860
Oh, but I let you drive.

766
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,990
Just let it go.

767
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,930
Where we going?

768
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,830
I'd like to make up for a little lost time.

769
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,940
I'm- I'm gonna go get a funnel cake. Okay?

770
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,470
I have something for you.

771
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,740
Thanks, Tempe.

772
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,700
Russ...

773
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,690
You were right.

774
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,960
You were only 19, but at the time...

775
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,010
I didn't understand what that meant.

776
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,620
Sometimes people need to...

777
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,510
explain things to me, I guess.

778
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,930
Then you have to let them talk to you.

779
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:48,790
If... you could maybe come back and stay a couple days longer?

780
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,830
Please?

781
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,650
At my place, I mean?

782
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,090
Marco.

783
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,570
Polo.

784
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,870
Anybody thirsty?

785
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,620
Is it too early for a beer?

786
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,130
Ah, I gotta go, you know? I'm picking up Parker for the weekend.

787
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,950
Yeah, I'll take one.

788
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,910
You have a boy?

789
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,100
Yeah...

790
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,500
Woman I'm seeing, she's got two daughters.

791
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,300
Nice.

792
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,910
Girls are nice.

793
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,510
To us.

794
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,950
Whoever the hell we are.

795
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,080
To what we're becoming.

796
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,040
<i>New message recorded today, 3:00 P.M.</i>

797
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,570
<i>Temperance, you have to stop looking.</i>

798
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,030
<i>You have to stop looking for me right now.</i>

799
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,270
<i>This is bigger and worse than you know.</i>

800
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,160
<i>Please, sweetheart, stop now.</i>

801
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,690
Who's that?

802
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,640
That was my father.
