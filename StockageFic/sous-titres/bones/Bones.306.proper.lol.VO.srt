1
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:08,072
Smoke comes out of the vents
into the first four break rooms.

2
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:10,268
You're sure you turned
the flame down last night?

3
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:13,397
Totally, 100% guaranteed,
positively sure.

4
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:16,290
Alarm's gone off before,
but the smoke was always gray.

5
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:18,688
One time, a possum
got stuck in the shaft.

6
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:22,295
- Smoke came out like this.
- Dr. Addy was conducting an experiment

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,694
on a pig yesterday.

8
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,474
I told all them eggheads

9
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:28,549
not to toss dead animals
down the incinerator shaft.

10
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,659
Since when do they listen to us?

11
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:34,878
Holy crap!

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,664
Definitely not pork.

13
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,084
At 400 degrees, bone chars in six hours,

14
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,826
and turns to ash in eight.

15
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,560
Charring, no ash.

16
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,652
Six to eight hours?

17
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,289
Dumped into the incinerator
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,024
Alive or dead before he or
she went into the incinerator?

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,428
Can't tell yet.

20
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,352
- What's that?
- Guest log.

21
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:11,085
No visitors checked out
after 9:36 last night,

22
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:14,992
no one checked in
before 8:02 this morning.

23
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,708
Meaning the victim probably works here.

24
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,025
Meaning the killer does, too.

25
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,609
Pubic bone is female.

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,984
There's no carbon in the trachea.

27
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:29,585
She was dead before
she was thrown down the chute.

28
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,210
Extensive fissures, fractures and breaks

29
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,716
to the entire skeleton.

30
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:36,836
I'll have Zack determine
which were caused by heat

31
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:38,125
and which by trauma.

32
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:39,269
Heads up.

33
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:42,795
They called Bancroft in
from a hearing on the Hill.

34
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:44,345
Who's Bancroft again?

35
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:45,394
God!

36
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,825
The Supreme Honcho of the Jeffersonian.

37
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:50,207
I think I met him once.

38
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,339
Okay, I am ready to start
the facial reconstruction.

39
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:56,124
I haven't put on
tissue depth markers yet.

40
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,817
I haven't finished removing
all the carbonized brain matter.

41
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,592
Once you've done that,
Zack can clean the skull.

42
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,502
Are you all right?

43
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,866
What's wrong?

44
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:25,438
I'm fine.

45
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:28,991
I'll start after
the tissue markers are...

46
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:33,296
Let me know.

47
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,228
What the hell was that about?

48
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:45,993
Bones S03E06

--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

52
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,696
You won't like it.

53
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:20,956
Like what?

54
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:23,235
I've ID'd the victim.

55
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,211
That's impossible.

56
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,923
- Told you you wouldn't like it.
- There are no tissue markers.

57
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:30,588
You can't just look at a skull
and see the person.

58
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,812
I've done hundreds
of these reconstructions.

59
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:36,631
The depressed glabella,

60
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,841
the narrow nasal aperture,
the chipped lateral incisor.

61
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,736
You can see a face from that?

62
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,511
The chipped tooth was
from a skiing accident...

63
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,060
when she was 16.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,130
you know the victim personally?

65
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,827
Kristen Reardon.

66
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,775
She's an intern.

67
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,845
We had coffee a couple of times.

68
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,906
She didn't want to be a scientist.

69
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,498
She wanted to go into design.

70
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,929
She was just here to
make her father happy.

71
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,536
She was young and...

72
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,241
eager and keen and...

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,798
She was just really, really young.

74
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,856
Wait. Reardon?

75
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,064
As in Dr. Ted Reardon?

76
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,687
- Yeah. He used to work here.
- I took a course from him

77
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,275
in Ancient Pharmacology.

78
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,385
Look, I know we can't say anything
until you do the tissue markers

79
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,590
and we go through channels,
but I'm telling you,

80
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,512
I know that this is Kristen.

81
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:31,784
Poor Ted.

82
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,293
You want to know something else?

83
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,067
She was seeing somebody who worked here.

84
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:38,295
Is that relevant?

85
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,194
Well, Booth will think so.

86
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,634
Especially since it was a married man.

87
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,078
Did she tell you who?

88
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,246
No.

89
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,261
Just that they had had their first kiss

90
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,115
at the opening of that Egyptian exhibit,

91
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,811
and that it had been hot
and heavy ever since.

92
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,431
I'm sorry, Ange.

93
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:54,812
No, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,864
I'm just really freaked out by this one.

95
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,748
- Because you know the victim.
- And the killer.

96
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:02,725
I mean, look around.

97
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,922
Do you like thinking
that somebody we see every day

98
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,635
could have thrown Kristen
into the incinerator?

99
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,098
How can I aid your investigation?

100
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,360
Well, Dr. Bancroft,

101
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,845
I'd like printouts
from the Jeffersonian Security

102
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,938
detailing who was and...

103
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,620
was not in the building.

104
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,417
- Done.
- I'd also appreciate it

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,668
if you would tell your people
to cooperate with the FBI.

106
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,939
Yes. Of course, agent Booth.

107
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:33,532
I don't know if you've had much cause
to work with scientists.

108
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,544
Difficult people by nature.

109
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,993
Combative, skeptical, resistant.

110
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:40,567
I've noticed.

111
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,907
- Have you identified the victim?
- Unofficially,

112
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,238
An intern by the name
of Kristen Reardon.

113
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,113
No relation to Ted Reardon?

114
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,440
His daughter.

115
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:54,913
Dr. Reardon left the Jeffersonian
for Georgetown University?

116
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:58,046
In the interests of full disclosure,
I was instrumental in that move.

117
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,190
You fired him.

118
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,708
- I facilitated a necessary change.
- Necessary change?

119
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:06,258
Excellent scientist, poor administrator.
Does Reardon know about his daughter?

120
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,235
Dr. Brennan is informing him now.

121
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,261
I'd like to be kept in the loop on this.

122
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:13,023
Within the constraints
of the law, of course.

123
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:14,632
Sure.

124
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:18,492
Ted Reardon? Victim's father?

125
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,718
Bones is telling him
his daughter's dead.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,904
Rumor has it Bancroft banished
Reardon from the Jeffersonian

127
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,198
because he felt threatened politically.

128
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:29,614
I know. Let's leave Bones to it.

129
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:35,012
Would it be insensitive to mention

130
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,093
that my father's
60th birthday is coming up?

131
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,526
60 already?

132
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,507
We're having a big birthday dinner
for him on Thursday night.

133
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,164
You give him my best.

134
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,129
Do it yourself.
You have to come with me.

135
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,886
What? No. Not your family.

136
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,723
I can't spend the night
defending the fact

137
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,524
that I still live alone to my family.

138
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,045
You never told them we broke up?

139
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,587
You wanna make a man miserable on
his 60th birthday.

140
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:56,787
You want me to pretend
that I'm your boyfriend?

141
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:59,348
Yes. Between 6:30 and 10:00 on Thursday.

142
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:00,854
Camille, you're an adult.

143
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,506
You can't live your life afraid
of what your family thinks.

144
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,489
Seeley, it's not going
to be like this forever.

145
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,029
One day, he'll die.

146
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:11,382
Tough going in there?

147
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:14,224
I've never had to tell
someone his child is dead.

148
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:17,148
I've been there when you did it
but to actually...

149
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:20,050
It's extremely unpleasant.

150
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,974
Listen, did you get a chance to...

151
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,905
ask him about his daughter's love life?

152
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,061
Yes. He said, as far as he knew,
she wasn't seeing anyone.

153
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,553
Kristen was lying to her father.

154
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,541
Dr. Brennan, is it true?

155
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:36,986
Kristen Reardon is dead?

156
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:39,483
Evan, Special Agent Booth.

157
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,420
He's in charge
of the murder investigation.

158
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:44,229
Dr. Evan Klimkew,
Kristen Reardon's supervisor.

159
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,185
Murder? Kristen was murdered?

160
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,261
What did Kristen Reardon do?

161
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:49,914
Authentications.

162
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,041
Other museums and high-end collectors,

163
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,900
use us to authenticate
their acquisitions.

164
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,128
- That a big department?
- Three to five interns,

165
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:57,423
all doctoral candidates,

166
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,069
my assistant and myself. That's it.

167
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,130
It's a competive environment.

168
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:04,539
Of course. You put a bunch of neurotic,
type-A overachievers together,

169
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,201
you dangle a prize over their heads...

170
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,333
Dr. Klimkew is referring
to the Bates Fellowship.

171
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,889
The top intern receives $75,000
and a gold star on their resume.

172
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,167
Kristen was the front-runner.

173
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:15,924
I had heard that her heart wasn't in it.

174
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:17,686
Didn't show in her work.

175
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,686
God, this is terrible.

176
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,246
Does her father know?

177
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,732
Who was her main rival
for the Bates money?

178
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,223
That would be Neil Tyler.

179
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,340
Neil Tyler. Where can I find him?

180
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,677
We're authenticating the artifacts
in your serial killer vault.

181
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,727
So what does your wife think of these...

182
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,507
you know, these late hours?

183
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:36,337
I'm separated.

184
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:39,156
- That's your answer.
- Are you seeing anyone now?

185
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:40,428
Are you serious?

186
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,601
It's a murder investigation, Evan.

187
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,018
No. I'm not seeing anyone.

188
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:47,087
Thank you, Dr. Klimkew.

189
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:55,472
This spinner appears
to be Masonic in origin...

190
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:56,883
bloodstone, gold...

191
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:00,216
But what's interesting is,
in the center,

192
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:03,295
instead of the traditional "G" for God,

193
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:04,821
there's a skull.

194
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,223
Gormogon iconography.

195
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,430
Strange.

196
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,861
We've been seeing a lot of that in here.

197
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:14,089
Gormogon? Okay, what's that?

198
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,087
- It's an 18th century...
- It's an extinct...

199
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,820
group dedicated to eradicating
the influence of the <i>Freemasons</i>

200
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,970
and <i>Illuminati</i> in Europe
in the 18th century.

201
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:26,144
That could be the largest collection
of Gormogon artifacts in the world.

202
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,467
That's great. You and Kristen
were here last night?

203
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,605
That's right.

204
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,403
Kristen worked there.

205
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:33,646
I signed out around midnight.

206
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,981
Kristen stayed longer, like always.

207
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:38,524
Okay. A little resentful there?

208
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:41,155
I worked my way through state college.

209
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,891
I've got a second job,
which is why I had to leave early.

210
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,886
Kristen went to an Ivy League
school, and Dad's got connections.

211
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,990
Who do you think needed
the Bates Fellowship more?

212
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:52,297
Oh, the way I hear it, you're next in
line for a big payday, pal.

213
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,954
I liked Kristen, and she liked me.

214
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:57,464
Check the logs. I wasn't here.

215
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,751
Do you know who Kristen was seeing?

216
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,672
You mean like romantically? No.

217
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,592
Only that it was an older guy,
and she said I was going to be

218
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,591
really surprised when
I found out who it was.

219
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,442
How about you? You married?

220
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:11,881
I'm gay, Agent Booth.

221
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,722
Excuse me.

222
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:19,502
What do you got?

223
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,751
Kristen Reardon's bag.

224
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:24,803
Ah, cell phone...

225
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,570
Logs.

226
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,418
The bag tells us that Kristen wasn't
leaving the museum

227
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,356
- when she met with her killer.
- A lot of calls to the same number.

228
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,686
- Let's hope it's our cheating husband.
- Kristen was authenticating artifacts

229
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:41,997
from the Gormogon Vault.

230
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,037
- Let's not go there.
- If Gormogon killed her,

231
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,512
then Gormogon is one of us...

232
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,383
somebody who works at the Jeffersonian.

233
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:48,429
You went there.

234
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,284
What?

235
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,746
You went there and you
gave him a nickname.

236
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:56,109
- That just happened, right?
- You saw that?

237
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,241
- Who is it?
- Is he dead?

238
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,147
Yes, but only because
he was never alive.

239
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,057
- You got to be kidding me.
- Look at this.

240
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,682
The Gestapo's interfering
with free inquiry.

241
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:13,593
Guys, just let 'em go. And if they try
to escape, shoot 'em.

242
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:17,032
- What's with the dummy, dummies?
- Not a dummy. It's an ersatz skeleton

243
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:19,240
made from glass and reinforced nylon,

244
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,372
which breaks exactly like human bone.

245
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:22,979
We threw it from the top floor.

246
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:25,002
Explicate your process, please.

247
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:27,846
Using bone density tables,
we duplicated Kristen's

248
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,311
exact height and weight.

249
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:30,768
For God's sake, why?

250
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,796
To prove that Kristen Reardon was dead
before her skull fractured

251
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,554
from falling down the incinerator chute.

252
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,994
- we already know that.
- We re-created her bone density

253
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,120
and found that her skull
would not have fractured

254
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,815
in the way it did from a fall
less than 25 meters.

255
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,475
"Oh," what? English, please.

256
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,192
That tells us the body was put
in the trash chute

257
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,724
on the top floor of our building.

258
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,672
The office suites.
It's always the suits, baby.

259
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:54,105
Hey, I work suits.

260
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,082
Yes, yes, you do.

261
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,566
All right, that's it. No shooting of
the squints tonight. Sorry.

262
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,133
All right, good work. Let's go, Bones.

263
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,555
Kristen Reardon was stabbed to death.

264
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,243
Aorta and left lung both punctured.

265
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,063
Whoa. She bleed a lot?

266
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,251
Through the wound, through her mouth.
Copious amounts.

267
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,416
Booth, everyone's coming
around to the opinion

268
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:18,500
that Kristen Reardon's death had
something to do with the Gormogon Vault.

269
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:22,676
See, we got to squelch that one
'cause that will totally shift the focus

270
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,883
- of this investigation.
- You might have noticed,

271
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,585
but these people are tough to squelch.

272
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,201
They're always telling
us not to jump to conclusions.

273
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,259
But when they do,
it's called a "quantum leap."

274
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:34,312
Jump, leap, tomato, "tomato,"
what's the difference?

275
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:37,861
Look, um, does the name
Aldridge mean anything to you?

276
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,526
Rings a bell, yeah. Why?

277
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:43,129
'Cause there was no blood near the
incinerator chute on the top floor.

278
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,105
The body could have been wrapped
in plastic or transported in a tub.

279
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,596
There's a Dr. Kyle Aldridge,

280
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,770
heads up the Middle East
department. Why?

281
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:51,890
Hmm, do they have offices
in this building?

282
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,884
Middle East department is in
Building S, but it joins up

283
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:56,521
to this building by a skyway. Why?

284
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,359
What floor does the skyway connect with?

285
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:01,358
Top floor. I'm gonna ask why again,
and this time you're gonna tell me.

286
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:03,950
This guy Aldridge's number's
all over Kristen's cell phone.

287
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,083
Just hold on.

288
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,152
Yeah, it's Booth.

289
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:09,537
Check out all the offices in the
adjoining building on the top floor.

290
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:12,323
Start with a Dr. K. Aldridge.

291
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,009
Cam, this case?

292
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:18,770
Yes, you still have to come
to my father's birthday dinner.

293
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,595
I didn't even bring that up.

294
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,145
- Nice try.
- Nice try what?

295
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:24,289
I didn't even...

296
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:31,162
Ah, the good life. Dr. Kyle Aldridge.

297
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,422
Mansion next to Teddy
Kennedy on Dupont Circle?

298
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,693
A 60-foot yacht and...

299
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:38,959
a vacation home in the Hamptons.

300
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:45,625
I wish I'd paid more attention
during science class.

301
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:48,307
Intelligence is not a matter
of will, Agent Booth.

302
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,980
So it's not a character flaw to be less
intelligent than someone else.

303
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:53,888
Yeah. Listen, I appreciate the pep talk.

304
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:56,342
Listen, our first suspect
would usually be your wife,

305
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,981
but since she's been in Venice
for a month...

306
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:00,946
Venice.

307
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,073
So how is it that somebody who makes

308
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:07,137
80 grand a year can lend
Ted Kennedy his lawn mower

309
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:10,562
and afford to send his wife
off to Venice?

310
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,885
My wife's family is very generous.

311
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:16,284
How generous do you think they would be
if they found out that you were...

312
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,044
bonking an intern?

313
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,246
They teach you that technique
at Quantico?

314
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:24,572
Spring vulgarities on the unsuspecting
suspect,

315
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,412
and he will confess all?

316
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:28,499
Are you confessing all?

317
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:31,270
To the affair or to murder?

318
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,923
Excuse me, agent Booth. There's
something you're gonna want to see

319
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,229
in Dr. Aldridge's workroom.

320
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:39,229
Lights, please?

321
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,415
Look at all that blood.

322
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:49,225
This cart explains how the body
was transported over

323
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,142
to the incinerator chute.

324
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,618
This must be where Kristen
Reardon was actually murdered.

325
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,346
All right, put the lights on.

326
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,092
OK, Dr. Aldridge, I'd like to ask
you a few questions

327
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:09,740
about the murder of Kristen Reardon.

328
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,354
We gonna go willingly?

329
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,503
I never liked Kyle Aldridge.

330
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:27,552
He told me once that having a high IQ
was no excuse not to bathe.

331
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:29,066
I don't believe it.

332
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,435
No, those were his exact words,
"No excuse not to bathe."

333
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,808
What do you got?

334
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:37,566
Consistent with the trauma
to the left lung and aorta,

335
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,623
the C-7 vertebrae and the fifth rib

336
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,132
were both nicked at a 67-degree angle,

337
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:44,149
suggesting a single point of entry.

338
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,374
Through the back?

339
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:48,380
The serial killer eats human flesh.

340
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,530
Kyle Aldridge is a vegetarian.

341
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:51,640
So was Hitler.

342
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,487
We're calling him "Gormogon" now.

343
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,844
Excellent name
and historically accurate.

344
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:58,990
People, you have to stop assuming
that Gormogon was in any way

345
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,660
- involved in Kristen's death.
- Why?

346
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:03,746
It's somewhere between
a possibility and probability.

347
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,231
Kyle Aldridge is not a cannibal.

348
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:09,381
But he may have killed his girlfriend.
Do you see the difference?

349
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:11,959
So, eyes on the evidence, okay?

350
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:12,949
Go.

351
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,822
Zack provided me with a fragment.

352
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:17,463
Retrieved from the fifth rib.

353
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,689
- Running it through the GC mass spec.
- What about the incinerator?

354
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,434
I analyzed the ashes in the incinerator

355
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,740
and found carbonized traces of
Cedrus libani.

356
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,156
It's a species of cedar fir
from Lebanon.

357
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,427
The Middle East is Aldridge's
area of study.

358
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,868
And the Mesopotamians used cedar as
an odor neutralizer

359
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:37,822
during funerals to mask
the smell of burning flesh.

360
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:41,282
Can you see Aldridge committing
a crime of passion

361
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:43,432
and using his knowledge to cover it up?

362
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:44,519
I guess.

363
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:46,877
He's kind of...

364
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,610
Exactly how well doyou know Aldridge?

365
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,203
We had drinks.

366
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,729
I don't sleep with married men.

367
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,912
You're married,

368
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,804
and you sleep with men
besides your husband.

369
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,261
What's the difference?

370
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,862
Why do you want me
to interrogate Aldridge?

371
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:10,486
Because he thinks I'm stupid.

372
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,613
- You're not.
- Thanks, Bones, I know.

373
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:16,051
Listen, during the interrogation, always
refer to the victim by her first name.

374
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,586
You're the one that told me
that personalizing the victim

375
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,644
doesn't work with
sociopathic serial killers.

376
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,532
They lack all empathy. You told me that.

377
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,140
We are not looking for Gorgonzola today.

378
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,032
Gormogon. Gor-mo-gon.

379
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:30,901
We're looking for someone who murdered
one girl and tossed her down

380
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,816
an incinerator chute. Entirely different
kind of a guy, so inside.

381
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,317
Don't tell me... Don't...
You're not bossing me... Stop it.

382
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:44,281
Kyle Aldridge seduced my daughter?

383
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,177
That's what we hope to find out, Doc.

384
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,193
There's definitely Kristen's
blood on your worktable.

385
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,894
That proves only she was killed
in my workroom.

386
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,363
Why am I talking to you?

387
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:56,138
What time did you leave
the Jeffersonian that night?

388
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,664
Shortly after 11:00.

389
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:02,148
Dr. Brennan, surely I merit
someone higher up the food chain

390
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:04,500
than an FBI consultant.

391
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:09,263
Kyle, I know you get everything you want

392
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,895
by flaunting your superior intellect,

393
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:14,214
but that won't work with me.

394
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,735
Why is that?

395
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,983
Because I'm smarter than you are.

396
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:22,778
So why don't we do the rational thing
and cut to the chase?

397
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,345
Were you having an affair with Kristen?

398
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:30,545
- I'm not willing to comment on that.
- Again, I know you were.

399
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,944
You first kissed at the opening
of the Egyptian Exhibit.

400
00:18:37,238 --> 00:18:39,349
Obviously, Kristen was indiscreet.

401
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,325
If your wife knew about Kristen,
she'd leave you, correct?

402
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:45,187
And you'd no longer be rich.

403
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:50,578
See, the FBI, they call that a "motive."

404
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,908
They think you did this, Dr. Aldridge.

405
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,763
And so far, the evidence
is on their side.

406
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:59,659
Can you tell me anything

407
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:01,774
that would suggest otherwise?

408
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:04,595
Yes.

409
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,596
But first I need to speak with a lawyer

410
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,862
and make arrangements with a
federal prosecutor.

411
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:12,115
Sounds like you want to cut a deal.

412
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,041
I've told you what I need.

413
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:16,291
So either have me arrested

414
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,259
or let me make those arrangements.

415
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:30,039
- All right, thank you, Doctor.
- Okay.

416
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,113
You look great!

417
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:35,231
I mean that objectively,
not as your fake boyfriend.

418
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,584
Thank you.

419
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,705
Hey, got your dad a universal remote.

420
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,474
Even bought the batteries.

421
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:43,069
Oh. He'll never let us break up.

422
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,387
So, am I driving?

423
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,787
No, my sister's picking us up.
But of course, she's late.

424
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,971
Okay. Maybe she's late
because there was traffic.

425
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,939
Maybe she's late 'cause there
was a sale.

426
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,016
Great. It's gonna be one
of those nights.

427
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,837
Hey, it's not me. She's the jealous,
competitive one.

428
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:59,373
- You don't think so?
- Look, I'm thinking it's your family.

429
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,588
I am an innocent bystander

430
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,546
with a universal remote and batteries

431
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,631
trying not to get hit
by shrapnel, that's all.

432
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:10,215
Ready. Sorry. Dad is in the car.

433
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:13,107
Okay, let me get my things.

434
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,051
There was traffic.
Not that she'd believe me.

435
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:20,277
No, traffic, that's
exactly what she said.

436
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:21,711
This is gonna be fun.

437
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:24,868
Yeah, everyone talking about how
perfect Cam's life is.

438
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:27,626
No, Cam's life is not so perfect.

439
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:29,715
You have a lot going for you.

440
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:31,414
Yeah?

441
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,189
Yeah.

442
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:34,957
What's not so great?

443
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,472
Are you and Cam...

444
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,581
What?

445
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:39,615
No.

446
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:42,505
- I should've never have said anything.
- Oh, you poor baby.

447
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:47,253
Okay, Felicia...

448
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,051
You don't have to say anything.

449
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,352
I'm here, that's all you need to know.

450
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,132
Okay.

451
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:56,463
Let's go.

452
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,435
Let's go.

453
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,238
Yeah, okay. You look great.

454
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,625
Doesn't she look beautiful?

455
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,556
She looks beautiful! God, I'm so lucky

456
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,335
to have you as my girlfriend.

457
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,704
Easy, big guy, it's gonna be all night.

458
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:08,242
Tell me about it.

459
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,496
You know, Jack,

460
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,920
you are actually a better
candidate to be Gormogon

461
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,566
than Kyle Aldridge.

462
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,615
Really?

463
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:22,963
You're brilliant...

464
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:25,036
paranoid about conspiracies...

465
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,623
I say that lovingly...

466
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,882
with limitless resources.

467
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:30,586
I'm not Gormogon.

468
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,746
I don't kill people and eat their faces.

469
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,787
I'm not waging a secret
war against anybody.

470
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:45,389
Great. Now, if I can only get the other
thousand or so people who work here

471
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,488
to convince me,
maybe I can sleep tonight.

472
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,973
Oh, I'll help you get to sleep tonight.

473
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,287
What's in your file?

474
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,167
GC mass spec analysis

475
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,861
of the fragment we pulled
from Kristen's rib.

476
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,177
It's 800-year-old copper.

477
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:02,763
Wait a minute.
The murder weapon is an artifact?

478
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:05,092
I thought we'd see if we can match
any of the weapons

479
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:07,220
in the Jeffersonian to the sample.

480
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,476
Well, there is one item.

481
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:13,375
An 800-year-old copper spear tip.

482
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:17,880
The authentication department checked
it out two weeks ago to a...

483
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,969
Dr. Kyle Aldridge

484
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:21,666
in the Middle Eastern Department.

485
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,676
Checked it out from where?

486
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:28,059
The Gormogon Vault.

487
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:35,129
Tell us about this piece, Dr. Klimkew.

488
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,158
The spearhead is genuine... decorative,

489
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:41,020
probably brought back
as a souvenir of the Crusades

490
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:43,881
by a Templar Knight in 1200 or 1300 A.D.

491
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:45,609
Go ahead, Hodgins.

492
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,079
What are you doing?

493
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:50,411
Did you see Kyle Aldridge the night
that Kristen Reardon was murdered?

494
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,521
Yes. What is he doing
with the spearhead?

495
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,160
It's phenolphthalein.

496
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:55,625
It won't affect the copper.

497
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:58,879
But if blood is present,
it'll turn pink.

498
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,398
So, what time did you see the doctor?

499
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,583
11:00... in the parking lot.

500
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,966
Did you talk?

501
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,021
Kyle Aldridge doesn't really talk to
anyone beneath him, which is everyone.

502
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:17,701
It's not the weapon we're looking for.
I'll put it back.

503
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,502
Did you know about Aldridge and Kristen?

504
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,404
- As a couple?
- Yes.

505
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:26,758
- Kristen told you?
- No, I caught them making out.

506
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,180
Frankly, I've been surprised ever since
that Aldridge didn't use his friendship

507
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:33,058
with Bancroft to have me transferred
to some dig in Darfur.

508
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,156
Help!

509
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,175
I need some help back here!

510
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:37,282
What?

511
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:38,593
Booth! Booth!

512
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,049
Hold on, hold on.

513
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,228
Easy, easy.

514
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,209
- I'll call an ambulance.
- We don't need an ambulance.

515
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,622
He's already dead.

516
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,911
That concludes the autopsy
of Dr. Kyle Aldridge.

517
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,409
Written report to follow.

518
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:15,073
Booth saw Aldridge's widow.

519
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:18,171
He sent her a suicide note by e-mail

520
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,758
apologizing for the affair with Kristen

521
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,073
and confessing to the killing.

522
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,127
Aldridge did not kill himself.

523
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,836
The ligature which was a
silk cord from the vault

524
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:29,263
didn't break his hyoid.

525
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,457
What was the cause of death?
I'm stumped.

526
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,534
No significant trauma, no cardiac
arrest, aneurysm or hematoma.

527
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:38,651
Plus, I did a full tox screen...
organics, inorganics,

528
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:40,967
heavy metals, even cardiac glycosides.

529
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,350
All negative.

530
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,520
Well, he was hung up in the vault.

531
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:46,879
It all circles back to the vault.

532
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:49,291
It all circles back to the
authentications department

533
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:51,160
who happened to be working in the vault.

534
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:54,654
Why don't you and Booth think that
Gormogon is behind these murders?

535
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:58,239
Because as far as we know, he only kills
males. And snacks on them.

536
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:01,210
Plus, there are far too many
other reasonable suspects.

537
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:02,375
Like who?

538
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:04,005
The victim's father.

539
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:05,107
Ted Reardon?

540
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:08,086
He saw you question Aldridge.
Booth said he went pale with anger.

541
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,311
When did he say that?

542
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:11,607
Oh, we had dinner the other
night when we...

543
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,750
had dinner.

544
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:17,253
This cord is actually a hanging rope
from England,

545
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:19,394
circa 1650.

546
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,734
In those days when sentenced to death,
nobles often chose a silk cord

547
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,986
rather than rough hempen rope.

548
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:27,505
It'd be cool to know who else
might've died on this cord.

549
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:31,111
If it came from the vault, the cord
probably can't lead us to the murderer.

550
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,585
Au contraire.

551
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,726
The killer left DNA.

552
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:36,324
In order to hoist Aldridge,

553
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:40,169
the killer wrapped the cord
around his forearm and pulled.

554
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,774
- He left some skin behind?
- Yeah, and hair.

555
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,260
Nice job, Hodgins.

556
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,532
We find the guy, we can do a DNA match.

557
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,930
King of the lab.

558
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,590
The skeletal muscles
are pulling away from the bone.

559
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:56,570
What's his potassium level?

560
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:59,348
blood serum contains...

561
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:01,655
ten milligrams per 100 milliliters.

562
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:03,660
Elevated, but non-fatal.

563
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,039
It's odd, though, because
his kidneys were healthy,

564
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,569
no signs of Addison's or any medication.

565
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:09,950
Succinylcholine.

566
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:11,955
- A muscle relaxant?
- In high doses,

567
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,777
it stops the heart and lungs.

568
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:14,916
Right.

569
00:26:14,984 --> 00:26:17,553
The body turns succinylcholine
into potassium,

570
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,078
which occurs naturally in the body,
so it's not detected as a toxin.

571
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,133
Succinylcholine is one of the
earliest anesthetics known to man.

572
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,565
Guess how I know that.

573
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,724
I read Dr. Reardon's book, too.

574
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,656
Why are you here?

575
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,464
I'm just waiting for Cam
to finish cutting up Aldridge.

576
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,062
She's done.

577
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:49,999
Why are you here in my area?

578
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,023
Cam's sister kissed me.

579
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,966
Dude...

580
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,301
Don't call me "dude". All right, listen,
I was supposed to be Cam's boyfriend,

581
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:58,628
but only between the hours
of 6:30 and 10:00.

582
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,390
She kissed me at 6:20,

583
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:02,315
so technically, that doesn't even count.

584
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:06,104
Cam went to her office to get something,
Felicia, she just grabbed me

585
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:07,666
and planted one on me.

586
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:11,724
I didn't even see it coming. I didn't
even have a defense maneuver planned.

587
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,598
All right, all right, how are you, uh...
How are you gonna bring it to Cam?

588
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:17,578
What?
Why would I do that?

589
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,726
You want her to find out
from her sister?

590
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:23,907
Wow, this is worse
than when we were a couple.

591
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,732
Sorry.

592
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:30,362
I really should take my gun
out and shoot you now.

593
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:33,706
I'm sorry, man. No, it's serious.

594
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:36,590
You're not helping.

595
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:42,354
Look, I have a son. If I thought someone
hurt him, I'd want to hang him.

596
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,267
I didn't kill Kyle Aldridge.

597
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:47,534
He was a political enemy who slept with
your daughter then killed her

598
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:50,170
after she threatened to tell his wife.

599
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:52,434
Juries understand situations like that.

600
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,807
There's no proof Kyle Aldridge
killed my daughter.

601
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,901
- Do you need proof?
- Yes. And for a jury

602
00:27:56,948 --> 00:27:59,265
to be sympathetic to me,
they'd need proof as well.

603
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,352
Do you have that proof, Agent Booth?

604
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,512
Aldridge didn't die from hanging.

605
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,283
Succinylcholine poisoning
can't be proven.

606
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,092
Right.

607
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,984
Nobody knows that better than you.

608
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:14,563
You literally wrote the book on it, Doc.

609
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:15,683
So...

610
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:20,052
Can you roll up your sleeves, please?

611
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:35,992
This is a sample of 800-year-old bronze.

612
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,904
- Why am I interested in that?
- Because we found a fragment

613
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,797
of 800-year-old copper
in Kristen Reardon.

614
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:43,610
- Different metals, right.
- Copper is an ingredient in bronze.

615
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:46,316
And when Angela accused me
of being Gormogon,

616
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:49,719
- It started me thinking.
- Angela accused you of being Gormogon?

617
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:53,758
It started me thinking that you and
Booth could be right.

618
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,557
I am not Gormogon.

619
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:01,675
Booth and I could be right about what?

620
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:03,905
I put the serial killer
in the vault out of my mind

621
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:07,544
and started considering Kristen's murder
as its own singular

622
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,495
occurrence... what?

623
00:29:09,685 --> 00:29:12,827
From the outside, you are a pretty good
candidate to be Gormogon.

624
00:29:12,944 --> 00:29:14,196
It's possible...

625
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:17,216
that the copper in Kristen's
wound was unalloyed chip

626
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,929
from a larger piece of bronze.

627
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,557
Like a chocolate chip that
didn't melt in the cake mix.

628
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,919
And the Jeffersonian's full
of bronze weapons.

629
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:26,802
None of which are in Gormogon's vault.

630
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:29,531
Are you able to match a bronze weapon
to a copper fragment?

631
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,659
Theoretically.

632
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,007
It would take about 200 years to test
every bronze weapon in the Jeffersonian.

633
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:36,030
I might be able to help with that.

634
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:39,172
I worked up a 3-D model
of Kristen's murder,

635
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:40,772
and I noticed something.

636
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,132
This is Kristen.

637
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:47,837
The angle of attack
was exactly 67 degrees.

638
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:50,418
As you can see, the weapon
went right through her.

639
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:52,160
- Which is weird.
- Why?

640
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:54,366
We've been assuming that Kristen
was stabbed.

641
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:57,435
Someone would have to be awfully tall
to stab downward at that angle.

642
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,395
And incredibly strong.

643
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,822
Six foot eight and 300 pounds.

644
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:03,803
No one at the Jeffersonian
looks like that.

645
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:06,322
It'd be pretty tough for someone
like that to sneak in.

646
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,997
Alternative explanations?

647
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,269
- Projectile.
- Blood stain analysis

648
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,972
indicates Kristen was killed
on Aldridge's work table.

649
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:15,357
And there's no evidence
on the surface suggesting

650
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:18,635
that a projectile exited Kristen's
body and struck the table.

651
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:19,654
But...

652
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:27,231
Kristen was impaled?

653
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:29,648
Like a piece of paper
on a message spike.

654
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,328
Visualize a sharp object on the table

655
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:34,930
at a fixed 67-degree angle.

656
00:30:35,061 --> 00:30:38,629
The object impales Kristen
through the posterior thorax.

657
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,639
Exits her anterior thorax.

658
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,618
Still at a 67-degree angle.

659
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,368
The only rational conclusion is
the death itself was accidental.

660
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,042
Dr. Aldridge gets in a tiff
with his young girlfriend.

661
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:54,261
She pulls out her phone,
threatens to call his wife.

662
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:56,992
They argue, Aldridge
reaches for the phone,

663
00:30:57,081 --> 00:31:00,764
- The girl falls back under the table.
- If you call Aldridge by his name,

664
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,254
you really should call
"the girl" by her name.

665
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:07,322
At which point, he panics and throw
Ms. Reardon down the incinerator chute.

666
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:11,387
Overcome with remorse, he arranges to
meet with the federal attorney

667
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:14,543
to confess, but before he can do that,
guilt destroys him.

668
00:31:14,628 --> 00:31:16,266
He hangs himself in the vault,

669
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,994
symbolically aligning himself
with the serial killer.

670
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:22,419
Aldridge arranged to meet
the federal attorney?

671
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:24,589
Through the Jeffersonian
in-house counsel.

672
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,368
- Most likely to confess.
- Why didn't he just confess

673
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:29,772
during Dr. Brennan's interrogation?

674
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,432
"The guilt being great,
the fear doth still exceed."

675
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:35,067
"And extreme fear

676
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:36,698
"can neither fight nor fly,

677
00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:39,273
but coward-like
with trembling terror die."

678
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,050
Unfortunately for Mr. Shakespeare,

679
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,789
Dr. Aldridge didn't
actually commit suicide.

680
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,205
He died of succinylcholine poison.

681
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:48,705
It's my understanding that
that can't be proven.

682
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,081
At least not to court standards.

683
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:55,081
I think you'll find that my explanation
will satisfy any inquest inquiry.

684
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:57,469
Dr. Bancroft, it's our
professional opinion

685
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:01,363
here in the forensics lab,
that Dr. Aldridge was murdered.

686
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,139
Fine. Prove it.

687
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,566
But watch your backs.

688
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,224
Because if I'm wrong and you're right,

689
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,996
that means there's still
a serial killer out there.

690
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,309
And if I were the killer,
you'd be next, Ms. Montenegro.

691
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:14,881
Why me?

692
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,528
Well, you identified the Reardon girl,

693
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,577
You figuered out this hologramatic
impalement scenario

694
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:23,222
Be careful.

695
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:30,899
I feel like I was just threatened.

696
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:43,647
I've checked every bronze weapon
in the Jeffersonian

697
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,314
that matches Angela's criteria.

698
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:48,913
None are consistent with the
fragment removed from Kristen.

699
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:52,802
I was here looking for weapons
hat was smuggled in.

700
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:54,589
Okay, what were those noises?

701
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,800
There is no way to smuggle
an 800-year-old bronze weapon

702
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,490
into the Jeffersonian.

703
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,579
No, we have X-rays,
guards, metal detectors.

704
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,298
You come in with anything bigger
than a watch, they search you.

705
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:07,420
You two are geniuses...
how would you do it?

706
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:08,763
Its absolutely impossible.

707
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:10,470
Unless you mail it.

708
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,004
Oh, yeah, right, there's that.

709
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:13,863
What?!

710
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:15,742
If you mail something to the
Jeffersonian,

711
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:18,247
it doesn't need to be cleared
by customs or security.

712
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:22,128
Okay, you're saying if I want to get a
stolen artifact into the United States,

713
00:33:22,197 --> 00:33:24,490
all I have to do is mail it
to the Jeffersonian?

714
00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:27,094
Technically yes, but the fact is,

715
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,224
we check and report all items
to the government.

716
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:30,671
Okay, who's "we"?

717
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,778
The Authentications Department.

718
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,045
Oh, okay,

719
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,931
you mean a bunch of starving interns

720
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:37,561
who work here during the summer.

721
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:41,451
Interns keep detailed records
of every item they authenticate.

722
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:43,912
Access Kristen Reardon's log.

723
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,915
I suppose Gormogon could
have mailed himself

724
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:48,685
to the Jeffersonian, stole an
I.D. and simply walked out.

725
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,573
This had nothing to do with Goobagon.

726
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:51,849
- Gormogon.
- Whatever.

727
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:54,748
How many times do I have to say that?

728
00:33:56,073 --> 00:33:57,864
I don't have the necessary clearance.

729
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,153
Let me try.

730
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:05,777
- Neither do I.
- Excuse me.

731
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,134
Wait, you have a password?

732
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:10,597
Yeah, Cam's.

733
00:34:11,354 --> 00:34:12,985
What? She won't mind.

734
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:19,006
Kristen Reardon worked on a lot of
16th-century Baroque wood carvings.

735
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:23,426
I know your password, too.

736
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,984
It's "daffodil."

737
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:27,299
- I never told you that.
- What? I got eyes.

738
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,819
I mean, you guys aren't
exactly CIA material.

739
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:30,966
Daffodil?

740
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:32,779
What? They're pretty.

741
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:36,580
Looks like Kristen might have worked
on some Luristan bronzes.

742
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:38,692
Any from the 13th century?

743
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,227
Yeah, tools, utensils, sculptures...

744
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:44,250
- What's Luristan?
- Persia...

745
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:46,304
You mean Iran? Or Iraq?

746
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:48,392
Since the war, Iraqi
museums have been looted,

747
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:50,663
and their pieces are being
sold on the black market.

748
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:54,177
This murder has nothing to do with
the vault or a serial killer.

749
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,186
Kristen Reardon was a smuggler?

750
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:58,149
More than likely killed by a smuggler.

751
00:34:58,236 --> 00:35:01,600
She goes to report something
and the smuggler kills her.

752
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,271
I'll have Zack check all these as
possible murder weapons.

753
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,484
And I'm changing my password.

754
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:10,789
Daisy?

755
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:13,377
- How did you know?
- It's your second favorite flower.

756
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:14,571
I know you, Bones.

757
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:16,173
Try a planet.

758
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:20,764
Jupiter.

759
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,497
- I owe you.
- No, you don't.

760
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:32,651
I do.

761
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,744
It took the pressure off.

762
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:36,826
I even reconnected with Felicia.

763
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:40,215
She kissed me.

764
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,563
- What?
- I swear I didn't see it coming.

765
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:44,353
She just planted it on me.

766
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:47,484
Like a peck on the cheek,
or the full meal?

767
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:50,930
- Why does that even matter?
- Full meal.

768
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,570
- I don't believe it.
- What's the big deal?

769
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,988
I mean, you and I aren't actually...
going out.

770
00:35:57,075 --> 00:36:00,196
She thought she stole you away from me,
that's why she was so nice.

771
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,095
You.

772
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:04,282
What?

773
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:08,412
- You kissed back.
- No, no, no, there was no "kiss back."

774
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:14,132
You know, my lips,
they may have parted for a second...

775
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,201
Hi, ready for lunch? Hi.

776
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:17,631
Don't say hello to her.

777
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,846
How could you make a move
on my boyfriend?

778
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:23,355
He said things weren't so
great between you guys.

779
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,229
You didn't think
you should ask me first?

780
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:27,318
Sorry, didn't seem he
was all that into you.

781
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,752
Time out. Let's get real here, okay?

782
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,262
You are actually fighting over something
that does not even exist.

783
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:34,172
What?

784
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,125
We don't go out anymore.
We broke up a long time ago.

785
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:39,459
And you brought him for Dad so
he'd still think...

786
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,665
You know how Dad is.
I'd never hear the end of it.

787
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:43,746
You saw how he lit up
when he got that remote.

788
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,200
- It can handle up to eight devices...
- We know, Booth.

789
00:36:46,346 --> 00:36:48,340
Why didn't you tell me
you guys split up?

790
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,166
You want him, take him. I don't care.

791
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,051
- I don't want him.
- You don't?

792
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,564
I was trying to get back at you

793
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:56,102
- for being so perfect all the time.
- So you admit it.

794
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,811
Like you're a saint.

795
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:00,504
She used to go into my closet
with all my dolls

796
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:03,171
and say that they were having a party,
but I wasn't invited.

797
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,231
You were five,
and they did not like you.

798
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:07,479
Typical. Start a fight so we miss lunch.

799
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:09,265
You made reservations?
I'm surprised.

800
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,581
I thought we'd have to eat
from a cart on the street.

801
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,268
You two can have lunch after all this?

802
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:15,322
Please. Like you can ruin a meal?

803
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:18,143
Okay, that's it.
I don't know who you think...

804
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:20,866
Don't raise your voice to her, Seeley.

805
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,486
- What?
- Let's go. Let him calm down.

806
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,846
Why did you guys break up?
What did he do?

807
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,754
It wasn't me. I...

808
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:37,560
This is the most likely murder weapon.

809
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:38,740
It's an antelope.

810
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,123
Actually, it's a oryx.

811
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:41,653
That's a type of antelope.

812
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,153
I was being precise.

813
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,192
You used to appreciate that.

814
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:49,969
67 degrees. Exactly.

815
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:53,474
Oryx on table, struggle, Kristen Reardon
is impaled on the oryx.

816
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,486
Good work, Zack.

817
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:58,721
Let's swab the sculpture,
see if there's any DNA evidence.

818
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:00,264
It's not here.

819
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:02,565
What do you mean it's not here anymore?

820
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:06,403
According to Jeffersonian records,
the oryx was mailed to Box 99,

821
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:08,824
Poplar Street Post Office in Arlington.

822
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,823
The Jeffersonian is being used
to smuggle Iraqi artifacts?

823
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,546
Has the FBI been informed about this?

824
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:16,900
Yes, Dr. Bancroft.

825
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,133
Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan
are trying to arrange

826
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:21,580
to have the post office
staked out by tomorrow.

827
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:24,284
Good. Good... That's good.

828
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,638
It's Cam.

829
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,153
I told him.

830
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:36,327
You were right. He wasn't happy
when I said the FBI already knew.

831
00:38:36,393 --> 00:38:40,369
Let's see if he's a part of it, or just
another ass-covering bureaucrat.

832
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,761
Good hunting.

833
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:47,180
Little game there, Bones...

834
00:38:47,383 --> 00:38:49,321
who shows up for the Iraqi Bambi?

835
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,176
There are a number
of possible candidates.

836
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:53,005
Come on, I mean it's a stakeout.

837
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:54,541
Play with me. Speculate.

838
00:38:58,175 --> 00:38:59,745
My money's on Bancroft.

839
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,680
The head of the Jeffersonian? Why?

840
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:02,824
He's a dill weed.

841
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:06,104
You think he's a murderer just
because you don't like him?

842
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:07,552
Bones, it's a game.

843
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:13,651
Well, there's no way it's Bancroft.
He has a doctorate.

844
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:16,201
Dr. Kevorkian has a doctorate.

845
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:23,377
Oh. So does that guy.

846
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:25,445
Dr. Klimkew.

847
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:29,893
During a murder investigation,

848
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,238
you uncovered my smuggling operation?

849
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,980
Man, that is bad, bad luck.

850
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,646
What about the murders, Evan?

851
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,961
Kristen Reardon and Kyle Aldridge?

852
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,174
No, I'm afraid that their
deaths are on your hands.

853
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:44,442
How do you figure?

854
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:48,531
This silver skeleton Gormogon
serial killer is obviously involved.

855
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,730
You brought him into our house.

856
00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:52,647
No, I can only take responsibility

857
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,329
for smuggling this oryx
into the country.

858
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,671
Get your hands off the murder weapon.

859
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,734
We know what happened.

860
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:07,360
I was there.

861
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,822
But it wasn't me who pushed
Kristen onto that table.

862
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:11,118
It was Aldridge.

863
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:13,309
Now... why would he do that?

864
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:15,409
Uh, love gone wrong,

865
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:17,206
I don't know, but Aldridge said

866
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:19,376
that if I didn't help him
dispose of the body,

867
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:21,719
he'd expose my smuggling deal
and I would go to prison.

868
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,083
Well, that's it then,
huh, Bones? Case closed.

869
00:40:24,347 --> 00:40:26,533
Wait. Well, except...

870
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:29,154
somebody killed Kyle Aldridge.

871
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,397
He hanged himself.

872
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:33,581
Rope burns.

873
00:40:33,656 --> 00:40:34,785
Look at that.

874
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:37,326
Well, we think you killed
Kristen Reardon...

875
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:38,782
probably by accident.

876
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:40,981
We know you killed Kyle Aldridge.

877
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:42,233
Premeditated.

878
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,806
And I'm confident we can prove it

879
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:46,015
beyond reasonable doubt to a jury.

880
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:48,200
It's over, Evan.

881
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:55,962
Do either of you know a good lawyer?

882
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,448
Okay, don't take it so hard.

883
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,255
I'm not taking anything hard.

884
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:07,844
What are we, Russian?

885
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:09,620
Nostrovia. Yeah.

886
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,965
I'll tell you what else I know.

887
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:16,771
What you're taking hard

888
00:41:17,034 --> 00:41:20,703
is the fact that it happened
in your house.

889
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,883
It's not my house.

890
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:23,776
Not where you sleep, okay?

891
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:29,204
Your favorite place, the house of
reason, the Jeffersonian.

892
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,138
- It's not my favorite place.
- Yes, it is.

893
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,379
What? No, it's no...
How do you know?

894
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:36,748
Daffodil.

895
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:38,248
Daisy.

896
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,530
Jupiter.

897
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,905
Okay. I'll tell you what else I know.

898
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,300
You were hoping that it was Gorgonzola.

899
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,648
Gormogon. Ah!

900
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:54,265
So you admit it.

901
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,842
But accidentally.

902
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,966
Does... does that count? Yes.

903
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:02,058
Look, all the scientists and the squints

904
00:42:02,194 --> 00:42:05,092
and the eggheads, they wanted
it to be a serial killer,

905
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,457
- so it wouldn't be one of them.
- Them?

906
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:08,704
- You.
- Me?

907
00:42:08,748 --> 00:42:10,073
One of you.

908
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:13,161
You were all offended
that it was one of you.

909
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:18,183
You know what?

910
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:21,681
- I am offended.
- I just said that.

911
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,413
I'm offended, because...

912
00:42:28,808 --> 00:42:30,304
... because, I...

913
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:33,319
Because you were betrayed
by one of your own.

914
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:35,685
Yes.

915
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:39,468
Are you going to betray me?

916
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,810
No.

917
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,410
Nonetheless, I shall be vigilant.

918
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:56,726
Nonetheless?

919
00:42:58,804 --> 00:43:01,852
I'm not going to have
a headache tomorrow, am I?

920
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,489
Well, we're going to find out.

921
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:06,553
Hodgins and Zack...
they do their experiments,

922
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:08,031
we do ours.

923
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:10,584
- To Gargonzola.
- Gormogon.

924
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:14,568
You missed.

925
