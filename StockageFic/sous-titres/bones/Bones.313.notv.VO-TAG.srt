00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:03,313
{\pos(194,230)}Bones, You're not going
to believe this one.

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:06,171
{\pos(194,230)}What? You said that about the guy who
was stuffed inside a huge truck tire.

3
00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:07,464
I believed that.

4
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,692
Yeah, that was a good one, but
this is a whole new level of weird.

5
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:17,995
I don't believe it.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:19,550
What'd I tell you?

7
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:20,957
How could this happen?

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,333
Maybe he was rolled up in a carpet.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,006
Where's the carpet?

10
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,687
Well, rotted away, you know,
with the meaty parts.

11
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,204
What? It's possible.

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,717
That would've... that would've
taken thousands of years.

13
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:45,586
The bones should be in a pile, but...

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,632
something is holding
them together and...

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,380
What is with you?

16
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,711
Rolled in a carpet? "Meaty parts"!

17
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,743
Excuse me?

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,189
What is so funny?

19
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,098
- Nothing.
- I should hope not because

20
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,460
there's a dead body deservin
of respect right in front of you.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,138
What happened to him?

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,730
I did not know she could laugh.

23
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,648
What are you doing at the crime scene?

24
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,724
Dr. Brennan is suspended
from all crime-related duties.

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,360
- What?
- What, for laughing at Booth?

26
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,835
- That really doesn't bother me.
- We have a date for your

27
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:23,340
father's murder trial.

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,839
Booth is the arresting officer.
You can't work together until it's over.

29
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,370
- This is not necessary.
- They don't need to separate us.

30
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,188
I'm very compartmentalized.

31
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:32,654
Very compartmentalized.

32
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,577
Take it up with the FBI, cheri.

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,797
Now, that sucks.

34
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,970
This one looked really interesting.

35
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,261
Yeah. Really, really interesting.

36
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,122
I'll let you know what happens.

37
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,952
You're not going to solve it without me.

38
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:00,512
I mean, there's no use

39
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:02,758
in doing partners' therapy
when we aren't partners.

40
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,186
- What, you split up?
- No, we got split up.

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,973
- The FBI says we can't work together.
- Why?

42
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:10,270
Brennan's dad murdered the
deputy director of the FBI.

43
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,666
- His trial begins next week.
- I should have been informed.

44
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:13,826
Of the trial? Why?

45
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,105
Because Sweets did the psychological
profile on Max for the prosecution.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,865
- What? Why didn't you tell me before?
- Why is that important to you?

47
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,540
Sweets? No therapy. Didn't i just...

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,100
listen. Because while it would
matter to, say, a normal person,

49
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,884
I just figured you wouldn't care.

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,386
- You're absolutely right.
- Dr. Brennan, everyone you work with,

51
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,899
- including your therapist...
- Former therapist.

52
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,807
Is endeavoring to imprison your father.

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,799
That's wicked stressful.

54
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:42,429
- Booth is right. It doesn't bother me.
- No, Booth is wrong. Yes, it does.

55
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,820
May I suggest that this is a golden
opportunity for you to feel a situation

56
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:48,513
rather than simply rationalize it?

57
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,608
I'm fine.

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,249
If you were fine, you'd be balled up in
the corner, weeping, or semi-catatonic.

59
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,474
That's fine to you?

60
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,605
I'm sorry but I'm agree
with Sweets on this one.

61
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:59,547
I think it's important that you know
that we know that we know the colder

62
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,590
and more objective you
appear on the outside,

63
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:05,250
the more pain you are feeling
on the inside.

64
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:07,706
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,507
Well, Sweets, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.

66
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,362
It was really a pleasure
working with you.

67
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:13,578
Really? You are?

68
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:16,674
I, too, find him intriguing
in a non-rigorous,

69
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,749
- pragmatically irrelevant kind of way.
- I agree with what she said.

70
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:22,022
Thank you for trying to help
Booth and me work together.

71
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:24,462
- Thanks, Sweets.
- You're welcome, but...

72
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:25,835
honestly, guys...

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,286
- Will you pick this up, the tab?
- Yeah, sure.

74
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,845
We can keep working...

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,035
lame.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,061
I thought I was doing a good job.

No offense, but I would feel better

82
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:12,060
{\pos(194,220)}if the famous Dr. Brennan
was my scientific mouthpiece.

83
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,981
{\pos(194,220)}- Have you done this before?
- This is not Clark's first trial.

84
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,209
He's a full-grown scientist?

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,502
I shave, sir.

86
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,750
I have a driver's license.
I've won a couple of fist fights.

87
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,129
I've saved a life.
I have lain with woman.

88
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,740
I've been hustled at pool,
I've defied my father's wishes.

89
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,896
{\pos(194,220)}I have broken hearts
and I have been heartbroken.

90
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,032
{\pos(194,230)}So, by all the markers of
this society, I am a grown man.

91
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,210
You "lain with woman?"

92
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,166
Is he going to talk
like that at dad's trial?

93
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:43,151
{\pos(194,230)}Listen, Max, we could have clark list
his qualifications for you right now,

94
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,751
{\pos(194,230)}but that would spoil the surprise
when they read them out in court.

95
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,596
{\pos(194,230)}Clark is the last forensic
anthropologist

96
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:49,721
{\pos(194,230)}that I'd want to go up
against in a court of law.

97
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,462
{\pos(194,220)}What about that genius kid at your lab?

98
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,762
{\pos(194,220)}The oversized eyes
and the toaster head, that guy?

99
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:56,430
I'm sorry if my normal sized head
and eyes diminish your confidence.

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,658
Zack is working for the prosecution.

101
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,142
Okay. Welcome on board, kid.

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,769
- Dad!
- Thank you.

103
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,850
Are you seriously squeezing
my hand that hard?

104
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,873
Give Clark his hand back, dad.

105
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:17,909
Thanks.

106
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,597
We'll wait outside, Tempe.

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,213
I still wish you were going
to be my scientist.

108
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:27,359
Here.

109
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,002
You should wear
this tie in the courtroom.

110
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,932
Oh, but it-it's a gray tie.

111
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,320
Apparently, the color gray
tells the jury

112
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,671
that you are a serious man
with good judgment.

113
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:43,601
Yeah, or that I'm drab.

114
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,488
- I can't stop this from happening.
- What do you mean?

115
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,889
Booth, Hodgins, Zack, Angela, Caroline
they're all my friends, but I can't...

116
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,736
Hey, listen, I know
you love me, all right?

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,163
I can see it even if nobody else can, so

118
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,747
that's something you don't
have to worry about.

119
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,971
I'll wear the tie.

120
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,583
{\pos(194,220)}I hate this. I hate it.

121
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,840
{\pos(194,220)}What, strangers
on our forensic platform?

122
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,920
{\pos(194,220)}Ange doesn't like that
we're on different sides.

123
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,114
{\pos(194,220)}All of us together and Brennan alone.

124
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:42,273
{\pos(194,220)}Not alone, she's with
those african american people.

125
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,925
{\pos(194,220)}This is not a competition.

126
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,033
{\pos(194,220)}I'm pretty sure the reason
they call the justice

127
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:49,030
{\pos(194,220)}system "adversarial"
is that it is competitive.

128
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,540
{\pos(194,220)}No, it's not a competition
between us and Brennan.

129
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:54,136
{\pos(194,220)}It's just an unfortunate situation.

130
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,400
{\pos(194,220)}Yeah. Yeah,
it's an unfortunate situation.

131
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,886
{\pos(194,220)}If Brennan understands that we aren't
crazily competitive about it, then...

132
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,177
{\pos(194,220)}We'll all come through this
with our friendships intact.

133
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,820
{\pos(194,220)}Besides, Dr. Brennan must realize
that we're going to destroy them.

134
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,687
{\pos(194,220)}I'll explain "crazily competitive"
to Zack

135
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,695
{\pos(194,220)}over and over again until he gets it.

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,827
{\pos(194,220)}Okay, prosecution briefing in 20, and
Caroline does not tolerate tardiness.

137
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,298
{\pos(194,220)}Well, I've reviewed all the physical
evidence as compiled by Dr. Addy

138
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,190
and provided by the prosecution.

139
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,751
What do you think?

140
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,262
{\pos(194,220)}There are always judgment calls, but...

141
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,996
{\pos(194,220)}it holds together.

142
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,625
{\pos(194,220)}I may feel better about our position
once I do my own intensive examination.

143
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,481
{\pos(194,220)}Tell me the first thing that occurs
to you when you look at the x-rays

144
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,460
{\pos(194,220)}and skeletal remains of the victim.

145
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,841
The killer was merciful.

146
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,815
That is completely unscientific.

147
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,834
{\pos(194,220)}The victim was stabbed several times,
set on fire, and gutted.

148
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,974
{\pos(194,220)}Where's the mercy?

149
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,683
Death was instantaneous.

150
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,810
A single blow to the mastoid process.
Zero pain.

151
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,463
Guts, stabs, burns...
all that occurred post-mortem.

152
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:57,584
Mercy.

153
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:59,887
Zack will be the more
precise expert witness.

154
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:02,485
Clark will be the more
understandable and persuasive.

155
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,680
In prosecution, scientific objectivity
is seen as a virtue.

156
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,032
In defense, we humanize the accused.

157
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:10,868
I accept your logic.

158
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,371
{\pos(194,220)}I'm going to put some effort
into making Dr. Addy look bad.

159
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,085
{\pos(194,220)}I'd appreciate it if the jury
didn't see you doubting me.

160
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,067
Well, that will be difficult
because my father actually is guilty.

161
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:24,520
Dr. Brennan, I need that to be the last
time you speak those thoughts aloud.

162
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,315
- Why?
- Because what we think about

163
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,500
the client's guilt
or innocence is irrelevant.

164
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,560
It's their job to prove your father
is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.

165
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,444
How much time do you need
with the skeleton?

166
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,829
As much as you can get me.

167
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,519
I'd also like to take a look
at your case files, if I might.

168
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:42,833
Why?

169
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,742
Because you taught Dr. Addy.

170
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,095
I'd like to get a feel
for who I'm up against.

171
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:55,530
{\pos(194,200)}I'm going to say to you
what I always say to you before a trial

172
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,512
{\pos(194,220)}because this one is
no different than any other trial.

173
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,555
- You've never said that before.
- What?

174
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,450
{\pos(194,220)}You've never told us that a trial
is no different from any other trial.

175
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,147
{\pos(194,220)}Which suggests
this one is different.

176
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,640
- Have you no control over these people?
- None whatsoever.

177
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:11,570
Look, Caroline, it's Bones,
it's different. Let's just admit that.

178
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,250
Here's what's not different.

179
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,977
Lose the cocky belt buckle.

180
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,396
No badges saying, "resist authority"
or "the truth is out there."

181
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:21,946
Do not cut your own hair
the day before a trial.

182
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,521
Ugly up a little; the plain
women on the jury hate you.

183
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,998
Use your fully grown-up words. Eat.

184
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,116
Last time, your stomach was
growling louder than your testimony.

185
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,750
Then don't put me on
first thing in the morning.

186
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,668
I assure you I will be totally,
awesomely mature on the stand.

187
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,854
Ms. Julian... I'm not taking the stand.

188
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,100
You have to.

189
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:49,423
Look, I'm not going to tell anybody else
what to do here, but I'm not testifying.

190
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:52,580
Booth?

191
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,980
Right, okay, listen up, people.

192
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,889
Bones, she believes in the system.

193
00:09:58,094 --> 00:10:00,977
She finds out that Angela is not going
to testify, she's not going to like it.

194
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,022
She'd want all of us to do our jobs.

195
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,960
Dr. Brennan does seem
to have an enviable,

196
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,715
if somewhat disturbing
ability to compartmentalize.

197
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,717
Hey, how...
how's that for fully grown-up vocab?

198
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,075
Clean and detached, people.
Just the way Dr. Brennan likes it.

199
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,280
I have no problem.

200
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:18,120
I'll ask Dr. Brennan directly.

201
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,914
If she says okay, then I'm on board.

202
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,260
See you all in court.

203
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:24,620
Listen, Caroline, you know,
when I'm actually testifying,

204
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,243
the jury's not going to see
my belt buckle 'cause it's below.

205
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:29,840
- This briefing is over, cheri.
- Yeah, you see, where I stand,

206
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,981
the tie kind of... covers...

207
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,712
<i>I am judge Marcus Haddoes.</i>
This is my court.

208
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,800
When you swear to god to tell
the truth, you look at my face,

209
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:43,908
because in this courtroom
I may not actually be god,

210
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:46,356
but I sure as hell am
the next best thing.

211
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:49,792
You people watching:
At heart I am a shy man,

212
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,734
I would be perfectly happy to kick all
of you out given the slightest excuse.

213
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,941
Ms. Julian, opening statement.

214
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,987
I'm the prosecutor in this trial,
and it's my job to prove to you

215
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:09,775
that Max Keenan murdered FBI
deputy director Robert Kirby.

216
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,152
My client had motive to kill the victim.

217
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:17,908
Motive, means, and opportunity
like many, many others.

218
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,477
Deputy director Kirby was
a bad piece of work.

219
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:24,041
Corrupt. A cold-blooded killer.

220
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,873
He had many, many enemies
who wanted him dead.

221
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,984
They're going to say that Kirby intended
to murder Max Keenan and his family

222
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,031
that's them there that beautiful
young woman, that fine young man

223
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,868
putting the concept of
self-defense into your head.

224
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,561
The prosecution will
produce no eyewitness

225
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:48,676
and no proof beyond
circumstantial conjecture

226
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,390
and trace evidence.

227
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:52,890
Dr. Temperance Brennan here is one

228
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:55,385
of the finest forensic
anthropologists in the country.

229
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:59,597
She's renowned for her integrity,
for her professional reputation.

230
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,071
She's also the defendant's daughter.

231
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:05,327
Dr. Brennan won't testify
on behalf of her father,

232
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,918
because you, the jury,
simply will not believe

233
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,973
that a loving daughter
can be objective. That's all.

234
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,168
- Booth?
- What?

235
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,211
- I could so be objective.
- I know, Bones. Okay, just...

236
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:18,534
what the prosection called
a "bad piece of work."

237
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,563
That charming man slit
Robert Kirby's throat,

238
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,070
gutted him and set him on fire.

239
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,014
We'll prove that to you.

240
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,301
Ms. Julian and I

241
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:33,116
may disagree on many
facets of this case,

242
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:37,377
but I do agree with her the
accused is a very nice guy.

243
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,645
Point of clarification,
I said "charming," not "nice."

244
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,222
This is exactly the kind of nonsense
that I want to avoid.

245
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:44,935
And you two please

246
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:48,407
keep to your own sides of the aisle.

247
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,130
All rise.

248
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,920
Get a cup of coffee, people.

249
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,146
We hear first prosecution
witness in 20 minutes.

250
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,352
It might not be good coffee but,
hey, at least it's lukewarm.

251
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:06,920
- We're not supposed to talk.
- We can't talk about the case.

252
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:09,917
But we can talk about crappy coffee!

253
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,950
Put the cup in front of
your mouth when you talk.

254
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,388
- I didn't see Angela today.
- Angela refuses to testify.

255
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,866
Why?

256
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,780
Probably because she's your best friend.

257
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:25,052
- You're my friend and you don't mind.
- I mind. We all mind.

258
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,738
Except for Zack.

259
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,314
Well, in that case Zack is
the only one thinking clearly.

260
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:31,528
I had to give Hodgins permission.

261
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,678
- I dunno what's wrong with everyone.
- It's not what's wrong, Bones.

262
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,428
It's what's right.

263
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,394
No, no, y'all cut that out.

264
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,157
Court will reconvene in 30 seconds.

265
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,114
Good luck, Bones.

266
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:49,377
And remember, I'm the one who

267
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:52,571
gave you this delicious coffee.

268
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,915
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm the first prosecution

269
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,850
witness against your father.

270
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,751
Dr. Brennan and I entered her apartment,
and we found a large pool of blood.

271
00:14:08,202 --> 00:14:10,687
You were concerned with
Russ Brennan's life at this point?

272
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,199
That's correct.

273
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,460
You thought the blood
was Russ Brennan's?

274
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,841
- That's correct.
- And whose blood did it prove to be?

275
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,429
DNA analysis proved the blood
was deputy director Kirby's.

276
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,124
A sharp instrument
was inserted here...

277
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,803
puncturing the sternocleidomastoid
and cutting the carotid artery.

278
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,943
It entered the skull just behind
the ear, nicked the mastoid,

279
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,078
continued through the oropharynx
and terminated

280
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,919
at the opposite side of the mandible.

281
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,093
In order to create
a blood puddle this large,

282
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,715
the body would have to lay there
for between three to five minutes.

283
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,339
Three to five minutes?

284
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,344
That's about the time it takes
to roll the body up in a shower curtain.

285
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,304
How do we know the copper
pipe is the murder weapon?

286
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:49,999
These are very, very small
traces of copper left here

287
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,208
in the mylohyoid line of the mandible.

288
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,110
And what is the copper pipe made of?

289
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,943
As with most copper pipes,
it's made of copper.

290
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,263
Did you discover any evidence tying
the defendant to the murder scene?

291
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,976
I found particles of the same soil
at the murder scene

292
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:06,465
at the rooftop where the body was burned
and at the our lady of angels seminary.

293
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:08,848
- What did that tell you?
- That someone transferred those

294
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:11,828
dirt particles from the seminary,
to the murder scene, to the rooftop.

295
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,377
Who could have done that?

296
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:15,263
The defendant was
at the seminary that day.

297
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,223
- Are you certain of that?
- Yeah. I saw him there myself.

298
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,105
What was he doing there?

299
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,333
He was impersonating a priest.

300
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,653
And you're 100% positive
this is the murder weapon?

301
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,006
I'm not comfortable with 100%.

302
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,293
You're convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that this is the murder weapon?

303
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,868
Yes. I am.

304
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,944
And is there any evidence at all
tying the defendant to this weapon?

305
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,275
In 1966, Max Keenan was sent
to cook county jail for robbery.

306
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:55,827
He was attacked.

307
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,082
Did he defend himself?

308
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,966
Yes.

309
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,775
Did he defend himself with this?

310
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,020
- Yes.
- Successfully?

311
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,455
I never killed anyone.
I just poked them to keep them away.

312
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:13,403
Yes.

313
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,384
What was the result of that attack?

314
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:18,922
Well, no one bothered Max again.

315
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,324
Anything else?

316
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,847
He had eight months
added to his sentence.

317
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,932
Anything else, agent Booth?

318
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,372
The sharpened pipe kind of became
a trademark for him.

319
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,576
Where was this weapon found?

320
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,648
Right here, in this pile of ashes.

321
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,111
What exactly is that pile of ashes?

322
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,387
It turned out to be
the victim's intestines.

323
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,539
The abdomen had been slashed opened.

324
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,300
And with a body so badly burned,
intestines reduced to ashes,

325
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:55,617
how did you identify the remains
as those of deputy director Kirby?

326
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:57,580
I've got nothing to say.

327
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,232
You're under oath as a material
witness, Miss Montenegro.

328
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,469
I swore to tell the truth, and the truth
is that I am not saying anything.

329
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,785
Judge Haddoes, could you...

330
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,190
- The witness will answer.
- No, the witness will not.

331
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,481
- Angela! Answer.
- Silence, please.

332
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,115
The witness will answer,
or I will find her in contempt.

333
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,318
Is there a way I could talk
you out of that?

334
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:18,624
Why'd you call a witness
you knew wouldn't answer?

335
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,542
I figured once she got up here and saw

336
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,545
your scary face,
she'd rethink her options.

337
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:23,896
I'm taking the fifth.

338
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,251
Cheri, the fifth refers
to the fifth amendment

339
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,301
which protects you from being
forced to incriminate yourself.

340
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,034
Okay,

341
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:36,900
all right, the-the first amendment
protects freedom of association, right?

342
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,243
Which means that it protects friendship.

343
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:42,956
I'm taking the first, which is
even better than taking the fifth.

344
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,254
There is no friendship
in a homicide trial.

345
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:48,723
This is the federal district court
for the district of Columbia,

346
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,280
United States of America.

347
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:54,038
When this asks you a question,
you answer, or you pay the ferryman.

348
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:57,083
- It ain't gonna happen.
- Angie, they aren't kidding around.

349
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,130
Bones, now's the time to speak up.

350
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:00,657
- What?
- He's the ferryman.

351
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:02,173
The judge is the ferryman.

352
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,064
Ange, just so you know,
he's the ferryman!

353
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,464
I will clear this courtroom
if I hear another word.

354
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,051
Thanks a lot.

355
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,820
I find this witness in contempt.

356
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,820
She will be incarcerated
until she answers

357
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:14,801
the question posed to her by the people.

358
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,375
- Angela, please!
- Hey, will you sit down!

359
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,341
Sweetie, this is one of those times
when I know what's right

360
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,607
and everybody else is confused.

361
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,449
<i>I mean,</i> shouldn't you be
objecting a little more,

362
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,075
asking for sidebars and more like that?

363
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,097
The jury looks at dad kind of mean.

364
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,571
They're having a horrific crime
described to them.

365
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,144
They have to blame someone.

366
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:55,175
Yeah. Me!

367
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,255
No, all they've done so far
is establish that a murder occurred.

368
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:00,747
- Everybody knew that before.
- They have to establish

369
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,283
that you are responsible.

370
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:04,793
- Sounds like they have.
- We have to discuss

371
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,940
- putting you on the stand.
- Absolutely. Put me on.

372
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,768
Didn't that lady say I ooze charm?

373
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,955
First question you'll be asked is,
"did you murder deputy director Kirby?"

374
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,540
No, I did not.

375
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,598
- I can't put you on.
- Well, what? I'm not emotional enough?

376
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,756
I would never kill another man.

377
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,117
No, because it would be obvious to the
judge, the jury and blind martians that

378
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,009
your loving family doesn't believe you.

379
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,020
We'll wait outside
when dad's on the stand.

380
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:39,296
Thanks a lot. So I'm on the hot seat
and you guys are out getting ice cream?

381
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,240
Kids don't believe their dad,
no way the jury does.

382
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,873
Next issue to consider... is Russ.

383
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,859
- Let 'em put me on the stand.
- They think you witnessed a murder.

384
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,983
I didn't. I wasn't there.

385
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,497
I wasn't there!

386
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,674
As an officer of the court,
I cannot put you on the stand

387
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,843
if I think
you're gonna perjure yourself.

388
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:01,703
- You think Russ is lying?
- I don't know.

389
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:03,705
- Which worries me.
- No, he's not.

390
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:06,360
I've known Russ since he was a child,
and I can tell when he's lying

391
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,501
He's not lying.

392
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:09,926
You can put me on the stand.
I didn't witness anything

393
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:12,469
- that they can use against my father.
- Attaboy.

394
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:18,065
Listen, take a few family minutes.

395
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:19,429
I'll see you in court.

396
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:28,188
A country full of unscrupulous lawyers,
and you find the one guy with scruples.

397
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,190
Dad,

398
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,569
Tempe's pretty
sure you killed that man.

399
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,321
And I don't think she can see
how you wear that so lightly.

400
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,777
Tempe...

401
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:41,745
I'm ashamed of a lot of
things I did in my life.

402
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,017
But in this case,

403
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,830
my conscience is clear.

404
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,770
That's not the same as being innocent.

405
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,462
Angela, please, just go on the stand

406
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:12,752
and say that you identified the victim.

407
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,681
No.

408
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:15,736
But... I-I want you to do that.

409
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:18,071
Do you think that your
father is gonna beat this rap?

410
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:19,839
That has nothing to do with it.

411
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:22,761
Yeah, Brennan, it does.

412
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,287
I'm not gonna help send
your father to his death.

413
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:26,460
To his death?

414
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,504
Look, your old man killed a
really big kahuna at the FBI.

415
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:33,104
You think that those guys
aren't gunning for execution?

416
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:36,830
That-that's not up to me. That's
not up to you. That's up to a jury.

417
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,470
That's not the point.

418
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,800
What is the point?

419
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,138
Friends don't send friends'
fathers to the electric chair.

420
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,851
Maryland uses lethal injection.

421
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,437
Well, the principle holds, sweetie.

422
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,800
You think we're going to lose?

423
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,363
Yeah.

424
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,451
I think you're gonna lose.

425
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,871
And I am not gonna help you.

426
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:15,045
What did I do to deserve
a friend like you?

427
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,270
I obtained my undergraduate psych
degree from the university of Toronto,

428
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,090
my master's degree in abnormal
psychology from temple university

429
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:33,720
and my doctorates in clinical psychology
and behavioral analysis

430
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,649
Doctorates? As in more than one?

431
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,902
I won simultaneous fulbright
and rhodes scholarships...

432
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:41,279
More than one scholarship too.

433
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,949
Which is what brought me to
my current posting at the FBI.

434
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:46,743
No wonder Dr. Geeks can
never hang onto a girlfriend.

435
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:48,328
It's Dr. Sweets.

436
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,080
I know, Bones. I just like
saying Dr. Geeks as in geeks.

437
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:54,590
Do you require a list
of my scholarly publications?

438
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,530
The defense stipulates that Dr. Sweets
is a qualified expert witness,

439
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,630
despite the fact he looks like
a high school volleyball player.

440
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,343
Meet Dr. Geeks.

441
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:05,095
Excuse me, agent Booth.

442
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,888
I'd like you to switch
seats with Dr. Saroyan.

443
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,355
You, Dr. Brennan, please switch
seats with your brother.

444
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:11,226
Why?

445
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,520
You don't whisper as
quietly as you think you do.

446
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:15,564
You know, you do
whisper a little loud.

447
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,818
- You started it.
- Just a little bit, little loud.

448
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,891
Thank you.

449
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:23,218
Please continue, miss Julian.

450
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:26,616
Did you compile a psychological
profile of the defendant?

451
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,536
Yes, over a series of
meetings spanning six months.

452
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,305
Is he capable of murder?

453
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,497
Like, totally.

454
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,549
Most definitely.

455
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,463
In his own way, Max Keenan
is a very impressive man.

456
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:41,256
What do you mean,"in his own way?"

457
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,640
Well, Max Keenan doesn't adhere
to an external ethical system.

458
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,136
He does what he wants.

459
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:47,763
He does what he thinks is right,

460
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:50,265
whether or not the rest
of the world agrees.

461
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,570
In another time, he could
have been a great leader.

462
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,860
You mean in a time when people
conked each other on the head

463
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,125
and lit them on fire as a
way of getting what they want.

464
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,776
Yes.

465
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,744
Is Max Keenan dangerous?

466
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,969
When he feels
his loved ones are threatened...

467
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,158
- Mega dangerous.
- In your opinion,

468
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:11,953
if Max Keenan felt that he was
threatened or his family was threatened,

469
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:13,660
could he do this?

470
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,998
Totally.

471
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,211
I mean, indubitably.

472
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,504
Without hesitation?

473
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:23,131
Without hesitation,

474
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,883
without remorse

475
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:28,136
without guilt.

476
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:36,887
Without hesitation

477
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:38,939
without remorse

478
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,645
without guilt.

479
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:46,857
Did you feel threatened
by deputy director Kirby, Mr. Brennan?

480
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,657
- No.
- A sniper-trained,

481
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:52,410
corrupt FBI agent hunting you and
you weren't scared?

482
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,579
I knew someone was after me,
but not who.

483
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,632
How did you know someone was after you?

484
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,160
I was shot at. I was wounded.

485
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,586
So it's fair to say you feared
for you life.

486
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,280
- Where were you staying at this time?
- In my sister's apartment.

487
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,925
Which is where
deputy director Kirby was murdered.

488
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,969
Where his blood was found, yeah.

489
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:10,720
But you weren't when it happened.

490
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:11,649
No.

491
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,444
You knew someone was gunning for you,

492
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,717
but you left the safety
of your sister's apartment?

493
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:18,520
It wasn't all that safe if someone
got murdered there, right?

494
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,772
No, it wasn't, Mr. Brennan.

495
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:22,691
- Where were you that day?
- Job interview.

496
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:23,942
You were being stalked

497
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:27,195
but it seemed like a good time
to wander around looking for a job.

498
00:25:27,355 --> 00:25:29,549
No, not wander. I went to
a specific job interview.

499
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:35,090
What's wrong?

500
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,706
I recognize
when Caroline's catching a scent.

501
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,223
What job?

502
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,918
Objection, your honor. Relevance?

503
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,296
If the people could have
a little latitude

504
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,423
the relevance will become apparent.

505
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,508
I'm gonna allow it.
Answer the question, please.

506
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:49,750
A mechanic's job.

507
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,221
And just how did you find out
about this job opening?

508
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:54,206
What?

509
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:58,059
A sign in the window, an employment
agency, the internet, a newspaper?

510
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,186
Where'd you find this job?
Objection, your honor!

511
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:01,410
Overruled.

512
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,300
My dad got me...

513
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,858
the... the interview.

514
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:07,235
Almost as though he wanted
you out of the apartment.

515
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:11,401
As if he knew that something was gonna
happen and he wanted you out of the way.

516
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,366
- Your honor...
- Out of bounds, Miss Julian.

517
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:14,659
Jury will disregard.

518
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,482
I'm done with this witness,
your honor.

519
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:19,349
Cross, Mr. Barron?

520
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:22,230
Did you father say or do
anything that suggested

521
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,127
he was trying to get you out of the way?

522
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:25,129
No.

523
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:28,355
- Thank you, your honor.
- Miss Julian.

524
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,967
The people rest, your honor.

525
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:35,010
Will the defense be ready
this afternoon, Mr. Barron?

526
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,020
The defense requests a summary judgment

527
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,747
because the prosecution
has absolutely failed

528
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,519
to prove their case against my client.

529
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,875
Denied, Mr. Barron.

530
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,566
Then we'll be ready this afternoon.

531
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,440
What are you doing?

532
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:09,950
Dr. Addy, the prosecution is required to
share all information with the defense,

533
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,710
not the other way around.

534
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,092
That better not stain.

535
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:15,441
It's not permanent.
What are you doing here?

536
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,666
I heard you were still looking
at the victim's skeleton

537
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,599
and wondered if you found
anything I missed.

538
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,810
- Not allowed to ask that.
- I didn't ask anything.

539
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,645
You asked me. I answered.

540
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:28,860
You're not screwing with me, are you?

541
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,860
You're just like this.

542
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,571
Yes, this is exactly how I am.

543
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,564
Your work is very, very good,
Dr. Addy.

544
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,120
Extremely thorough.

545
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,273
Thank you. I am aware of that.

546
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:46,710
Good luck this afternoon.

547
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,733
I don't need luck, sport.

548
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm writing a book.

549
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,560
Taking a clinical approach to efficacy
and focused outcomes.

550
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,563
You shouldn't work well together, but
you do. I'd like to study it further.

551
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:08,857
- I don't get it.
- He wants to study us.

552
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:10,483
Once a week. Nothing changes.

553
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:12,152
Now, why would we want to do that?

554
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,195
I can't think of a good reason.

555
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:16,481
See? That thing that you do
when you talk to each other

556
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:20,452
while excluding the third party,
namely me, it's an adaptive mechanism,

557
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:23,955
for disparate entities to bond
together against their own

558
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:26,249
individual impetuses to dissociate.

559
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,128
It's... it's what...

560
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,720
- What does that mean for us?
- Nothing useful.

561
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,793
Tell you what.

562
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:37,070
Why don't we make a deal with him
where we allow him to study us.

563
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,388
In return, he gives us
psychological profiling on demand.

564
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:41,811
Okay.

565
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:44,192
You like that sort of thing,
but I don't see the point.

566
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:46,579
I just think he doesn't want
to admit that he likes us.

567
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,837
- Do you like us?
- What?

568
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:52,484
And he wants to spend time with us.

569
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:53,670
Is that true?

570
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:55,470
- You like us?
- No.

571
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,910
He really likes us.

572
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,268
All right, you know what?

573
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,658
I'm sorry I made the offer.
I take it back. Forget it.

574
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:07,000
Sweets is pretty good
in the interrogation room.

575
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,480
Yeah, profiling on demand,
interrogation backup.

576
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,420
Well, to be honest, I was
impressed by his credentials.

577
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,950
I'll tell him okay.

578
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,093
Dr. Brennan, I found something.

579
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,560
I do not like the look of that.

580
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,890
Why? They look happy.

581
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,580
All rise!

582
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,750
This court is reconvened.

583
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,000
They look smug. I don't like it.

584
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:38,990
Any way clark found something
you missed there, pal?

585
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,030
I don't miss things.

586
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,910
The defense calls
Dr. Zack Addy to the stand.

587
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,560
Your honor, I beg the indulgence of
the court to allow our expert witness,

588
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,668
Dr. Clark Edison
to appear Pro Hac Vice.

589
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:52,961
Objection, your honor.

590
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:54,588
What grounds, Miss Julian?

591
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:56,130
What's going on?

592
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,299
They want clark to question Zack,
not the lawyer.

593
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,890
- I'm thinking.
- Objection denied.

594
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,470
Dr. Edison.

595
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,010
Good afternoon.

596
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,226
Dr. Addy, you identified
this as the murder weapon.

597
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:09,436
That's correct.

598
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:11,410
Could you refresh the
jury's memory, please?

599
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,523
Yes. Striations found on the bone

600
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:16,420
indicated a sharp-tipped weapon
without a cutting edge.

601
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,403
Also, the diameter of the pipe fits.

602
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:19,840
That's correct, yes.

603
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,552
And copper particulates.

604
00:30:24,152 --> 00:30:25,940
Can you identify this Dr. Addy?

605
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,000
It is the entry wound in the
mastoid made by the murder weapon.

606
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,330
And this?

607
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,530
This is the same wound stained red.

608
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,800
Is this what you were
doing this morning?

609
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,380
And this?

610
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,500
It appears to be the same wound blown
up to approximately 120 magnification.

611
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,346
Can you discern any
microfractures in that photo?

612
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:46,335
Yes.

613
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:49,976
You sound surprised, Dr. Addy.

614
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:52,270
- What did you stain this with?
- Red food dye.

615
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:54,590
Can you answer that question, please?

616
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,568
These microfractures indicate
that the weapon went in so deep,

617
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:01,321
that the hilt hit the
bone,'causing microfractures.

618
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:02,708
The hilt.

619
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,825
Could you please indicate
the hilt on this weapon?

620
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:07,570
I cannot.

621
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,786
And why is that?

622
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:09,996
There is no hilt.

623
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:11,706
So this is not the murder weapon.

624
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:12,916
Obviously not.

625
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:19,631
You made a mistake.

626
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,843
Yes, I was mistaken.

627
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:28,264
Your honor, the defense requests
a dismissal of all charges.

628
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:30,475
The prosecution's entire case

629
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:33,330
was built upon the identification
of the murder weapon.

630
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,731
Your honor, the people
will need some time

631
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:37,962
to properly review Dr. Edison's
new evidence.

632
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:39,021
How much time?

633
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:42,069
Exactly as much time as it will
take agent Booth to find

634
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,081
- the actual murder weapon.
- I'll meet with counsel in chambers.

635
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:47,450
If you don't come up with
a terrific argument, Miss Julian,

636
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,460
Mr. Keenan is going home
to his family tonight.

637
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:53,520
All rise.

638
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:08,150
Bones, I have a warrant here
to search these premises

639
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,182
for any weapon or implement
congruent with the murder weapon.

640
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:12,960
I could save you some time.

641
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,774
No, Zack is gonna be
the bone expert on this one.

642
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,314
He'll be doing all the looking.

643
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:19,580
Where'd Clark Edison learn
that trick with the food dye?

644
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,780
- I don't know that trick.
- Zack...

645
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,319
focus.

646
00:32:33,997 --> 00:32:35,373
How you doing there, Bones?

647
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:39,860
When it looked like my father
might go free, I got...

648
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,757
this is very confusing for me.

649
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,636
You liked the idea of him
beating the murder charge?

650
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:50,754
Yes.

651
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:53,287
But he did it.

652
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,159
We both know my father did it.

653
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,200
Wanting your father to come home
instead of going to prison, that's okay.

654
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,579
But what I do...

655
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:05,320
what we do is put
murderers like him away.

656
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,031
Okay. You're not Dr. Brennan today.

657
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,198
You're Temperance.

658
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,659
I don't know what that means.

659
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,580
The scientist part of you
got sidelined, temporarily.

660
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:20,335
- I still don't know what that means.
- Bones, just...

661
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:24,238
Take the brain, okay,
put it in neutral...

662
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,438
take the heart, pop it in overdrive.

663
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,740
Sometimes, I think you're
from another planet.

664
00:33:36,837 --> 00:33:39,979
And sometimes I think
you're really very nice.

665
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:45,526
I found it.

666
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:55,820
What is that?

667
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:57,790
It's a misericorde.

668
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,955
A sharp, unedged medieval copper dagger

669
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:03,196
used for delivering a final,
fatal blow.

670
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,341
Also known
as the "coup de grace."

671
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,130
I'm sorry, Bones.

672
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:52,635
As usual, I will ask

673
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:55,489
the jury to refrain from speaking
to each other about the case

674
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:57,974
between now and when we reconvene
tomorrow morning.

675
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:01,269
At which time you will be prepared
to remount your defense.

676
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,339
Rise.

677
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,288
Hey, kid, you did good.

678
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,999
You had 'em on the run
there for a while.

679
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,137
Yeah, well, their case is
much stronger now, so...

680
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:22,823
My team... they're, they're really good.

681
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,921
Maybe you could brag over
them another time, Tempe.

682
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,148
You know, maybe I can discredit
the weapon.

683
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,848
We're past forensics.

684
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,402
Now it's about the story.

685
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,773
Excuse me?

686
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,671
Jurors like to think
they know what happened.

687
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:44,229
We did a good job in showing that
maybe Max didn't commit this murder,

688
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:47,748
but we didn't give the jury
a satisfying alternative.

689
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:52,549
One they can go home to their families
and say here's what really happened.

690
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,459
They need a bogeyman.

691
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,784
And it's dad.

692
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,737
Well, at least you guys will
always know where to find me.

693
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,644
What do you mean, on death row?

694
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:02,883
You should have...
you should have run, dad.

695
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,500
You should have just taken off.

696
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:05,974
Dad stayed for me.

697
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,727
He knew that if he ran,
we'd never see each other again.

698
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,143
You stayed for me.

699
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,129
I would have stayed here forever.

700
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,666
It was worth every second...

701
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,525
We had together.

702
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,974
If I knew the bogeyman, how much
warning would you need to make it work?

703
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,404
A good story about five minutes.

704
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,335
I have to talk to somebody.

705
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,423
If the truth can't be proven,
is it still the truth?

706
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,636
You inviting me to breakfast
to talk philosophy?

707
00:36:56,793 --> 00:37:00,078
A theory isn't even really a
theory until it's challenged.

708
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,014
It's just simply a hypothesis.

709
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,886
I don't believe that a man should
die based upon a hypothesis, do you?

710
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:08,088
If you have a question, just ask it.

711
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,392
I have a way to lodge
reasonable doubt in the jury.

712
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:11,967
We can't talk about this.

713
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:14,363
Please, you're the person I talk
to about things like this.

714
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,010
No perjury involved?

715
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:24,753
Just an interpretation
of existing facts?

716
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,030
An alternate story.

717
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:27,984
You don't know that he did it,
your old man.

718
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,590
We both know he did it.

719
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,095
No, not the way that you define "no."

720
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,021
You know, with proof and all that.

721
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,849
It's going to be enough for the jury.

722
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:39,115
Jury's are the human
factor in trial, all right?

723
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,107
You never know what they'll do.

724
00:37:41,227 --> 00:37:43,616
You think it's all right
to take advantage of that?

725
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,678
Brain and heart, Bones.

726
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:48,413
Brain and heart.

727
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,960
<i>You found particulates</i> placing
the accused at the scene of the murder,

728
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,534
the seminary, and the rooftop
where the victim was immolated?

729
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,447
Yes.

730
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,357
Was anyone else present
at all three locations?

731
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,722
Me.

732
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,032
But I didn't kill
the deputy director of the FBI.

733
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,619
You had motive.

734
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:12,430
He'd fired you that day,
and threatened Ms. Julian.

735
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,639
By the way, was she at
all three locations?

736
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,687
Objection.

737
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,772
It's just rude to accuse me of murder.

738
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,946
I count three people in this courtroom

739
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:22,751
besides my client
who had motive to kill Kirby.

740
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,940
I'll allow it.

741
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,848
Ms. Julian was never at
the crime scene so you're stuck with me.

742
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:29,508
And Dr. Brennan.

743
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,878
I see where you're going with this.

744
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:37,522
- Was Dr. Brennan at the seminary?
- Yes.

745
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,608
And your apartment, the same day?

746
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,027
Yes.

747
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,604
Do you recognize this?

748
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,950
Yes, it's mine.

749
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,470
So you are every bit as plausible
a suspect as your father.

750
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,270
Dr. Brennan is hyper-rational.

751
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,687
She is capable of rationalizing
almost anything.

752
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,158
Including murder?

753
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,048
It is the danger of the totally
rational human being.

754
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,177
But did she have a motive?

755
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,844
Yes, she had motive.

756
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:03,592
Kirby tried to kill her brother.

757
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,046
Thank you.

758
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,540
Bones was with me all day.

759
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,217
She didn't have time
to commit this murder?

760
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,323
No, she did not.

761
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,128
How did your son, Parker,
get home from school that day?

762
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,223
45 minutes we were apart,
but we talked on the phone.

763
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,219
Plenty of time, wasn't it, agent Booth?

764
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,553
Dr. Brennan could have burned the body
hours later when you were safe at home.

765
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:47,894
The witness will answer the question.

766
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,827
That's a lot of heart, Bones.

767
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,381
Your honor...
Answer the question please, agent Booth.

768
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,921
Could Bones have killed Kirby?

769
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:58,350
Temperance Brennan,
I've worked with this woman,

770
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:00,122
I've stood over death with her.

771
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,080
I've faced down death with her.

772
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,850
And Sweets, he's brilliant,
he is, but he's wrong.

773
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,415
She could not have done this.

774
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,228
I didn't ask you your opinion
of Dr. Brennan's character.

775
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:17,696
I asked you did she have time?

776
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,912
Yes. She had time.

777
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,880
Has the jury reached a verdict?

778
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,390
Yes, your honor.

779
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,870
So, are you going to charge her?

780
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,356
You got to go back
to school on this one.

781
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,118
That's a fine woman there.
