1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,993
- Do you have therapy today?
- It's not therapy.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,403
- Well, you're seeing a psychiatrist.
- Not for therapy.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,567
- It's an official evaluation, okay?
- <i>[Siren Wails]</i>

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,974
Person who found the body
is in the living room.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,070
Great. Crime scene first,
then we talk to the witnesses.

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,081
- <i>Corpse is gonna be in the den.</i>
- Thanks.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,083
- What is that?
- What's what?

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,210
- Your tie. It's staid.
- Staid?

9
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,278
Yeah, and boring. It looks like
J. Edgar Hoover picked it out.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,450
- Look, it's something I'm workin' on, okay?
- In therapy?

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,462
Gordon Gordon says that
the wild socks and the fancy ties...

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,464
are all just, you know,
quiet rebellions...

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,466
helping me suppress other impulses.

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,468
- Isn't that good?
- You'd think so, right?

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,733
But apparently, all the other issues
have to just rise to the top.

16
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,297
Why do you call
your psychiatrist Gordon Gordon?

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,139
'Cause that's how he introduces himself.
"Hi. I'm Gordon. Gordon Wyatt."

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,975
Like "James. James Bond."

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,346
"Bond. James Bond."

20
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,750
Not "James. James"...James... Whatever.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,981
- <i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>
- <i>[Saroyan] We're over here.</i>

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,081
You might want to tuck
your pants into your socks.

23
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,752
- <i>The flies get in everywhere.</i>
- [Groans]

24
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,990
<i>What, no cartoon characters on the socks?</i>

25
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,055
Never had cartoon characters
on the socks.

26
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,692
They were just...
Uh... Never mind, okay?

27
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,703
- What have we got here?
- Three weeks "decomp," give or take.

28
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,762
- Oh. Place was tossed, huh?
- No forced entry.

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,434
The victim is probably the man
of the house, Terrance Bancroft.

30
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,535
<i>His wife Clarissa identified</i>
<i>the watch and wedding ring.</i>

31
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,308
- This isn't good for me.
- Yeah, it's pretty gross.

32
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,613
No, not that. There's too much
soft tissue for me to tell anything.

33
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,519
- In fact, why am I here at all?
- The Bancroft family asked for us specifically.

34
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,457
- They got some kind of pull?
- The Bancroft Wing at theJeffersonian.

35
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,858
<i>Sixty million bucks</i>
<i>will buy a lot of good will.</i>

36
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,558
- <i>Typical.</i>
- This dried crust here at the mouth...

37
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,362
When the jugular's cut,
the air mixes with venous blood...

38
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,528
and the negative pressure
causes an air embolism.

39
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,801
- <i>Death is very quick.</i>
- So just sit there and stop complainin'.

40
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,535
- <i>[Brennan] Bound.</i>
- <i>Multiple stab wounds.</i>

41
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,543
<i>We need photos of these spatter patterns.</i>

42
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,977
I bet this statue's worth
more than my house.

43
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,574
You know, you should ask your therapist
about your issues with rich people.

44
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,982
You're in therapy?

45
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,147
- You've seen the socks.
- [Chuckles]

46
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,714
<i>The victim's wife's in the kitchen.</i>

47
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,091
I was... I was at the Vineyard for a month...

48
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,826
and Terry was supposed
to be at his fishing camp in Idaho...

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,834
<i>so the house was closed up.</i>

50
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,234
And you didn't try to contact him
at all during that time?

51
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,270
We spoke three weeks ago.

52
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,278
Um, the day before
he was supposed to leave.

53
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,110
<i>The cabin doesn't get cell service.</i>

54
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,749
I heard the officers talking
about a possible home invasion.

55
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,687
Definite possibility.

56
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,055
Well, Terry supports
a youth center...

57
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,117
on the other side
of the Anacostia River.

58
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,060
Rough neighborhood. Tough kids.

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,064
I was always afraid to go there...

60
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,259
but he said it was because
I didn't really know them.

61
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,633
Yeah. Listen, I'd like you to, uh, put a list...

62
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,798
of things together
that might have gone missing...

63
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,275
- and, uh, give me a call.
- Okay.

64
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,378
[Beeping]

65
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,807
- That the Bancroft case?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,909
Looks like a home-invasion homicide, right?

67
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,820
Yes. I'm running dental records now.
Cam is finishing up the autopsy.

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,915
But Booth is pretty sure
it's Terry Bancroft?

69
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,392
<i>Yes. There was a lot of insect activity.</i>

70
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,395
Samples are at your work station.

71
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,931
<i>Also the extension cord</i>
<i>used to tie him up...</i>

72
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,092
<i>and everything that was</i>
<i>on top ofhis desk.</i>

73
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,261
He was tied up?

74
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,966
His heart was perforated, but there's
no blood in the thoracic cavity.

75
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,975
He was stabbed after
he was already dead.

76
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,341
What-What killed him?

77
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,346
His jugular was punctured.

78
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,905
Multiple stabs are congruent
with killers jacked on crystal meth...

79
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,144
- or just plain adrenaline.
- Why kill him?

80
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,347
No sign of forced entry.
He probably knew his attackers.

81
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,016
- We have a match.
- <i>[Beeping]</i>

82
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,322
<i>Confirmed. Terrance Bancroft.</i>

83
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,487
He knew his killers?

84
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,293
Are you all right?

85
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,130
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

86
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,633
I'll-I'll get on insect analysis right away.

87
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,990
- Hodgie?
- Yeah? Hey.

88
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,048
Hi. Good morning, Angela.

89
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,095
I have blood spatter
patterns on my computer...

90
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,757
- if you need to match them
to anything you have here.
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

91
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,927
I'll come take a look after I get through
with the evidence from the desk.

92
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,870
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

93
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,873
Yeah?

94
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,603
- Wanna have lunch later?
- Okay. Yeah.

95
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,393
Would I get to play?

96
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,063
Uh, no. You will be cheering and watching.

97
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,437
- What fun is that?
- I am a mad "sagger."

98
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,872
l-l-I wear my shorts very, very low.

99
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,608
- Okay.
- [Laughs]

100
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,618
You suck hugely at being a girl.

101
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,779
Okay, okay. Anthropology. Anthropology.

102
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,119
Oh, okay. Think of it
as a social ritual...

103
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,251
in which I impress you
with my manly prowess...

104
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,261
during a game of basketball.

105
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,388
- You wanna impress me?
- I'm traditional that way.

106
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,559
Why don't you just bonk me
on the head with a giant club?

107
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,501
I'd much prefer you came
to the game and ogled my butt crack.

108
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,233
You know, it's law enforcement
versus public defenders.

109
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,741
Guys with ponytails
and love handles. You know?

110
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,243
We're heavily favored.
[Imitates Swoosh]

111
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,303
So?

112
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,758
Hi, Clarissa.

113
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,590
Jack. I...

114
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,257
- <i>You heard about Terry?</i>
- Can I come in?

115
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,176
Last time I saw you,
you didn't have a beard.

116
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,338
Yeah, last time you saw me,
I couldn't grow a beard.

117
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,143
I'm sorry about Terry.

118
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,378
<i>Makes everything that happened</i>
<i>between us look...</i>

119
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,387
Meaningless.

120
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,091
<i>Just... a lot less important...</i>

121
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,559
than it seemed at the time.

122
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,858
I got over us, Clarissa.

123
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,525
Then how come it took
Terry getting murdered...

124
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,568
for you to show up at our door?

125
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,512
Where did you get this?

126
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,514
I work at theJeffersonian Institution.
I'm on the case.

127
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,914
- This showed up with the evidence.
- I don't understand.

128
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,442
- Why are you bringing it to me?
- If my bosses were aware that I knew the victim...

129
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,513
or his wife, they'd remove me
from the investigation...

130
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,049
and I would really like to help catch
whatever son of a bitch murdered my friend.

131
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,995
So if someone introduces us...

132
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,262
"Nice to meet you, Ms. Bancroft."
"And you too, Dr. Hodgins."

133
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,326
Got it.

134
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,374
<i>Jack?</i>

135
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,376
Terry and I were...

136
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,378
[Clears Throat]

137
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,380
having some marital problems.

138
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,678
<i>But we were getting through it.</i>

139
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,275
That's gonna make me
a suspect, isn't it?

140
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,821
I can't talk about it, Clarissa.

141
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,225
<i>Terry. Man, we're really gonna</i>
<i>miss that guy around this place.</i>

142
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,231
Foot the bill for this place?

143
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,392
Oh, you know, he was more
than a checkbook.

144
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,663
I mean, Terry,
he took a personal interest.

145
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,864
How personal?

146
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,873
[Chuckles]
Don't even go there, man.

147
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,273
I mean, Terry, he was one of the good guys.

148
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,369
- Those kids are pretty hard core? huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

149
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,904
- Drugs, gangs, violence.
- Any recent arguments or incidents?

150
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,678
Well, apparently, the night before
Terry was gonna head up to his cabin...

151
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,814
he caught a kid with
a couple pounds of heroin.

152
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,950
A couple pounds?
The kid was a mule?

153
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,324
Yeah. He was runnin' deliveries
to Baltimore on the bus.

154
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,454
<i>Did you see Bancroft</i>
<i>take the drugs from the kid?</i>

155
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,830
- No.
- How about any of these kids? Did they see it?

156
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,768
Sure, yeah, until you ask 'em.
Then nobody saw nothin'.

157
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,305
- Did Bancroft call the police?
- Oh, man, come on.

158
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,171
If we did that, no kid would ever
set foot back in this place.

159
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,369
Oh. Then what, huh?
Flushed it down the toilet?

160
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,742
<i>No, no, it's not like that. I mean, Terry...</i>

161
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,111
He would always deliver
whatever he snagged to the cops.

162
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,173
Otherwise the supplier would
think they would get ripped off...

163
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,185
and then the mule ends up dead.

164
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,744
So this is Julio Diaz's locker.

165
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,586
<i>Oh. Blood on the kid's sweatshirt.</i>

166
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,960
No, no. Julio would never kill anybody.

167
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,965
He might deliver drugs,
but he really liked Terry.

168
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,764
What, maybeJulio's supplier?

169
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,031
When was the last time
Julio was here?

170
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,300
The day Terry took the heroin.

171
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,377
<i>All right, look.</i>

172
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,646
If it wasn't for Terry Bancroft,
this place wouldn't exist.

173
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:51,122
<i>Come on. I need one witness who saw</i>
<i>Terry take the dope from Julio Diaz.</i>

174
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,158
Just one.

175
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,164
[Exhales]
Sorry, man.

176
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,366
<i>[Angela] What is not to like?</i>

177
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,668
- Go watch Sully play basketball.
- He still hasn't made a move on me.

178
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,106
How many times have you gone out?

179
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,406
Four... or six...

180
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,605
depending on how you define "go out."

181
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,910
Great. Bumping into
each other at the diner...

182
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,951
does not count as going out.

183
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,316
Four. There.

184
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,914
Along the interior cervical vertebrae.
Is that shadow a glitch?

185
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,186
I don't do glitches. Four, huh?

186
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,696
<i>So the question is,</i>
<i>is this Sully damaged goods...</i>

187
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,097
- <i>or is hejust very respectful?</i>
- Those are my choices?

188
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,567
Damaged goods, you run away.

189
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,105
<i>Very respectful, you hang in.</i>

190
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,163
I should just make the first move.

191
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,200
No, Brennan, for once, can you
just pretend that you are the girl?

192
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,111
Why is everyone so anxious
for me to be a girl?

193
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,308
Listen. Go to the basketball game...

194
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,751
let him show off for you,
and see what happens.

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,118
I don't know. It sounds so passive.

196
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,454
- Now you've got it.
- <i>[Booth] You just don't get it.</i>

197
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,926
What? I'm asking for guy advice.

198
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,793
You are a guy. What's not to get?

199
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,799
First of all, guys...
They don't ask for advice.

200
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,392
- And I'm not gonna help you
get my partner into bed.
- Why not?

201
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,562
It's not like you want her.

202
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,106
<i>Unless...</i>

203
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,108
Do you want her?

204
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,270
- Aw, come on, huh?
Bones is, you know, my partner.
- <i>[Laughs]</i>

205
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,610
That is why you need
psychiatric treatment...

206
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,616
because you have the hots
for your partner.

207
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,618
I'm not in psychiatric
treatment, okay?

208
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,484
- It's an evaluation. Big difference.
- <i>I can tell...</i>

209
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,047
that Brennan is the go-slow type,
but you gotta help me out on how slow...

210
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,150
because too slow is worse
than not slow enough.

211
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,159
- Agent Booth?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

212
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,892
District cops got a kid matching your A.P. B...
down at the morgue.

213
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,633
<i>John Doe number 120806.</i>

214
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,402
Male, approximately 14 years old.

215
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,138
His body was found under
the Anacostia Bridge on the sixth.

216
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,305
<i>That was almost 20 days ago.</i>

217
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,477
l-l-I think that's Julio.
That's definitely his gold chain, for sure.

218
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,648
- Cause of death?
- Single gunshot wound to the back of the head.

219
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,782
- Execution style.
- Yeah, if, uh...

220
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,792
lfTerry hadn't gotten
the drugs to the cops...

221
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,794
the supplier would have
come afterJulio.

222
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,320
Terry Bancroft got killed for that heroin.

223
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,765
<i>Dr. Brennan saw a shadow on the X-rays.</i>

224
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:21,000
- I removed the tissue from
the bones and found a fungus.
- Not odd.

225
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,064
If you were decomposing
for three weeks...

226
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,303
you'd probably work up
a fungus or two as well.

227
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,368
The interior cervical vertebrae.

228
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,437
Spell it out, bone boy.

229
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:34,179
The jugular was cut,
and the blood pooled here.

230
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,222
<i>He was lying on his back</i>
<i>for several hours.</i>

231
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,553
- <i>[Booth] Anything new?</i>
- Yes.

232
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,617
The victim was killed
by the puncturing of his jugular...

233
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,492
left lying there for several hours.

234
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,896
- <i>Then the murderer came back...</i>
- Forced the body into his chair.

235
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:52,631
- And stabbed him 14 more times.
- Oh, to make it look like a home invasion.

236
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,300
The blood on Julio's sweatshirt found
in the locker was definitely Bancroft's.

237
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,866
Well, that doesn't make sense.

238
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,208
Bancroft confiscates the kid's dope.

239
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,306
Kid runs to the supplier.
They go to Bancroft's place...

240
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,817
<i>scare him into telling them</i>
<i>where the dope is, then kill him.</i>

241
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,185
- Only that doesn't scan.
I mean, why murder the kid?
- 'Cause he was there.

242
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,190
'Cause he cried.
'Cause he blew his nose on a red hankie.

243
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,419
- They don't need much reason.
- Well, I don't like it.

244
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,553
Doesn't mean it's not true.

245
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,565
Calliphora vomitoria.
<i>Prepupal stage of the third instar.</i>

246
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,433
- <i>Does that give us a postmortem interval?</i>
- 18.5 days.

247
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,494
Oh, you can be
that accurate from flies?

248
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,905
D.O.J. Forensics has new
statistical models of maggot growth...

249
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,409
that pinpoint death
within a six-hour window.

250
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,003
- Hmm. Then I was right.
- About what?

251
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,514
Julio Diaz was killed 20 days ago.

252
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,041
18.5 days ago is after
his body was found.

253
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,918
Then how did Bancroft's blood
get on Julio's sweatshirt?

254
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,287
Julio Diaz was dead
under that bridge.

255
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,350
Somebody else put that blood
on his sweatshirt.

256
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,535

<i>Guys only got one kind</i>

264
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,718

268
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,269
- In point of fact, it is therapy.
- What?

269
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,306
No. No, it's not. It's an evaluation.

270
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,604
No. I've already certified you as fit
to carry a gun and go back to work.

271
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,610
Okay, then why are we meeting?

272
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,806
Well, because you discharged
your weapon at an ice cream truck.

273
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,612
My <i>provisional</i> certification
of your mental health...

274
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,778
only holds as long as
you continue to meet with me.

275
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,788
Great. For how long?

276
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,950
Till I'm satisfied that you won't
start firing at confectioners again.

277
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,290
- What's your objection to therapy?
- [Laughs]

278
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,923
You know what, Doc? I am not
the kind of guy who's got anything to hide.

279
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,901
Do you know, I often find that
when people declare what they are not...

280
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,994
it almost invariably turns out...

281
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,562
that's precisely what they are.

282
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,610
Great. Then you know what?
No more declarations from me.

283
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,237
[Chuckles]
You do know that what you just said is, in fact...

284
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,781
the very avatar of a declaration.

285
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,783
Avatar. That's great.

286
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,183
- Can I get a cup of coffee and, uh...
- Tea, please.

287
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,414
- Sure.
- Tea. Let me ask you a question, Doc.

288
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,925
Why is it that every time you introduce
yourself, you always say your name twice?

289
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,893
[With English Accent]
"Hello. My name is Gordon... Gordon Wyatt."

290
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,896
Well, now you're simply
lashing out, aren't you?

291
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,592
Why don't we talk about the case
you're working on at the moment?

292
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,761
- What?
- Well, I am trained as a forensic psychiatrist.

293
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,430
- I might be able to help.
- Okay. Fine. Great.

294
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,168
I have a dead rich guy,
works with at-risk youth...

295
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,837
gets brutally murdered after confiscating
a couple of pounds of heroin...

296
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,846
from one of his kids.

297
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,382
Interesting the first word
you use to describe him is "rich."

298
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,248
Ah. Second. First description was "dead."

299
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,550
Why do you think you have
a problem with wealthy people?

300
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,524
In this case, a perfect example.
This guy, he makes up his own rules.

301
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,526
- What's that word that you used?
- Uh, entitled.

302
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,892
Yeah. Entitled. That's what got him killed.

303
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,432
Did this rich guy
by any chance have a wife?

304
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,866
- Are we changing the subject now?
- And does the rich guy's wife have a lover?

305
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,870
I just told you.

306
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,702
The murder has to do
with the heroin.

307
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,232
The boy the victim took the heroin from
also turned up murdered.

308
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,905
And is this boy
from a modest background?

309
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,415
- Doesn't get any "modester."
- So is there any chance...

310
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,008
that you would rather catch
the boy's murderer...

311
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,247
than the wealthy fellow's murderer...

312
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,415
so you have decided
that they're one and the same?

313
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,425
Any chance that you've
based this assumption...

314
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,122
purely on your bias against rich,
entitled people?

315
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,131
Hmm. You know what?

316
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,929
I did the belt buckle, I did the tie,
I did the socks...

317
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,027
What else do you want from me?

318
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,769
What would you say if I told you...

319
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,440
that my name actually <i>is</i>
Gordon Gordon Wyatt...

320
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,483
that my first and middle names...

321
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,246
are the same?

322
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,413
- Yeah, baby!
- Oh, yeah.

<i>Good game, man.</i>

- Don't you want to take a shower?

- Won't you be uncomfortable at the restaurant?

00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,061
It's a scuzzy bar. I'll be one
of the best-smelling things there...

328
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,266
- <i>Next to you, of course.</i>
- You played very well.

329
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,332
Thank you.

330
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,378
In fact, you were the best.

331
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,913
See, that's why I wanted you
to come... to be impressed.

332
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,074
Well, it was an impressive
display of manhood.

333
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,084
[Laughs]
Well, thank you.

334
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,177
Athletics as an analog for battle.

335
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,654
In effect, you were
a warrior tonight.

336
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,352
[Laughs]
Wow. You really were impressed.

337
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,486
There are quite a number of ways...

338
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,826
that men judge their relative maleness...

339
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,832
- with respect to other men.
- Uh-huh.

340
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,132
Muscles, income, cars.

341
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,604
<i>Attractive mates,</i>
<i>tolerance to alcohol.</i>

342
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,938
Hair loss, and, of course,
the-the size of sexual organs.

343
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,411
Ho! Save something
for us to discuss at dinner.

344
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,347
Well, women don't care about that.

345
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,044
- Dinner or hair loss?
- [Laughs]

346
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,713
The size of the sexual organ.

347
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,756
Ours or yours?

348
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,225
Penis size only matters
to other males.

349
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,661
See, I was hoping you'd comment on
how I shut down the other team's offense.

350
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,664
Well, their offense wasn't
really all that good.

351
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,098
Oh, you know how to hurt a guy.

352
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,331
That's not a bad thing. I like it.
A little sauce. Little zing.

353
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,403
The flake on the trachea was india ink.

354
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,704
It came from this.
It's a scrimshawed letter opener.

355
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,710
Wiped clean, but there are
still minute traces...

356
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,372
ofTerrance Bancroft's
blood in the etchings.

357
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,219
I need to pull a little con on the wife.

358
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,586
- <i>Your wife?</i>
- No, the victim's wife.

359
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,421
- Wh-Why?
- Find out if she was cheating on her husband.

360
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,154
I thought the murder
was because of the heroin.

361
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,393
<i>Well, it is, but I need you</i>
<i>to come along...</i>

362
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,935
and collect some dust
or pollen or seeds...

363
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,766
or whatever the hell it is you do...

364
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,830
so I can get in and figure out
if she's got anything to hide.

365
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,968
- How will you do that?
- Oh, I've got my ways. Come on.

366
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:10,276
Wow. You know, I'm really busy here.
You know, with the murder weapon.

367
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,217
Plus we found a fiber in the victim's throat.
It's actually muskrat.

368
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,083
That's a perfect cover.
We'll go to the mansion.

369
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,454
You go inside, look for anything
made out of muskrat. Come on.

370
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,227
Why you draggin' your feet? Let's go.

371
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,162
- I'll-I'll-I'll get my kit.
- Get your kit.

372
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,236
Good evening, Ms. Bancroft.

373
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,966
This is Dr. Hodgins
from theJeffersonian.

374
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,372
- I was wondering if...
- Very pleased to meet you.

375
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,809
Nice to meet you, Dr. Hodgins.
Clarissa Bancroft.

376
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,409
Dr. Hodgins needs
to take a look inside...

377
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,418
in the den, if that's all right.

378
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,286
- Oh. What are you looking for?
- Muskrat.

379
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,093
[Sighs]

380
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,424
How long will Dr. Hodgins be in there?

381
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,761
Oh, you know, a homicide investigation
is pretty invasive.

382
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,960
Both the family and the victim
lose all their privacy.

383
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,470
I understand.

384
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,506
Do you?

385
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,010
Because, uh...

386
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,809
it's inevitable that we find out everything.

387
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,942
What kind of doctor is Jack?

388
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,646
Bugs. Slime.

389
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,189
There's fancier names, but...

390
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,589
<i>that's about it.</i>

391
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,627
You know, don't you?

392
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,686
<i>You know that I had an affair.</i>

393
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,197
It's best you tell me everything.

394
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,633
It ended three months ago.

395
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,331
Terry and I were working through it.

396
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:45,672
- Separate vacations?
- I didn't say it wasn't difficult.

397
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,907
<i>You can love someone</i>
<i>and still hurt them.</i>

398
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,108
- <i>You need his name?</i>
- Yeah.

399
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,117
<i>Leland Oliver.</i>

400
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,949
He's our financial consultant.

401
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,955
So you divorce your husband...

402
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,584
<i>I would have gotten</i>
<i>at most half ofhis money.</i>

403
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,118
This way I get it all. Leland knew
that better than anyone.

404
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,064
<i>That's exactly why</i>
<i>I didn't say anything earlier.</i>

405
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,068
How'd you know Dr. Hodgins's first name?

406
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,503
- You introduced us.
- I never said his first name.

407
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,803
Just tell him, Clarissa.

408
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,876
All right, look, I'm sorry,
but it doesn't change anything.

409
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,576
- Hey, this is not a problem.
- Not a problem. Not a problem, huh?

410
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,585
I ought to arrest you
for tampering with evidence.

411
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,350
This goes to trial, you are in Ibiza
or Antarctica, on vacation.

412
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,926
Start looking for another job.

413
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,223
<i>[Car Starts]</i>

414
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,288
[Beeping]

415
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,096
Hodgins, what is the significance
of the muskrat fur?

416
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,162
Yeah, Hodgins, what is the significance
of the muskrat fur?

417
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,970
Muskrats have an under layer of fur.

418
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,376
The outer layer is coarse hair.
This-This is muskrat hair.

419
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,380
Fur, hair.
[Chuckles]

420
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,906
I doubt our victim's jugular
was cut by a muskrat.

421
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,919
Is there something going on?

422
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,955
You wanna tell 'em?

423
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,887
Muskrat hair was colored
with a new dye...

424
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,723
<i>that's just been patented</i>
<i>by a menswear company in Canada.</i>

425
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,230
<i>So the murderer was dressed</i>
<i>in one of thesejackets?</i>

426
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,563
<i>Wait a second. That one.</i>

427
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,763
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>The leather bomber with muskrat liner.</i>

428
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,806
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>That's the one Robert Frazier was wearing.</i>

429
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,933
- The director of the youth drop-in center.
- Then we have our murderer.

430
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,444
Good job, Hodgins.

431
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,946
No, not good job, Hodgins.
He might have blown the whole case.

432
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,949
I told him it is not a problem.

433
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,485
- <i>[Brennan] What happened?</i>
- I don't care what he does on his time off.

434
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,953
<i>When he screws with evidence</i>
<i>to get in the pants of an old girlfriend...</i>

435
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,855
on one of my murder cases,
that's a problem.

436
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:59,069
<i>I already got no proof</i>
<i>how the victim got hold of that heroin.</i>

437
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,374
Now you're saying I can't
put Hodgins on the stand? Why?

438
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,505
- You don't want to know the answer.
- [Brennan] Why doesn't she?

439
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:09,282
As the prosecutor in this case, I'm obliged
to share everything I know with the defense.

440
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,812
- Just because Clarissa Bancroft and I...
- Whoa, whoa. Good night.

441
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,122
Did you not hear what she just said?

442
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,027
There are some things
she can't know.

443
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,588
Clarissa and I were engaged.

444
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,658
- [Exhales]
- She and Terry started something up...

445
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,534
and it unfolded the way
those things do.

446
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,939
<i>I haven't contacted or heard</i>
<i>from either of them in eight years.</i>

447
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,103
- Then Terry got killed...
- And like every other rich guy in the world...

448
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,443
you decided that rules
just didn't apply to you.

449
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,712
Hey, the guy used to be my friend,
all right? And Clarissa...

450
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,277
- You tampered with evidence.
- The glass and frame were evidence.

451
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,687
The photograph I removed was not.

452
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,055
I wanted to work Terry's murder.

453
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,061
Obviously, you're off the case.

454
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,967
- Should be off the job.
- That is not your decision, Booth.

455
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,198
I apologize.

456
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,803
I will deal with this
however you see fit.

457
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,679
<i>[Caroline]</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of thejury...</i>

458
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,415
my good friend Mr. Barron
is gonna give you a long speech...

459
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,684
about what reasonable doubt is.

460
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,750
He's mostly gonna be right.

461
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,319
But facts are facts,
ladies and gentlemen...

462
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,764
<i>and the fact is, Mr. Robert Frazier killed...</i>

463
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,496
<i>Mr. Terrance Bancroft...</i>

464
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,902
<i>for a few pounds ofheroin.</i>

465
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,271
They've got anthropologists
and psychiatrists...

466
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,608
<i>and particulate experts</i>
<i>and blood experts...</i>

467
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,083
the whole weight
of theJeffersonian Institution...

468
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,247
all interpreting the facts for you.

469
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,347
<i>And I stress the word "interpret"...</i>

470
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,222
<i>because you, as thejury...</i>

471
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,057
are the arbiters of common sense...

472
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,098
that gets lost in all the science.

473
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,691
Would you describe
how the victim was killed?

474
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:08,364
Mr. Bancroft died when a sharp instrument
was thrust into his jugular.

475
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,240
<i>This is a dried fleck of india ink</i>
<i>left in the victim's trachea.</i>

476
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:17,304
It matches the ink on a scrimshawed
letter opener the F.B.I. found at the scene.

477
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,215
<i>Postmortem, the vicious attack</i>
<i>on the victim continued.</i>

478
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:24,312
<i>Objection. Categorization</i>
<i>of the attack as vicious is prejudicial.</i>

479
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,721
Fourteen times a man was stabbed.

480
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,784
- How many stabs does it take
to be vicious, exactly?
- Sustained.

481
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,593
Using a 2-D image
from a stereo microscope...

482
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,964
<i>I was able to create</i>
<i>a three-dimensional model.</i>

483
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,163
These kerf marks are congruent
with a double-edged blade...

484
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,900
<i>one side serrated, the other not.</i>

485
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,967
Yeah, that's the knife we found
in the tool box in Robert Frazier's truck.

486
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,242
That would explain the prints
found by the F.B.I. forensics lab?

487
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,443
Explain the prints,
but not the victim's blood.

488
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:57,181
Yeah, this is the jacket Robert Frazier
was wearing at the time of his arrest.

489
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,122
<i>[Brennan] The hair on the left came</i>
<i>from the victim's larynx.</i>

00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,284
The hair on the right
came from the jacket.

491
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,158
And they came from the same jacket?

492
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,791
- They came from the same muskrat.
- [Laughing]

493
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,166
How did this hair get
into the victim's larynx?

494
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,798
The larynx and the trachea were both
punctured by the murder weapon...

495
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,809
and that was most logically achieved
by the murderer...

496
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,438
<i>approaching the victim from behind,</i>
<i>putting a choke hold on him...</i>

497
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,006
and plunging the murder weapon
into his throat.

498
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,542
In doing so, the murderer inadvertently
stabbed through his own jacket...

499
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,852
<i>thus depositing the muskrat hair</i>
<i>in the victim's throat.</i>

500
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,324
<i>Let the record show</i>
<i>that the witness...</i>

501
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,055
is wiggling his finger through the jacket
in a very convincing manner.

502
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,394
Objection to the use of the phrase
"very convincing manner."

503
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,457
- Sustained.
- Why?

504
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,402
- Why what?
- Why was Terrance Bancroft killed?

505
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,372
<i>Did you discover</i>
<i>a motive, Agent Booth?</i>

506
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,737
I need five minutes, Your Honor.

507
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,555
Look, man, I saw Terry
take the dope from Julio.

508
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,887
I don't see how this is gonna
help burn Frazier though.

509
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,826
It's called "chain of evidence."
It'll help, okay? Trust me.

510
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,193
I'll say what I saw.

511
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,597
- Terry was a good man.
- So are you. Come on.

512
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,364
Let's go.

513
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,735
Terry was, like,
"Open that bag, Julio."

514
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,333
- <i>[Caroline] What did Julio do?</i>
- Just stood there.

515
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,140
Terry went over,
took the bag from him.

516
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,341
He opened it up. It was packed
with pounds of blast.

517
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,384
Tell the jury what that means.

518
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,545
Heroin. At least two bricks.

519
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,215
And, like, everybody knows what
happens ifTerry catches you holding.

520
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,224
You get sent out for 72 hours.

521
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,726
- And the drugs?
- Straight to the police.

522
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:48,755
You believe Robert Frazier killed
Terrance Bancroft for that heroin?

523
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,563
<i>Yes. Robert Frazier</i>
<i>turned out to be a junkie.</i>

524
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,604
That's why he wore
that jacket all the time.

525
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,698
- Objection. Assuming facts not in evidence.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

526
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:01,075
The defendant has every needle disease
in the book except H.I.V.

527
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,307
Same objection...
Plus, Miss Julian seems...

528
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,906
to deeply desire to <i>testify</i> herself.

529
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,044
I would like to <i>testify,</i> because then
I would know what answers I was getting.

530
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,054
- [Laughing]
- <i>[Judge] All right, settle down.</i>

531
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,717
This is a murder trial,
not a night at the Improv.

532
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,820
<i>The victim was killed and left</i>
<i>for between 10 and 15 hours.</i>

533
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,957
<i>The murderer returned</i>
<i>and forced him into the chair.</i>

534
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,729
This was also when
he was stabbed 14 times.

535
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,896
That 10 to 15 hours
gave the murderer time...

536
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,168
to soakJulio Diaz's sweatshirt
in the victim's blood...

537
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,473
in order to put the blame on either
Mr. Diaz or the drug suppliers.

538
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,810
But you do not believe
that the defendant killed the boy?

539
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,815
No, but he might as well have.

540
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,477
- Objection.
- I'll hear it.

541
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,580
Terrance Bancroft intended
to give that heroin to the police...

542
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,253
- in order to keepJulio Diaz
square with his suppliers.
- Thank you.

543
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,593
- Julio Diaz was 14 years old.
- Your Honor!

544
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,761
The prosecution apologizes,
Your Honor, and rests.

545
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,196
Wait. You still
haven't slept together?

546
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,037
- I know the problem.
- Is it religious upbringing?

547
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,874
- His penis.
- What's wrong with it?

548
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,177
- Apparently, it's small.
- [Laughs]

549
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:15,208
Well, that maybe explains why
he hasn't made any moves on you yet.

550
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,881
He's insecure, so I should make
the first move, right?

551
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,051
Yeah. Take Sully
for a little test drive.

552
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,618
Maybe he's got unlimited mileage.

553
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,631
That'll make up for the fact
that he's a sub-compact.

554
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,730
<i>Doc, what we're doing here,</i>
<i>would that be considered therapy?</i>

555
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,568
Oh, absolutely, especially since
I'm about to inquire...

556
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,574
whether you've experienced
any outbursts of temper...

557
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,236
since I requested
you alter your dress code.

558
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,508
Yeah. One of the squints... Hodgins...

559
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,776
<i>decided the rules,</i>
<i>they didn't apply to him.</i>

560
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,978
<i>He got entitled</i>
<i>andjeopardized my murder case.</i>

561
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,987
Ah. And you confronted him physically?

562
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,182
Physical confrontation...
that's my main skill.

563
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,853
"Entitled," you said.
Is he a wealthy man?

564
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,726
- Yeah, like the guy who got killed.
- <i>The murder victim...</i>

565
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,598
who... tried to help a child
and then died for it?

566
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:06,228
- And your... squint?
- Yeah, squint.

567
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,102
Extraordinary.
Your squint tried to help a friend...

568
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,734
so they both endeavored to do good.

569
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,778
With no clue of the way things are.

570
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,337
The way things are as defined
by a working-class lad from Pittsburgh.

571
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,945
That's right. Pittsburgh.
Where I'm from, all right?

572
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,251
From the streets, where you get
a sense of how the world really is.

573
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,918
Yes, I'm sure that's true,
but has it occurred to you...

574
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,292
that without the distortion of reality
provided by a privileged upbringing...

575
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,594
there'd be no such thing
as the Sistine Chapel or Taj Mahal...

576
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,397
or the Three Rivers Stadium,
home of your beloved Steelers?

577
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,403
Three Rivers Stadium
was demolished in 2000.

578
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,031
But it was a great place though.
I mean that Lambert...

579
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,474
No doubt. The point is,
you rebel in your way...

580
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,104
your friend rebels in his.

581
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,081
We all of us have to overcome
our upbringings, rich and poor alike.

582
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,482
You know what?

583
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:59,580
I'm going to ask you to go back to your
bilious socks and your ostentatious ties...

584
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,750
and your provocative belt buckles.

585
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,590
You're saying, if I wear flashy socks,
I'm going to forgive Hodgins?

586
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,756
[Chuckling]
Oh, Lord. I'm not sure I'm <i>that</i> good.

587
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,164
Well, perhaps I am. Hmm.

588
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,328
Hey, Doc, Doc, Doc, uh...

589
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,566
Why is it that the belt buckle is provocative?

590
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,007
It's a modern-day codpiece.
It forces the eye to the groin.

591
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,616
<i>What process was used to match</i>
<i>the india ink on the letter opener...</i>

592
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,678
<i>with the flake in the victim's trachea?</i>

593
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,850
Hydropneumatic elutriation.
[Laughs]

594
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,861
<i>Which involves dissolving</i>
<i>the sample in a solution, correct?</i>

595
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,454
- Yes.
- Essentially destroying it.

596
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,465
<i>Yes.</i>

597
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,967
And how was the muskrat hair processed?

598
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,630
Liquid chromatograph
mass spectrometry.

599
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,503
<i>And did you perform this test</i>
<i>personally, Dr. Saroyan?</i>

600
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:55,171
No. It was done by a specialist
at theJeffersonian.

601
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,841
- And who might that be?
- Dr. Jack Hodgins.

602
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:03,217
<i>The same man who used flies</i>
<i>to estimate the time of death?</i>

603
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,153
Yes.

604
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,124
The same Dr. Jack Hodgins...

605
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,389
who was once engaged to the victim's wife,
Clarissa Bancroft?

606
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,692
Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

607
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,632
- Sustained.
- Quite right, Your Honor.

608
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,829
The defense calls
Dr. Jack Hodgins to the stand...

609
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,841
after which we will be moving
for dismissal of all charges.

610
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,119
<i>How do you think they found out</i>
<i>about Hodgins and Clarissa Bancroft?</i>

611
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,123
Aw, it's a classic defense move.

612
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,819
You just check out the wife for motive,
run through the ex-lovers.

613
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,126
Well, the judge didn't dismiss the case,
which is a miracle.

614
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,497
"Better you don't know,
Caroline." Ha.

615
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:55,767
I figured it was something small,
like a typo on a search warrant, but no.

616
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,741
Turns out Hodgins had motive
to kill the man himself.

617
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,177
Eight years ago, maybe, but not now.
I've got Angela.

618
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,407
Hello. If I might continue.

619
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,042
The judge has allowed you 24 hours...

620
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,519
<i>to come up with additional evidence</i>
<i>that has never been seen...</i>

621
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,955
heard, smelled, touched
or considered by Dr. Hodgins.

622
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,959
Twenty-four hours.

623
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,358
Hodgins was all over this case.

624
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:25,198
We need something brand new
or something that Hodgins didn't touch.

625
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,033
Uh, both weapons,
blood spatter evidence.

626
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:32,372
Right. Trace evidence from the scene,
the heroin, the sweatshirt.

627
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,003
- We've covered it all.
- The answer is here, in front of us.

628
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,912
- Just like always.
- W-Well...

629
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,289
- The fungus.
- <i>[Saroyan] What fungus?</i>

630
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,333
The fungus Zack found
along the interior cervical vertebrae.

631
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,302
- Typical cadaver mold.
- <i>[Brennan] Let's have it identified.</i>

632
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,430
- That would usually be Hodgins's job.
- Not this time.

633
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,911
It's my letter of resignation.

634
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,320
Your science was dead-on perfect.

635
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,359
That's all I care about.
I don't need your resignation.

636
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,829
He didn't actually
tamper with evidence.

637
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,497
Dr. Hodgins endangered a case
by hiding his relationship with a suspect.

638
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,699
I'm saving Dr. Saroyan
the trouble of firing me.

639
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,038
Well, how much trouble is it?
"You're fired."

640
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,204
<i>That's no trouble at all.</i>
<i>A child could do it.</i>

641
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,111
I appreciate it.

642
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,982
<i>So we all agree it's</i> Aspergillus.

643
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,894
<i>But there are 185 strains of</i> Aspergillus.

644
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:04,526
- <i>Clavatus, glaucus, flavus...</i>
- They all look totally alike to me.

645
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,698
No. No, these two are different.

646
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:13,801
- I don't see it.
- Well, they're both..."puddly."

647
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,108
- "Puddly"?
- Well, by puddly...

648
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,240
I mean the hyphae are septate and hyaline...

649
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,342
and the conidiaphores originate
from the basal foot cell...

650
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,512
<i>Iocated on the supporting hyphae...</i>

651
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,522
<i>and terminate in a vesicle.</i>

652
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,524
<i>Aspergillus ustus.</i>

653
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,719
You found it.

654
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,058
Exactly how much time
have you been spending with Hodgins?

655
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,671
Pie good?

656
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,948
I quit.

657
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,014
<i>Handed in my letter to Cam.</i>

658
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,890
Idiot. Should have got fired.

659
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,191
Now no severance package.

660
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,323
I figure, a guy like you...

661
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,061
I resign, that puts things
right between us.

662
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,433
<i>Do we need to discuss it past that?</i>

663
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,634
What are we, girls?

664
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,574
A piece of pie for my friend.

665
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,382
<i>I will remind thejury that</i>
<i>they have heard previous testimony...</i>

666
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,820
from Dr. Clifford Lonsdale...

667
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,825
<i>a clinical expert in drug addiction.</i>

668
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,919
Why should the jury care
about some Latin infections?

669
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,487
We found a fungus on the victim...

670
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,898
called <i>Aspergillus ustus.</i>

671
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,096
- Is that not very common?
- The fungus in the victim...

672
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,766
matches exactly the strain
Dr. Lonsdale found in the defendant.

673
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,242
- What are the chances of that occurring?
- Incalculable.

674
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,247
Which is something
I've never said before.

675
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,783
<i>Miss Montenegro,</i>
<i>how did this happen?</i>

676
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,785
When the defendant punctured
the victim's jugular...

677
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,821
he nicked himself.

678
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,655
...thus introducing the bacteria
directly into the victim's bloodstream.

679
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,822
The fungus developed only
where blood from the fatal stab pooled...

680
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,331
here, along the spinal cord.

681
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,424
It did not spread
throughout the body.

682
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:22,029
- Which means...
- That only Mr. Frazier
could have infected the victim...

683
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,075
<i>and only within moments</i>
<i>of the victim's death.</i>

684
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:29,772
- And who found this fungus?
- <i>Dr. Zack Addy.</i>

685
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,146
- And who identified it?
- <i>Ms. Angela Montenegro.</i>

686
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,677
- And who realized the significance of it?
- I did.

687
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,714
<i>Dr. Jack Hodgins participated</i>
<i>in no way whatsoever?</i>

688
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,454
Objection.
The implication is offensive.

689
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,294
That objection has no standing in law,
Miss Julian. The witness will answer.

690
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,027
Despite the fact
that I have absolute faith...

691
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,335
<i>in Dr. Hodgins's integrity</i>
<i>and objectivity...</i>

692
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,672
in this instance,
he was not involved.

693
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,178
Then the evidence stands.

694
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,344
- [Chattering]
- I don't see how they could do that.

695
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,751
- <i>[Zack] Who?</i>
- Lawyers.

696
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,812
- Do what?
- <i>[Brennan] Be all friendly.</i>

697
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,859
<i>The only people lawyers like</i>
<i>are other lawyers.</i>

698
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:20,363
Oh, they were married.
They have a daughter, second year at M.I.T.

699
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,695
Does anyone else see the irony here?

700
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:26,601
Listen up, you people. The verdict
is gonna come down any minute.

701
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,902
Maybe we'll win, maybe we'll lose.
But this I do know...

702
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,501
you people have got to get
your sand together, you hear me?

703
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:37,445
Booth... and you scientist,
android brainiacs...

704
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:41,417
you got something very special here,
but you are losing it.

705
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,352
Dropping serial killers
off balconies...

706
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,448
and blabbin' suspects' names
to vengeful fathers.

707
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,585
Cutting into heads before their times.
Getting poisoned.

708
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,562
Gettin' blown up because you go
grabbing for things you shouldn't ought.

709
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,691
Taking photographs from frames.

710
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:01,261
Gettin' a perfectly good car
smashed to bits for no good reason.

711
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,866
Get it together.
Start using your oversized heads.

712
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,933
<i>This is the real world.</i>

713
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:12,711
Now, I know bug man here
handed in his resignation.

714
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,879
My officialJustice Department
recommendation is the following.

715
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,445
We win the case,
he gets his job back.

716
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,117
We lose, Booth shoots him.

717
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,560
The jury's returned
with the verdict.

718
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,893
Okay, let's go face the music.

719
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,844
Will the defendant please rise?

720
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,449
<i>Madam Foreperson,</i>
<i>please read the verdict.</i>

721
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:57,290
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>We thejury find the defendant guilty.</i>

722
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,919
Told you so.

723
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,294
- <i>[Judge] This court is adjourned.</i>
- <i># [Pop Ballad]</i>

724
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,458
- Nicely done, Caroline.
- Thank you.

725
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,276
[Mouthing Words]

726
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:22,718

727

<i>You look happy.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

732
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,289
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, you look really happy.

733
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,887
[Laughs]
You made the first move.

734
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,160
- Well, you told me I should.
- How was it?

735
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,168
I mean, I don't mean "it."

736
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,864
No, no. I do. I mean... <i>it.</i>

737
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:52,637
I discovered something very interesting
about cops and nicknames.

738
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,441
- Anthropologically interesting?
- Anatomically interesting.

739
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,473
They call the bald guy Curly,
and the fat guy Tiny.

740
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,486
- It's ironic.
- So when they call Sully Peanut...

741
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,545
He doesn't like to shower
with the other guys...

742
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,592
because he diverges from
the quantifiable morphological norm.

743
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:12,561
- What? What's that mean?
- Stands out from a crowd.

744
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,292
Do you have a nickname, Booth?
Something the other cops call you?

745
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,596
Why? What have you heard?

746
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,403
- Congrats, Brennan.
- [Chuckling] Wow.

747
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,340
<i>Those socks... Those are amazing.</i>

748
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,934
Right. The socks,
the tie, the belt buckle.

749
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,072
All escape valves
for my socioeconomic rage.

750
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,082
I hate psychology.

751
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,778
Oh, you know, they help me
deal with the day-to-day irritations...

752
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,151
of dealing with people
that are more privileged.

753
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,123
I slept with Sully last night.

754
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,159
- Oh. I thought you already...
- No. Last night.

755
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,494
Oh. It's really none of my business.

756
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,501
- Except we're partners.
- Yeah, there's that.

757
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,197
And you told me about your socks.

758
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,796
Mm-hmm. Sex, socks...
Pretty much the same word.

759
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,434
Do we have a case,
or are you just visiting?

760
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,944
Yeah. I'll fill you in
on the way. It's messy.

761
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,003
Better get some protection.

762
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,174
Let me get my gum boots.

763
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,588
[Exhales]

764
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,988
Yeah. I'm gonna need a flashier tie.

765
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,559
What's that mean?
