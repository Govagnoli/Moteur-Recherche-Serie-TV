1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,552
I'm Stacy Goodyear, and joining me on
<i>Wake Up DC</i> is Dr Temperance Brennan.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,236
She's the author of the bestselling
mystery novel <i>Bred in the Bone</i>,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,550
and she's also - tell me if I get this wrong -

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,111
an anthropologist
who works with the FBI to solve crimes?

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,435
Yes, that's correct. I use the bones
of people who have been murdered,

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,988
or burned, or...

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,436
blown up, or eaten by animals or insects,

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,511
orjust decomposed.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,479
Well, that's exciting. Uh, Dr Brennan,
your book has sold over 300,000 copies.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,154
How do you juggle twin careers

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,312
as a bestselling author
and crime-fighting scientist?

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,553
I do one, then the other.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,028
And is the work enjoyable?
I mean, the part involving rotten bodies?

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,716
Enjoyable? Satisfying, yes,
like cracking a code,

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,591
but when you're looking at someone who's
been brutally murdered... It's complicated.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,752
Cos I just thought, you know, yuck!

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,672
Doesrt leave you much time
for a personal life, does it?

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,512
It's true I'm more focused
on my career right now.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,276
Most of our viewers are parents,
home with their preschool-aged children.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,559
What will you tell your kids about
the horrors that you see every day?

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,632
I'm not going to have any children.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,314
- Really?
- Yes, really.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,435
Do you have any advice
for budding authors out there?

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,876
Well, the first thing
they should have is an idea,

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,272
and then, well, first you need
something to write with.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,114
They know that. Well, obviously...

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,432
you need a writing instrument
and you need an idea.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,990
I'm just not sure which should come first.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,118
The book is <i>Bred in the Bone</i>
by Dr Temperance Brennan.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,795
Next up after the break:
Wicker, the new leather.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,270
But is it safe for your children?

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,199
How was I?

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,033
- We'll talk about it on the way.
- On the way where?

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,310
<i>(man)</i> Tape off the perimeter.

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,592
The fire department came to put out a burning
car. They found a body in the driver's seat.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,717
- The licence plate and VIN are missing.
- Why is the FBI involved?

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,716
One burned backpack, child-sized sneaker,
plus the rear seatbelt had been sliced away.

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,511
You think it was a kidnapping?

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,593
The first 48 hours after a child abduction
are crucial. That's why you're here.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,309
You ID that victim,
that tells me what kid I'm looking for.

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,311
Shoe size four. It's a schoolbag, but
the contents are burned beyond recognition.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,153
What about the human remains?

43
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,395
The victim was female. Her skull shows
combined Caucasoid and Mongoloid features.

44
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,713
Also, preauricular sulcus to the pelvis shows
the victim gave birth five to eight years ago.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,189
The kidnapping victim could be her child.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,434
Maxillary molars have been replaced
with removable dentures. Lots of gold.

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,751
In parts of the Caucasus,
when girls from wealthy families turn 16,

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,150
they're given gold teeth
as a display of affluence.

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,437
I'll dissolve a bicuspid in nitric acid
and do a chemical workup.

50
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,718
- There's something lodged in the larynx.
- Part of her tongue?

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,914
It's not fleshy enough. This is can'tilage.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,915
This is Miss Pickering. She's performing
a security review for the State Department.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,117
One mars security review
is another mars witch-hunt.

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,873
- That would be Dr Jack Hodgins.
- It would be, yes.

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,238
You know us all, don't you, Miss Pickering?
Or is it Agent Pickering from the NSA?

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,596
I don't yet know you
as well as I will, Dr Hodgins.

57
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,238
Is something burning?

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,630
Not any more.
She's pretty much extinguished by now.

59
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,271
Miss Pickering will require a few minutes
to perform a routine security review.

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,353
- I expect everyone to be cooperative.
- I'm not swearing a damn loyalty oath.

61
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,270
And civil.

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,511
Ask Dr Chen in Pathology
to identify this as soon as possible.

63
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,353
- Dr Brennan.
- Yes, security check, civil.

64
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,989
Zack will grind a segment of the femur
for trace element analysis.

65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,469
Didrt I see you on television this morning?

66
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,634
How could I possibly know what you watched
on television? Booth, I have to talk to you.

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,679
- Yeah. It was definitely her.
- Maybe work your way up to Dr Brennan.

68
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,877
- Have you ID'd the burn victim?
- I may be jumping the gun...

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,075
Music to my ears.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,870
We should be looking at Eastern European
immigrants going back, say, ten years.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,838
I can find that out.
Angela doing the facial reconstruction?

72
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,354
- If this works, I'll buy you a puppy.
- Inadvisable.

73
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,637
You never told me how I was this morning.
I asked, "How did I do?"

74
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,188
You said, "We'll talk in the car," but we didn't.

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,033
- Was it your first TV interview?
- Yes.

76
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,796
- It was fine, you know, for your first one.
- Well, that was a qualified response.

77
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,111
What? No. It was lively.

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,270
- What kind of word is that?
- An adjective.

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,515
Though ironically most words that end in <i>ly</i>
are adverbs, like "ironically".

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,989
OK, what did I do wrong?

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,868
Maybe next time tell a funny story.
Never say you don't like children.

82
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,520
I didn't say that. I just said I don't want any.

83
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,909
On TV, it's the same thing.

84
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,991
The victim's skull was in good shape.
No real shrinkage from the fire.

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,757
I'm running a comparison
between the facial reconstruction

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,559
and the photos in the immigration database.

87
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,909
I hear we're gonna get grilled
by some mysterious government chick.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,313
I've been through this before. It's so we can
work on classified cases - CIA, military.

89
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,312
- You have something to hide?
- Better believe it, bucko.

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,790
- What kind of something?
- The best kind.

91
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,876
There. That one.

92
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,916
OK.

93
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,632
It's a good match.

94
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,359
Polina Rozalina Semov.

95
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,149
Born 1970, Churdon,
Perm district of the Urals.

96
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,191
She emigrated to the US in '94
with her sister Maria, married Carl Decker.

97
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,794
- They live in Cleveland Park.
- Children?

98
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,875
Donovan Dimitri Decker, born 1997.
He's eight years old.

99
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,317
<i>(Bones) Polina and Carl separated</i>
<i>three months ago. Separate addresses.</i>

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,915
We know that Mom's in a drawer
in your lab. Let's go find Dad.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,958
You arrest someone really small lately?

102
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,271
- Car seat in the back.
- Oh, I had Parker for the weekend.

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,193
- How can you do that?
- Install a car seat in an FBI vehicle?

104
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,589
Bring a kid into this world
knowing what you know.

105
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,595
I'll bet Parker was an accident, right? Because
his mother wouldn't marry you? What?

106
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,717
It never occurred to you that
that might be a sensitive topic.

107
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,836
You could have gone with "very small felon".

108
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,992
I'm better for Parker being around.
Someday you'll see that.

109
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,718
- I won't.
- You'll change your mind.

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,518
- I don't do that.
- You will.

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,071
Yeah, after I see how Carl Decker reacts when
you tell him his child has been kidnapped.

112
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,914
- We're gonna find Donovan with his dad.
- What? Why?

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
Most kidnappings
happen by estranged spouses.

114
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,352
You're certainly making the whole
domestic scene more and more attractive.

115
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,592
- This is it?
- Yeah, this is the correct address.

116
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,559
Just hang back
and let me do all the talking. OK?

117
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,876
Mr Decker.

118
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,997
- Bones, what are you doing?
- It's tidy, spartan even.

119
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,275
Is that odd for a recently separated man?

120
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,830
The guy's supposed to be
some super-rational tight-ass geek.

121
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,717
No offence.

122
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,394
There's no TV, no magazines,

123
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,596
no art, no stereo.

124
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,549
There's dust on everything.
I don't think he's been here in a while.

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,517
Where are you going?

126
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,750
Booth, where are you going?

127
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,869
- FBI.
- US marshals!

128
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,949
US marshals?

129
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,874
Forensic anthropologist!
That's why no gun.

130
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,678
At least nobody got shot.
Probably cos she didn't have a gun.

131
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,275
Sir, why is Carl Decker's home
being watched by US marshals?

132
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,113
He's a federal witness
under witness protection.

133
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,351
He's scheduled to appear
before a grand jury in two days.

134
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,718
- Is it a mob thing?
- Decker designs armour for KBC Systems.

135
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,270
He says they knowingly sent
defective armour to Iraq.

136
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,955
The Justice Department believes him
so they moved him to a safe house.

137
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,032
Does the Justice Department
think Decker is in danger?

138
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,157
He thinks he is.
They want him to testify, they play along.

139
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,710
Does Decker know his wife is dead
and his child has been kidnapped?

140
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,756
- No, and they don't want him to.
- Why?

141
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,152
- It might prevent him from testifying.
- Nothing can be gained from him knowing.

142
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,677
Except he doesn't testify and they don't kill
his son. Shouldrt that be his decision?

143
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,959
It's estimated KBC Systems is responsible
for 30 deaths and hundreds of injuries.

144
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,076
It's complicated.

145
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,709
His wife is dead and his child is missing.
That's not so complicated.

146
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,191
- No one's stopping you from investigating.
- He's a witness. I need access to him.

147
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,431
Decker didn't kill his wife -
he was in custody of US marshals,

148
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,795
so start looking someplace else.

149
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,474
Harsh reality, Booth. Deal with it.

150
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,313
- Does he not like me?
- I don't know.

151
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,392
<i>(Bones) I'll stay on Polina Decker's remains.</i>

152
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,109
I'll talk to the victims' families -
the ones not under federal protection.

153
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,079
You think a corporation would
actually kill a woman and kidnap her child?

154
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,234
Billions in dollars, plus civil suits if they're
found guilty? I've seen people killed for $50.

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,232
- You believe the boy is dead?
- I have to assume he isn't.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,639
Why?

157
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,475
It gives me something to look forward to
instead of dread. Given a choice I avoid dread.

158
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,869
- OK. It's logical.
- Is it?

159
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,111
Why dread something
that hasn't happened yet?

160
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,394
Yeah.

161
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,952
That piece of can'tilage we found in Polina's
mouth - antihelix and meatus remnants.

162
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,315
- It's an ear?
- Chen says it was bitten off.

163
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,709
The victim bit off one of her attacker's ears.

164
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,315
I heard someone found a fingertip
in their chilli once.

165
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,755
Dr Chen also found vestiges of earwax.

166
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,355
OK, get that wax to Hodgins.
See what he can find.

167
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,798
- <i>How come I have to learn to ride a bike?</i>
- <i>Are you really asking... or just stalling?</i>

168
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,678
- <i>Mm, stalling.</i>
- <i>Yeah. Thought so.</i>

169
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,631
- Why'd you stop?
- What are we hoping to learn from this tape?

170
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,635
We know Carl Decker didn't kidnap his own
child. The mother is dead, and the boy...

171
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,711
And the boy might be dead too.

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,792
I'm just wondering, what is
the benefit of watching this?

173
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,314
You put faces to names,
get a sense of people.

174
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,119
You're the anthropologist.
What does this tell you?

175
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,510
Learning to ride a bicycle
is a kind of rite of passage.

176
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,036
- It has anthropological significance.
- Really?

177
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,240
It carries meaning beyond the simple
mechanics of learning to ride a bike.

178
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,279
- Are you being psychological?
- No. Psychology is about the individual.

179
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,477
I'm speaking to a set of
cultural proxies and mores.

180
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,233
What the hell are you talking about?

181
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,673
The father is tight.
He's holding his arms, touching his mouth.

182
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,390
- So he's nervous. So what?
- Look at the boy. He's relaxed. He's not afraid.

183
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,393
- So then why was the boy stalling, huh?
- He's not. The father is.

184
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,110
The son knows that on some level and he's
enabling his father to reach a level of comfort.

185
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,193
- It's a symbiotic relationship.
- "Relationship." That's psychology.

186
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,114
The boy trusts his father absolutely.
He's confident.

187
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,873
The father wishes he didn't have to do this,

188
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,397
but he's accepted that he must
in his role as a father.

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,436
- <i>(sniffs)</i>
- What?

190
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,034
Probably felt the same
about being a whistle-blower.

191
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,795
That's psychology, and it's
of no use to us in this investigation.

192
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,598
Just push "play", OK?

193
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,233
- <i>All right, you ready?</i>
- <i>OK.</i>

194
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,754
- <i>Be careful.</i>
- <i>Don't make him nervous, Polina.</i>

195
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,912
<i>Push me, Dad.</i>
<i>Let go. Let go.</i>

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,399
<i>Not yet.</i>

197
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,277
<i>Let me go, Dad. Let me go.</i>

198
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,069
- <i>(Polina) Not yet. Run along with him, Carl.</i>
- <i>(Donovan) I can do it.</i>

199
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,871
<i>He's doing it.</i>

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,559
<i>He's doing it.</i>

201
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,108
<i>Be careful. Be careful.</i>

202
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,114
<i>How will we get him back, Carl?</i>

203
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,674
That's the real question, isn't it, Bones?
How do we get the boy back?

204
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,199
They left this morning very early, about 5am.
Donovan is on the swim team. Oh, my God.

205
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,431
- You and your sister were close?
- Yes.

206
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,390
When Polina and Carl separated,
she and Donovan came to stay with me.

207
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,959
This is terrible.

208
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,555
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt your sister?

209
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,074
It must be Carl.

210
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,436
Maybe he was afraid
she would take Donovan away from him.

211
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,353
- Would she have done that?
- No. Never.

212
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,036
- You don't like your brother-in-law.
- He's supposed to be brilliant, I know.

213
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,238
But he is also cold, angry.
Everything has to be just so.

214
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,348
- Why did Carl and your sister separate?
- Polina said he was having an affair.

215
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,159
I thought, "Who'd want him?"

216
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,678
But she found credit card receipts
from a motel he went to once or twice a week.

217
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,392
When she confronted Carl, he was furious,

218
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,995
wouldn't talk about it, so she left him.

219
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,154
Please find Donovan.

220
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,151
Find my sister's boy.

221
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,033
I found cracks in the victim's upper incisors.

222
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,430
There are also bilateral fractures
in the femoral necks.

223
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,115
There are similar fractures
in the proximal humeral heads.

224
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,270
The body went into spasm as it burned?

225
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,114
If she was burned alive.
I'll have Angela run some scenarios.

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,395
Angela's in a security review.

227
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,996
- 25 addresses in six countries in eight years.
- That's weird, right?

228
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,710
- What were you doing in all those places?
- Different things. Mostly looking.

229
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,791
I'm an artist.

230
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,757
- When did you last see your husband?
- My husband?

231
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,955
Yes.

232
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,951
Oh.

233
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,912
Oh.

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,115
Wow.

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,316
You mean that actually took?

236
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,312
Really, it didn't seem legal. We were in Fiji.

237
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,520
There was a fire dance.
You know how those things can be, right?

238
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,637
- I really don't, Ms Montenegro.
- Right.

239
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,269
- And do you like working here?
- Sometimes, yeah.

240
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,239
Not always. But there's also
a sense of accomplishment.

241
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,392
And Brennan needs me,
so I feel a personal connection there.

242
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,713
But the world's a big place. Frankly,
I'm emotionally ambivalent on the subject.

243
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,317
Was that the wrong answer? I should be more
"This is the bestjob in the world."

244
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,679
Right? Am I going too fast here?
Am I treating you too much like a therapist?

245
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,830
Do you want to stop... actually?

246
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,071
Cos... we could pick this up later if you're...

247
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,389
Yeah.

248
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,508
Carl Decker is not only
a disgruntled employee, he's... uh...

249
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,113
What's the term?

250
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,320
As a lawyer, the legal term
is "nuts, and a pain in the ass".

251
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,075
"Oppositional defiance disorder
and paranoia" is what I read.

252
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,515
Like I said, nuts and a pain in the ass.

253
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,070
Read where? Paranoia - you read that where?

254
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,438
You had Carl Decker investigated?

255
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,432
He's making damaging allegations
against the company.

256
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,033
False allegations.

257
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,475
Who would kill his wife and kidnap his son?

258
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,516
- It wasrt us.
- I didn't say it was.

259
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,672
Oh, please.
We have to top your list of suspects.

260
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,390
Look, we have an in-house system for dealing
with whistle-blowers. We encourage it.

261
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,994
I served in Vietnam, Agent Booth.

262
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,878
I saw what soldiers see.

263
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,394
If I read you correctly, you know what I mean.

264
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,914
Army, 75th Regiment.

265
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,991
"Rangers lead the way".

266
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,518
I'd never risk soldiers' lives by knowingly
providing them with defective armour,

267
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,878
and I welcome Carl Decker's appearance
at the grand jury, because he is wrong.

268
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,750
Carl Decker did brilliant work for us,
but he alienated everyone he worked with.

269
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,877
You should look for your murderer
and kidnapper elsewhere.

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,355
- Where have you been?
- I'm a field agent. I was out in the field.

271
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,796
There was a piece of an ear
in the victim's mouth, like she bit it off.

272
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,759
- The ear may help us. Did you find anything?
- A lot. No reason for the attitude.

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,150
- I beg your pardon?
- It's not like you've been doing all the work.

274
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,471
- What have you found out?
- The victim and her husband had problems.

275
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,472
She found motel receipts.
I got the motel's security tapes.

276
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,031
- Angela can use her fat recognition program.
- <i>Mass</i> recognition program.

277
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,355
Whatever. Maybe we'll be able to find out who
Decker was seeing. Is Angela in her office?

278
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,477
The FBI pathologist found
no smoke in the victim's lungs.

279
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,549
Meaning?

280
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,713
The victim was dead when she was burned.
There was clotting in the lungs as well.

281
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,791
- Troublesome.
- If the fire was hot enough...

282
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,590
No. For clotting to occur, superheated air
would have to be drawn into the lungs.

283
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,035
Which wouldn't happen
if she was already dead.

284
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,032
- Something else caused the clotting.
- Angela has the tapes.

285
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,795
The broken teeth could be
from particularly violent seizures.

286
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,154
Epilepsy?

287
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,198
There are several causes
of acute tonic muscular contractions.

288
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,273
- Poisoning, drop in blood sugar...
- Is this a good time to speak with Mr Addy?

289
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,478
Considering you had to interrupt him to ask,
probably not. Take Hodgins.

290
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,597
- I demand a lawyer.
- I don't need Dr Hodgins, I need Mr Addy.

291
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,468
- If I demand a lawyer, will I get out of it too?
- We all demand lawyers.

292
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,869
- I'll wait.
- Why aren't you interviewing me?

293
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,632
It won't be necessary.

294
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,032
They think my dossier is complete.
They think they know everything about me.

295
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,634
- They're wrong!
- Be happy they're leaving you alone.

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,915
I'm happy. Don't worry, I'm happy.

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,232
You know, the ear you found -
there's no way it's her own ear? Right?

298
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,390
- How could it be?
- That's what I'm saying.

299
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,789
- What?
- It's definitely not her ear.

300
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,634
- How could she bite off her own ear?
- Chromosome tests make it a male ear.

301
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,869
Seizures.

302
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,918
Seizures could be due to low blood sugar,

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,072
electrocution, infection, head injury,

304
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,038
brain tumour,
a sudden lack of oxygen in the brain.

305
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,951
- Electrocution.
- What?

306
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,194
The broken teeth, the fractures,
the clots in her lungs. She was electrocuted.

307
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,114
That much damage to the teeth could
only result from multiple violent spasms.

308
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,599
Dozens.

309
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,591
She was tortured.

310
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,551
- For what?
- To find out where her husband was.

311
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,111
- At least pretend to interview me.
- Your file is complete.

312
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,873
No one has interviewed me in two years.

313
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,155
No one has ever interviewed you.

314
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,800
Right. Yeah, let's play it your way.

315
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,270
Your cousin was appointed to
a very high posting in the government.

316
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,749
- My cousin with a bad rug?
- It doesn't affect his job.

317
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,354
It should. It demonstrates a denial of reality.

318
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,716
- Appointed to what very high posting?
- That's classified.

319
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,712
In what part of the government?
Or is that classified too?

320
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,792
As a potential embarrassment,
you were checked out.

321
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,351
- What kind of embarrassment?
- You're a conspiracy buff. You're paranoid.

322
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,797
OK, OK. So you're telling me
that my toe-chewing moron cousin

323
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,237
was appointed to a secret post in a secret part
of the government you can't tell me about,

324
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,552
so you compiled a secret dossier on me,
but I'm the one who's paranoid.

325
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,995
We don't use the word "dossier".

326
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,595
What was the finding? I still work here, so...

327
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,797
- Harmless.
- "Harmless"? I'm harmless?

328
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,509
Yes. You do not pose a viable threat.

329
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,114
Well, that's just insulting.

330
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,398
If you want me to interview you, I will,
but I'll only discover what we already know.

331
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,232
You are benign.

332
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,835
I am not benign, lady. I'm not harmless.

333
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,718
- I'm malignant. I'm a loaded cannon.
- Thank you.

334
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,397
I know things that would curdle your blood,
including a formula that does curdle blood.

335
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,151
Excuse me.

336
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,708
She's wrong. I'm dangerous.

337
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,278
Carl Decker is 1.7 metres tall
and weighs 58.2 kilograms.

338
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,036
- An ultra-marathoner.
- Being lean should make him easier to find.

339
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,429
- Not him.
- I talked to Pickering.

340
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,354
- Was it awful?
- Actually, I found it... cathartic.

341
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,717
- Well, his head's down. What do you think?
- No, he doesn't move like a runner.

342
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,439
She knows a lot about us. It's creepy.

343
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,432
- It's confidential.
- Couldrt you get the file?

344
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,990
- Probably.
- Then it's not confidential.

345
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,668
That's him. That's Carl Decker.

346
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,911
Fast forward -
see if he shows up with anyone else.

347
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,792
Back up.

348
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,909
Freeze on that guy.

349
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,070
Can you zoom in?

350
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,309
<i>(Angela)</i> Hm.

351
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,472
A secret life can cause marital strife.

352
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,633
- He was having an affair with a man?
- For all we know, he's meeting a hit man.

353
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,597
Doesrt look like a hit man.

354
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,797
Print the picture.
I'll see if he's in any of the databases.

355
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,316
- And when we find him?
- Haul him in, check he's got both ears.

356
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,198
I'll let you know what happens.

357
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,429
- Could we start, please?
- Any time. I can do two things at once.

358
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,080
Mr Addy, I require your full attention.

359
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,754
No, you don't. But I'll give it to you.

360
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,872
I need to establish that you are not
a threat to the security of this country.

361
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,111
I have a degree in forensic anthropology.
I study engineering.

362
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,670
Are you afraid I'll build a race
of criminal robots to destroy the Earth?

363
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,638
- Do you have that kind of fantasy often?
- Very often.

364
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,474
Does it concern you that such thoughts
are a sign of emotional retardation?

365
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,790
I've been told. I'm working on it.

366
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,350
- Can you understand why that concerns us?
- Not really.

367
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,750
Hypothetically,
you have a piece of information...

368
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,277
- Secret and meaningful information?
- Yes. The security of the country's at stake.

369
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,476
- Could I bribe you to give it to me?
- No.

370
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,357
- Threaten you?
- No.

371
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,274
What if I made a reasonable
rational argument, very persuasive?

372
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,396
- Merely persuasive?
- Irrefutable.

373
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,759
I make an irrefutable argument as to why you
should give me this information. Would you?

374
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,913
Not without checking with Dr Brennan
or Angela first, see what they said.

375
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,719
Agent Booth, if he'd talk to me.
He probably wouldn't.

376
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,917
I'd ask Dr Hodgins but he'd say
it was all part of a conspiracy,

377
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,118
so I mostly only take his advice... on women.

378
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,476
- 480 volts. 350 amps.
- I beg your pardon?

379
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,712
It's sort of secret information
I probably shouldn't tell you.

380
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,075
Any other questions?

381
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,957
Good.

382
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,315
Good work, sir. I only posted his face
on the hot sheet 20 minutes ago.

383
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,472
My boss is the United States
Attorney General.

384
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,597
You're not doing my career any good
putting me on the hot list.

385
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,196
Special Agent Seeley Booth,
meet Assistant US Attorney Ken Weeks.

386
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,159
I was hoping you'd turn out to be gay...
or have only one ear.

387
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,756
I get the gay thing a lot because I'm so cute,
but the one-ear thing - that's unique to you.

388
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,274
You're Decker's Justice Department handler?

389
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,158
Carl Decker was my prime witness
against KBC Systems.

390
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,915
"Was"? Did you get fired cos we caught you
on some motel surveillance cam?

391
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,319
They lost him.

392
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,757
A material witness for a specially convened
grand jury, and you lost him?

393
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,755
The guy's pretty smart - genius level.
Do you have any idea what it's like

394
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,400
- to interact with those types of people?
- A little.

395
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,277
So what made him run?

396
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,158
Decker insisted upon
talking to his son every day.

397
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,711
This morning we couldn't get Donovan. He
panicked and ran. The marshals will find him.

398
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,793
Doesrt matter. He won't testify
after he finds out about his wife and child.

399
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,236
Might as well pack up that grand jury
and send everybody home.

400
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,394
I get the chance, I'll give him the "don't let
your wife die in vain" speech. It might work.

401
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,234
Do you think this company
is capable of putting a hit out on Decker?

402
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,912
Kill his wife, kidnap his kid?

403
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,436
KBC Systems sent our boys into battle
with faulty body armour.

404
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,149
In my book, you can do that,
you can do anything.

405
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,392
- If Decker's smart, how will they catch him?
- Forget Decker. Ourjob is to find his son.

406
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,314
- If Decker doesn't testify...
- We can't assume they'll let the boy live.

407
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,517
- Surely KBC won't...
- We don't know who hired these guys.

408
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,391
KBC, military, disgruntled shareholders,
or someone we haven't even thought of yet.

409
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,390
- What?
- You told me not to jump to a conclusion.

410
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,392
- No offence.
- You were right. It's just I usually tell you.

411
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,710
<i>(Booth)</i> Our relationship has taken a new turn.

412
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,951
- 480 volts, 350 amps.
- Polina Decker?

413
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,999
The voltage it'd take to cause muscle spasms
so strong they'd fracture bone.

414
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,595
- That's not household current.
- They used a generator.

415
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,796
Zack, you are smart.

416
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,799
Zack! Zack! This guy Decker, he's like you.
He's in the whole stratosphere IQ-wise.

417
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,916
- What's his IQ?
- It's 163.

418
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,309
Oh! He's not where Zack is.

419
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,311
I'm in the ionosphere.

420
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,153
The point is that Decker
escapes the US marshals,

421
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,959
tries to contact his wife
and finds out she's been killed.

422
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,429
- What does he do next?
- His IQ's not a variable.

423
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,274
Intelligence doesn't determine what you do
but how effectively you do it.

424
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,832
- It depends on what kind of person he is.
- Well, you know, he's a loving father,

425
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,992
estranged from the mother of his child.

426
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,796
- Sound like anyone you know?
- Back out of my space, buddy.

427
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,352
Zack's right. If you were in Decker's
position, what would you do?

428
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,712
Bucar four with accessory
proceeding to 4413 Elstree, KBC Systems,

429
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,234
requesting local backup, possible 1031.

430
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,357
- <i>(man) Roger that.</i>
- Did you just refer to me as an accessory?

431
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,399
You asked me what I'd do if I were Decker.
They kill my wife, they take my boy,

432
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,199
I go to the source of the problem.
I take 'em out.

433
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,430
Take 'em out like...?

434
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,873
Oh.

435
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,631
- FBI. Seward in?
- Yes, sir.

436
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,711
Secure the building. Nobody in or out.

437
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,828
I enjoy your company, but at times like this
you give me something extra to worry about.

438
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,798
You enjoy my company?

439
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,392
<i>(moans)</i>

440
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,553
- <i>(man)</i> Make the call.
- FBI, Mr Decker.

441
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,949
Drop your weapon. Now!

442
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,152
Nothing's changed.
Make the call, or I'll blow your head off.

443
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,552
- He wants me to call his sors kidnappers.
- Tell them to release my boy or you die.

444
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,551
It's that simple.

445
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,995
- You can shoot me after that.
- I don't know...

446
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,631
- Mr Decker, Agent Booth is an excellent shot.
- I'm not afraid to die.

447
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,871
- For God's sake, shoot him.
- Mr Seward, please shut up.

448
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,636
What you're trying to do, save your son, that's
not gonna happen if you die here tonight.

449
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,919
Be rational, Mr Decker. What you were
planning has failed. You have to adapt.

450
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,471
Adapt how?

451
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,916
All I want is for my son to live.

452
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,470
You people just took away his best chance.

453
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,396
- <i>(Pickering)</i> Do you know a Lily Marsden?
- Yes, I do.

454
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,597
- Have you had sex with her?
- This falls under your purview?

455
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,196
- Lily Marsden is an environmental extremist.
- She's in Earth Now.

456
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,475
You give money to Earth Now, don't you?

457
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,917
And the Sierra Club and Habitat for Humanity,
the opera, and public radio.

458
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,835
Lily Marsden has been arrested for
breaking into animal labs, torching SUVs,

459
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,711
trespassing on military reserves,
dousing citizens wearing fur with red paint...

460
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,396
Dr Goodman, if you have had or are having
sexual relations with Lily Marsden,

461
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,311
- we have a problem.
- Why?

462
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,154
Because an illicit sexual relationship
gives her leverage over you.

463
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,198
This makes you a security risk.

464
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,479
I'm a married man, Ms Pickering.
I'm faithful to my wife.

465
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,438
Please define your relationship
with Lily Marsden.

466
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,080
I enjoy talking to her.

467
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,277
We argue. She's a nut, but she's a smart nut.

468
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,558
She's... always interesting. She's never dull.

469
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,790
- So you...
- Talk to her.

470
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,320
It's a bad sign
when discourse becomes suspect.

471
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,233
- You talk to her?
- Sometimes we yell.

472
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,917
You want to give me one good reason why I
shouldn't charge you with attempted murder?

473
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,390
- You think I went after him out of vengeance?
- Looks like that.

474
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,430
KBC Systems hired people to kill my wife and
kidnap my child. Think rationally for a minute.

475
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,958
If KBC Systems is behind the kidnapping,
Seward would be the person to call it off.

476
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,998
A rational human. How did you
find yourself amongst these people?

477
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,559
We are trying to help.

478
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,156
Excellent. Hold your gun to Trent Seward's
head and force him to let my son go.

479
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,950
There's no compelling evidence that Trent
Seward ordered the kidnapping of your son.

480
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,398
I personally calculated the penetration
tolerances for the combat flakjackets.

481
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,439
The company found my calculations
to be excessively conservative.

482
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,273
30 soldiers died.

483
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,036
Trent Seward will do anything
to prevent me from testifying.

484
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,079
He or someone working for him
kidnapped my child and killed my wife.

485
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,550
If you want to get Trent Seward,
tell that grand jury what you know.

486
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,949
And the kidnappers will kill my boy.

487
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,194
With respect for what you're going through
emotionally, sir, Mr Weeks is not wrong.

488
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,877
This is my son. I love him, and if there's
even a slight chance that I can save his life

489
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,191
by shutting up, then that's what I'll do.
Shut the hell up!

490
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,430
And what about the soldiers?

491
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,311
Analytically, I understand
that many lives outweigh the one...

492
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,153
but I cannot trade my sors life.

493
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,437
Have you considered that
your wife will have died in vain?

494
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,038
Shut up. If you had protected Mr Decker and
his family properly, we wouldn't even be here.

495
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,709
Let's go.

496
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,595
The only way that I will testify...

497
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,679
is if I see you with my son.

498
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,514
Mr Decker, you and Donovan,
you have a codeword?

499
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,831
Something to let him know that you sent me?

500
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,354
"Paladin".

501
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,477
Tell Donovan "paladin".

502
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,952
Paladin.

503
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,350
Defender of the faith, protector.

504
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,351
Suits you, Booth.

505
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,670
You know what?
You tough guys are all very sentimental.

506
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,113
I have results on the earwax. I ran the
particulates through the gas chromatograph

507
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,159
and found the pollen of <i>Eragrostis curvula</i>,
known as weeping lovegrass.

508
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,630
- Where does one find weeping love?
- That's found worldwide.

509
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,998
But weeping lovegrass?
That's in South Africa.

510
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,036
Anything else?

511
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,148
Traces of automotive-grade asbestos.
The guy didn't have very good aural hygiene.

512
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,435
Dr Brennan.

513
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,115
- What, now? You've got to be kidding.
- Take me. I'll waive the lawyer.

514
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,988
I have a few surprises in me.
Tell that to your superiors at the NSA.

515
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,799
Booth, we're looking for
a one-eared South African.

516
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,791
- South African?
- Does that mean something?

517
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,678
There's a number of
South African security consultants

518
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,958
companies use to do their dirty work
in the Third World. They're really mercenaries.

519
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,949
- <i>He might be a mechanic.</i>
- You can tell that?

520
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,793
<i>He had traces of</i>
<i>what is probably brake pad in his ear.</i>

521
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,189
- How'd that get in there?
- <i>Any number of ways.</i>

522
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,798
<i>Most likely his hand comes in contact</i>
<i>with asbestos and then he scratches his ear.</i>

523
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,589
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

524
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,990
- I'm on my way over.
- What's the matter?

525
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,877
Somebody sent me Donovan Decker's finger.

526
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,836
An eight-year-old boy?
That's consistent with what I'm looking at.

527
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,150
You should send this to an FBI pathologist.

528
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,995
They'd give me fingerprints and DNA. We
know who the finger belongs to. I need more.

529
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,149
Like what?

530
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,437
You gave me a South African mechanic
from a chunk of burned ear.

531
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,193
Do it again. Do it better. Do it fast.

532
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,429
What?

533
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,114
Start. Come on, do what you do.

534
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,509
- You're kind of worked up.
- You see facts

535
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,914
but I see a terrified little boy with
his finger cut off. Now, is he even still alive?

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,074
Blood saturation levels are high. His heart
was beating when they removed his finger.

537
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,752
OK.

538
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,194
- He's alive. That's something.
- Who does this?

539
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,475
Cuts a finger off an eight-year-old boy?

540
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,632
Mercenaries, professionals.
They don't feel a thing.

541
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,553
- I feel things, Booth.
- Never said you didn't, Bones.

542
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,790
I'm a professional too.

543
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,715
I do better work if I only see the finger and not
the child. That doesn't mean I'm like them.

544
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,351
I know that, but what I also know is that they
made a big mistake sending us that finger.

545
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,035
- Because it made you mad?
- Because you're gonna use it to catch them.

546
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,918
So, you gather up your squint squad.

547
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,275
Let's get to work.

548
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,750
Did you kick the ball? How far did it go?

549
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,879
Backwards? <i>(laughs)</i>
Yeah, I can kick a ball.

550
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,270
I'm gonna...
Daddy's gonna show you on Saturday.

551
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,749
I'm gonna see you Saturday, OK, Parker?

552
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,913
OK, I gotta go, bub. I love you. I'll see you
Saturday. Bye. What have you got?

553
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,356
The finger was severed
using a hatchet on a wooden surface.

554
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,795
- Cutting board?
- No. Older, unsealed pine.

555
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
- I'm thinking a mechanic's workbench.
- Why?

556
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,671
Traces of lead and
methyl tertiary-butyl ether on the bone.

557
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,799
- The nail was bitten to the quick.
- The kid was nervous. You would be too.

558
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,953
- MTBEs have been in gas since the '70s.
- But there's lead here as well.

559
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,749
Leaded gasoline was phased out
between 1975 and 1986.

560
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,991
Asbestos from brake pads,
leaded gasoline, a mechanic bench,

561
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,312
plus the mother was electrocuted
by current from a generator.

562
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,598
We want an abandoned gas station or a
mechanic shop off the grid. You're geniuses.

563
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,433
- How do we find that?
- I work for the FBI, you idiot.

564
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,992
Way to go, Zack. We went from
geniuses to idiots in three seconds.

565
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,198
- Tell me what you were doing in Cuba.
- Only if you tell me first.

566
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,352
- I beg your pardon?
- I don't know your security clearance.

567
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,035
- What is <i>your</i> security clearance?
- Check with the State Department.

568
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,398
- I'm from the State Department.
- Then that should make it easy for you.

569
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,237
When you were in Cuba, did you meet
with a man... named Juan Guzman?

570
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,509
Hello. It's Dr Brennan from the Jeffersonian.

571
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,388
You told me to call you
if anyone asked about... you know...

572
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,277
him.

573
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,591
Someone from the State Department
named Samantha Pickering.

574
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,597
Pickering.

575
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,510
Yes, sir. Yes, I'll wait here.

576
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,632
- Any more questions?
- No.

577
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,508
Uh, no. In fact, the entire review is suspended.

578
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,389
I'm to wait here until someone
comes to destroy my notes.

579
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,869
We might have the kid.

580
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,558
Polina didn't make any cellphone calls after
she was kidnapped, but nobody turned it off.

581
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,236
When she left her coverage area, the phone
was assigned a new routeing tower.

582
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,392
- You could triangulate her position.
- To within 75 square miles.

583
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,996
There were six abandoned gas stations
in that area - five urban, one rural.

584
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,753
SWAT'll check them all,
but I think it's the rural one.

585
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,354
- Why?
- Cos I used to do this kind of work.

586
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,513
- Rescuing people?
- Or being the person to be rescued from.

587
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,589
Oh.

588
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,038
If I had a choice, I picked an isolated area.
This is an abandoned truck repair depot.

589
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,873
- SWAT will meet us there.
- Why don't we ever take my car?

590
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,712
- Do you have bulletproof vests?
- No.

591
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,233
That's why.

592
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,030
The FLIR imagery gives us
three adults within the structure.

593
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,599
- Boy?
- No reading.

594
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,549
- Probably because he's small, hypothermic.
- Entirely possible, sir. What's the play?

595
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,473
I go in first, straight for the kid.
You do what you do.

596
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,788
All right.

597
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,030
- What about me?
- Wait outside.

598
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,113
- I don't want to miss anything.
- These guys aren't like anyone you've met.

599
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,196
Please, just be someone you aren't for the
next ten minutes and you hang back. Please.

607
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,672
Paladin. Paladin.

I think your dad's crying because he's happy.
He's happy he got you back.

615
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,112
- Well done.
- I hope you're really good at yourjob.

- Why's that?
- Cos you got nothing else going for you.

617

He's a father himself.

Thank God I always had the sense
not to let that happen to me.

619

All right, thank you.

620
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,754
You think KBC hired the mercenaries?

621
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,515
We'll let the grand jury figure that out.
We did ourjob.

622
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,160
It's not often I get to help save someone.

623
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,879
When you catch a murderer
you save his next victim.

624
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,077
- This is different.
- Yeah. Still glad you don't have kids?

625
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,752
Yeah. Why?

626
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,071
Looking at that boy and his dad,
I thought you'd change your mind.
