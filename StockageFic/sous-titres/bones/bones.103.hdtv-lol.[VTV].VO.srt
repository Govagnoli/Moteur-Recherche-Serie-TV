1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,944
Bones, where's the kid?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,484
Who's that with Zack?

3
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:17,950
Naomi from Paleontology.

4
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,113
Naomi and Zack slept together
about a month ago.

5
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:22,506
Since then, she hasn't
return a single call.

6
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:24,286
Oh.

7
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:26,813
You working on
anything interesting?

8
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:29,370
Me? Yeah, yeah,

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,082
a three-dimensional model
of an Etruscan burial crypt.

10
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:33,300
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,930
- You?
- Yeah, oh, God, yeah.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,467
Very exciting,
very exciting.

13
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:38,531
Some, uh, silt profiles.

14
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:42,647
God, Etruscan burial
crypts are so boring.

15
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,486
Oh, man, I know.
I mean, silt profiles?

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,660
You know what we need?

17
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:47,706
A murder investigation.

18
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:49,305
Brennan and Booth
are out front right now

19
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:50,451
waiting for Zack.

20
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:52,272
What, there's a case?

21
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,172
Why didn't you say so? Zack!

22
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:55,873
You've got to go.

23
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:56,820
Oh, she really bolted.

24
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,505
Doesn't look good for Zack.

25
00:00:58,572 --> 00:00:59,728
Come on, Zack.
Shake it off, huh?

26
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:00,825
Be a man.

27
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:01,858
You okay, honey?

28
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:02,700
She said, "Take a hint."

29
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,945
But when I asked, "What hint?"

30
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:05,726
Naomi said
if she told me what hint,

31
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:06,800
then it wouldn't be
a hint anymore.

32
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,675
- It would be a statement.
- You know what's good?

33
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:09,941
Throwing yourself
into your work, huh?

34
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,142
You really do hate
slime profiles.

35
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:13,675
Have a little compassion.

36
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,752
I understood the individual words,
but I do not comprehend her meaning.

37
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:18,485
Did you tell Naomi that?
Yes.

38
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:20,152
She said,

39
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:23,280
"Ask your friends,
if I have any."

40
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,707
You know,
Hodgins is right.

41
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:27,959
Let's not
keep Booth waiting.

42
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:30,014
Somebody is decomposing
as we speak.

43
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,959
Get out there and bring
us home a case, buddy.

44
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,399
We've got a dead body

45
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:45,866
in a prep school
out in the sticks.

46
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,432
Good morning to you, too.

47
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:49,132
You're successful
with women, right?

48
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,187
I mean, they like you.

49
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:52,568
Okay, look, it's a very
prestigious prep school.

50
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:53,475
There's a lot
of rich kids.

51
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:54,775
I thought it was good
to start with "good morning."

52
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,470
If a woman said to you,
"Take a hint,"

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,370
what would it mean?

54
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,308
Can we just concentrate
on the job?

55
00:02:00,342 --> 00:02:01,909
<i>Suspect has been located.</i>

56
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,275
<i>Need assistance...</i>

57
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:05,809
Thank you.

58
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,088
Now I know the sheriff
out there.

59
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,236
She's mostly okay.

60
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:12,050
But the school's got a lot
of pull in the county,

61
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,419
and she's probably
just trying to scrape

62
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,052
the whole case
off on us.

63
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,417
Look, what I'm
trying to say is,

64
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:17,716
it's not just
a crime scene,

65
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,378
but it's a political
situation.

66
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:20,353
So when we get out there,

67
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:21,886
you follow my lead,
and you pay attention.

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,197
You call after every
sexual encounter, right?

69
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:26,821
Because that's
the good thing to do.

70
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:28,921
Look, is is a work mode.
This is a work zone.

71
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:30,655
You do not talk sex at work.

72
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,846
First, you tell me
I'm too task-oriented,

73
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,646
then when I say "good morning,"

74
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,313
you say that I should
concentrate on the job.

75
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,293
Okay, look we got about
a 45-minute drive. Hmm?

76
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,462
What do you say we pass it
in quiet meditation?

77
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:57,710
Finally! Can we talk yet?

78
00:02:58,193 --> 00:02:59,619
- No.
- Why not?

79
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,115
Because when we're at a crime
scene, I do all the talking.

80
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,603
My crime scene, my rules.

81
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:04,960
what's with all the security?

82
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,946
I told you. This is not a regular school

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,779
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth,
and a forensic anthropologist.

84
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:14,355
Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian Institute.

85
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:15,638
plus one crack assistant.

86
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,406
I'll need to see
some ID, please.

87
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,638
This reminds me of
where I went to school.

88
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:24,120
You don't get much farther from the
real world, that's for sure.

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,319
Whose kids go to school here

90
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,820
is actually classified
information.

91
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,687
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, I'll lead you
to Mr. Sanders, our head of security.

92
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,832
Can you just aim us in the right direction?
We'll find it.

93
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:36,735
All outsiders are
to be escorted, sir.

94
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:42,987
"Omnia Mea Mecum Porto."

95
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,053
What's that mean, huh?

96
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:45,786
"Regular people stay out"?

97
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,560
"I carry with me all my things."

98
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,515
Hey, Seeley, how's it going?

99
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:06,948
Karen, congratulations
on being elected full sheriff.

100
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,815
Very impressive.

101
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,749
Agent Booth, I'm Leo Sanders,
head of security at Hanover Prep.

102
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:13,216
This is Headmaster
Peter Ronson.

103
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,716
Where are
the human remains?

104
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:16,250
Dr. Temperance Brennan

105
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,758
and her assistant,
Jack, uh, something.

106
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,119
Zack Addy.

107
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,636
Could you show me
to the remains?

108
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,526
Even though the school
was mostly empty

109
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,645
during the two-week break,
it's impossible to...

110
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:26,909
I don't know
if you remember me,

111
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,476
but we worked
together on a case--

112
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,443
bunch of bones
found in the culvert,

113
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,261
about a year ago.

114
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,576
I remember the bones
in the culvert.

115
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,033
You know, Bones,
being nice to the locals,

116
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,701
remembering
their names and such,

117
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,100
it wouldn't hurt.

118
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,234
Our two-week term break
ends tomorrow.

119
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,579
I'd like to get
this tidied up,

120
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,353
so the students
never know what happened.

121
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,320
But we don't know what happened
yet, that's why I'm here.

122
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,786
Did anyone touch the body?

123
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,487
I doubt it.
it´s pretty grisly.

124
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,587
Not big on small talk, is she?

125
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:52,353
Dr. Brennan's very focused.

126
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:56,873
Where are the remains?

127
00:04:58,403 --> 00:04:59,403
Bones?

128
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,484
Is that a student?

129
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,718
It's a secury campus.

130
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,317
Got to be student,
staff or faculty.

131
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:18,799
Video first.
I don't want your flash
disturbing the crows.

132
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,899
Yeah, that'd be a shame.

133
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,334
Disturb the human
flesh-eating birds.

134
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,266
You want to increase
the perimeter here?

135
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,599
Gentlemen.

136
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,780
Give my forensic
anthropologist some room.

137
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,606
Your forensic anthropologist?

138
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:30,873
Agent Booth, if you
decide this is a suicide,

139
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,626
it becomes my
problem, correct?

140
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,924
Actually, the person who decides
if this is a suicide is me.

141
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,278
Let's give the bone
lady some room.

142
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,167
You know, I'm glad
we had that little chat

143
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:42,202
about being nice
to the locals.

144
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:44,103
I don't like sheriffs.
They're elected into office,

145
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,595
which means their goal
is being reelected,

146
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,618
not finding the truth.

147
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:47,552
I got video, Dr. Brennan.

148
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:48,852
Go to stills.

149
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,719
Can we just get him
down from there?

150
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:53,353
There's a lot of work to do
before we get to that.

151
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,229
- You want to step back, please, sir?
I'm the headmaster here.

152
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,152
And this is a crime scene. Step back.

153
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,670
Oh...

154
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,689
I'm gonna need an evidence bag.

155
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,589
Heads up.

156
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:19,429
I'm going to need a bigger bag.

157
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,926
Episode 103:
Boy in a tree

158
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:35,138
Transcript: cfsmp3
Synchro: narkond
www.forom.com

159
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,163
I make this a male.

160
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,464
Approximately 5'6", 130 pounds.

161
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:01,263
From the looks of
the sternum and skull,

162
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,120
I'd say mid-adolescence.

163
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,323
Say, 14 to 17.

164
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,854
high cheek bones,
you think maybe Asian?

165
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,697
I'm getting more
of a Hispanic vibe.

166
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,503
There is a significant
crematogaster ant colony

167
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:14,169
in the tree
that fed on the body,

168
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,524
as well as
tabanid maggots.

169
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:16,958
I'll give you
a time-of-death estimate

170
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,529
when I figure out
who ate what when.

171
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,197
Check for insect pupa and larva,
see what kind of medications

172
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:22,526
and/or drugs
might have been

173
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,726
- ...in his system.
- He was wearing this.

174
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,926
Catholic boy.

175
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,058
One-by-two forceps.

176
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,667
What is that?

177
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,590
Cochlear implant.

178
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,275
Looks like the birds
were trying to get it.

179
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,675
That would set a boy apart
from the others.

180
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,841
Being deaf.

181
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:45,811
Get a serial number.

182
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:49,205
I'll get X-rays and 3-D imaging
of the entire skeleton.

183
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,457
I didn't talk to anybody
in high school.

184
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,619
I didn't kill myself.

185
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,185
That wasn't a high school.

186
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:57,219
It was an experimental
eugenics program.

187
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,268
How hard can it be to find out

188
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,272
which one of your students is missing?

189
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:08,517
We can't just
call parents and say

190
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:09,985
"We found a rotting body.

191
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:11,330
Do you know
where your child is?"

192
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:13,351
We can do a full
roll call tomorrow.

193
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:14,982
All of our higher-risk students
are accounted for.

194
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,041
Higher-risk?

195
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,474
The ones with
personal bodyguards.

196
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,641
What are our options

197
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:20,307
vis-à-vis publicity, media?

198
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,654
Not my concern.

199
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:23,504
There are students here

200
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,339
we really don't want the
whole world to know about.

201
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,819
It's obviously
a suicide.

202
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,179
It's not as though we're asking you to
for ego the glory of catching a murderer.

203
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,713
Excuse me, I´m Sorry

204
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,458
Booth.

205
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,751
We'll have the identity of the
boy in the tree within the hour.

206
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,018
That was fast.

207
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,451
You know what
a cochlear implant is?

208
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:43,617
Hearing aid?

209
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:45,053
No. Not exactly.

210
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,059
It's a much more sophisticated
piece of equipment,

211
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,239
- ...which is surgically...
- Can you identify him through the serial number.

212
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,009
That's correct.

213
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,376
But the interesting thin
is that...

214
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,142
You can fill me in later.

215
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:53,576
Wait, no,

216
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,875
but the interesting thing
is that his...

217
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,176
That's correct.

218
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:57,334
What?

219
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:58,901
That is interesting.

220
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:01,638
Are you drunk or something?

221
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,029
We'll catch up later.

222
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:03,969
Wait, wait.

223
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,264
I'm not completely certain
the boy's death is a suicide.

224
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,231
Well, we'll grab
some Chinese food

225
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,098
and you can fill me in later
on all the boring details.

226
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,431
Sorry.

227
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:16,438
Death is very upsetting
to a community as tight as ours.

228
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,757
Well, you're famous
for keeping your students safe.

229
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,625
But you can't held responsible

230
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,258
if a troubled student
kills himself.

231
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,189
We all agree that

232
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,456
suicide is the only
feasible conclusion.

233
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,256
We understand each other

234
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:30,328
Hmm, we sure as hell do.

235
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,333
I'll need a complete
enrollment list,

236
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,071
including teachers, staff,

237
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:38,713
students.

238
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:40,861
That's extremely
confidential information.

239
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,130
Luckily, I'm good
at keeping secrets.

240
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,261
What do you mean
it's not a suicide?

241
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
- Hold on a second, sir.
- What the hell is that?

242
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,686
We can't have just anyone
step into the forensics area,

243
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:02,020
and contaminate
all the boring details.

244
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:03,419
The boring details?

245
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:04,886
Do not push me, kid.

246
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,590
"Boring details" was my signal
for you to stop talking. Okay?

247
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,680
- I want my own card.
- Well, I want my own gun.

248
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,773
Last time you had a gun,
you shot someone.

249
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:11,440
He was a bad guy.

250
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:12,974
Okay, look,
who's our victim?

251
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,240
All the boring details?

252
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,374
Let it go, Bones.

253
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,474
Move on.

254
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,040
Don't call me "Bones."

255
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:19,873
We traced the cochlear implant

256
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,340
to Dr. Maurice Ledbetter
at Cedars-Sinai,

257
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,210
who placed it in a boy
named Nestor Olivos.

258
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,817
"Nestor Olivos.
Student visa.

259
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,515
Son of a Venezuelan
Ambassador."

260
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:30,881
What else?

261
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,144
You want all
the boring details?

262
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,391
Let it go, Bones.

263
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,686
Don't call me "Bones."

264
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,099
The boy's hyoid bone is broken.

265
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,632
Strangulation death,
the hyoid is always broken.

266
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,337
In adults.
This was a boy.

267
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:44,771
His hyoid is flexible.

268
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:46,070
Unbreakable.

269
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,144
Well, maybe the kid's got
some kind of Venezuelan

270
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:50,889
brittle bone syndrome?

271
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,793
Im just trying to help.

272
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:55,897
So you're saying
he was murdered.

273
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:57,797
No, I'm saying I don't know
what happened to the boy,

274
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,431
because I don't
have all the facts.

275
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:09,888
How hard can it be?

276
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,921
A kid hanging from a tree--
obviously, it's a suicide.

277
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,021
Sir, is Hannover Prep stirring
the pudding on this?

278
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,612
Of course they're
stirring the pudding.

279
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:17,141
Every mover and shaker
in this town

280
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,367
is connected
to that damn school.

281
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,693
Apparently, the very future
of this country is at stake.

282
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,767
I'd like to declare it a murder,
just to shake those little...

283
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:23,837
not going
to declare it a murder,

284
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:25,580
just so you can shake things up.

285
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,582
The evidence is ambiguous at best.

286
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,582
Well, unambiguize it.

287
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:33,867
Please, Dr. Goodman.

288
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,533
Look, you're very experienced

289
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,266
within your field
of bones and such, right?

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,527
Doesn't your gut
say "suicide"?

291
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,360
I don't actually
use my gut for that, sir.

292
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,861
She really, really doesn't.

293
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:47,867
Like all of us here in Jeffersonian, Dr. Brennan
prefers science to the digestive tract.

294
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:48,908
What about your gut?

295
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,505
My gut says it stinks.

296
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:52,653
If he smells with his gut,
what does he use his nose for?

297
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,505
All right, all
right, all right.

298
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,468
In order for an investigation to occur,
you, Dr. Brennan,

299
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,644
have to declare it
a murder.

300
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,422
Without an
investigation,

301
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:01,588
we can't find out
if it's a murder,

302
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,321
but there'll be
no investigation

303
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,455
unless Dr. Brennan
declares it to be a murder.

304
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,988
Shall I send for
a philosopher?

305
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:10,517
They're saying it's my call.

306
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:13,188
You see? It's how you talk
to these people.

307
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:21,578
My official finding is that Nestor Olivos...

308
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,046
is a victim of a homicide.

309
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,302
<i>( over radio ):
* Let it go *</i>

310
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,985
* On a highway...

311
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,384
Thank you.

312
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,126
For what?

313
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:46,432
For going with my
instincts in there.

314
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,833
No, I did not back up
your instincts.

315
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,833
I bought time to find the facts I need

316
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:52,008
to tell me what happened
to Nestor Olivos.

317
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,265
What's with you
and the private school?

318
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,098
They thought we understood
each other.

319
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:58,232
That's bad?
Understanding each other?

320
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,631
I don't like people

321
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,465
who think they're better
than other people.

322
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:03,015
Some people are better
than other people.

323
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,232
You know, what you just said
right there that is un-American.

324
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:07,110
All men are created equal.

325
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,700
Either you believe that,
or you don't.

326
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,800
And some people
are smarter than others.

327
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,521
There's no use being
offended by the fact.

328
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,454
What are we going to tell
Nestor's parents?

329
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,687
We tell them that
their son was found dead,

330
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,287
we're looking into it,

331
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,715
sorry for your loss.

332
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:25,149
And we are.

333
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:27,544
What?

334
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:28,728
Sorry for their loss.

335
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:29,699
It's sad.

336
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,239
Try to remember that.

337
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:32,632
I'm not a sociopath.

338
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,166
You're bad with people.

339
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,552
No use being offended
by the fact.

340
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,598
Hanging from a tree
at the school?

341
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,228
I'm afraid so,
Ambassador Olivos.

342
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,308
We will provide you
with full details

343
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:52,315
when Dr. Brennan
finishes her investigation.

344
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,881
Will you need us to identify
Nestor's remains?

345
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,215
That won't be necessary.

346
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,384
When was the last time
you heard from Nestor?

347
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:09,669
A few days after
his holiday began.

348
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,769
He went with a friend
to Nova Scotia.

349
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,469
We received an e-mail.

350
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,667
Could we have a copy?

351
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,072
It'll help us determine
exactly when the victim died.

352
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,199
Your son.

353
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:21,431
We're very sorry for your loss.

354
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,675
There was nothing to suggest in the
e-mail that Nestor s unhappy.

355
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,866
Certainly not enough to...

356
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,673
We would like
to take him home.

357
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:35,145
We must petition the church to bury him
in consecrated ground.

358
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,146
Nestor was
an altar boy.

359
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:38,958
They will bury him properly.

360
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,794
When will you release him to us?

361
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:45,358
That's up to Dr. Brennan.

362
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,451
What did Naomi mean
when she said, "Take a hint"?

363
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,272
Ooh.

364
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,507
What did I do wrong?

365
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,543
It's not what you did wrong;
it's what you didn't do.

366
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,464
Where do you learn
this stuff?

367
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,063
Some thins
you learn by doing:

368
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,755
Riding a bike, driving a car,
pleasing a woman...

369
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,851
I can't ride a bike
or drive a car.

370
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:13,818
Or apparently,
please a woman.

371
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,644
I need specific
instructions.

372
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,256
A list of techniques
to implement

373
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,822
or a sequence of moves.

374
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:21,244
Im not really the guy
to talk to about that.

375
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:23,117
Why not? You've slept
with, like, 10,000 women.

376
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:23,989
Because our
relationship

377
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,323
is all about
what's up here.

378
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:26,422
What you need
to do is talk

379
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:30,323
to someone
more... earthy.

380
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:41,491
As a school psychiatrist,
I'm bound by patient confidentiality.

381
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:44,221
In the absence of a warrant
or permission from his parents,

382
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:47,268
I can't divulge the specifics
of my meetings with Nestor Olivos.

383
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,832
I can tell you that he was
at extreme risk of suicide.

384
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:53,649
There are no indications that Nestor
was taking antidepressants.

385
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,814
I can only make recommendations
to the parents.

386
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,515
You think this boy
was depressed enough

387
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:58,586
to hang himself from a tree?

388
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,765
He was alienated by culture,
by language, by his handicap,

389
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,305
by his own social
awkwardness. Yes.

390
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:06,136
Thank you for coming down,
Dr. Petty.

391
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:08,374
As we suspected,
suicide.

392
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:12,938
A depressed and lonely boy
hangs himself over the holiday.

393
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,989
So how's the son of an
ambassador go missing

394
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,162
for two weeks
and nobody notices?

395
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:19,515
As far as the school
was concerned,

396
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,231
Nestor was vacationing
with his roommate.

397
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:23,291
The school requested

398
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,944
and received a waiver
from Ambassador Olivos.

399
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:29,358
I was in Venezuela
last year.

400
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:30,883
It's very unstable
politically.

401
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,368
It's true the family received threats
and we were cognizant of that.

402
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,005
But you are
seriously suggesting

403
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:39,513
that some kind of Venezuelan
hit squad assassinated

404
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:41,364
a student at Hanover Prep?

405
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:42,483
Like the doctor said,

406
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,681
it's a simple case
of a depressed boy

407
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:47,542
ending his life,
not a Tom Clancy novel.

408
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,730
Yeah, we'll start with Nestor's
roommate tomorrow morning.

409
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,561
It's your investigation.

410
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:08,551
Hey.

411
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:11,181
I'll say this
she's tall.

412
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,348
Dr. Temperance Brennan,
meet Sid, the owner.

413
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:15,814
Hey, bone lady.

414
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,756
The sign says "Wong Foo's."

415
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,005
I'll get your meal.

416
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:23,090
But we didn't order.

417
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,349
No, Sid knows what people want
better than they do.

418
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,940
Nestor's bones are completely
normal, not brittle in any way.

419
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,545
You know, this is kind of my
little getaway place, you know?

420
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,726
The grooves the rope left
in the branch

421
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:36,052
when Nestor was hanging
are too deep for his weight.

422
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:38,088
Please, everyone,
come on, sit down.

423
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,929
Eggs, larvae, waste--
all indicate

424
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,255
that the insects which fed on the body
are indigenous

425
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:46,355
Which means he died there
aproximately ten to 14 days ago.

426
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:48,126
I'll have the seven-organ soup.

427
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,754
You don't order.
The guy just brings it.

428
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:50,614
He didn't void.

429
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,962
Usually somebody that hangs
themselves, the flood gates open.

430
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:54,395
Bodily fluids everywhere.

431
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,162
There was plenty of effluent
in his clothes,

432
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:57,559
but they're all
post-decomposition.

433
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,257
As the body swells,
it bursts from internal gases.

434
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,233
How's guy the ow
what you want?

435
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:01,848
The guy has a knack.

436
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,182
The guy's name is Sid.

437
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,988
It was birds
who ate his eyes, ears,

438
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,816
and worked their way
into the skull.

439
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,542
Birds pecking at the soft tissue
at the throat--

440
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,499
could that crack the hyoid?

441
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:10,797
No, it's a stress fracture

442
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,307
caused by the rope against
his throat-- not postmortem.

443
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,920
You put a sensitive adolescent
in a high-pressure prep school,

444
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,157
add social alienation,
cultural differences,

445
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:21,941
pressure from high-achieving
parents, it could be suicide.

446
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,496
It's not a suicide.

447
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:26,526
Because Booth thinks that
prep schools turnout entitled criminals.

448
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:27,755
We all went to private school.

449
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:28,915
none of us are criminals.

450
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,162
In fact, we fight criminals.

451
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,495
We're crime fighters.

452
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:34,930
No, You´re...I'm just saying
it's not a suicide.

453
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,864
I'm a big believer in instinct.

454
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:40,663
Finally, a squint
with an open mind.

455
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:43,527
You have no idea
how open-minded I can be.

456
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:45,737
What's with these pictures?

457
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:48,504
This is a restaurant.
People come here to eat.

458
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,724
Wat's the matter
with you people?

459
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,092
Booth, what the hell did you
bring in my place?

460
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,142
I had nothing to do with this

461
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:56,047
This is exactly what I wanted.

462
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,503
This is amazing.
The guy definitely has a knack.

463
00:18:59,103 --> 00:18:59,921
Ooh.

464
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:02,475
So you do take orders.

465
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,030
course we do.

466
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,113
But it's always better
when you leave it to me.

467
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:06,623
Booth.

468
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,667
All right, I'll take care of it.

469
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,622
You're saying the boy died
ten to 14 days ago?

470
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:12,455
Hey, bugs buzz,
but they do not lie.

471
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:14,222
Hodgins is very good
at using insects

472
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,703
to ascertain the time of death.

473
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,155
How do you explain an e-mail
that was

474
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,589
sent seven days ago
from Nova Scotia?

475
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,225
See? Look at that.

476
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:23,340
It stinks.

477
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:24,783
Go ahead: smell it.

478
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:27,150
You know you want
to smell it. It stinks.

479
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:28,292
Don't, don't
smell that.

480
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,218
No, no, you've got to taste it.

481
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,450
- I can smell it from here.
-Ang, it's so good. Mm.oo

482
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,597
That's really gross.

483
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,483
You and Nestor were roommates
for three months, correct?

484
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,919
Yes, sir.

485
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,701
And you invited him to spend
the vacation with you?

486
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,200
We have a summer home
on Cape Breton, plenty of room.

487
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,196
Then Nestor decided to go
back home to Venezuela.

488
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,058
What did the other kids
say about Nestor?

489
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,848
Nestor was different.

490
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:51,903
He used to be deaf,
so he kind of talked like...

491
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:54,402
Some kids called him "retard."

492
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,794
Tucker, please
don't say "retard."

493
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,700
I never called him that.

494
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:00,665
He went to church every Sunday,
even though nobody made him go.

495
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:02,591
People thought that was weird.

496
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:03,639
Did Nestor have a girlfriend?

497
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,040
He said there was a girl he liked,

498
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,050
but he never told me who.

499
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,983
You know, Tucker, you're lying
to a federal agent.

500
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:12,080
Careful, Agent Booth.

501
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,803
An e-mail was sent
to Nestor's parents

502
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:16,247
from Nova Scotia saying what
a great time he was having.

503
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,571
The only thing is that Nestor
was already dead.

504
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:21,731
Was it you, Tucker?

505
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:22,914
I'd prefer he didn't answer.

506
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:25,814
No, Dawn, if it was Tucker,
he has to admit it.

507
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:28,686
You know the dodge.

508
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,482
You backed him up
so he could be with a girl?

509
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,164
Tucker!

510
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,530
I know, I m sorry,
but he begged me.

511
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:35,376
What girl?

512
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:36,620
I told you I don't know.

513
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,741
I thought Nestor made her up.

514
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,572
I sent an e-mail. That's all.

515
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,758
Dr Brennan,
can you spare a moment

516
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,459
for the Venezuelan
ambassador?

517
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,046
Thank you.

518
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:57,792
Is there something
I can do for you?

519
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:01,825
I understand that you are very
good at your job, Dr. Brennan.

520
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:06,308
But I think that you are
not a mother, correct?

521
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:07,904
No, I'm not a mother.

522
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,151
Please, watch this.

523
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:19,109
All a mother wants to know
is that

524
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,378
she has raised
her child well.

525
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,077
That he will grow up
to be a good man.

526
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:27,847
I will never see this.

527
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,414
I will never know.

528
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:36,610
The day Nestor received
his implant...

529
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,622
Nestor?

530
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:42,819
The first day
that he could hear...

531
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,086
And the first thing he heard
was my voice.

532
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:50,318
His mother's voice.

533
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,466
I told him I loved him.

534
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:02,248
The child who has lived
through this miracle

535
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:04,398
would never take
his own life.

536
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,922
You're a scientist.

537
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:10,951
You need more than a mother's
reassurance, fine.

538
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,558
My husband and I have
many enemies.

539
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,660
That is why I sent Nestor
to Hanover.

540
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:20,200
They promised us
that he would be safe.

541
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,053
What if they failed?

542
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:23,628
They would not want to admit it.

543
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:25,487
They would do everything
they could

544
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,395
to buy as you towards suicide.

545
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,905
I promise you
I will find out the truth.

546
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:35,560
Thank you.

547
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,366
Swan dive,

548
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,555
cannonball, cherry bomb--

549
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:53,560
no matter how he jumps,
The hyoid does not break.

550
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,301
What about added weight?

551
00:22:56,226 --> 00:23:00,345
We figure an adde strain of 90 kilos
to snap the hyoid.

552
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,612
90 kilos is just
under 200 pounds--

553
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:03,940
the weight
of a muscular man.

554
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,940
What? The Venezuelan hit-squad
fantasy thing?

555
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:07,230
For one thing, it's nuts.

556
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,863
And another, your guy would have
to be about 20 feet tall.

557
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:14,690
I'm out of alternative scenarios
to explain this hyoid break.

558
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,047
I want to take another look
at Nestor's room.

559
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:28,337
What exactly
do you hope to find?

560
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,056
Stay here.

561
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:35,818
Yeah, right,
that's gonna happen.

562
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,208
You all right?

563
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:54,620
Are you?

564
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,747
Check his ID.

565
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,266
His name's Tovar Comara.

566
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,266
He's security
at the Venezuelan Embassy.

567
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,830
If he is security,
why'd he run?

568
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,992
What we would like to know

569
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:18,854
is what Señor Comara was
doing in Nestor's room.

570
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:21,586
I asked Señor Comara to go to
Nestor's room to prove a point.

571
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,034
That suicide was not
the only possibility.

572
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,467
To prove that an outsider
can get to your son?

573
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,040
The school informed me
that Nestor's death

574
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,133
was most certainly suicide.

575
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,442
That anything else
was impossible.

576
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,075
We proved them correct.

577
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:37,405
I failed to escape
without being detected.

578
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:39,480
The school lied
to you, Ambassador.

579
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,948
Dr. Brennan already declared
your son's death a homicide.

580
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,608
I apologize.
I was misinformed.

581
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:48,513
- I won't be pressing any charges.
- Thank you.

582
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,164
Please excuse me.

583
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:03,036
Do you think Nestor was killed
by outsiders?

584
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:04,994
Not Venezuelan insurgents.

585
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:09,209
They would make a statement,
not fake a suicide.

586
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,742
This hanging...

587
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:13,114
<i>Huele malo.</i>

588
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Sure, you know,
someone says, you know,

589
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,101
it smells in a
Spanacceish ,

590
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,364
and all of a sudden you're,
like, "Hmm, interesting."

591
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,292
What are we looking for?

592
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:30,991
Talked to Nestor's teachers,

593
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:32,825
the few students that
he hung out with.

594
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:34,148
He was a loner.

595
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:37,325
Well, I mean,
he went to his classes, but,

596
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:40,545
you know, mainly
he just stayed here in his room.

597
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:43,945
That's it, so I figured,
you know, we'd come here,

598
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:47,232
and you, uh, do your little
anthropologist thing, huh?

599
00:25:47,232 --> 00:25:50,745
Okay.

600
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,759
He liked music.

601
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,946
Heavy percussion, low
frequencies for the most part.

602
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:00,700
The stuff he probably liked
before the implant.

603
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,573
He could feel the vibrations
in his chest.

604
00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:04,980
After the implant,
he started...

605
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:07,135
enjoying stuff with more melody.

606
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,402
He was... growing.

607
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,617
He enjoyed it.

608
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,440
Enjoyment is the opposite
of suicide.

609
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:15,467
You've decided this
isn't a suicide,

610
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,841
so you're collecting
evidence to support that.

611
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,401
By closing your mind, you're
missing important indicators.

612
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,109
Oh, yeah? So then why'd he
throw this away?

613
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,008
I mean, it's flute music.
That's reason enough.

614
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,248
But where's the case?

615
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,903
These aren't organized.

616
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,137
Well, you know, girls,
they organize alphabetically.

617
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,230
Guys are more organic--
you know, good stuff

618
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:41,799
up to the left; crap...

619
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:45,596
bottom right.

620
00:26:46,462 --> 00:26:49,596
Look at that.

621
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:52,862
Well, I mean,

622
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,557
if he hated it,
why'd he reburn it?

623
00:26:56,771 --> 00:26:58,364
This isn't a CD.

624
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:01,438
It's a DVD.

625
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:02,915
I should've known.

626
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,032
It's a 15-year-old boy.

627
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:06,335
- It's just porn.
- Wait.

628
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:16,069
- That's our hanging victim.
- This is pretty kinky stuff.

629
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,389
I need to know where and when it
was shot, what kind of camera,

630
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:20,523
anything else that might help.
I'm gonna need stills

631
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,123
and a close-up
of the girl's face.

632
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:24,902
Thanks a lot, Booth.

633
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:27,073
My seven-organ soup
is repeating on me.

634
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:28,806
Well, you ordered it.
You should have left it to Sid.

635
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:32,752
Let's see what the school
has to say about this.

636
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,048
That was not wild
and kinky sex.

637
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:38,227
It was very, very
basic beginner stuff.

638
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,954
Just so you know.

639
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,080
Angela, you got
any bicarbonate?

640
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,192
We've seen this kind
of thing before.

641
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,308
Kids recording themselves
having sex?

642
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,433
Young people are more jaded than
they used to be.

643
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,266
Sometimes they'd swap
these tapes.

644
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,699
Surprised to see Nestor.

645
00:27:58,699 --> 00:27:59,906
But not so surprised
to see the girl?

646
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:01,774
How is that relevant?

647
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,973
You know what's
a better question?

648
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:05,898
What makes you think you get
to decide what's relevant?

649
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,655
:D of a high school.

650
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,532
We need to see all of the
sex tapes you've confiscated.

651
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:11,797
Absolutely not.

652
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:14,209
Well, I'll just get
a warrant,

653
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,248
and in the application
for a warrant,

654
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:18,404
I'll include your admission
that you allow your students

655
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:20,137
to swap homemade sex tapes.

656
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,913
The headmaster is not refusing
to provide you with the tapes.

657
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:25,407
"Absolutely not"
sounds like a refusal.

658
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,474
When we confiscate the tapes

659
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,874
we immediately turn them over
to local law enforcement.

660
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,211
Sheriff Roach knew about this?

661
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,073
No need to issue a warrant;
we're cooperating completely.

662
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:35,599
Was the girl also
a student here?

663
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,928
Given your hostility,

664
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:39,062
it's time we bring in
a lawyer to advise us.

665
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:40,363
Or you take my advice.

666
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:42,392
If you don't answer
my questions,

667
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:45,404
I'll take you down to FBI
Headquarters in handcuffs.

668
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,720
He'll do it.
He doesn't like you.

669
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,644
Fine Agent Booth,
Her name is Caen Destry.

670
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,884
Nestor Olivos?

671
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,001
I knew him.

672
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,318
He's kind of famous
since he died.

673
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:03,165
Poor kid.
To take his own life.

674
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,292
Were you romantically
involved?

675
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,079
No.

676
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:10,291
Camden is to young
to date seriously.

677
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:11,421
Too yong?

678
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:17,031
Tell me when you've seen
enough to start telling the truth.

679
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:23,330
Oh my God!

680
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:28,211
I can't believe this.

681
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:30,928
Oh, my God!
Where did that come from?

682
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:32,168
Really, Mr. Booth,
I must protest.

683
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:36,201
I'm tired of being lied to,
so excuse me if I'm indelicate.

684
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,756
Let's start over, shall we?

685
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,007
Did you know Nestor Olivos?

686
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:46,299
Were y romantically involved?

687
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:49,624
Why would he do that?
Why would Nestor tape us?

688
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,395
I loved him.

689
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:03,072
So let me just
get this right:

690
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:05,416
- I'm the tactless and insensitive one?
- Okay, the girl lied

691
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,383
to a federal agent
during the investigation

692
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,200
of the death of a boy
that she said she loves.

693
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,300
You know what?
These kids, they all lie.

694
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,615
That school they teaches
that they're special.

695
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,408
That they're above the rest of us;
well, they're not.

696
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:17,639
You´re the least objective
person I've ever met.

697
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,641
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.

698
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:21,699
Aw, come on, Bones, you know something's
wrong here, right?

699
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:23,841
The school, the tapes,
now sheriff Roach.

700
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,541
All this mess you're uncovering,
it smells, yes,

701
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,952
but it doesn't add up to murder,
not logically.

702
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,586
Maybe if you look
for more than the facts...

703
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:33,386
Maybe if you opened your mind,
we could find out the actual truth.

704
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:35,141
Brought you the tapes.

705
00:30:36,497 --> 00:30:37,102
How many?

706
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:38,394
All of them.

707
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:40,244
What do you think,
I'm with holding evidence?

708
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:42,861
I'm thinking Hanover Prep
gets you elected,

709
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:44,754
and you look the other way
when you see these tapes.

710
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:47,088
Kids having sex?
There's no law against that.

711
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:50,067
Let's hope that's
the worst thing that we find.

712
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,383
You were right about the school

713
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,252
serving pudding.

714
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:03,870
<i>Stirrin the pudding.</i>

715
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,115
It means...

716
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:06,701
Melodee Destry.

717
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,868
That's... that's
Camden's mother.

718
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:12,714
Is that... is that
Nestor Olivos she's with?

719
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:14,516
Nope.

720
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,220
That's Nestor's roommate,

721
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:19,032
Tucker Padison.

722
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,734
How long did the sexual
relationship cotinue?

723
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:28,717
A couple of months.
I don't know.

724
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:29,752
Tucker is the underage

725
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,297
victim of statutory rape.

726
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:31,909
When did it end?

727
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:32,947
That was the last time.

728
00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:34,229
Why Nestor's bed?
Why not your own?

729
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:35,146
It was only
ten feet away.

730
00:31:35,146 --> 00:31:36,084
- I don't know.
- It was because

731
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:37,650
you knew exactly
where the camera was pointed.

732
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:40,728
Mrs. Destry gave me money,
you know, to keep quiet

733
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:42,618
Nestor said, "How much
do you think she'd pay

734
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,859
to keep her husband
from seeing a tape?"

735
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,850
Nestor set up a drop
and got $5,000.

736
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,804
He said we should do it again
but, just before vacation,

737
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,380
I told him that I was going
to tell my parents,

738
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:53,859
even if it meant
getting kicked out of Hanover.

739
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:58,104
The next thing I know...
he killed himself.

740
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:00,628
I figure it was my fault.

741
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,906
Tabanid pupal casings
show the boy ingested

742
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,800
a heavy dose of ketamine
before he died.

743
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,017
Kids call it
"Special K."

744
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:13,762
So somebody dosed him, right? That explains why
he wasn't struggling during the hanging.

745
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:15,309
Or-- a wild thought--

746
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,714
he took it himself for fun
like most kids do.

747
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:19,909
I had sex with Naomi
in Paleontology.

748
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:21,909
You mean actually
in Paleontology?

749
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:22,910
No, at her place.

750
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,660
I thought it went great,
but I could be wrong.

751
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,479
Because, apparently,
what I think

752
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,759
is wild and kinky
is just basic.

753
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,259
And, since she
never called me back,

754
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:30,872
I'm wondering
if it's because

755
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:32,352
I lack imagination
in the sack.

756
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,047
You know what, Zack?

757
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,829
I'm thinking this is more of
a guy-guy conversation.

758
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,004
Yeah.
I was wondering.

759
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:43,127
Dude, minty burp
is still a burp.

760
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,961
Yeah, well, who took me
to Wong Salmonella's?

761
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:45,917
All right,
you know what?

762
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,961
Just go back to Sid.

763
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:49,513
Let him bring you your meal,

764
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:50,938
the heartburn will disappear.

765
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,536
Heartburn?

766
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:54,068
What?

767
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:58,085
Hodgins has heartburn because stomach acid
is rising into his esophagus.

768
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:59,510
The ketamine, plus choking,

769
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,921
could have caused Nestor
to regurgitate.

770
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,723
The rope would hold the gastric
juices in the upper throat,

771
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:04,459
weakening the hyoid.

772
00:33:05,514 --> 00:33:07,787
Digestive juices
are basically hydrochloric acid.

773
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,911
Sometime, when you're not busy,
I wonder if I could ask a few questions

774
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,246
about sexual positions.

775
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:14,289
If you even try,
I'll take out my gun

776
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:15,714
and shoot you
between the eyes.

777
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,773
These marks here and here--

778
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:19,549
that's scoring consistent
with hydrochloric acid.

779
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:20,755
I don't like where
you're going with this.

780
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,850
We need to run a few scenarios
through the Angelator.

781
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,124
Replace the values
for the hyoid bone mass

782
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:26,484
with theseliding soefficients.

783
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,794
That will replicate
bone deterioration

784
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:31,187
as the hyoid is being digested
by stomach acid.

785
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,181
I'm applying a timeline
and running it fast forward.

786
00:33:34,928 --> 00:33:36,731
This will show it
in measured time.

787
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:39,279
The body decomposes,
and the gastric juices,

788
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,162
trapped by the noose
and Nestor's esophagus,

789
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:43,352
actually digest
the hyoid over time.

790
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:45,335
Wait. There.

791
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:46,972
The hyoid cracked.

792
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,244
196.3 hours.

793
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,935
Just over eight days.

794
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,689
The finding is congrue
with suicide.

795
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,530
I do not accept that.

796
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,608
It's a fact.

797
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,332
I have to amend my
"Cause of Death" report.

798
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,823
Then you'll stop
my investigation.

799
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,652
The school's trying
to cover up a murder,

800
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:04,749
and you're helping them.

801
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,403
Honey?

802
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:22,738
Did you ever just
believe something?

803
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:26,731
Despite the evidence,
just know it was true?

804
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,607
No.

805
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:31,105
I've hoped things.

806
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:34,130
I've always known the difference
hope and fact.

807
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,234
All that's left of this boy
is a tableful of bones.

808
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:42,652
Now everyone he's ever known
has an agenda:

809
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:45,270
his parents, his school, even
the cop investigating his death.

810
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,015
You know, I'm the only one
who cares about the truth

811
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:51,458
of what Nestor's life came to
in the end, good or bad.

812
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:54,652
And I know the truth is more
important than anything else.

813
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:59,470
You know, or you hope it's true?

814
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:06,467
Suicide is the most rational,
logical explanation.

815
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,401
What I believe doesn't matter.

816
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:11,178
What makes me sad
don't matter.

817
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,661
Look at this face.

818
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,582
He did not
kill himself.

819
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,718
Angela, I need a little more
proof than a nice drawing.

820
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:27,743
I can do that.

821
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,651
Okay, this is not from the DVD.

822
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,551
It's a quick snippet that
was on Nestor's hardve. dri

823
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:49,332
Somebody tried to erase it, but
Zack and I got some of it back.

824
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,046
Angela, zoom in
on that necklace.

825
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:01,818
A little sea horse?

826
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:04,898
Come on. What kind
of blackmailer does that?

827
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,303
It's sweet.

828
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,061
It's a clueless
kid in love.

829
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,251
That's your evidence that he didn't
commit suicide?

830
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,181
A sea horse?

831
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:12,184
The kid doesn't give a gift

832
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:14,251
because, you know, he's in love.

833
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,868
He does it 'cause he wants
little loving.

834
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:17,533
Rerun that.

835
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,749
That cynicism you affect, Booth?

836
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:22,491
It's your way of hiding
a deeply romantic nature.

837
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:25,025
There. Stop. Play again.

838
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:29,029
- There. She rolled her eyes for the camera.
- What?

839
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:30,827
No, I didn't see it either.

840
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:32,221
Play it stop motion.

841
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:35,018
Zoom in. There.

842
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,086
Slow motion.

843
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:46,327
How did you see that?

844
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,571
Wait. That girl knew
the camera was there.

845
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:49,583
She looked right at it.

846
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,506
Camden isn't a victim.
She's in on it.

847
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:52,550
You don't roll your eyes
to yourself.

848
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,417
You do that for someone else,
not Nestor Olivos.

849
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,283
What do we do now?

850
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:59,989
This is where a public school
education comes in handly .

851
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,342
Divide
and conquer.

852
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:02,714
It was the
playground motto.

853
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,341
Would you help me, Camden,

854
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:06,385
is if you told me
why Nestor killed himself.

855
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,595
Then we can close the murder investigation.

856
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:10,949
Why is Tucker here?

857
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:13,144
Oh, Tucker--
he said some things.

858
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,334
What things?

859
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:17,073
Well, what Tucker told us
doesn't make you look good.

860
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:19,047
I believe him,
but Agent Booth says

861
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:20,759
it was only fair
to hear your side.

862
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:23,482
If your stories match up,
I'll be able to drop the murder investigation.

863
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:28,516
You know,
I find it hard to believe

864
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:30,278
that it was your idea for Tucker

865
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:31,286
to seduce
your mother.

866
00:37:31,307 --> 00:37:33,156
It wasn't.
She hit on Tucker.

867
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:35,421
No, wait, wait.
Can they do this?

868
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,844
They're fishing.
Don't say a word.

869
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:38,408
I wasn't fishing. Were you fishing?
No, I wasn't fishing.

870
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:40,360
Tucker was all Stacy´s mom about it.

871
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,308
I just sort of
gave him permission.

872
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:44,732
It was funny.

873
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:45,738
Please stop this.
Stop it.

874
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:47,253
Mom, deal with it, okay?

875
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,908
You're the one
that's the perv,

876
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:49,486
so...

877
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:54,245
When my mom gave Tucker money
to keep him quiet,

878
00:37:54,245 --> 00:37:56,372
we got the idea to blackmail her
with the tape.

879
00:37:57,189 --> 00:37:58,715
I was mad at her, I guess.

880
00:37:59,979 --> 00:38:01,325
And Tucker said it was my turn.

881
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,564
Nestor was rich,
lonely, Catholic,

882
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:05,270
and he had a thing for you.

883
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,052
And he was cute.

884
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:08,946
People didn't notice
because of the way he talked,

885
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:10,938
but he was really cute.

886
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:12,342
I liked him.

887
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:17,239
We made the tape
and showed it to Nestor.

888
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:19,292
It made him really upset.

889
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,074
Really upset.

890
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:23,807
Because you threatened
to show it to his mother?

891
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:25,346
Or because it broke his heart.

892
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,065
I still can't believe
he killed himself.

893
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:30,380
I'm really sorry he did that.

894
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,194
What Camden did

895
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:32,787
was wrong, which
she's acknowledged,

896
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:34,551
but she can't be
held responsible

897
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,684
for an unstable
boy's overreaction.

898
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:38,580
I said I'm sorry.

899
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,019
Yeah. Camden Destry,
I'm place you under arrest

900
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,121
for the murder
of Nestor Olivos

901
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:43,947
She's adtted
to blackmail

902
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,410
and attempted blackmail.
That's all.

903
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,985
Nestor was going to go to
the headmaster expose you

904
00:38:47,985 --> 00:38:51,003
so you dosed him with kademine
and hauled him up into the tree.

905
00:38:52,382 --> 00:38:54,346
The DNA traces in the rope
will prove that.

906
00:38:54,346 --> 00:38:55,981
Plus, you've already
confessed to the motive.

907
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:01,163
If I cooperate, and tell you
everything Tucker did,

908
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:02,658
do I get some sort of deal?

909
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,636
That depends on
what else you got.

910
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,267
The headmaster
and thad of security

911
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,660
will both lose their jobs
over what happened to Nestor.

912
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:17,080
The sheriff will resign.

913
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:20,691
The two kids who killed your son
are both in custody.

914
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,340
Thank you.

915
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:27,353
We're very sorry for your loss.

916
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,413
Ambassador Olivos?

917
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,994
You told me that
all a mother wants

918
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:42,192
is to know that
she's raised her child well.

919
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,133
That your biggest
regret is that

920
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,847
you'll never know
if Nestor would have grown up

921
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:47,894
to be a good man.

922
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,840
But he was a good man.

923
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:53,623
He died because

924
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:55,093
he was trying
to do the right thing.

925
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,747
Very impressive, Temperance.

926
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:09,273
You got that one right.

927
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:19,911
When you're with someone,

928
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,049
the gymnastics
aren't what matter.

929
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:23,408
It's who you are.

930
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:24,995
It's in your intentions,

931
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:26,583
and in how much you care
about the other person.

932
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:27,859
you don't want
to help me, just say so.

933
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,902
All right. I'm going
to l you let on a secret.

934
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:34,313
This is
a female secret.

935
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:39,445
Go to Naomi and tell her
that you don't know anything

936
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:42,182
about lovemaking. Sex, yeah.

937
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,027
Lovemaking, you're
a blank slate.

938
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,253
You'll do
anything she wants

939
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:50,415
if she just introduces you
to the secrets of love.

940
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:52,104
She'll be more interested
in that

941
00:40:52,104 --> 00:40:54,960
than if you were the most
imaginative lover on the planet.

942
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,981
That is totally
counterintuitive.

943
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:58,501
Just do it, Z-Man.

944
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:00,853
Reap theenefits
of my sexual wisdom.

945
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,096
Oh, no.
This i't going to work.

946
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:08,738
I mean, this is my place.

947
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:11,085
Sid?
As long as they
keep it down

948
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:12,528
on the subject
of rotten corpses

949
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:14,172
and bodily fluids,
I have no beef at all.

950
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,161
Okay, that is amazing.

951
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,431
I... I had heartburn.

952
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,966
I asked Sid
to bring me something,

953
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:20,180
and now the
heartburn's gone.

954
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,225
I mean, it's gone.

955
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:22,676
Man, I love this place.

956
00:41:22,676 --> 00:41:24,621
Okay, fine.
New rules.

957
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:27,107
That counter is mine.

958
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:28,543
That booth is yours.

959
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:30,004
Everything else
around here--

960
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:32,511
right?-- mine. Right?

961
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:35,253
Mine. M-I-N-E. Mine.

962
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:50,135
I've been thinking
about your whole

963
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,791
"something stinks"
aptitude.

964
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,601
Oh, yeah?

965
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,803
I think you have
a subconscious knack

966
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:58,000
for reading body language.

967
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,142
Stress in the voice, other subtle yet
discernible indicators.

968
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:03,204
It's not mysterious,
but it is impressive.

969
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:05,854
And, in the future,
I will try to accord it

970
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:07,472
an appropriate degree of objective worth.

971
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:09,755
Thank you, Temperance.
I appreciate that.

972
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,774
So, uh...

973
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:15,415
what part of
"This is mine"

974
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,964
did you not
understand?

975
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,468
Do I have to say it in Latin?

976
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:31,251
<i>Absit invidia.</i>

977
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,207
Thanks!
