1
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:11,026
- You should have worn the gumboots.
- I'm fine! You know, I'm...

2
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:12,428
I'm agile...

3
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:17,012
So, Hodgins asked
Angela to marry him.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,312
Twice.

5
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:22,187
Oh, and she turned him down? Both times?

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,770
I heard all this from Angela.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,930
Yeah, but did she tell you
that he said that he was...

8
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:28,036
he wasn't gonna ask
her to marry him?

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,045
- Yes.
- And she said...

10
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:32,932
"I'd like to marry you. "

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,164
Kind of sudden, Bones.
Let me think about it.

12
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:38,464
What? No, Booth, that's
what Angela told Hodgins.

13
00:00:40,347 --> 00:00:41,239
You're joking.

14
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,089
You know, a lot of
psychologists say that jokes

15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,883
are the way we manifest
our hidden desires.

16
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,128
Yeah...

17
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:48,498
Geez!

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,692
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,049
What do we got?

20
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,075
During a foot pursuit last
night, suspect tosses a knife

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,715
into this muck in an effort
to avoid incarceration.

22
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,927
The effluent gets drained,
we start finding stuff.

23
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,335
Define "stuff. "

24
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,669
Stuff... cell phones,

25
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:05,792
guns, knives, crack vials.

26
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:08,942
Evidently, you want to lose something
in this vicinity, you toss it in here.

27
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:11,370
The miscreants probably think
it's some sort of bottomless pit.

28
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,994
Does the word "concise"
mean anything to you?

29
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:15,789
Well, we found that.

30
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:16,997
Concise enough?

31
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,654
Small.

32
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,715
Is it a kid?

33
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:30,334
Female.

34
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:34,709
Pelvic girdle and skull
sutures suggest preadolescent.

35
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,885
- A child's pencil case.
- How long has she been dead?

36
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,863
Does this freeze over in the winter?

37
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:44,295
Yeah. Solid.

38
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:47,293
It's possible she was placed
here as long ago as last fall.

39
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,047
Cause of death?

40
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,545
It looks like a gunshot
wound to the back of the head.

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,243
- Can you guess the caliber?
- Nothing larger than a 22.

42
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,032
- Find any 22s?
- Two.

43
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,607
All right, let's get an FBI forensic team
down here and search for bullet fragments.

44
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:01,463
I'll go call it in right now.

45
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:11,004
"I love you."

46
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:16,285
You said that pedophiles can delude themselves
into thinking they love their victims.

47
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:23,705
A nice traditional church
service. Very ecumenical.

48
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:24,995
That's great.

49
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:27,494
As long as the reception
makes Caligula blush.

50
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:29,570
Let's hope he got his invitation.

51
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,740
- Hey, what are those?
- They were found in this case.

52
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:35,588
Probably belonged to the victim.

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,039
And these are water samples
teeming with organisms.

54
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:40,960
I found an inordinately large
number of dead fairy shrimp

55
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,634
in the mud beneath the remains.

56
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,139
I will not make a "clap
for Tinkerbell" joke.

57
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,016
How about we not discuss child murder

58
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,233
and our upcoming nuptials
in the same conversation.

59
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,705
That's a good idea.

60
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:59,764
Hey, do you want me
to... change my name?

61
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,566
Do you want me to want
you to change your name?

62
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,482
Do you know what you're looking at?

63
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,389
The neck bone.

64
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,345
That's... connected
to the shoulder bone.

65
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:28,055
There's arthritic lipping here
and here, on the posterior dens.

66
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,723
Arthritis? For this
to occur she had to...

67
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,233
she had to look up like this.

68
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,705
- Maybe she prayed a lot.
- Four to six hour a day?

69
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,477
What did she want so badly?

70
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:39,931
Her father?

71
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,142
Hey, baby.

72
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,092
Dad.

73
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:45,078
Booth.

74
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,972
- Put your hands up.
- Booth!

75
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:50,022
I was hoping that we could get a
drink or something before this part.

76
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,908
Max Keenan, you're under
arrest as an escaped felon.

77
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,562
Oh, okay, so I guess that's
"no" on the drink, huh?

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,037
Bones, grab the cuffs out
of my back pocket there.

79
00:03:58,224 --> 00:03:59,749
- No.
- What do you mean no? Bones...

80
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:02,371
It's okay, baby. I don't want
to handcuff my own father.

81
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,943
Plus, remember when he saved your life?

82
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,808
Hey, just throw them over
here. I'll do it myself.

83
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,353
He's telling me what to do.
Put your hands on the wall.

84
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,450
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I heard you were getting married.

85
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:13,874
What? No.

86
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:16,825
Angela's getting married
to Hodgins, not me.

87
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,555
Oh, the bug guy.

88
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,983
- Well, that's great.
- Will you shut up, please?

89
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,599
long enough for me to mirandize him.

90
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:26,440
You got the right to
remain silent. Got it.

91
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,962
- We'll talk more later.
- Look, I'm sorry, Bones,

92
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:31,980
but he killed the Deputy Director
of the FBI. I'm just doing my job.

93
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,059
It's okay.

94
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:36,402
He's right.

95
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,672
Kisses, baby.

96
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:45,250
Uh, sweetie... was that your dad?

"Stargazer in a Puddle"</b></i>

101
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,877
What do you mean that's not Max Keenan?

102
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:26,771
Cherie, you know that's Max Keenan,
and I know that's Max Keenan,

103
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:30,132
but to the rest of the world, that
man is a hardworking electrician

104
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:32,171
from Coos Bay, Oregon,
named Art McGregor.

105
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,777
That electrician was a bank robber for
15 years and murdered two FBI agents.

106
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,358
Only one was still an agent
at the time of his demise.

107
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,189
The guy was Deputy Director!

108
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,525
And a crooked, murdering son of a
bitch, not to speak ill of the dead.

109
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,191
Driver's license, credit
cards, tax returns...

110
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,762
And this library card
was issued 11 years ago.

111
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,525
- A complete history?
- Yes.

112
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,777
We'll keep digging, but
Cherie, I don't know.

113
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,361
I gotta cut that guy loose?

114
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:03,828
Legally speaking, that man is a law-abiding,
tax-paying, fully certified, dues-paying member

115
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,877
-  of the international brotherhood of...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

116
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,352
since 1984.

117
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:17,492
Tell me something, Max, on a job site,

118
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:21,621
what's the most hazardous
classification for an electrician?

119
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,776
Class 1, Division 1. You
planning a career change?

120
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,545
Ah, you're checking out my prints.

121
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,747
Max, you know I like you
and I hate to hurt Bones, but

122
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:33,621
it's my job to catch you.

123
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,987
And I'm very good at my job.

124
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:39,445
You'd have to be to work with
my daughter. What do you say?

125
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,043
Shake hands with an old con.

126
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:44,424
Or is that bad for the FBI image?

127
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,509
You abandoned her as a child.

128
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:48,864
You don't think she feels that,

129
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,630
every time you pop in
and out of her life?

130
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,011
You're just saying that so I'll hit you.

131
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,087
Then you got a reason to lock me up.

132
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,970
20 years ago...

133
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:07,134
that would have worked.

134
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:14,404
Your estimate was correct. This hole
is consistent with a 22 caliber slug.

135
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,888
I learned "slug" from Cam. It's a...

136
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,902
colloquialism for projectile.

137
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,703
Which so far the FBI
has been unable to find.

138
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:25,888
Okay, I have a face, but
you are not going to like it.

139
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,467
That is an old woman.

140
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:38,394
I provided you with the tissue data
for a ten-year-old Caucasian female.

141
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,276
Well, when I actually held
the skull and started...

142
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:43,476
the tissue markers felt wrong.

143
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:48,282
Angela, with all due respect to your
art, facial reconstruction is a science.

144
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,769
It's both, babe, and this time

145
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,244
art made science her bitch.

146
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,109
Hey, moan all you want. I stand by this.

147
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,434
We should recheck for other
indications that we got the age wrong.

148
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,493
Because art made science her bitch?

149
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,780
Because the lipping on the
vertebrae had to have been caused

150
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,337
by looking up over a
period of several years.

151
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,000
That's a scientific
rationale for rechecking.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,440
Hey, Brennan.

153
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:15,326
I'd like to ask you a favor.

154
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,845
Well, it's not so much ask a
favor as, as extend an honor.

155
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,153
I mean, I hope you
see it as an honor and

156
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:23,023
don't think of it as some onerous duty,

157
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,326
which I don't think you will, but then
again I've never done this before...

158
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:27,179
Angela... just ask.

159
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,191
Will you be my maid of honor?

160
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:31,487
At the wedding?

161
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:38,074
- Is that yes?
- I am...

162
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,695
- completely, totally honored.
- Really?

163
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:43,557
- I thought I'd have to tell you...
- I don't even care

164
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:46,100
how awful the bridesmaid
dresses are. I'm...

165
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,255
so glad you asked me.

166
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:53,977
I have your brother set up in a
little auto supply place. It's a...

167
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:56,364
shade-tree mechanic situation.

168
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,499
You set him up where? Oregon?

169
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:01,502
It's better that you
don't know. He's, uh,

170
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,074
- in violation of his parole.
- Because you made him leave the state.

171
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,945
Your brother is on a slippery slope

172
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,511
and... yeah, I know,
I know, the irony of me

173
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:15,036
being a good influence,
but it's true, I am.

174
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:17,015
It's nice to see you smile.

175
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,575
That's, that's something.

176
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:25,910
Booth is going to find
proof of who you are.

177
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:28,525
- Then he'll arrest you.
- Not tonight.

178
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,426
Did you come here just to
tell me that Russ is okay?

179
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,097
No, actually, I have
something for you that...

180
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:40,959
that belonged to your grandmother.

181
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:45,303
I have a grandmother?

182
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:49,432
I know your mother and I told you that
you didn't have grandparents, but...

183
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,288
Try it on.

184
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:04,021
I... I have to go to bed.

185
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:07,546
There are some inconsistencies
with the remains,

186
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,807
which I have to address
first thing in the morning.

187
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:11,754
Okay.

188
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,525
You're welcome...

189
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,071
to stay here if... you want.

190
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,024
The couch would be great.

191
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,191
No, Dad, I, I made up the guest room

192
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,176
in case you...

193
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:31,701
Good night.

194
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:47,003
His fingerprints don't match?

195
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,100
There's nothing to compare them to.

196
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:52,631
Max Keenan got himself
wiped from the system?

197
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:53,815
That's right.

198
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:55,894
Who is this guy? Some
sort of super-criminal?

199
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:59,659
It must have been Deputy Director
Kirby. Yeah, he wanted Max dead, so...

200
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,597
he made him invisible first.

201
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:03,967
That would be an ironic twist,

202
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:07,275
seeing as how you want to
arrest Max for Kirby's murder.

203
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:14,093
You don't have doubts about
catching this guy, do you? I mean,

204
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,932
- he is your partner's father.
- No.

205
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,023
Bones gets it.

206
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:22,005
You hope she does.

207
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,363
I'll get you a warrant to
collect a DNA sample from the man.

208
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,803
You, find something to compare it to.

209
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:38,495
No wisdom teeth suggests prepubescence.

210
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,917
The lower bone plate and
the radius have not fused.

211
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:43,545
Angela's wrong. The
victim was not yet 20.

212
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,600
What?

213
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,718
The arthritic lipping on the vertebrae,
degeneration in the collarbone,

214
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,331
spiking on the superior
articular process.

215
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:56,398
And all the large bones in her body show
osteolytis and advanced deterioration.

216
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,785
- Meaning Angela was right.
- Meaning you were not wrong,

217
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:02,070
which is not the same as being right.

218
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,407
Progeria...

219
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,451
She had one of the aging diseases.

220
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,029
Anyone want to hear about the hit
my sketch got off the NCIC database?

221
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:14,809
Chelsea Cole... age 22,

222
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:17,319
went missing last November.

223
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,565
Good, Angela.

224
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:21,876
Really good.

225
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:32,174
- Zack?
- I really should've thought of that.

226
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:35,177
A disease which prevents the
sufferer from entering puberty,

227
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:37,476
but simultaneously ages her otherwise.

228
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,663
I'd like to ask you to be
my best man on Saturday.

229
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:42,346
Things aren't always either-or.
Sometimes they're both.

230
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:43,765
At my wedding.

231
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:46,305
Saturday.

232
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,575
To Angela.

233
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,856
My best man.

234
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,100
- When do I have to decide?
- You have to think about it?

235
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,191
Yes.

236
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,100
Fine.

237
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,302
Let me know what you decide.

238
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,510
You found her in a shopping cart?

239
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,153
- Yes.
- From Tuft's Grocery?

240
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,748
How did you know that?

241
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,777
Chelsea loved Tuft's.

242
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:25,144
Give her a dollar and she'd go
down there and buy a candy bar

243
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,044
or some cheap toy.

244
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,393
Everybody knew Chelsea,
walking along with one

245
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:34,355
small thing in a big cart,
bringing it home to show me.

246
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,334
Did Chelsea draw these?

247
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:38,258
Yes.

248
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,601
She's 22 years old. These are
the drawings of a young child.

249
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,522
Chelsea had a...

250
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,525
- condition.
- Werner's syndrome.

251
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:51,112
- How did you know?
- What's that?

252
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:55,754
It's an aging disease in which
mental development can be a factor.

253
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,566
Your daughter spent...

254
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:03,721
a long time looking up. Correct?

255
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:06,534
Chelsea was obsessed with the stars.

256
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:12,475
She thought they were signals
from heaven, showing people...

257
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:13,930
the way home.

258
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:19,859
Mrs. Cole, when Chelsea disappeared,
you gave the police a name?

259
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:21,534
Joe Mellon.

260
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:26,266
He was a caretaker provided by the city while
I was going to classes at community college.

261
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:28,721
One night I came home from class

262
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:33,738
and her hair smelled like
the shampoo I use... lemons.

263
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:37,287
I always use baby shampoo on Chelsea.

264
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,125
That, that wasn't part of
his job... bathing Chelsea?

265
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,815
Definitely not!

266
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,492
I complained to Child
Services, and they...

267
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,609
launched an investigation.

268
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,518
Which ended as soon
as Chelsea disappeared?

269
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:55,055
I guess so.

270
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,782
No victim... no crime.

271
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,469
I absolutely...

272
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,002
did not molest Chelsea Cole.

273
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:09,340
- Why'd Child Services let you go?
- They didn't let me go.

274
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:12,020
They reassigned me because they
knew I didn't do anything wrong.

275
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,149
What did you not do wrong, Joe?

276
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:20,999
Chelsea Cole had the mental
capacity of a six-year-old.

277
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:24,606
She got jam all over her and
freaked out from being sticky.

278
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,375
That's why I ran her a bath.

279
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,483
And I sat outside

280
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:31,510
the bathroom door and made her
talk to me while she was in the tub.

281
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,225
She used her mom's shampoo and
it stung her eyes. She cried.

282
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:39,058
I went in and rinsed
the soap out of her eyes

283
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:41,973
and then I went back out
and let her get dressed,

284
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,870
which is what she told her
mother, who did not listen.

285
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:47,283
Then why is Cynthia Cole so insistent

286
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,770
that you were inappropriate
with her daughter?

287
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,946
I crossed the line, man. I...

288
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:58,782
suggested that Cynthia consider
an alternate solution for Chelsea.

289
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:00,582
What? Like an institution?

290
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:03,398
The woman was exhausted. She,
she was looking like crap.

291
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:07,348
She was failing all of her college
courses. She couldn't hold onto a job.

292
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,538
Everything was going downhill.

293
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,148
Listen, Joe.

294
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:16,673
I want you to look me
in the eye, and tell me

295
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,711
that you never touched that little girl.

296
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,722
I wiped the soap

297
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:23,693
out of her eyes.

298
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,089
And I wrapped a towel around her.

299
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,142
That's it.

300
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:35,936
This ring was passed down from
oldest daughter to oldest daughter.

301
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:38,019
It was a tradition in your
mother's side of the family.

302
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:41,444
You told Russ and me that
we didn't have any relatives.

303
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:46,071
Well, honey, we were underground. We
had new names. We had to tell you that.

304
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:50,722
What's the truth?

305
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,036
Your mother's the
oldest of three sisters,

306
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:55,502
and if you want to seek them out,

307
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:58,705
you show them the ring, they'll know who
you are and accept you into the family.

308
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:00,283
What about on your side?

309
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:04,115
Your mother was the only family
I ever knew. And you and Russ.

310
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,517
You abandoned me for 15 years.

311
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:12,174
And I'll do whatever
I can to make repairs.

312
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:15,397
- While running away from the FBI?
- I have more.

313
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:18,995
A message from your
mother. On videotape.

314
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,884
- Well... what does she say?
- I don't know. It's for you.

315
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:26,039
When you're ready.

316
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,154
I am sorry to interrupt, but
I have a warrant here to...

317
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:38,696
take a DNA sample from you, Mr.
Arthur McGregor from Coos Bay, Oregon.

318
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,171
I'm really sorry.

319
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:51,212
Zack?

320
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:54,071
There's a recalcification
around this hole.

321
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,922
It healed.

322
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,626
Zack, I'm getting married Saturday.

323
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,984
Two short days, man.

324
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:03,365
I need to know if
you'll stand up with me.

325
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:11,441
I don't need a formal response.
A simple "yes" would...

326
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:13,931
Iraq?

327
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,192
You can't go to Iraq.

328
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,626
- The president is asking me personally.
- No.

329
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:26,708
Not personally. The president
has a machine to sign for him.

330
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:31,235
He's probably talking to every forensic
anthropologist in the country. You can't go to Iraq.

331
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:32,332
No.

332
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:37,792
No way. You, you stay here and you be
my best man. You let someone else go.

333
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,049
He's says I'm at the
forefront of my field,

334
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:43,028
- that my country needs me.
- You can't go to Iraq.

335
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:44,295
Zack.

336
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:47,445
Will you be my best man or not?

337
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:48,759
No.

338
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:51,896
- Why?
- Because,

339
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:55,415
if I decide to do what the president
wants, and go to Iraq and get killed,

340
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,178
you won't be able to remember
your wedding with happiness.

341
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:00,228
Okay, big assumption there, buddy.

342
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,231
Rationally speaking, I'm
not good at social ritual.

343
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:04,990
You should ask Booth.

344
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:07,509
Everything isn't rational.

345
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:08,976
It should be.

346
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,935
I no longer believe
this is a bullet hole.

347
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:16,099
I believe this was created by a drill.

348
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:22,888
Chelsea had brain surgery
when she was three.

349
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,374
- They had to drill into her skull?
- Yes, to relieve the pressure.

350
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,477
- These are accurate.
- I beg your pardon?

351
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,761
These are all constellations.

352
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:37,113
Centaurus, Aquarius... Gemini.

353
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,694
I knew Chelsea loved the stars but I
never thought her drawings were actually...

354
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,902
- They're real?
- This one's Delphinius.

355
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,978
The Dolphin. It was...

356
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:51,034
my favorite when I was a child. My
mother and I both loved dolphins.

357
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:53,190
So that was something that we...

358
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,298
shared.

359
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:01,342
Mrs. Cole, why exactly did...

360
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,723
your daughter require brain surgery?

361
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:05,691
Why do you ask it like that?

362
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,996
- You think I did something to Chelsea.
- Head injuries are...

363
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,025
extremely common in children
who are physically abused.

364
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,439
Excuse me, but it's very important
that I take my medication on time.

365
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:26,119
My daughter, at age
three, fell out of bed.

366
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,656
She didn't stop crying until
I took her to the hospital.

367
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:32,553
She had the surgery. It
was because of that injury

368
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:35,108
that they discovered that
she had the aging disease.

369
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,659
Did Joe Mellon tell you that
I physically abused my daughter

370
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,512
because I grabbed her arm once?

371
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,504
Once?

372
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,342
- Booth.
- Dude...

373
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,237
- will you stand up for me on Saturday?
- Against who?

374
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,076
No. I mean...

375
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:58,647
be my best man?

376
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,873
Sure. Wow.

377
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,410
I know. Big honor.

378
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:05,210
No, no, no. Yeah, that, but, you
know, you didn't give me much time to

379
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,650
- put a bachelor party together.
- No bachelor party.

380
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:10,307
- Is that Hodgins?
- Yeah. He wants me to be his best man.

381
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:12,196
Well, if there's no bachelor
party what do you want me to do?

382
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:14,436
Stand there. Make a toast.

383
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:16,014
Hand over the ring.

384
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:19,436
Tongue-kiss the maid of honor at the
reception when people clink glasses.

385
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,348
Nice. Excellent. Okay,
who's the maid of honor?

386
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:24,712
No idea, but most of Angela's
friends are really hot.

387
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:27,146
Well, I'm the maid of honor.

388
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:28,693
Why?

389
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:33,476
Uh, listen, do you need me to, uh,
connect with the bride's father?

390
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:37,264
Put together the, uh, the
toast, the speeches and all that?

391
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,969
Hodgins, you there?

392
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,496
Angela's father.

393
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:44,871
Oh, I forgot all about him.

394
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,705
- She has AIDS.
- Angela?

395
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:52,524
Cynthia Cole, the victim's
mother. HIV or AIDS.

396
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,157
What, all that medicine she took?

397
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:55,969
I recognized one of them.

398
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,358
We'll ask Cam.

399
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,789
In the mud sample taken
from beneath the remains,

400
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,567
I found a high concentration
of dead anostraca.

401
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,293
Also known as "fairy shrimp."

402
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:05,737
Shrimp can live outside the ocean?

403
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:08,093
They're not actually shrimp; they're
brachiopods. Main differences being...

404
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,670
- Moving on.
- I want to know if they can be poisoned

405
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,922
by feeding on decomposing flesh.

406
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,483
Oh, God.

407
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,795
- Please tell me that is not...
- That's not human.

408
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,308
That's Spam.

409
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,688
Which has been injected with
a number of organic poisons.

410
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:29,531
We'd like to introduce a
colony of Artemia Salina.

411
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:31,221
Commonly referred to

412
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:32,688
as sea chimps.

413
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:36,501
If they die, I can check to see if running them
through the spectrometer reveals what poisoned them.

414
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:37,937
What do you want from me?

415
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,408
Permission.

416
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:41,840
- Why?
- Because you said

417
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:45,345
you'd fire us if we did any more
experiments without clearing them first.

418
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:46,952
Boys,

419
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:50,375
you've got Spam and sea chimps.

420
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,844
You get anything out
of that, and I will...

421
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,359
buy you each a car.

422
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:01,733
- Release the hounds.
- What?

423
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,065
Pour in the sea chimps.

424
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,939
I found that anticlimactic.

425
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:27,967
Yeah.

426
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,594
- Do you like your father?
- Love my father.

427
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,016
I think I love my father.

428
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:37,827
Well, that's normal.

429
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:40,561
But he ran out on me and Russ.

430
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,267
He robbed people.

431
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,731
He's a murderer.

432
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,158
He got my mother killed. You
know, how does he expect me to...?

433
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:53,156
It's hard to trust someone
who's abandoned you.

434
00:23:53,393 --> 00:23:55,255
Especially a parent.

435
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:59,088
Am I...

436
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,350
Am I terrible for not...

437
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:06,476
wanting to let myself
care about my own father?

438
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:12,054
Look, Bones, your father is going to do
something tomorrow that's going to hurt you.

439
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:14,100
How do you forgive that?

440
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,255
I'm not a bad daughter?

441
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,676
Bad person?

442
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,088
You're not a bad anything.

443
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,917
Hodgins figured out
what killed Chelsea Cole.

444
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,389
Branchinecta Lindahli. Also
known as the fairy shrimp.

445
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,731
Not a true shrimp,
actually, a branchiopod.

446
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:44,438
You want to hurry it up there,
Hodgins? I got a tux I need to rent.

447
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,432
Right. Zack and I did a brief
experiment involving sea chimps.

448
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:49,889
Sea chimps? I love sea chimps.

449
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:53,072
To confirm that they would feed
on decomposing human tissue?

450
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,654
Great, thanks for ruining the
whole sea chimp thing for me.

451
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,746
- Did they?
- Those sea chimps went after that pork

452
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,840
by product like piranhas after
a skinny-dipping missionary.

453
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:03,985
Did you find anything in the fairy
shrimp beneath Chelsea Cole's body?

454
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:05,119
Yeah.

455
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:08,432
They were exposed to
lethal concentrations

456
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:11,280
of non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.

457
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:13,587
- I feel bad for the sea chimps, but...
- Booth.

458
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:18,078
Chelsea Cole was poisoned
by an overdose of Navirapine.

459
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,400
What's that?

460
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,981
- AIDS medicine.
- AIDS medicine...

461
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,741
It was her mother.

462
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:29,166
We'll probably be able
to trace this to you.

463
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:31,936
- I loved my daughter very much.
- The hell you did.

464
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,556
She got to be too much for you
to handle, so you killed her.

465
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,929
You don't understand.

466
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,307
I don't think you'll
ever find anyone who does.

467
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,869
You know, your daughter had
the mind of a six year old.

468
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:43,497
She loved the stars; she trusted you...

469
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:44,886
We're here.

470
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:46,529
and you killed her.

471
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,715
Ritonavir...

472
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:51,434
MK-0518...

473
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,338
Tenofir.

474
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:56,976
None of those is a trade
name for Navirapine.

475
00:25:57,117 --> 00:26:00,152
Wait... MK-0518...

476
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,731
is still in experimental
trials to replace Navirapine.

477
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,243
She used her old medicine to
poison Chelsea. Thanks, Cam.

478
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:10,713
Cynthia Cole, you're under arrest for
the murder of your daughter, Chelsea Cole.

479
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:16,914
Could you please take down
the pictures Chelsea drew?

480
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,683
I don't want anyone to come
in and just throw them away.

481
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,931
You threw away your own daughter.

482
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:25,890
Why would I do you a favor?

483
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:30,083
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

484
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,667
In 1978, Max Keenan

485
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:42,405
robbed a Piggly Wiggly
in Carbondale, Illinois.

486
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,764
The clerk conked him on the
head with a baseball bat.

487
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,799
Keenan pressed napkins to
his head to staunch the blood,

488
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:49,621
left them behind.

489
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,138
Don't tell me.

490
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:57,331
State Police have said
napkins in evidence.

491
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:04,727
Agent Booth, you wanted me to get
this information for you, correct?

492
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:06,440
Good work, Charlie.

493
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,766
Hey.

494
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:25,985
I mean...

495
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:34,214
You get that a lot, right? The whole...

496
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:36,729
Rrr, rrr, rrr... thing.

497
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:40,014
- Can I help you?
- I'm... Jack Hodgins.

498
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,105
You seem okay to me so far.

499
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,429
Well, I suddenly realized...

500
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,636
My best man said,
speeches at the wedding...

501
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,008
- You know about the wedding?
- Oh, yes.

502
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,807
It's no coincidence I'm here.

503
00:27:58,022 --> 00:28:01,088
Well, it occurred to me that
you might have a traditional...

504
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:03,979
You're Texan, and...

505
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,935
I mean, really Texan.

506
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,935
Guitars and hot rods Texan, so...

507
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:11,672
So I figured I should ask you for
your daughter's hand in marriage.

508
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,950
As a sign of respect.

509
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,813
You're making a huge mistake, son.

510
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:19,886
- Marrying Angela?
- No.

511
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:23,172
If Angie finds out that a man, you,

512
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,624
asked another man, me...

513
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:30,138
me, for her hand, or any
of her other fine parts,

514
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:32,653
horrible complications will ensue.

515
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:37,155
- I didn't think of that.
- You could get us both killed.

516
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:39,901
Okay. Good advice.

517
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,624
You got any more?

518
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:47,403
Always play it in the
key of G demolished.

519
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,868
I don't know what that means.

520
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:54,341
Well, if you do, you do.
If you don't, you don't.

521
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:55,491
Forget it.

522
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:07,906
Hodgins.

523
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:14,454
I've got cars and I've got guitars...

524
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,532
and I got guns.

525
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,331
You treat my little girl right,

526
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:25,571
you'll only see the business
end of the cars and guitars.

527
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:23,161
Am I going to need to use my gun, Max?

528
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:25,758
You got your piece of paper?

529
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,487
Max Keenan, I'm placing you under arrest

530
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:29,818
- for the murder of Deputy Director...
- Oh, fine, fine. Sure.

531
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:34,586
You know what? You can take me. You're
right. I'm not going to abandon her again.

532
00:30:35,736 --> 00:30:38,458
- You're not going to resist?
- It's your lucky day, I guess.

533
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,398
- Great.
- No.

534
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,589
No. Wait a minute. No.

535
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:46,653
See, I'm wrong. I can't just
go quietly. It's not my nature.

536
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:48,291
Max, I got a gun.

537
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:50,466
I can't surrender. You're
going to have to shoot me.

538
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,449
You... You understand.

539
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:53,787
Not your nature?

540
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,899
Yeah, maybe it's a character flaw.

541
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,978
Yeah, shoot me. Shoot me. But in
the leg, please, if you don't mind.

542
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,628
Ok. Hold up.

543
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,255
One second, please. Thank you.

544
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:09,260
Ready?

545
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:16,074
Hey. Hey, that's good,
kid. You're throwing.

546
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,070
What's the matter? Got a glass jaw?

547
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:20,728
You know what? You talk too much.

548
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:24,092
Right in the face? Geez. Time. Time.

549
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,932
- You had enough?
- Wait.

550
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,636
-  I'm old. - There's no
time-outs during an arrest.

551
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,041
Ok, I'm done. I'm done.
It's over. I'm finished.

552
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:44,368
Let's go.

553
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,964
Oh, God. That really hurts.

554
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:14,176
<i>Hi, Temperance. It's Mom.</i>

555
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:17,383
<i>I don't know when or
if you'll ever see this.</i>

556
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,160
<i>I hope to put it in your hands myself,</i>

557
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,360
<i>see you again with my own eyes,</i>

558
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,725
<i>but this is a hard, hard world.</i>

559
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:31,742
<i>Your father and I left you and Russ</i>

560
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:33,521
<i>to save your lives.</i>

561
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:37,491
<i>People would have killed you to get us.</i>

562
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:40,038
<i>But that's not what this is about.</i>

563
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:44,477
<i>Today is your 16th birthday.</i>

564
00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:50,285
<i>I'm so sorry... not to be there to</i>

565
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,010
<i>to tell you all the things that a mother
should tell her daughter when she turns 16.</i>

566
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,817
<i>And sorry not to give you this...</i>

567
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:04,038
<i>It's an heirloom from
my side of the family</i>

568
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,237
<i>and starting today, it's yours.</i>

569
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,082
<i>I don't know how long it will
take me to get it to you, but</i>

570
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:12,960
<i>I promise you I will.</i>

571
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:16,570
<i>You're going to hear a lot
of things about your parents,</i>

572
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:19,085
<i>especially about your father.</i>

573
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,291
<i>He is a good man.</i>

574
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,382
<i>It was my insistence to leave you kids.</i>

575
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,834
<i>Max would have kept us together,</i>

576
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,177
<i>fought until the end.</i>

577
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:32,626
<i>I'm not sure he'll ever
forgive me for that.</i>

578
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,441
<i>So, please, Temperance...</i>

579
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,270
<i>I need you to forgive me.</i>

580
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:44,399
<i>And if you can't forgive
me, I beg you, honey,</i>

581
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:47,786
<i>forgive your father</i>

582
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,986
<i>because he is a very good man.</i>

583
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:53,082
<i>Remember this:</i>

584
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:56,086
<i>you were cherished in this world.</i>

585
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,156
<i>Adored.</i>

586
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:03,314
<i>What I did to you may have been wrong,</i>

587
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,240
<i>but I did it out of love.</i>

588
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:09,956
<i>I did it out of love.</i>

589
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:31,304
Chelsea thought that

590
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:34,492
stars were signals from heaven,

591
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:37,120
showing how to get home.

592
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,930
Your AIDS cocktail wasn't working.

593
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:43,050
You were sick...

594
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:45,537
dying.

595
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:50,227
They put you on an experimental drug

596
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,587
and you felt even worse.

597
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:56,708
Your worst nightmare was coming true:

598
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,836
Chelsea was going to outlive you.

599
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:06,150
No foster parent would take her.

600
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:10,288
You did what you did...

601
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:14,020
out of mercy.

602
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:20,505
We went to the park.

603
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:23,133
And I gave, uh...

604
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,273
told Chelsea that it was candy.

605
00:35:29,657 --> 00:35:30,768
We...

606
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:34,895
we sat there looking up at the stars.

607
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:38,176
I didn't know what to do with her.

608
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,180
I didn't have any strength left.

609
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,412
And then...

610
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,944
I remembered the water.

611
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:52,456
And I thought it was deep.

612
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:55,054
Peaceful, you know?

613
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,318
And then...

614
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,566
like you were being punished,

615
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:05,055
the experimental drug

616
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:08,743
started to work, didn't it?

617
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,118
You got better.

618
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,430
What you did was wrong...

619
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,258
but you did it out of love.

620
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,507
How do I look?

621
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,509
Good.

622
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,520
How come yours looks so much better?

623
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:15,291
I took this and yanked.

624
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:17,649
Have you been to Iraq?

625
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,880
That's classified information,
and you aren't cleared for that.

626
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,617
Does it hurt to get shot?

627
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:23,786
What?

628
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:26,540
I've been blown up. That
wasn't as bad as I expected.

629
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,065
But I've never been shot.

630
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,882
- Booth?
- Yeah.

631
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:32,974
Better?

632
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,033
Wow. You look great.

633
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:38,161
You said I looked good before.

634
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,704
Whose day is it, huh? It's
Angela's. Come on, let's go.

635
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,065
There you go.

636
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:51,313
- Bones?
- Yes?

637
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,589
Listen, I'm

638
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:57,594
I'm sorry, I had to arrest your father.

639
00:37:57,595 --> 00:38:01,701
We don't have to talk about that right
now. You did your duty. I understand.

640
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:03,966
Yep. But...

641
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,417
- Bones?
- What?

642
00:38:35,698 --> 00:38:37,623
- He could have gotten away.
- What?

643
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,499
We got into a fight. Your dad
could have escaped capture.

644
00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:43,556
- So he beat you in the fight?
- No, I didn't say that.

645
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:45,747
You beat him, but you gave
him a chance to get away?

646
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:47,843
No, I didn't say that. I don't
see any other alternative.

647
00:38:47,844 --> 00:38:50,472
No, Bones, your father chose to
be arrested because he felt if

648
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:52,889
he abandoned you again,
he'd lose you forever.

649
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,293
I just thought you should know.

650
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:03,297
Thanks, Booth.

651
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,183
Hi.

652
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,337
I'd like to get married now.

653
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:20,073
Welcome, everyone.

654
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:24,653
We have gathered here today
to join together in matrimony

655
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,628
Jack Stanley Hodgins and
Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro.

656
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,038
Who gives this woman?

657
00:39:32,226 --> 00:39:34,510
I give you this beautiful woman.

658
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:42,759
I got a show.

659
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:47,993
Have a good time, everybody.

660
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:53,074
Angela and Jack have
invited us all here today

661
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:55,522
to be part of something beautiful.

662
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:59,027
Two people standing
before their friends,

663
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,070
family, and community to say,

664
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:04,448
"You are the one I love."

665
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,186
"You are the one for whom
I forsake all others."

666
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:08,617
Excuse me?

667
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:11,821
Is this the
Hodgins-Montenegro nuptials?

668
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,381
It's trying to be.

669
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:17,105
I'm with the State Department and it's imperative
that I speak with Hodgins and Montenegro

670
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:20,418
before these proceedings... proceed.

671
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,523
Come on then. Let's
get this figured out.

672
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:31,855
We'll, um... be right back.

673
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:40,726
- Booth?
- Yeah.

674
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:44,081
Is there any sense in ducking
when someone shoots at you?

675
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,788
Your body ducks whether
you want to or not.

676
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,324
- Why?
- You can read this later,

677
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:55,495
then explain it to everyone.

678
00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:00,290
Why me?

679
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:03,759
You know more about duty and
honor than anyone else I know.

680
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,303
Angela is already married?

681
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:10,933
Angela is totally,
unmistakably, legally married.

682
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,104
As federal employees
with security clearance,

683
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:15,161
your marriage license
underwent special scrutiny,

684
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:16,882
especially since your
wedding was so hurried.

685
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:19,385
You were married in Fiji four years ago.

686
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:21,669
I jumped over a broomstick with a guy.

687
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,277
I'm sorry.

688
00:41:28,303 --> 00:41:29,899
Jack, I...

689
00:41:30,415 --> 00:41:31,870
I'm sorry.

690
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,585
- This is my fault.
- No worries...

691
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:38,199
No worries. We'll just...

692
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:39,853
We'll, um...

693
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:44,445
There's just a lot of people
in there expecting a wedding.

694
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:45,885
Yeah,

695
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,522
I made this huge deal out of
getting married right away and

696
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:52,370
and they all... and... Run.

697
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:57,321
What? Flee. Scram. Skedaddle.

698
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:01,616
I like it.

699
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:08,074
Change of plan. Please go to the
reception. Have a great time on us.

700
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:09,587
Thank you for coming.

701
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:31,718
What do we do now?
