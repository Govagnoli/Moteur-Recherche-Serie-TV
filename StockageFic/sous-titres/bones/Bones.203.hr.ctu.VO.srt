1
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:25,979
Holy mother of God!

2
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,809
Ugh, geez!

3
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,716
Booth, what do we have here?

4
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,532
I bet I know.
That's... lasagna.

5
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,347
Fishy rotten cat food and...

6
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:38,803
vulcanized rubber.

7
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:41,088
Excellent olfactory talents, Hodgens.

8
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,378
- What happened?
- Well, it's obvious isn't it?

9
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,563
A guy tried to beat the yellow light,

10
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,063
he got T-boned by a tractor trailer.

11
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:47,527
Well, what was the semi carrying?

12
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:48,873
Aquarium sand, but that's not...

13
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:51,793
No natural gas or propane?
No explosion, no fire?

14
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,452
No corrosive chemicals.

15
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,502
What...
do you need me for?

16
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:57,380
You might want to prepare yourself.

17
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:00,070
Or not.

18
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:01,393
Oh, man.

19
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:05,703
Okay, how bad does garbage got to stink
to cover the smell of a dead body?

20
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,491
I think the victim was a minor.

21
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:12,010
Okay, well, then, if you agree,
then this falls under FBI jurisdiction.

22
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:18,423
It's a male.

23
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,231
Yes.
An adolescent.

24
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:24,480
Flatworms, necrophagous flies and beetles.

25
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:27,130
Yeah, he's been garbage
for about three weeks.

26
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:29,771
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

27
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:33,081
Fractures to the cranium,

28
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:36,023
sphenoid and occipital regions.

29
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:38,260
Neck's broken,

30
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:40,412
and the femur is shattered.

31
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:41,693
From the garbage truck flipping over?

32
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,133
No. This damage is more
congruent with a fall.

33
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:50,890
What do you got?

34
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,360
It's organic.

35
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:56,031
Whatever it is,
he brought it with him

36
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:57,910
from the crime scene.

37
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:02,532
How much of this are you going to need?

38
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,431
The whole disgusting shebang.

39
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,603
- Ugh! Everything?
- Everything.

40
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,473
He was wrapped in a shroud?

41
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:14,903
Angela's analyzing the stains on the cloth

42
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:17,812
while Hodgins figures out
what they're made of.

43
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:19,471
No finger pads left for prints.

44
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:20,713
How are we on dental records?

45
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,003
FBI's on it.

46
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:26,222
Multiple shards of leaded glass

47
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:29,022
embedded in the remaining tissue.

48
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:31,782
Massive contusions

49
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:35,181
congruent with the swan dive
onto a hard surface.

50
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:37,113
And take a look at the upper spine.

51
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:40,921
Weighted impact against
the scapula and clavicle.

52
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:42,020
He was struck?

53
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,650
Yes, but not hard enough to kill.

54
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:45,841
Private garbage hauler.

55
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,751
They aren't real strict
about their routes.

56
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,950
Driver says he can't be sure
where he picked the victim up.

57
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,482
No visible tats or track marks.

58
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:54,172
You sound surprised.

59
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,422
Well, it's pretty obvious, Bones.
He's either a junkie or a hustler.

60
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:58,932
Why make that assumption?

61
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,753
Not many kids from the suburbs
end up rotting in garbage trucks.

62
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,232
Fun factoid from the front lines.

63
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:05,583
Hey, guys.
Want to see something cool?

64
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:10,683
I assume you're all familiar
with the Shroud of Turin.

65
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,383
Image of Christ's face
on the inside of a burial cloth.

66
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,602
Right. Booth is a good Catholic boy.

67
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:18,253
It was revealed to be a hoax.

68
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,442
It wasn't a hoax?

69
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,382
Okay, whatever you want to believe.

70
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,023
This is no hoax.

71
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,540
On the fabric covering John Doe's skull,

72
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,541
there are tissue stains around
the eye sockets,

73
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:31,440
the nose and the mouth.

74
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:34,243
This is sentinel a photo negative
of his features.

75
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:37,082
Are you saying you have enough
to assemble a face?

76
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:40,780
I call it the
Shroud of Montenegro.

77
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:44,182
I used computer tomography
to create X-Ray slices

78
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,392
of the underlying
facial architecture.

79
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:49,022
Selective laser
centering allowed me

80
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,012
to map the unimprinted areas

81
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,443
surrounding the nose,
mouth and chin.

82
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:55,590
Skin tone and hair color were extrapolated
based on Dr. Saroyan's data.

83
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,721
I'm no expert, but

84
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,240
he sure doesn't look
like a street kid.

85
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:10,622
Bones
Episode 2x05 - The Boy in the Shroud

Subs by Zhalom

87
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:20,322
Rsynch this version: hanest

88
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:36,540
I'm running our facial recognition

89
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,550
through the Center for Missing
and Exploited Person database.

90
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,260
That's a lot of missing and exploited kids.

91
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,553
These are just the locals.

92
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,180
Let's hope we don't have to go national.

93
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:45,202
Narrow the search

94
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:46,232
to street kids in the foster system.

95
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,422
- Why?
- Because,

96
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,643
statistically,
that's where this boy comes from.

97
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,142
It's far too early
to start narrowing our focus.

98
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:55,722
Runaways, street kids,
foster system.

99
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,872
Dr. Saroyan's the boss.

100
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:59,663
I've autopsied a lot of dead kids.

101
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,263
Car accidents, drug overdoses,
drownings--

102
00:05:02,276 --> 00:05:04,103
fine, it's a broad search.

103
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:07,570
Kid in a Dumpster; It's a runaway,
street kid or foster system.

104
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,111
Cam's right, Bones.

105
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:13,591
Got it.
Dylan Krane, 17.

106
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:16,111
This is why I was appointed
this job, Dr. Brennan.

107
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:17,873
To streamline the process.

108
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:20,700
Honor student from a
nice neighborhood in Alexandria.

109
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,173
Oops.

110
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:25,701
He disappeared three weeks ago
with his girlfriend Kelly Morris,

111
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,092
who is in the foster system.

112
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:30,331
Good.

113
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,003
There we go.

114
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:34,020
I guess your first move
is to find Kelly Morris.

115
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:36,263
No, the first move is to inform the Kranes

116
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:38,301
that we just found their son.

117
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:40,651
Are you positive?

118
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,010
We don't need to identify him?

119
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,653
To- To make sure, I mean.

120
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,531
I need to see my son.
You understand?

121
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:48,261
Mr. and Mrs. Krane,
I realize this is very hard,

122
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,862
but the reason why we asked you
to come to the Jeffersonian...

123
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,820
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

124
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,550
What? I don't understand
the significance of that.

125
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,643
I'm called in when a victim
is too decomposed...

126
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:01,240
to identify.

127
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,602
Oh, God.

128
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:05,392
I was able to identify Dylan

129
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:07,740
beyond the shadow of a doubt.

130
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:09,252
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,661
That's Dylan.

132
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:11,932
How did he die?

133
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,493
He fell...

134
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,492
from a height of approximately 50 feet.

135
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,822
Suicide?

136
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:22,322
Is there any reason to believe
that your son was despondent?

137
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,710
Dylan? No.

138
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,233
He was a smart,

139
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:27,432
happy kid.

140
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:29,222
Problems at school?

141
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:31,532
You know, uh... spending
too much time on the Internet?

142
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,141
Anything like that

143
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:35,870
His whole life centered around
this girl that he was seeing.

144
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,519
Was this Kelly Morris?

145
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,143
Yes. I suppose you read
the missing persons report.

146
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,723
So, you know Kelly's
in a foster situation?

147
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:45,923
Have you seen her
since Dylan disappeared?

148
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:46,833
No.

149
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:49,021
To be honest, we were hoping
they ran away together.

150
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,371
- Why would they do that?
- We told Dylan to stop seeing her.

151
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:53,710
Why?

152
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:57,210
Dylan met her at Harper Plaza
where the street kids hang out.

153
00:06:57,265 --> 00:07:00,960
Dylan was getting ready to go to M.I.T.
She's already dropped out of high school.

154
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,962
The life we provided him, it didn't
prepare him for a girl like Kelly.

155
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,780
You mean a foster child?

156
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,732
Bones.

157
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:09,310
Whatever happened to my son,
it happened because of Kelly.

158
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,310
We're going to find her,
and we're going to talk to her.

159
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:17,130
Dr. Brennan, I can see that you think
that we're being hard on Kelly.

160
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,303
But my son...

161
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,762
My son was a good kid

162
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,152
with his whole life ahead of him.

163
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,440
Kelly Morris' foster mother is going
to meet us at my office.

164
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,890
Okay.

165
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:41,922
She says Kelly took off a couple weeks ago
with most of her belongings.

166
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:46,883
You okay, Bones?

167
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,690
I was a foster child.

168
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,100
Yeah, I know.

169
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,002
Do people always assume
the worst of me?

170
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,780
Yeah, I know that you hate psychology,

171
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:59,482
but those people-
they just lost their son.

172
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,891
They need to blame someone.

173
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,950
Poor Dylan. He was a good kid.

174
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,202
He was a good influence on Kelly-

175
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,771
trying to get her back into school.

176
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,590
And he was good to Alex,

177
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,622
treated him just like a little brother.

178
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,311
To the best of your knowledge, were...

179
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:23,423
Kelly and Dylan sexually active?

180
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,331
Oh, I know they were.

181
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:27,450
I- I'm afraid I caught them...

182
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,392
in Kelly's bedroom,

183
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:32,812
and I had to forbid Kelly to bring
Dylan into the house after that.

184
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:33,621
Why?

185
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,270
It's the rules.

186
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,473
They're underage,
and Kelly's a ward of the state.

187
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:40,493
Yeah, and I knew that it might force
Dylan and Kelly to find other

188
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,630
places to be together.

189
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,642
You know, to feed into their own, uh...

190
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:45,860
Romeo and Juliet fantasy.

191
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,562
But Alex lives in the house, too,
and he's only 12.

192
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,133
Kelly and her brother, they close?

193
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:53,592
Very close.

194
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:57,060
Their parents were killed
in a hotel fire four years ago.

195
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:59,440
They had no family.
They were put into the system.

196
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:02,822
I've had them for...
a little over a year.

197
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,983
That's a pretty good run for a foster kid,

198
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:07,961
especially a brother and a
sister who want to be together.

199
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,581
Yes.

200
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:12,523
What?

201
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:16,392
Well, I'm not certain how much longer
I can keep the both of them.

202
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,103
I have diabetes,

203
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,270
and I don't
have the energy

204
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:23,063
that I used to, and Kelly is a
real handful.

205
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,353
I've asked Children's Services
to look for alternatives.

206
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:27,831
Did Kelly know?

207
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,733
Yes. I told her.

208
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:32,540
Did they find Kelly or not?

209
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:34,141
No, Alex,

210
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:36,240
but they found Dylan.

211
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,322
Is he all right?

212
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,953
I'm... I'm afraid not.

213
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:45,970
Dylan is dead.

214
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,213
Do you know where Kelly is, Alex?

215
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:54,411
No.

216
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,331
Kelly could be in danger.

217
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:58,613
I don't know where she is.

218
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:00,963
She hasn't called me or anything.

219
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,873
Do you think she's dead, too?

220
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:04,943
No. Mm-mm.

221
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,321
You know, I'm gonna find your sister,

222
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:09,112
and I'm going to bring her back
here to you.

223
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:11,641
Really?

224
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,183
Absolutely.

225
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,062
This is the FBI, buddy.

226
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:18,432
Were you lying to the boy?

227
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,733
Do you really think Kelly
Morris is still alive?

228
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,533
I don't know.

229
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,932
- You don't know if she's alive?
- No, I don't know if I was lying.

230
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,292
You see, I just... I really don't have
a read on the sister yet.

231
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,680
I mean, was she a bad guy?
Was she a victim?

232
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,871
Well, do you have a
read on Dylan Krane?

233
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,653
Oh, yeah, he had that whole adolescent
savior complex thing going on big time.

234
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:37,353
Savior complex?

235
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,413
Yeah, teenage boys
love not than more than the idea

236
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,371
of saving the damsel
in distress.

237
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:42,933
Well, how do you know?

238
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,471
Well, 'cause I was...

239
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,180
You know, I was a teenage boy.

240
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:48,592
Hey.

241
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,002
DNA from the tissue
under the victim's fingernail?

242
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,790
Female, and there's nail polish
in the gouges on his arm.

243
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:56,560
Well, it wasn't necessarily from the murder.
They were sexually active.

244
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:57,980
She might have scratched him.

245
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,872
No. Hodgins also found oxidized iron
in the scratches.

246
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:02,673
Oxidized iron.

247
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:03,911
What's that?

248
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:04,883
- Rust.
- Rust.

249
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,312
Why didn't you
just say "rust"?

250
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,730
Well, she said it.

251
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,900
The same oxidized iron found on
the victim's upper back and shoulder.

252
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,433
Probably left behind
by the weapon that struck him.

253
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:17,740
So... he was hit
with what, a rusty pipe?

254
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:18,973
That's a reasonable assumption.

255
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:21,143
Oh, so, Dylan tells the girlfriend
they're breaking up...

256
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,040
She whacks him across the carotid
with a pipe.

257
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,711
- And pushes him out the window.
- Exactly.

258
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:26,680
What?

259
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,413
What's with the stink eye?
It's just a theory.

260
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:33,370
There was cheap nail polish
in the box of Kelly's belongings.

261
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,262
You should see if there's a match.

262
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,930
Find some hair.

263
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,593
Match the DNA on that, then

264
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,441
get started on the, uh, murder weapon.

265
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,741
Yeah.

266
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:43,441
Where are you going?

267
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:46,053
I thought before we arrest
Kelly Morris for murder

268
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,480
based solely on the fact
that she's a foster kid,

269
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:51,543
we might want to find the place
where Dylan Krane actually died.

270
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,912
Point of fact:
The pipe... if that's even what it was-

271
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:55,133
was not the murder weapon.

272
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,743
The evidence, if anybody cares,

273
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:59,492
shows that Dylan Krane died...
from a fall.

274
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,961
No compression fractures
to the ulna or phalanges,

275
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,873
so his arms weren't outstretched
or across his face.

276
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,983
Which means he wasn't bracing for impact.

277
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:14,762
Suggesting he was unconscious
before he went out the window.

278
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,863
Perhaps from being struck
by the rusty pipe?

279
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,483
Oh, don't you start.

280
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,832
Start what?

281
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:21,133
We don't know what he was struck with yet.

282
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:22,893
I analyzed the impact damage,

283
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:26,743
and the weapon was a cylinder
approximately two inches in diameter.

284
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:29,043
That plus the oxidation residue suggests,

285
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,252
in the vernacular, a rusty pipe.

286
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:34,050
Good. If you tell me that, I get it.

287
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:35,821
It's empirical, not guesswork.

288
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,352
That which we call a rose

289
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:41,050
by any other name
would smell as sweet.

290
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,033
Romeo and Juliet,
Act II, Scene II.

291
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:46,570
The quote considered to most aptly describe
the central conflict of the play...

292
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,132
which I totally do not understand.

293
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,231
The flower in Dylan's hand
was a roseacalyx, a rosebud.

294
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,830
You do not smell like a rose.

295
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:58,190
I've been sifting
through two tons of garbage,

296
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,292
which you should ask me about.

297
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:01,892
Ask what exactly?

298
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,071
Poultry skin loaded with garlic and chives,

299
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:06,332
red beets, empty imported vodka bottles,

300
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,593
and traces of Osetra fish eggs.

301
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,852
Put 'em together, and where are we?

302
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,980
Anyone?

303
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,960
Booth should check the garbage truck route
for a Russian restaurant.

304
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:23,550
Whoa, okay, horrible area,

305
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:24,743
but, you know, on the upside,

306
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,643
only one Russian restaurant
and no Starbucks.

307
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:30,570
You know, no one we've talked
to has recognized either Kelly or Dylan.

308
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:33,193
Hey, we could ask them.

309
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:34,463
Why?

310
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:36,473
Because they share the same unique

311
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,222
socio-cultural identifiers
as Kelly Morris.

312
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:41,113
You mean, like teenagers?

313
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:42,341
- Yeah, exactly.
- I don't know.

314
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:45,542
You know what? They will melt away
before we get half a sentence out.

315
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:46,663
All right, you just watch.

316
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:48,373
Okay, but, hey, you know, what do I know?

317
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,000
I've only been working
the streets my whole career.

318
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,311
Excuse me?
Excuse me. Hello?

319
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,990
Hi. I'm an anthropologist.

320
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,461
I'm not a cop.

321
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,561
- That's most definitely a cop.
- Thank you.

322
00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,483
See, they're very cooperative,
aren't they?

323
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,980
Booth, please. Just...
There they go.

324
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:04,281
Oh, excuse me.
Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:06,940
Will you just take a look at
these pictures and tell me

326
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,231
if you recognize anyone?

327
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:13,373
Give me five bucks,
and I'll tell you.

328
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:15,103
Five bucks.

329
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:16,890
Booth, please.

330
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:19,923
Here you go.

331
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,351
So, who is it?

332
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:23,592
It's his sister.

333
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,602
But hold it this way, right?

334
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:29,153
'Cause the only time anyone ever
sees his sister is on her back.

335
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:33,331
Yeah, I'm assuming...
this isn't your sister?

336
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:34,800
No, it is.

337
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,601
Okay, I'd like my money back.

338
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:40,392
Well, there they go. Bye.

339
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:43,360
Mm-hmm. That really worked
now, didn't it, huh?

340
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,022
Great.

341
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,283
They just took my money for nothing.

342
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:49,441
Well, you know,
that's because they're exploited,

343
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,473
you know, and misunderstood.

344
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:56,231
Oh, you got to be kidding me, huh?

345
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:59,011
Geez, they could at least wait until your
back is turned.

346
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,451
What?

347
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:02,252
FBI. Hands in the air.

348
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:03,932
There's no problem here!

349
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,490
No problem at all! Katie?

350
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,152
Uh, I'll cover you. Go see
what they're dealing, Bones.

351
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,561
What? Uh, I hate this part
where you stand with a gun,

352
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,762
and I have to go do the looking.

353
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,312
Bones, I got you covered.
Let's go.

354
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,770
What are you selling?

355
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,371
What do they got there, Bones?
What do you got, huh?

356
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,950
- What is it?
- Ibuprofen.

357
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,860
Uh, multivitamin.

358
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:30,051
I think these are sandwiches,

359
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,450
and condoms.

360
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:37,700
Franny and I have been
doing this for years.

361
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,961
Sandwiches, clothing, vitamins,

362
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,973
some basic hygiene supplies
for homeless kids.

363
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,353
You must be really embarrassed.

364
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:47,061
Hey, you know what? It was
suspicious behavior, all right?

365
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,743
And besides, uh, they're...
It's not like they're...

366
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,381
Are you social workers?

367
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:51,423
Nope.

368
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:52,361
They're not even social workers.

369
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,781
They're good Samaritans.

370
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,840
Well, I apologized, okay?

371
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:57,600
Do you know how long it takes
to gain some trust around here?

372
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,150
Make a scene like this and these
kids won't talk to us for weeks.

373
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:02,683
Oh, good. Maybe you could do us
a favor in return.

374
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:04,741
Show them the picture.

375
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,680
We're looking for someone.

376
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:08,543
The girl.

377
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:10,290
Dylan and Kelly.

378
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,883
Yeah, that's right.

379
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,652
We haven't seen them around here
in a couple of weeks.

380
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,360
Dylan is dead.

381
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:18,880
We found him in a garbage truck
that services this area.

382
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,442
My God, what happened?

383
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:21,550
That's what
we're trying to figure out.

384
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:24,343
Warehouse.

385
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,522
Yup.

386
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:29,070
Come with us.

387
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,111
What is this place?
It's a squat.

388
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,052
Every one of these old factories houses
junkies and squatters.

389
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,731
Yeah, and kids with nowhere else to go.

390
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,333
What'd this building used to be?

391
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,962
Plumbing supply, I think.

392
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,450
Pipes.

393
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,182
Bones. Dylan, right?

394
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,661
It's obviously a kind of shrine.

395
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,571
It's something the kids do for each other

396
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,761
when somebody dies.

397
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,610
Still could be traces of
Dylan's blood on the concrete.

398
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:02,633
- I'll call the crime scene unit.
- Tell them to start on the fifth floor.

399
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:03,331
Why?

400
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:05,642
Because the injuries show
that's how far he fell.

401
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,790
Hey!

402
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:10,622
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

403
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:12,260
That's Dylan's school jacket!

404
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,873
We're not going to hurt you!

405
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:19,411
Okay.

406
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,112
I hurt you a little bit,
but that's only because you ran.

407
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:26,520
You can't ask me nothing without a social
worker being present.

408
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,351
- I know my rights.
- I'm not questioning you here.

409
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,891
We're just...
We're talking, okay?

410
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:32,752
Here.

411
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,092
Some gum?

412
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:36,491
Yeah, like that's going
to make me trust you.

413
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,883
You know, I'm just asking your name.

414
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,213
C.

415
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,873
Does that stand for anything?

416
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:47,942
Carter.

417
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:49,743
I'm not saying if that's
my first or my last name.

418
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:52,103
- Why'd you run?
- 'Cause this lady was chasing me.

419
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:53,492
Because you ran.

420
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:54,682
- Yeah, it's a brain twister.
- You know,

421
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,582
that sweatshirt you're wearing belongs
to a kid by the name of Dylan Krane.

422
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:59,671
- Never heard of him.
- Where'd you get it?

423
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,690
I'm done with the hoodie.

424
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,390
You guys can have it.

425
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:08,163
What's with the, uh...

426
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:11,061
the names on the inside of your
forearm there? What does that mean?

427
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,712
Guys I killed.

428
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,222
It's a list of foster homes.

429
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,562
Ones that threw him out.

430
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,962
Sometimes getting thrown out's the best...

431
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,852
Is the best thing that can happen.

432
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:21,860
I know.

433
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,351
You were in the system?

434
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,621
Booth, the sunglasses?

435
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,131
They're the same ones that Dylan
was wearing in the photograph.

436
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:34,790
These, huh?

437
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,662
Top of the line.
How can you afford these?

438
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,192
You don't want to know.

439
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:42,413
- Can I go now?
- No. Child Services is on the way.

440
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,222
I tell you something,
you'll let me go?

441
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:45,361
- Try me.
- You want to know

442
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,971
what happened to Dylan and Kelly?

443
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,861
Check out the sandwich pervs.

444
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:53,220
Fran Duncan's clean.
Great record in the community,

445
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,453
but Kevin Duncan-
the kid got it right. I mean, he's a perv.

446
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,570
Inside three times on solicitation
of minor charges.

447
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,111
- Boys or girls?
- Girls. He's a traditionalist.

448
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:04,190
Oh, so he went after Kelly...

449
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:07,281
Yeah, and the white knight from the suburbs
steps in, gets conked with a pipe,

450
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,102
and... tossed out the window.

451
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,771
- Kelly goes into hiding.
- Unless he got her, too.

452
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,522
So, what do you want to do next?

453
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:15,823
Hmm, that's up to Cam, isn't it?

454
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,031
No, Bones, I asked you.

455
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,353
What do you want to do?

456
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:22,751
I think...

457
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:26,871
I think we shouldn't close off
any avenue of investigation.

458
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:30,333
We stay on all the evidence
and see where it leads us,

459
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,033
like we did before Cam.

460
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,403
Okay.

461
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:38,560
Do you have a list like Carter?

462
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,863
Of...

463
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,303
foster families that didn't work out?
Yeah, we all did.

464
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:45,000
I wrote mine on the bottom of a shoe.

465
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,402
Oh. You know, they say with foster kids,
they're really hard on themselves.

466
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:51,571
They?

467
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:53,193
Yeah, experts,...

468
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:54,720
psychologists...

469
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,650
like that. Apparently, foster kids feel
so alone in this mean world,

470
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:01,432
they lose that knack
of trusting in other people.

471
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:03,653
You mean at work?

472
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,163
Well, everywhere, you know?

473
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,850
Weight of the world, it's...

474
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,852
it's profound.

475
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:12,400
They say that, uh, they have a hard time
letting themselves off the hook.

476
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:14,693
They grow up with control issues.

477
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,373
Are you telling me something, Booth?

478
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:18,653
No, it's just, you know,

479
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,481
something to keep into consideration when
we catch up with Kelly Morris.

480
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,681
Okay.

481
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:25,130
If you decide to take
some other wisdom out of it,

482
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,392
none of my business.

483
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:30,502
How Cam and I get along
is none of your business.

484
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,412
Yeah, right, which I just said...

485
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:34,180
said just then.

486
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,342
None of my business.

487
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:54,722
- Is there anything I can do?
- Hey, this schematic is great, Angela.

488
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:56,900
All the pipes are numbered and located.

489
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,772
Meanwhile,
I have hundreds of rust samples,

490
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:02,282
and I've covered, hmm, maybe
a quarter of the crime scene.

491
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:03,780
- Ugh!
- Yeah.

492
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:05,372
On the good side,

493
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,733
that is definitely the window
Dylan Krane exited as he fell.

494
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:10,502
Leaded glass is a match.

495
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,692
It's a strange place for two people
in love to end up.

496
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,563
What, a forensics lab?

497
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:19,680
No, a squat in an abandoned pipe factory.

498
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,612
Right, yes, right.

499
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:25,652
- What were you talking about?
- Just...

500
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,053
- Cam and Booth. You know, of course.
- Oh, yeah.

501
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:29,803
Given their-their history.

502
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,103
Mm.

503
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,493
Tension, party of two.

504
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:41,991
Great. Great.

505
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:44,771
Okay.

506
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,121
All my mistakes were made
before I met Fran.

507
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,653
Then I fell in love.

508
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,190
Love changes everything.

509
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:56,030
- Your wife know about these mistakes?
- Of course.

510
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:58,243
We have no secrets. I got counseling.

511
00:21:58,245 --> 00:21:59,713
I'm still in counseling.

512
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:01,893
And I'm out there on the street
making amends every day.

513
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:06,250
Passing out sandwiches and aspirin
and condoms to street kids?

514
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:07,572
Yeah.

515
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,970
I have no direct contact with the kids.
Fran does.

516
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:12,222
I make the sandwiches.

517
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,282
I drive.

518
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:16,662
Insure my wife's safety.
That's a tough part of town.

519
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:20,023
And your past is...
all in the past?

520
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,463
No, that's with me every day.

521
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:24,631
Yeah.

522
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,970
Miranda Tyler, Susan Price,
Laura Costello.

523
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:33,781
All these girls say that you traded
sandwiches for sex in the past six months.

524
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:36,130
Well, they're street kids. They lie.

525
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,413
Yeah.

526
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:39,641
These girls came on to me,

527
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,703
and they wanted money.

528
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:43,891
When I rejected them, they got angry.

529
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:46,700
Yeah. We catch up to, uh, Kelly Mois,

530
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,572
is sh-she going to say the same thing?

531
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:55,951
Hairbrush from Kelly's room
provided her DNA.

532
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,263
The nail polish from her room

533
00:22:57,267 --> 00:23:01,173
also matches the nail polish we found
in the scratch marks on the victim's arm.

534
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:03,391
It doesn't mean
she pushed him out that window.

535
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:06,430
If he finds it, and it matches
the rust found in the scratch marks,

536
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:08,301
then we can tie Kelly to the weapon.

537
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:09,731
Oh, young love.

538
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:13,222
You pour your soul out to some
pimple-faced jock with a great body

539
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,323
and the emotional
maturity of an 11-year-old,

540
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:18,170
only to get your heart broken
in the back of a red Camaro.

541
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:20,073
Remember that first slow dance?

542
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,272
Oh, God.

543
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,080
Some horrible power ballad.

544
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:25,440
Oh, that special boy with
the pipe in his pocket.

545
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,231
Oh, God. Lewis Cole.

546
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,150
Mm, he was a drummer.

547
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:31,550
He had this hair, it was...

548
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:33,150
Wait-Wait, excuse me.

549
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,270
Marching to the beat
of a different drummer here.

550
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:39,260
I'd like Hodgins to identify the species
of rose found in Dylan Krane's hand.

551
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:40,983
What can that possibly tell us?

552
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,701
I won't know until he identifies it.

553
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,433
I'd prefer he keep looking for the pipe.

554
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:46,201
It could have Kevin Duncan's DNA on it.

555
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:50,180
Which will prove only that Kevin Duncan
struck Dylan, not that he killed him.

556
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,003
I want Hodgins on that rose.

557
00:23:52,008 --> 00:23:53,860
It's my call. No.

558
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:57,251
I can't work like this.

559
00:23:57,945 --> 00:24:00,500
Are you telling me I should start looking
for your replacement?

560
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,132
Dr. Saroyan,

561
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:04,010
I don't want to be overly dramatic
or anything,

562
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:07,321
but if you lose Brennan,
you lose us all.

563
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,920
- Really?
- Really.

564
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,450
And Booth, too.

565
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:21,982
In the interests...
of this investigation,

566
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:24,402
I am going to defer
to you, Dr. Brennan.

567
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,232
Thank you.

568
00:24:26,638 --> 00:24:27,833
Thank you.

569
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:31,501
But I will start the search
for your replacement.

570
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:41,240
- Agent Booth?
- Yeah.

571
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:44,300
This young man says he has information
he won't tell anyone but you.

572
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,882
All right.
Thanks. I got him.

573
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,551
Come on in, Alex.
Have a seat.

574
00:24:54,086 --> 00:24:56,691
- You want a Coke or anything?
- No.

575
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,470
You a big shot?

576
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:02,791
Um, yeah.

577
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:07,392
Look at that, huh?
Special Agent in charge, Seeley Booth.

578
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:11,883
- So, how'd you get here?
- Bus.

579
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:14,312
Kelly called me...

580
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,810
on the phone.

581
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:17,460
What she say?

582
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,622
That she's okay...

583
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,333
and that we'll be together...

584
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:23,730
soon.

585
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,510
Did she say where she was?

586
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:31,252
Does she know about Dylan?
About being dead?

587
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:33,911
Yeah.

588
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:37,412
She couldn't stop crying about it.

589
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,521
She had to hang up.

590
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:45,020
I think she's lying.

591
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:47,483
I think she's never coming back.

592
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:55,531
Hey, it's okay, Alex, all right?

593
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,750
Everything's going to be okay.

594
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:01,012
I think I'm all alone now.

595
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:05,062
Oh, hey, look, man, you're never going
to be alone, okay?

596
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:08,603
We know for
certain that Kelly is alive,

597
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:11,251
and I promise, we're going
to find your sister.

598
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,461
Okay? All right.

599
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,491
Let's get out of here.
I'll give you a ride home.

600
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:22,122
Got your call.

601
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:25,572
- It was urgent. Why didn't you answer?
- I was busy. What's so important?

602
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:30,993
- Kevin Duncan.
- Single gunshot wound to the chest.

603
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:32,981
You're just in time for the autopsy.

604
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:47,512
Feeling queasy, Zack?

605
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm not used to bodies looking so much
like actual human beings.

606
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,680
Oh.

607
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,561
Since this man was just killed,
and there's plenty of flesh,

608
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,711
how is my presence beneficial?

609
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:16,521
The number six rib.

610
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:19,812
The bullet passed through his vital organs
and lodged in the rear curvature.

611
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,373
Get it out.

612
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:29,771
So, you're thinking, the perv kills Romeo,
and Juliet kills the pervert?

613
00:27:29,776 --> 00:27:32,793
Street-smart kid like Kelly Morris would
have no trouble getting her hands on a gun.

614
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:34,193
Mm-hmm.

615
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:38,003
Booth, if Dr. Brennan were to quit...

616
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:42,651
- What?
- If she were to leave the Jeffersonian...

617
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:46,120
Well, the squints would flee
this institution like the French army.

618
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:49,793
- And you?
- Well, I do as I'm ordered.

619
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,381
No, you don't, Seeley.

620
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:54,941
Ah. Okay, here we go.

621
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,553
What's going on, Camille?

622
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:02,191
What if I fired her?
What would you do?

623
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:04,981
I'm with Bones, Cam.

624
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:06,793
All the way.

625
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:09,463
Don't doubt it for a second.

626
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,021
Meet the English Alba Rose.

627
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,581
Climbing varietal.

628
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:16,501
Non-existent in the United States.

629
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:20,523
Some say it was the rose by any
other name Shakespeare wrote about.

630
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:22,652
And we give a rat's ass
because...?

631
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,970
It's what Dylan Krane was
clutching in his cold dead hand.

632
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:26,952
So, what, he was killed by Hamlet?

633
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:28,353
Wrong play.

634
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:30,793
It's more likely he paid a visit to
the Rose Wing

635
00:28:30,795 --> 00:28:32,800
of the United States Botanic Garden.

636
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:36,613
When it comes to bugs, slime,
crud and compost, you're the man.

637
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:40,511
You know, Cam,

638
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:44,621
maybe you just got off on the wrong foot
with this case with Brennan because, uh,

639
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:46,632
she was a foster kid.

640
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,623
Oh.

641
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:54,480
- Why didn't she tell me?
- She doesn't do that.

642
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,903
Excuse me.
Oh, by the way,

643
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:00,732
I didn't just tell you that.

644
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,402
United States Botanic Garden

645
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:07,991
falls under the supervision of
the Architect of the Capitol.

646
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,351
- I really don't care.
- The Architect is also responsible

647
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:12,663
for maintaining the grounds
of the United States Capitol.

648
00:29:12,678 --> 00:29:14,181
Hi. You seen either of these two kids?

649
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:17,731
It's open every day of the year
to the citizens of these United States.

650
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:19,851
Which way to the Romeo and Juliet roses?

651
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,681
It's over there, where
Kelly Morris is standing.

652
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh.

653
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:29,091
Oh, Bones was right.
Okay, go distract her.

654
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:30,361
Well, hey, why me?

655
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,220
Well, because, apparently,
I look like a cop.

656
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:35,422
- Well, what do I look like?
- What are you, my straight man? Go.

657
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,493
Hey.

658
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,933
The United States Botanic Garden

659
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:53,471
falls under the supervision
of the Architect of the-the Capitol.

660
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:55,832
- Get away from me, perv.
- Hello, Kelly.

661
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:57,920
FBI. Not a perv.

662
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,352
Uh, it's okay, it's okay.
We're just here to help.

663
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:02,550
We're not going to hurt you.

664
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:04,910
Just got to talk
about what happened to Dylan.

665
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:07,253
Dylan's dead.

666
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:09,552
Were you there when Dylan died?

667
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,441
Was I there?

668
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,711
Who do you think killed him?

669
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:21,681
Why'd you kill Dylan, Kelly?

670
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:22,490
Agent Booth...

671
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:24,742
Well, she already admitted
to the murder, Ms. Child.

672
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:27,231
Actually, I believe she asked,
"Who do you think killed him?"

673
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:28,670
It's an ambiguous question.

674
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:29,811
I killed him.

675
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,231
I did it.

676
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,590
Because he broke a promise to me.

677
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,222
The promise to stay with you?

678
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:40,513
He tossed me a couple hundred bucks
and told me he was going to college.

679
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,522
That we couldn't see each other anymore.

680
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:44,520
What did you do?

681
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:46,380
I pushed him out a window.

682
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:48,402
It was kind of an accident, right?

683
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,041
What do you call it, a crime of passion?

684
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:52,843
- You pushed him out the window?
- Yes.

685
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,552
And he was conscious at the time?

686
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:57,443
Yeah. He screamed, okay?

687
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:02,282
- What then?
- I ran away.

688
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:04,481
No, Kelly, you didn't.

689
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:07,553
You went down to the alley,
and you wrapped Dylan in linen,

690
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:11,333
and then, you put a rose
from the Botanic Garden in his hand.

691
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,342
The Romeo and Juliet rose.

692
00:31:14,658 --> 00:31:16,652
Yeah, it's a strange thing to do...

693
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,103
right after you murder someone.

694
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:20,001
Well, I'm pretty screwed up.
Didn't you hear?

695
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:23,433
Someone shot Kevin Duncan.
He's dead.

696
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:25,513
- The sandwich guy?
- We were thinking that

697
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,453
the two deaths were connected.

698
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,853
- Fine. Yeah, I killed him, too.
- She killed him, too.

699
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:36,642
Okay, I'd prefer that we not pursue
this line of questioning.

700
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:48,540
Well, she confessed.

701
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:50,422
She got it wrong.
She forgot about the pipe.

702
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,613
- Well, she said they fought.
- She's lying.

703
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:55,431
You know, I'm just trying to think
of a situation so bad where...

704
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:58,112
a girl would confess to murder
to try and get out of it.

705
00:31:58,115 --> 00:31:59,673
It's just...

706
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:02,693
Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan.

707
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,701
Mrs. Duncan.

708
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,403
Do you want to sit down,
have a cup of coffee?

709
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:08,102
No, thank you.

710
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:10,573
I'm sorry for your loss.

711
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,701
Did Kelly Morris kill Dylan?

712
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,483
Well, she confessed.

713
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:16,853
And now you think
she killed my husband, as well?

714
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:18,201
It's very possible.

715
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:20,491
I'd believe that before
I'd believe she killed Dylan.

716
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:22,942
Kelly shouldn't take the blame.

717
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,283
You'll find one bullet missing.

718
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:36,661
You're confessing
to your husband's murder?

719
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:40,671
He used me to get close to young girls.

720
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:43,290
I don't know how many through the years.

721
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,011
Francis Duncan, you're under arrest.

722
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:52,013
You have the right to remain silent.

723
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,433
- Anything you say can and will be used
- Thank you.

724
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:55,852
against you in a court of law.

725
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:58,581
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney,

726
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:00,282
one will be...
Pick up the gun.

727
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,420
Ballistics confirm that the bullet that

728
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:06,660
killed Kevin Duncan came
from Fran Duncan's gun.

729
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:09,172
- Case closed?
- On Kevin Duncan, definitely.

730
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:10,761
And since Kelly Morris has confessed...

731
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,111
No, she didn't do it.

732
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:14,173
What evidence do you have of that?

733
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:16,202
How about this?

734
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:19,432
Specimen 268, right corner
of the room schematic.

735
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:22,903
- You are good.
- Oh, you have no idea.

736
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:25,101
Are you having a moment?

737
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:28,823
Well, how does finding the pipe prove
that Kelly Morris is lying?

738
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:31,112
How does her confession not
include the murder weapon?

739
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,772
For the last time, the pipe
is not the murder weapon.

740
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:35,733
Dylan Krane died from a 50-foot fall.

741
00:33:35,735 --> 00:33:38,200
Can you run the scenario
through your magic...

742
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:40,343
holographic...
crystal ball... thingy?

743
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:43,663
Too many variables.
But I have another idea.

744
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:47,861
Okay, Booth, you're Dylan Krane.

745
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,243
Okay, you know what?
I'm out the door.

746
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:51,771
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Cam...

747
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:52,870
Kelly Morris, right.

748
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:54,110
Okay, I feel stupid.

749
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,253
Okay, you two...
You are young.

750
00:33:56,258 --> 00:33:58,322
You are in love.
You're about to break up,

751
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,093
but this is very tragic.

752
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:02,202
It's very emotionally fraught.

753
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:06,120
Kelly Morris says she argued with Dylan
and pushed him out the window.

754
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,753
She pushed him, then tried to save him
by grabbing his arm?

755
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:11,553
Well, that would explain the
fingernail polish in the scratch, but...

756
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:14,251
Not the oxidized iron.

757
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:16,862
Kelly would've had to strike him
with the pipe from behind

758
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,821
and then drive him through the glass.

759
00:34:18,826 --> 00:34:21,523
But she said that they were
arguing face-to-face.

760
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,882
He would have seen her coming.

761
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:26,223
That means there had to be a third person.
Someone who snuck up behind him.

762
00:34:26,225 --> 00:34:27,883
Guys, I need a Kevin Duncan.

763
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:31,411
I'll do it. Kelly already called me a perv,
so I have my motivation.

764
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,902
So Kevin strikes Dylan with the pipe...

765
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,990
- Careful.
- which moves him forward.

766
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:41,341
Kelly grabs the pipe away from him,
but Dylan is losing consciousness.

767
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:43,863
He didn't have to throw Dylan
out the window.

768
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,190
- He could have simply pushed him.
- Easy.

769
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:47,611
Kelly grabs his arm.

770
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,862
- To save him.
- Which would put the fingernails

771
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:52,381
and rust in the wound.

772
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,651
But she can't hold him, and he falls.

773
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,762
Oh!

774
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,611
Well, that theory explains
the physical evidence.

775
00:35:01,618 --> 00:35:02,673
Except,

776
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:06,633
why would Kelly confess to murder
to protect Kevin Duncan?

777
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,173
She's afraid of him.

778
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:09,713
But she knows he's dead.

779
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,543
Guys...

780
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:17,323
there's only two people in this world
that Kelly Morris would cover for.

781
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:21,253
One of them went out that window.

782
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:24,871
- We know you didn't kill Dylan.
- I did, too.

783
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:27,720
Kelly, I don't want you to admit
to anything more, all right?

784
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,832
No, you didn't.

785
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,520
We can prove there was
a third person there.

786
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:35,832
The third person
that hit Dylan with a pipe

787
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:39,713
and when you took away the pipe,
pushed him through the glass.

788
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:43,762
No, it was just me. I hit him with a pipe.
I pushed him through the glass.

789
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:46,313
No, you grabbed his arm.
You tried to save him.

790
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:47,612
No.

791
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:04,863
Dylan made you feel like you weren't
alone in this world.

792
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:07,062
Right?

793
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,523
He was sweet to you.

794
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:14,123
He took so much weight off your shoulders.

795
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:17,300
He was good to Alex.

796
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,381
And when...

797
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:25,852
Dylan said that you'd be together always,
you believed him.

798
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:31,183
Yes.
Yes, I believed him.

799
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:33,473
And when Suzanne...

800
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:38,103
couldn't take care of both you and Alex,
you had an idea.

801
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,673
Run away with Dylan.

802
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:46,630
Maybe Suzanne will keep Alex,

803
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:49,720
and everybody will be happy.

804
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,940
Dylan loved me.

805
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,153
I know.

806
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,731
But I didn't tell Alex.

807
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,181
He just...

808
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:10,403
He just... he thought that Dylan was
trying to take me away from him forever.

809
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:15,031
I...

810
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,323
I did it all wrong. It's not...

811
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:20,090
it's not Alex's fault, it's my fault.

812
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,391
Kelly...

813
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,672
You're 15 years old.

814
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,680
This is not your fault.

815
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,500
The weight of the world
is not on your shoulders.

816
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:46,852
And we can't let you pay
for what Alex did.

817
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:29,961
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

818
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:33,001
I didn't tell them,
they just...

819
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,690
They just knew.

820
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:40,913
It's okay.
Sorry about Dylan.

821
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:14,973
You were right about the pipe.

822
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,050
You were right about the rose.

823
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:22,133
Could I sit for a moment?

824
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:28,060
I wish you would eat some of these fries,
save me from myself.

825
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,382
They're really good with
the garlic mayonnaise.

826
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:36,033
- We have a problem.
- Uh-huh.

827
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:38,981
Do you see a solution?

828
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,853
It's not completely... my fault.

829
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:47,741
I was a foster child.

830
00:40:48,627 --> 00:40:50,543
And apparently...

831
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,361
Booth says that...

832
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,540
Booth says that I have...

833
00:40:55,026 --> 00:40:59,081
something about control issues
and the weight of the world.

834
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,431
That sounds like Booth.

835
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:03,800
I think he meant that...

836
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:07,430
if I'm going to share
responsibility for these cases,

837
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:11,393
I'm going to have to learn...
to stop controlling everything, too.

838
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,512
Does that make sense?
Psychology's not...

839
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:19,190
I really...
I really hate psychology.

840
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,443
Not everyone's brain
works as fast as yours.

841
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:26,973
I... have to mull sometimes.

842
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:29,201
Are you familiar with that concept?

843
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:32,532
Yes. I just always thought
it was a waste of time.

844
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:36,883
I'm in charge.

845
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:39,321
But out of respect for you,
I could extend...

846
00:41:39,326 --> 00:41:41,493
- Did you ever play Monopoly?
- No.

847
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:44,542
Well, they have this thing called
a "Get Out of Jail" card.

848
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:48,092
Think of it as a free pass
to defy me.

849
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:49,912
No explanation needed.

850
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:53,140
No recriminations,
no repercussions.

851
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:56,772
Well, how...
how many would I get?

852
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,252
- One a week.
- Five per case.

853
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:01,961
Three per week.

854
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:10,431
Booth told you I was a
foster kid, didn't he?

855
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:14,391
Okay, yes, he did, but...

856
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:17,503
he did it with a good heart.

857
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:21,633
And I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't let him know. Please.

858
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:25,000
He's going to know that you told me
the second he sees us together.

859
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,180
It's true.
He's awful like that.

860
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:31,940
He reads people the way that you read
pathology reports or I read bones.

861
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,490
Oh, God, I know.
I hate him.

862
00:42:34,496 --> 00:42:36,861
- Well, I don't really.
- I know.

863
