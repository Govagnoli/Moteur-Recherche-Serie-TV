1
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:06,610
Come on, honey. If we don't leave now,
we don´t get into the club.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,316
I'm just finishing
up a few e-mails.

3
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:09,070
Oh, what?

4
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:12,688
My publisher wants to schedule a book tour
and I'm just confirming dates.

5
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,337
Okay, that can wait, sweetie.

6
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:18,402
The students need help identifying the cause
of a fracture on a lateral epicondyle.

7
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:20,924
TGIF. You heard of that?

8
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:23,867
Yeah. It's some kind of acronym.
But my inbox is full.

9
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,189
We know that's not true.

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,591
And there's a TV show that needs
research. Not that they listen.

11
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:29,296
We're going.

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,996
I really should catalogue that skull. It's in the
museum's exhibit on the French Revolution.

13
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:38,343
Yeah, Pepe LePew is more
important than booze and boys.

14
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:39,984
I don't think that's his name.

15
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:52,054
Tonight the basement club brings to you
a number one DJ around town

16
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:55,026
DJ Rulz

17
00:00:55,987 --> 00:00:59,392
Feels good, doesn't it? Being with
people who are alive.

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,594
It's very stimulating,
I have to admit.

19
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,411
We're so going to
tear it up tonight.

20
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,395
- That's slang, right?
- Right.

21
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,735
Is my costume all right?

22
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,868
Sweetie, it's not a costume, it's a cute
outfit, and yes, it looks perfect.

23
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:12,853
I know, it's very,
very warm in here.

24
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,889
No, because it looks great.

25
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:17,970
We´re so get in check up!

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,065
- I love this music!
- DJ Rulz! He is so hot!

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,157
It's so tribal.

28
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:30,381
- You don´t say tribal, sweetie.
- Why?

29
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,264
Oh, because of
all the black people?

30
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:35,713
Sweetie, just for tonight, have fun,
stop dissecting  and take part.

31
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:38,795
Well, African-Americans aren't the
only ones with a tribal heritage.

32
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,467
You saying we're natives
in some tribe?

33
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,838
Anthropologically speaking,
we're all members of tribes.

34
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,372
You'd better shut your mouth.

35
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:51,510
I just meant hip-hop mirrors the direct visceral
connection you see in tribal communication.

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,108
What?

37
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:56,559
After the Cartesian split he 17th century,
we separated our minds from our bodies,

38
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,386
the numinous from
the animalistic.

39
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,468
Are you calling me
an animal, fool?

40
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,448
No fool, she´s using the Cart foilosophy
to say she's down with the music.

41
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:07,115
Now, who are you
calling a fool, fool?

42
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:08,887
Get out of my way.

43
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,895
We're going.
We're going.

44
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,305
You shouldn't
have done that, bitch.

45
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,228
Are you sure she
can handle this?

46
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,867
No one in our lab knows the first thing
about dealing with a mummy.

47
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,092
I'd have to call her in anyway.

48
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:47,002
She assaulted two agents who were
trying to tape off the body.

49
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,828
They were trying
to compromise the remains.

50
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:51,061
A cloud of meth covered
the dance floor.

51
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,287
I think they inhale quite a lot.

52
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:54,209
Are you two high?

53
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:55,851
Only by accident,
so it doesn't count.

54
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:58,502
Wait. Why did you bring Tessa? This doesn't
seem like such a great date.

55
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:02,021
We were out to dinner when he got your call.
Your pupils are the size of saucers.

56
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,700
Get away from the remains!

57
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,176
Bones,  simmer down.

58
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,177
How long is this
going to take?

59
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:08,851
Who the hell wants to know?

60
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:11,886
I'm sorry. He works for me.
I'm Randall Hall. I run this place.

61
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:15,544
You run this place, Mr. Hall. Just so you know,
'cause we, uh, found some drugs on the dead...

62
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:17,271
We found them. We found them.

63
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:19,247
We found some drugs
on the dead guy.

64
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:21,079
We're going to want to know where they
came from, why he had them...

65
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,902
Why?

66
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,337
- Why he had them.
- Why he had them.

67
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,154
Any idea who he is?

68
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:26,788
Any idea?

69
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:30,482
The guy barely looks human. What makes
you think I'd regnize him?

70
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:32,135
Bones...

71
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,496
how did something like this
happen?

72
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:37,086
The Egyptians would give
the body a cedar oil enema

73
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,039
and then rinse it with wine and cover it with
salt. But I don't think that's what happened here.

74
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:41,884
Bones, you are totally wasted.

75
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,346
Zack! Zack!

76
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:45,454
Come here, come here.

77
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,288
n't thIs a beautiful
specimen of mummification?

78
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,015
What's going on?

79
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,605
Let's just say
your boss inhaled.

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,533
See how perfectly drie
and preserved the skin is.

81
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,033
You don't find something
like this every day.

82
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:57,589
Tessa, have you seen it

83
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,127
It's so hard to believe that
you two would be a couple.

84
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:01,803
You know, cop and lawyer.
It's very touching.

85
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,045
I'm going to grab a cab.

86
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,925
Oh, no, oh, okay,
hold on. Well, uh...Sorry.

87
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:10,983
I apologize. Here. I'm going to
make it up to you, I promise. okay?

88
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,064
Ice cream later.

89
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:14,104
-Take care.
- I'll talk to you later.

90
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,105
Talk to you later.

91
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,911
Can we just stick to the
business here? Thank you.

92
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,877
I´m gonna need a list of
your employees, all right?

93
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:26,441
We'll find out-- run them through the system,
see if any one of them have a drug conviction.

94
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,416
How long before
you can ID him?

95
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:32,090
Well I´m not all tired, so I'm sure
I can stay up all night and work.

96
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,457
We have to be careful removing him.
He's very dry and brittle.

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,735
My first modern mummy.

98
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,937
Bones 1x06

99
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:57,768
Trancript: cfsmp3
Sync: Narkond

100
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,022
Crystal meth is made
from cold medicine, lye,

101
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:20,795
and the strike
pads from matchbooks.

102
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,933
The body was not designed to
deal with that kind of assault.

103
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,107
So I'm finding out.

104
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:25,875
Chamomile tea?
It's very soothing.

105
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,181
JI just need your results.

106
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:29,180
How about a stick to pry
the monkey off your back?

107
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,054
Are you sure you need me here?

108
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,685
Payback for showing
me the good life.

109
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:36,555
Ok, so how is my man,
the Tut?

110
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:37,767
In better shape
than I am

111
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:40,008
The meth found in his lungs and nasal passages

112
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,385
matches the meth that juiced
Angela and the good doctor here.

113
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,252
Can you please
keep it clinical?

114
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:48,274
So, uh, he died
of, uh, an overdose.

115
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,233
Asphyxiation.

116
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:55,543
The meth coated the alveoli in his lungs,
making breathing impossible.

117
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,846
So, uh, he, uh, overdosed
with his meth behind the wall?

118
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,185
The little space was too narrow
for him to squeeze through.

119
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:05,806
He got stuck, the bag broke, and when he gasped
for air, he inhaled and died instantaneously.

120
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:09,952
The dry air convection behind the wall removed 
most of the moisture from his body

121
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,163
How long he was, uh, in there?

122
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,495
Judging from the acarid mites
in his ears, I'd say six weeks.

123
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:16,843
Hey, didn't he have hands?

124
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,412
They're easier to work with
dismembered.

125
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,390
I've rehydrated them so we
can get some fingerprints.

126
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,751
- Off that?
- Sure.

127
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,894
You ever been
to Costa Rica?

128
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,429
I was flown down once.
They found a human skull...

129
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:41,009
12,000 years old

130
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,899
Why?

131
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,108
I'm finally getting some vacation time.
I was gonna head off on Thursday.

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,545
Heard Costa Rica was beautiful.

133
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:56,226
Yes. Fascinating wildlife,
lots of parrots.

134
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:58,803
Oh, I don't like parrots. No.

135
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:03,418
People should really, really do all the
talking, you know. Maybe I should...

136
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,769
Oh God! What are
you doing?

137
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:11,630
The Aztecs would flay people and then
wear their skin as a bodysuit.

138
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:15,391
I guess you won't be needing
mittens for Christmas.

139
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,287
Did the FBI find a match?

140
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:25,558
Yup. His name
is Roy Taylor.

141
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:28,171
Roy Taylor?
You're kidding.

142
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:29,523
It's DJ Mount!

143
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,058
I don't know
who that is.

144
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:35,330
Mount is one of the best DJs in DC.
He used to play at the club.

145
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,378
Everyone was wondering
what happened to him.

146
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:41,086
His album is really going
to take off after this.

147
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,355
Never knew this side
of you, Bones.

148
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,150
It's DJ Mount.

149
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,499
You're hung over. Does this make
your head explode?

150
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,080
I grabbed a couple hours sleep
on my couch

151
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,135
and showered in the lab's
decontamination room.

152
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,477
You really know how to live.

153
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,986
JmsJay, Tupac, Biggie...

154
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,701
Do you even know who
you're talking about?

155
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:11,131
Yeah, I've done my Googling.

156
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:13,143
Listen...

157
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,570
you can hear the alpha
male asserting himself.

158
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:22,262
eah, fill your ass
up... with lead?!

159
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:23,263
Always a nice lyric.

160
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:27,171
I'm heading back to the club
to meet the FBI forensics team.

161
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,383
I'm getting facts.

162
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,202
DJ Mount

163
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:37,912
was starting to break,
finally making some money.

164
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:41,455
Someone who's never had anything,
that can go to your head.

165
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,962
So, he gets involved
with drugs.

166
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:50,107
You didn't know who he was hanging with
or who might have been chasing him?

167
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:54,196
Dude like Mount,
he had a lot of enemies--

168
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:57,846
other artists, rivalries.
Everyone wants to be number one.

169
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:01,169
I mean, you have to know
who the rivals are, Mr. Hall. q

170
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:03,952
It affects your bottom line.

171
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:06,321
Wait for me by the elevator.

172
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:17,839
Rulz.

173
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:18,878
What rules?

174
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:22,348
That's his name. He performs at the club.

175
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,803
I'm trying to keep my crew
together, Agent Booth,

176
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,011
but I always had to run
interference between those two

177
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:33,290
Why?

178
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,370
Ask Rulz.

179
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:43,974
Was it fun coming to the club?

180
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:48,846
Yeah, before the drugs and the
dead body. Tilt... tilt down.

181
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:54,776
It seems so primitive, being in a
crowd of strangers, gyrating to music.

182
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,186
You never dance.

183
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,189
I've been told I look like a marionette
in a wind storm.

184
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:01,028
You would've fit
right in last night.

185
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:02,171
Really?

186
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:06,822
Footprints. In the dirt
and the termite shavings.

187
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:09,007
Someone was on the
other side of him.

188
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:09,945
Light.

189
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:12,311
This leads to the outside.

190
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,952
- We need to get inside that wall.
- Or take it down.

191
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,123
One last look?

192
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:22,073
Take them in, show them around.

193
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,394
- Agent Booth?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,428
Roy Taylor´s father.
Maybe you know him as DJ Mount.

195
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,818
- Mr. Taylor, please come in.
- Thank you for seeing me.

196
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,387
Please sit.

197
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,989
You're the one looking
into my son's murder?

198
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:47,331
Investigating his death,
yes, sir.

199
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,093
I'm sorry for your loss.

200
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,184
I have some information
you need.

201
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,437
- About your son's death?
- No, sir.

202
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,683
About his life.

203
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:04,270
I've been readingin the newspaper. how my son was
a part of the meth scene.

204
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,736
Now  he was killed by drugs,
behind the wall right there.

205
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,965
What my son did...

206
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,319
was graduate third
in his class from high school.

207
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,003
He would have graduated first...except he...

208
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,830
he worked
a full-time job.

209
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,941
Track-and-eld medals.

210
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,132
Baseball.

211
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:38,787
Roy never drank, and he never did drugs.
Do you understand me, sir?

212
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:39,704
Mr. Taylor...

213
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:43,302
How they are portraying my boy
in the newspapers is wrong.

214
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:46,174
If his mother was alive
it would kill her.

215
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:50,276
I taught him a relationship with Jesus.

216
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,399
Do you understand, sir?

217
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,449
A personal relationship
with Jesus.

218
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:02,017
With all due respect, sir, sometimes when kids
grow up they change.

219
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:04,609
They move away from
what they were taught.

220
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,663
Five years old,
he made this.

221
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:19,064
And a lady who...
who reads palms

222
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,776
she looked at it and she said...

223
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,631
she said my boy
was going to be a great man.

224
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,186
A good man.

225
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:36,627
He read no evil
inhat boy'hand.

226
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,007
I can see that now, sir.

227
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:57,504
Some iniquity killed my boy.

228
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:07,040
You know that word, Agent Booth?
It's from the Bible.

229
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:09,939
"Deliver me...

230
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:12,910
from
the workers of iniquity...

231
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,181
and save me from bloody men."

232
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:26,029
You know your salms.

233
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:38,848
I can trust that you will find
out what happened to my boy?

234
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,597
Yes, sir.

235
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:43,936
Good.

236
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,964
Then I'm glad
I came by.

237
00:13:56,743 --> 00:14:00,005
Can we conform to as much
forensic protocol as possible?

238
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,937
We're better at this
than you think.

239
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:06,316
You know what those are?

240
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:07,531
Rats.

241
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,958
intensive scare of rats

242
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,955
eat the laces
right out of our boots.

243
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:13,645
Take it easy there, Willard.

244
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,269
Here are the footprints.

245
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,783
There are marks on the wall.

246
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:22,426
It's scraped.

247
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,166
Bloosmear... dried.

248
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,494
I see something. Can I retrieve?

249
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,364
Yes.

250
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,887
Apparently, there's
a rivalry between Mount

251
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,591
and this guy Rulz.

252
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:05,813
We saw him perform at the club
last night. Did you talk to him?

253
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:07,778
Oh, no. I don't have
enough yet.

254
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:10,974
I go in too soon,
he could run.

255
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:13,673
Wow, that's a beautiful piece.
Zirconium or diamond?

256
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:17,435
I'm more focused on the dried blood
and flesh at the moment.

257
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:19,164
You buy Tessa jewelry?

258
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,971
I... I really don't want
to talk about that right now.

259
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:25,663
Too much of a commitment? I just thought
because, you two were going away.

260
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:26,993
Do you have anything yet?

261
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:32,886
Given the rate of air convection, and the
degree of dehydration of the flesh,

262
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,292
I'd say they were there
at the same time.

263
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,456
Must hurt like hell to get that thing
ripped out of your belly button.

264
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,044
- I thought it was an earring.
- Look at the size of the stud.

265
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:46,462
I had one  of these. Before they
became totally Miami-divorcee.

266
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:48,951
Good news. I was able
to pull some particulates.

267
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:51,985
Are those, uh...?

268
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:56,294
Eyeballs? Yeah. Two types of
foreign material in the eyes--

269
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:59,571
low-density polyethylene residue
and methamphetamine crystals.

270
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,608
Polyethylene?

271
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:02,760
Came from the plastic bag
holding the meth.

272
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,307
This can be cleaned now.

273
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:09,168
Yeah! That's a real diamond.

274
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,665
Why don't you get her
a belly button ring?

275
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:13,376
That's not too much
of a commitment.

276
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:14,448
Yeah, that's great.

277
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:18,279
The inside of the lips was damaged by the teeth.
This was not an accidental inhalation.

278
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:19,280
The meth was pushed against his face
with force.

279
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,021
Someone was
to smother him.

280
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:26,240
Which would explain how the
particulates got into the eye.

281
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,779
So he didn't OD.
He was murdered.

282
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,620
So we just have to find out
who owns this belly button ring.

283
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:36,809
Look at this.
"Luv Rulz."

284
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:40,264
At least we know who to ask.

285
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,210
Hello.

286
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:48,819
Yeah, it's open.

287
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,748
Yeah, it's open. FBI.
Special Agent Booth

288
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:55,393
Is the FBI recruiting
from America's Top Model now?

289
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:57,783
I'm a forensic anthropologist
at the Jeffersonian.

290
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,352
She works for the FBI.

291
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,566
Yeah, I can live with that.

292
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,817
Dr. Brennan also discovered
that Roy Taylor was murdered.

293
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:04,441
So?

294
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:08,899
So, murder is wacked. See, 'cause those
are the rules... Rulz.

295
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,419
Maybe he had it
come to me.

296
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,191
Oh, so you and Roy Taylor
don't get along.

297
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:19,633
That sucker ran me down, man. Tried to slam me
on one of his tracks, and ain't nobody do that.

298
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:23,222
And, uh... what happens
when they do?

299
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:24,893
I take a piece of them.

300
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:30,232
I got in his face one night at the Bassment.
told to disappear, and I ain't seen him since.

301
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,428
'Cause he knew
to follow the Rulz.

302
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:41,880
And, uh, maybe your girlfriend made sure
that your...your problem just went away.

303
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:45,479
That ain't my woman no more. I kicked
her sorry ass a months ago.

304
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,612
What is her sorry ass name?

305
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:48,853
Eve Warren.

306
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:50,274
What was she doing
with Mount?

307
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,112
Take a guess. I guess it was just
his turn.

308
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:54,214
She kept your ring?

309
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,611
It's a diamond, man.
Why she gonna get rid of that?

310
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,572
Any idea where she is now?

311
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,416
Probably ripping somebody
else off.

312
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:04,862
That girl don't care about nobody but herself.
Even though she got a kid,

313
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,431
don't care about
her neither.

314
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:07,797
Let her brother shoulder that.

315
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:08,729
Bitch.

316
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,821
What happened to your hand?

317
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:13,685
I got shot through the wrist
a few years ago.

318
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,980
Shattered the lower radius
and the pisiform.

319
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,574
Yeah. I got some nerve damage, too.

320
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:20,873
That's impressive

321
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:24,032
Yeah! I got shot in the back and through
the leg, too. You want to see the scars?

322
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:25,264
Thanks anyway.

323
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:28,278
Let us know if you hear
from Eve Warren.

324
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:32,212
That's all I got for y'all.
I'm gonna get back to work.

325
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,854
Let us know
if you hear from her.

326
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,010
Bones?

327
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,124
I like this music.

328
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,200
Okay, how about this: DJ Mount trusted Eve
because they were sleeping together.

329
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,421
So she meets him in the wall,
takes the drugs,

330
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:57,704
kill him for Rulz then he takes off.

331
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,044
You should write fiction.

332
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:00,406
What? It's reasonable.

333
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:03,145
It´s not based on evidences
It's conjecture.

334
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:05,831
Look, I'm positing a scenario.
We've been through this before.

335
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:10,267
Yeah, and it always seems to be a waste
of time. Now, finding a marker on a bone...

336
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,199
ow. You know, I think I need a vacation.
I think you do, too.

337
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:14,992
I'm not the one who's snippy.

338
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:18,067
Snippy? What are you, 70?

339
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:22,978
See what I mean? I think you should find
a nice, relaxing place to go on that vacation.

340
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:26,539
Somewhere where you can get a
massage, maybe do some yoga.

341
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,361
I don't do yoga. Okay, push-ups, sit-ups,
pull-ups, that's what I do.

342
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:32,135
That's more cardiovascular.
Yoga deals more with...

343
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,451
Why exactly are
we talking aut this?

344
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:35,709
Because you're tense.

345
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,952
Because we're talking.

346
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,464
You switched my music.

347
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,340
- Roy Taylor?
- Yes.

348
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,681
Anything pop out at you
now that the bones are clean?

349
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,350
There's some damage to the facet joint and
foramen on C-4 on the right side of the neck.

350
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,956
That suggests his head
was forced that way.

351
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,837
One other thing. I was looking the
skull through the microscope

352
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:09,782
came across a slight depression.
Barely discernible.

353
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,830
Slight indentation?

354
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:15,897
Could be congenital or a bone anomaly.

355
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,446
Probably.

356
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,162
Do you ever go on vacation?

357
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:25,532
I take my vacation
when you take your vacation.

358
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:26,458
What do you do?

359
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:29,344
Go back home to Michigan.
See the family.

360
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:33,123
I have three brothers
and four sisters.

361
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,517
Do you enjoy that?

362
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:35,596
God, no.

363
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,588
I made the mistake of telling them. I work with
corpses and skeletons. They think I'm a freak.

364
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,379
Then why do you go?

365
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:46,632
It's my family.
They love me.

366
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:53,505
Take a closer look he anomaly under the scanning
microscope. See what made that mark.

367
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:57,059
Work it out, work it out.
That's right. Good, good, good.

368
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,700
Yeah, let's work,
let's work.

369
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,413
What do you want?

370
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:09,096
Special Agent Booth, FBI.

371
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:10,631
This is my associate
Dr. Brennan.

372
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:13,222
- What you call this?
- The Krump.

373
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:17,983
The kids-- they come her they dance.
They don't gangbang.

374
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,687
So what do you want?

375
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,807
You didn't come here
for a dance lesson.

376
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,983
Hi, Maya. How
you doing, baby?

377
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:32,817
Come on now. We're going to go outside
and gonna play with the rest of the kids, okay?

378
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:33,959
There you go.

379
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:37,242
We'd like to ask you a few questions
about your sister Eve.

380
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:40,372
What's she done now?

381
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,412
When was the last
time you saw her?

382
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,154
About six weeks ago
when she dropped off Maya.

383
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,142
Just dropped her off
and left?

384
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,262
Told me she needed me to watch her
for a couple days. Left me some money.

385
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:57,112
Did you, um, happen to have a, I don't know,
recent photo that we could take?

386
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,327
Evie said she had
cleaned herself out

387
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:05,583
She was turning her life around,

388
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,059
and I believed her.

389
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,750
And she never
came back.

390
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:15,405
So that little girl out there,
that's her daughter.

391
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,113
She's like a daughter
to me, too.

392
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,337
Didn´t it bother you that Eve never came back?
I mean, didn't you go look for her?

393
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,128
I learned to let her go.

394
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:32,110
And Eve, she's had a lot of problems.
Drugs, hanging out with the wrong people.

395
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:35,222
I mean, if I track her down and
she takes Maya before she's ready...

396
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:38,386
I'm not letting nothin' happen
to that little girl.

397
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,149
Do you know
Roy Taylor?

398
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,070
Met him. DJ Mount.I like his stuff.
He's pure. Play it for the kids.

399
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,641
We have reason to believe that she
was with him the night was murdered.

400
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:50,571
Murdered?

401
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:53,999
You can't find Evie?

402
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:54,902
No.

403
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:01,891
She told me she loved him.

404
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:08,011
And ... she and Mount were gonna
take Maya away out of DC...

405
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,679
give her a better life,
one we never had.

406
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,486
She said she left you some cash.

407
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:13,212
Yeah.

408
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:15,526
For Maya.

409
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:17,571
I'll buy what you have,
two dollars to one.

410
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:20,431
Sure, man...

411
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:32,920
You may want the stooges the FBI...who
are experts, due to your so-called "drug war"--

412
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,211
to run a comparison, but I'd say
the methamphetamine on these bills

413
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:38,734
matches the meth found
with DJ Mount behind the wall.

414
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:43,389
And my guess is that Eve was with Mount
at the time that he was murdered.

415
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,604
How about this, huh?

416
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,992
DJ Mount rejects Eve because
of her questionable past.

417
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:55,724
So, uh, hey, she gets mad, she wants
to leave with some money, so, uh...

418
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:58,938
What?

419
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,094
Yeah, I don't really think much
about that kind of stuff.

420
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,418
I'm more about bugs
and minerals. Sorry.

421
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:05,799
Oh, come on, Hodgins, hey,
you're a smart guy, you're a smart guy.

422
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,980
Look up from your microscope, huh?

423
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,446
These are real people
we're trying to figure out here.

424
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,112
Maybe she was just using Mount, setting him up
to get his drugs and money.

425
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:17,020
Very nice, Hodgins.

426
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,025
Yeah?

427
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,111
Yeah.

428
00:24:20,908 --> 00:24:22,953
Real question is,
where does she go next?

429
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,636
You're on fire, man.

430
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:28,737
After she left her brother's place, because
that is where she met her untimely end.

431
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:31,652
You know what? I'm gonna turn
you into an investigator yet.

432
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:35,675
No, no, no, no. Bugs and slimede,
that is where I'm happy.

433
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:50,674
The damage to his C-4 vertebra was the result
of his head being twisted so far to the right.

434
00:24:50,674 --> 00:24:53,969
He was moving this way, toward Eve.

435
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:55,453
My bet is he was chasing her.

436
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,551
And that's based on...?

437
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:00,319
Money and meth.

438
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:04,702
She left that corridor carrying money
saturated in the same meth that killed Mount.

439
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:06,086
She was moving fast.

440
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,508
She didn't even stop when
her belly ring got ripped out.

441
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,686
Hey, money's a pretty good
reason to get chased, hm?

442
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:13,205
Only question is,
why wasn't he facing her?

443
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,416
It got thigh back there.
15 centimeters.

444
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,318
Eve ripped out
her belly button ring here,

445
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,765
and then left a smear of blood
until the corridor widened. Here.

446
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:30,991
What?

447
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:34,707
That just...makes me a little sick.

448
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:39,407
You pick dead bodies out of mass graves, and
yanking out a belly button ring makes you sick?

449
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:42,251
Okay, okay, moving on. All right, I've shot
a lot of people on my time

450
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:45,096
and I got to admit, that whole belly
button thing makes me nauseous, too.

451
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:46,186
Thank you

452
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:50,037
At this point, Mount must have looked
behind him but kept going.

453
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:55,103
Then the passageway narrowed, so he
couldn't turn his head back toward Eve.

454
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:58,557
Then there's no way she could've shove
the meth into his face...

455
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:00,226
Eve didn't kill him.

456
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,950
A third person surprised them--
that's why he turned his head to look.

457
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,005
Mount's body prevented this third person
from getting to Eve, so she escaped.

458
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:10,321
But he got to Mount and shoved the meth
in his face and he killed him. Ah.

459
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:14,816
But the real question is, who the hell
is this third person?

460
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:23,554
Why the hell you pick me up, man?

461
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,450
I think you know why
I brought you in.

462
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,324
Yeah, right.

463
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:31,576
I waited for you to contact me, explain your
situation, but you didn't do that.

464
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,281
That's not polite.

465
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:38,331
What are you, DEA?
Metro cop?

466
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:41,418
I'm Special Agent Ronald Oakes.

467
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:43,162
One of us?

468
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,413
My orders were not to break
deep cover for anybody.

469
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:48,676
Out of deep regard for my FBI brother...

470
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,519
I gave you the nod.

471
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,258
That's bull.

472
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:59,385
I made you. Now you're making excuses.

473
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:01,717
Got any keys
for these cuffs?

474
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:04,562
Fine. Have it your way.

475
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:10,435
You know I need more than aod, man.
I'm conducting a murder investigation.

476
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,447
Now, I need to know
what you know.

477
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:16,235
Been 15 months
on the task force

478
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:20,438
investigating the links between
the urban music business and gang activity.

479
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,167
So that's why you got next
to Randall Hall.

480
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,502
"Randall Hall" is a clean alias.
You ran him, right?

481
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:24,949
Yeah.

482
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:25,818
Came back clean?

483
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:28,762
Exactly. His real name
is Terence Baskin.

484
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:34,234
Now, we know... that he's
pushing meth through the club.

485
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:37,441
But we can't get enough to touch him.
Our informants disappeared.

486
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:40,222
They either get bought off
or they get killed.

487
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:41,228
What about this murder?

488
00:27:41,263 --> 00:27:45,861
The night that DJ Mount disappeared, Hall got
ripped of for a mountain of meth and a ton of cash.

489
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:47,704
DJ Mount ripped of all?

490
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:51,014
Nah, doesn't scan. Mount was into
Jesus, not chalk.

491
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:53,449
Hall killed DJ Mount.

492
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:56,070
Hall has people do that
type of stuff for him.

493
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:02,010
So listen, anybody asks...
why'd you have me arrested?

494
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,228
Weapons beef.

495
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,761
- So I don't get my gun back.
- No. No.

496
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:11,747
We meet up again...

497
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:15,762
if you get an excuse, hit me.

498
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:20,468
Oh... count on it.

499
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:28,464
I've been investigated for years. Why do
you think they never got me on anything?

500
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,249
'Cause you're so smart?

501
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:34,750
Because Terence Baskin
is my past.

502
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:37,518
I am 100% clean now.

503
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,981
This is my life now.
This and my recorrd label.

504
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:45,017
Not crystal meth,

505
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:46,859
not gang-banging.

506
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,362
Yet much of the iconic
quality of urban music lies

507
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:54,084
in the perceived or actual rivalry
between the principal artists.

508
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,822
Where did you find her?

509
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:58,658
Museum.

510
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:04,917
Was the rivalry between Mount
and Mr. Rulz strong enough to...

511
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,776
lead to murder?

512
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:08,674
Sure, they were
both capable.

513
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:12,813
Add in the fact that Mount was
sleeping with Rulz' girlfriend Eve.

514
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,213
Yeah, in fact...

515
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:14,717
Yeah?

516
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:18,106
Rulz built himself a studio
around that time.

517
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:22,037
Poured cement for the pad
a day after they disappeared

518
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:22,619
So...?

519
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:25,165
I'm saying, Mount's dead,

520
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,710
Eve's gone missing.

521
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:31,026
You might want to consider that.

522
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:34,415
Let's go.

523
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,500
What do you think?

524
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,415
Oh, I think, uh, I think we need to find a way
to find a body buried under a slab of cement.

525
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,607
Well, can't you
get a warrant?

526
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,760
To look around the premises,
maybe, but no way to tear it up.

527
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:51,429
Well, let me make
a phone call.

528
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:56,988
Tutti's traveled the world
finding dead bodies.

529
00:29:57,248 --> 00:29:59,259
Does Tutti always drool like that?

530
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,254
What, I'm gonna hurt
her... his feelings?

531
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:07,788
Tutti is the best cadaver dog
in the world, Agent Booth.

532
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:11,122
It's true. If you were a dead body,
you'd want Tutti looking for you.

533
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:16,022
How can it smell anything
buried under a building?

534
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,779
he can

535
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:23,787
Once, I saw Tutti find a dead body wraped
in plastic, under concrete, after four years.

536
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:27,610
Tutti can smell decaying blood on a tooth six
feet underground.

537
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,760
I mean, so what?
He drools a little.
What's up with that?

538
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,711
You know, your eyes are kind of
close together, but I don't comment.

539
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,688
I apologize.

540
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:39,059
Is he sincere?

541
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:40,317
Yeah.

542
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,494
All right, then,
we accept.

543
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:48,994
Good boy, Tutti.
Tutti found something.

544
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:50,290
Oh, maybe he's just lazy.

545
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,497
Lying down is his indicator.

546
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:55,927
Tutti found it. There's a body
under here.

547
00:30:56,783 --> 00:30:59,970
You should get a warrant to bring
a jackhammer for this floor.

548
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:03,823
I'd start digging here.

549
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:10,638
Dental records confirm
that this is Eve Warren.

550
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:13,751
Insect activity confirms she died
around the same time DJ Mount did.

551
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:15,602
Where did Booth go?
I got to give him the news.

552
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:17,898
- His girlfriend brought him a change of shirt.
- They're up in the lounge.

553
00:31:18,322 --> 00:31:19,785
Zack, clean the bones.

554
00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:22,698
We've already got cause of death
and identity-- what am I looking for?

555
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:26,150
It might be grasping but that odd
mark we found on Mount's skull,

556
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:29,466
see if you can find anything
like it on Eve's remains.

557
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:32,233
Jamaica?
God, that's incredible.

558
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,662
Mm, it's a bed-and-breakfast.
There are these coral cliffs.

559
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:38,320
Snorkeling, kayaking...

560
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,002
you two are so ready for the
pre-shacking-up test vacation.

561
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:44,939
What do you mean?

562
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:46,582
You have keys
to each other's places.

563
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:49,417
You've done the weekend away
a couple times.

564
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:52,424
Yeah, it's time for the ten-day vacation.

565
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:58,428
You know, Jamaica's like a dry run for living
together, only with rum punch and steel drums.

566
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,601
Yeah, see you later.

567
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:03,513
Living together?
Silly.

568
00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:05,696
Thanks, you know, for
bringing me a shirt.

569
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:06,643
Yeah, okay.

570
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:08,685
I'll talk to you later.
Yeah.

571
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,348
- Hi, Tessa.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

572
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,493
- It's Eve Warren.
- Eve Warren.

573
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,498
- Uh, cause of death?
- Same as Mount.

574
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:22,029
- Meth overdose.
- Pushed in the face, but there's more.

575
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,826
I don't think that
Rulz killed her.

576
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:26,279
- She was buried under his studio.
- But her wrist was broken.

577
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:30,943
Bone damage indicates
that was taken from behind

578
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:32,763
and smash into wall

579
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:42,264
Her skull shows damage to both the infraorbital
and supraorbital margins and the zygomatic process.

580
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,733
Zygo-zu...? You said
she was killed by crystal meth.

581
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:50,179
She was. She would've been hurt and stunned by the
blow but not killed, certainly not immediately.

582
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:52,689
A bag of crystal meth
was placed over her face

583
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:56,274
actually ground into wounds,
into the airway.

584
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:59,780
Rulz couldn't have smashed her
into a wall?

585
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:03,217
Her radius was separated
from the scaphoid and trapezium.

586
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,128
Her right wrist was twisted hard
behind her back.

587
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:09,745
There's damage to both the elbow
and the shoulder, as well.

588
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:13,940
For that to happen, Eve's attacker would've had
to twist her arm up with his right hand

589
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:17,428
while jamming the crystal meth
into her face with the other.

590
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,042
Both with a great deal of force.

591
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:24,311
Rulz had been shot twice in the right hand.
I got it. He had nerve damage.

592
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:27,395
There´s no way he had the
strength to kill Eve Warren

593
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,125
You did not murder
Eve Warren.

594
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:40,093
This is a weird kind
of interrogation, huh?

595
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:42,023
Cops telling me
what I didn't do.

596
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:46,408
Well, then, do me a favor:tell me Bones
is wrong and confess to a murder.

597
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,669
Hell, no, man. What you think,
I'm some type of idiot?

598
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:51,486
Well, do me a favor,
deny it.

599
00:33:52,274 --> 00:33:55,634
See, you got tricks. You gonna
twist all my words around.

600
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,615
Better not say anything at all.

601
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,339
You didn't kill Eve Warren.

602
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:02,796
So you say. The Rulz says
say nothing.

603
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:05,059
- He wants us  hold him.
- Why?

604
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:09,785
Why? Because every time some raper gets murdered,
his business goes straight through the roof.

605
00:34:09,785 --> 00:34:13,651
Why should DJ Mount get the bump, huh?
Maybe it's my turn.

606
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:17,127
I'll tell you what. I'll make you
a better deal.

607
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:20,960
You tell us what we need to know,
and I'll have those charges laid against you,

608
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:22,637
put you in the
Remand Center.

609
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:23,516
For how long?

610
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:25,157
Oh, that depends
on what you tell us.

611
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,905
Wait! Wait! You're negotiating
to put this guy in jail?

612
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:31,167
Sweeten the pot, I'll charge you
with Mount's death, too.

613
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:34,287
You hire one of those
moron lawyers,

614
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:38,133
and you'll be thrown in lock-up for what,
maybe a month.

615
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:38,985
Sweet.

616
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,339
Where am I...
in Backwards World?

617
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:42,382
What have you got?

618
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:45,039
Look, I can tell y'all.

619
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,810
But y'all have to figure out
the rest on your own.

620
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:50,264
We have to figure it out
just from motive?

621
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:53,028
Okay, look, Bones, this is, you know,
sort of my thing.

622
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,033
Man, Mount was going to jump.

623
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:58,837
You mean commit suicide?

624
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:01,207
Where did you find her?

625
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:02,435
The museum.

626
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:05,346
I mean labels. Jump labels.

627
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:11,522
You're saying that DJ Mount was going
to leave Bassment Records?

628
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:15,927
All he needed was the money to buy himself back.
That's why he got himself killed.

629
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,721
Now if Hall even finds out
that I told you all that much,

630
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm going to end up
some dried-out mummy in a wall.

631
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:22,564
But what about Eve?

632
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:24,795
Eve couldn't kill nobody.

633
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,002
Sex 'em to death maybe,

634
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:28,644
but that's about it.

635
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:31,285
Oh, there's
one more thing...

636
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,803
the next day, Hall built me
a new studio.

637
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:38,164
Took it out of my money, too.

638
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,858
So, you gonna put me in jail?

639
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:48,125
EWell, you know, hey,
it's the least we can do, hmm?

640
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,056
Hey, how about this? Hall's got motive to kill
Mount. Why? Because he's jumping labels

641
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:58,041
and he's running away with some girl
who's stealing Mount's meth and money.

642
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:02,766
I'm starting to see how
this whole motive thing works.

643
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:03,982
Thank you.

644
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:06,812
It's still murky
psychological guesswork, though.

645
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:11,032
Dr. Brennan, I found a mark
on Eve Warren

646
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:12,294
here

647
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:13,948
on the manubrium.

648
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:16,980
Compare it to the mark
on Mount.

649
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:20,609
Okay, Eve tells Mount that
he wants to start a new life.

650
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:25,342
So she rips off the dope and the cash
thinking she can build a new future with it.

651
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:29,264
It's a story, Booth.You need to find
something real.

652
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,084
For what? I mean, it feels real
to me...I mean, Eve is a woman in love,

653
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:36,964
whs trying to escape a world
that's just crushing her.

654
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,310
Mount finds out how much trouble the woman
he's in love with is in,

655
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,647
so he gives up his own life to protect her
It's not enough.

656
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,854
They were hoping for a better life
and they both wind up dead.

657
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,398
Looks like a match.

658
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:13,949
Thanks.

659
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:15,368
Good job.

660
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,387
- What the hell is that?
- Not sure.

661
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:21,384
It's a bone dimple. But they both have it,
so it can't be genetic.

662
00:37:21,384 --> 00:37:24,094
Something external caused it,
but I'm not sure what.

663
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:26,315
Randall Hall.

664
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:28,256
He's behind this.

665
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:31,345
Randall Hall... okay, he killed
these two people.

666
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:33,886
We know it; he did it.
We just can't touch him.

667
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:38,281
And there's no evidence linking
him to the drugs, the cash or either body.

668
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:40,691
Except f a couple
of damn bone dimples.

669
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:44,570
I'll keep looking at the remains...
maybe find the evidence we need.

670
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:46,762
I can't let it stand.

671
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:47,234
What?

672
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:50,488
You know what? I'm going to spread the pain.
Okay? That's my new motto.

673
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,153
Wait! I can help spread pain.

674
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:54,723
Wait!

675
00:37:57,982 --> 00:37:59,054
We know you did it.

676
00:37:59,353 --> 00:37:59,933
What?

677
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,393
Killed Mount in that wall so that he wouldn't
leave your label.

678
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,808
You killed Eve Warren.

679
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:06,861
Killed her and buried her
under Rulz's studio.

680
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:11,740
In the meantime,this i going to have
to remain an active crime scene.

681
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,850
That's harassment.
I'll sue.

682
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,532
Well, I'm going to harass you
every chance I get.

683
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:23,654
I'm not somebody
you want to mess with.

684
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,105
Did you just poke me?

685
00:38:32,651 --> 00:38:35,828
Did he just poke me
with his little stick?

686
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:39,657
This is my place. I want to poke
someone, I do it.

687
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:48,390
All right, how easily
do you think I scare?

688
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,165
Hey, Booth?

689
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,859
Don't break the cane. Arrest him
and confiscate the cane as evidence.

690
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:55,461
I need the cane.

691
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:58,267
Arrest him for what? He's the guy
who pointed a gun at a federal agent.

692
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:02,331
Uttering threats or smelling bad
or anything. It's the cane we want.

693
00:39:03,193 --> 00:39:04,750
Fine, here. Randal Hall

694
00:39:05,939 --> 00:39:10,714
I am placing you under arrest...
for assault of a federal agent.

695
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:13,109
This will never
go to court.

696
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,208
Oh, let's go find out.

697
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,335
Oh, next time I take your
gun away from you, I'll shoot you.

698
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,694
Well then, I bette not
let you get my gun again.

699
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:25,037
Come on Let´s go!

700
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:36,816
Get this:
I called Tessa,

701
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:39,323
to tell her a cole of places
she should check out in Jamaica...

702
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:41,782
- she's not going.
-  What happened?

703
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:45,687
Well, she said something came up
at work, but I know the truth.

704
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,688
How many times do you want me
to poke Zack?

705
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:50,498
Just once, but
as hard as you can.

706
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:51,490
As hard as he can?

707
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,389
Why don't I hit him
as haras I can?

708
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:56,244
Because you have arms like noodles,
while I am vigorous and burly.

709
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:57,168
What truth?

710
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,622
That all you got, burly boy?

711
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,499
They got freaked out
by Stage Six.

712
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:04,547
What...
what is Stage Six?

713
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:06,569
One: Spend the Night;

714
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:08,204
Two: Spend the Weekend;

715
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:10,269
Three: Exchange Keys;

716
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:12,441
Four: Sexy Weekend Getaway;

717
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:15,898
Five: Extended Vacation;
inevitably folloby Six:

718
00:40:15,898 --> 00:40:17,367
Move in Together.

719
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:21,645
I'm an anthropologist. I know the
stages of everything. You made those up.

720
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,008
I did not.
Yes, you did.

721
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:24,843
They got to Stage Five
and they balked.

722
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:27,084
Not Booth.
Booth did not balk.

723
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:28,852
Sweetie,
it's always the guy.

724
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:30,012
No, Booth is not
a balker.

725
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:33,168
Hey!  The mark on Mount,
the mark on Eve. They're the same.

726
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:35,736
He can't resist hitting them
with that stupid cane.

727
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,121
The end of the cane,
it's a fit for both marks.

728
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:40,763
Hall's the killer.

729
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:45,543
Send the cane, the photos, and the medium
to the FBI. Let them confirm the match.

730
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,813
What, and let them have
all the glory?

731
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,221
My chest hurts.

732
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:50,891
Yeah..
all the glory.

733
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,083
Here's what we know so far:

734
00:40:55,083 --> 00:41:01,295
Evidce linking rap producer Randall Hall
with the death of rising hip-hop ar DJ Mount

735
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,506
led the charges being file today
by the Dtrict Attorney.

736
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:08,056
Information coming to us slowly at this point,
but as soon as details...

737
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,401
Getting yourself
in the mood?

738
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:17,068
Trying.

739
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:23,138
You know, this... really isn't going to be
the type of vacation I hoping for.

740
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:24,356
Oh?

741
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,554
Tessa's not going.

742
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:28,805
Something came up at work.

743
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,166
Too bad.

744
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:32,755
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,622
Hey, I like going
on vacations by myself.

746
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,251
Really?

747
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,496
Sure, nothing wrong
with being alone.

748
00:41:42,026 --> 00:41:44,238
No, I mean,
you like to go on vacation?

749
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:46,696
Yeah, I go places
all the time.

750
00:41:51,388 --> 00:41:56,479
You ever just, you know, sit on the beach?
Pretend there's no such thing as skeletons?

751
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,609
Is that in any way fun?

752
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,757
When was the last time
you got away?

753
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,103
Got away from what?

754
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:10,505
Ah, Bones, you know, 'cause
what usually happens to me...

755
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:14,076
I think
about not coming back.

756
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:16,651
Seriously?

757
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:18,457
Yeah, you know,
you go with someone,

758
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:21,872
you joke about not going back
to your real life..

759
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:25,247
the two of you laugh.

760
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,364
But when you're alone...
the world is full of possibilities.

761
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:39,200
See you next week.
