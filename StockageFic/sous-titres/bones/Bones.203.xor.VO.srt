1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,900
Holy mother of God!

2
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
Ugh,geez!

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,700
Booth,what do we have here?

4
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,600
I bet I know.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
That's.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,100
lasagna.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,300
Fishy rotten cat food and.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,800
vulcanized rubber.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,500
Excellent olfactory talents,Hodgepodge.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,400
What happened?

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,300
Well,it's obvious isn't it?

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,400
A guy tried to beat the yellow light,

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
he got T-boned by a tractor trailer.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,300
Well,what was the semi carrying?

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,800
Aquarium sand,but that's not.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,300
No natural gas or propane?

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,900
No explosion,no fire?

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,700
No corrosive chemicals.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,600
Whatdo you need me for?

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,700
You might want to prepare yourself.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
Or not.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Oh,man.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,900
Okay,how bad does garbage got to stinkto  cover the smell of a dead body?

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,400
I think the victim was a minor.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Okay,well,then,if you agree,

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,900
then this fallsunder FBI jurisdiction.

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,900
It's a male.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
Yes.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
An adolescent.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,800
Flatworms,necrophagous flies and beetles.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,700
,he's been garbage for about three weeks.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,800
Fractures to the cranium,sphenoid  and occipital regions.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,100
Neck's broken,

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,700
and the femur is shattered.

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,900
From t garbage truck flipping over?

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,100
No.

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,500
This damage is more congruentwith a fall.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
What do you got?

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,500
It's organic.

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,400
Whatever it is,

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,500
he brought it with himfrom the crime scene.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,800
How much of this are you going to need?

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,500
The whole disgusting shebang.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,700
Everything?

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,900
Everything.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,500
He was wrapped in a shroud?

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,900
Angela's analyzing the stains on the cloth

49
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
while Hodgins figures out what they're made of.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
No finger pads left for prints.

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,800
How are we on dental records?

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,500
FBI's on it.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,500
Multiple shards of leaded glassembedded  in the remaining tissue.

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,600
Massive contusionscongruent with the  swan dive onto a hard surface.

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
And take a look at the upper spine.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,100
Weighted impact against the scapula and clavicle.

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,200
He was struck?

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Yes,but not hard enough to kill.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,900
Private garbage hauler.

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
They aren't real strict about their routes.

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,600
Driver says he can't be sure  where he picked the victim up.

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
No visible tats or track marks.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
You sound surprised.

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,500
Well,it's pretty obvious,Bones.

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
He's either a junkie or a hustler.

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,800
Why make that assumption?

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,900
Not many kids from the suburbsend  up rotting in garbage trucks.

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,600
Fun factoid from the front lines.

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,400
Hey,guys.

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,900
Want to see something cool?

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,500
So,I assume you're all familiarwith  the Shroud of Turin.

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,600
Image of Christ's face on the  inside of a burial cloth.

73
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,100
Right.

74
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,500
Booth is a good Catholic boy.

75
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
It was revealed to be a hoax.

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,700
A hoax?

77
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,400
Okay,whatever you want to believe.

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
This is no hoax.

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,800
On the fabriccovering John Doe's skull,

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,500
there are tissue stainsaround the eye  sockets,the nose and the mouth.

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,300
This is essentially a photo  negative of his features.

82
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,900
Are you saying you have enough to assemble a face?

83
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,900
I call it the Shroud of Montenegro.

84
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,600
I used computer tomography

85
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,800
to create X-Ray slicesof the  underlying facial architecture.

86
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,200
Selective laser centering allowed  me to map the unimprinted areas

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,100
Skin tone and hair color were extrapolatedbased  on Dr.Saroyan's data.

88
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,900
I'm no expert,

89
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,500
but he sure doesn't look like a street kid.

Bones. Season 02 Episode 03

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,000
******

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,100
through the Center for Missing and  Exploited Person database.

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,800
That's a lot of missing and exploited kids.

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,100
These are just the locals.

97
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,800
Let's hope we don't have to go national.

98
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Narrow the searchto street kids  in the foster system.

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,500
Why?

100
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,200
Because,statistically,that's  where this boy comes from.

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,900
It's far too early to start narrowing our focus.

102
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,400
Runaways,street kids,foster system.

103
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Dr. Saroyan's the boss.

104
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
I've autopsied a lot of dead kids.

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Car accidents,drug overdoses,drownings-

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
fine,it's a broad search.

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Kid in a Dumpster-

108
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,900
it's a runaway,street kid or foster system.

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,700
Cam's right,Bones.

110
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,100
Got it.

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,400
Dylan Krane,17.

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
This is why I was appointed this job,Dr. Brennan.

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,300
To streamline the process.

114
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,800
Honor student from a nice neighborhood  in Alexandria.

115
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,200
He disappeared three weeks ago

116
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
with his girlfriend Kelly Morris,

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,900
who isin the foster system.

118
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
Good.

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
There we go.

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
I guess your first move is to find Kelly Morris.

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,700
No,the first move is to inform the Kranesthat  we just found their son.

122
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Are you positive?

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
We don't need to identify him?

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,100
To make sure,I mean.

125
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,800
I need to see my son. You understand?

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,900
Mr. and Mrs. Krane,

127
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,400
I realize this is very hard,

128
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
but the reason why we asked you  to come to the Jeffersonian.

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

130
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,000
What? I don't understand the significance of that.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm called in when a victim is too  decomposed to identify.

132
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh,God.

133
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,500
I was ableto identify Dylan beyond the shadow of a doubt.

134
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
That's Dylan.

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,700
How did he die?

137
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,700
He fell from a height of approximately 50 feet.

138
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,700
Suicide?

139
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,000
Is there any reason to believe that  your son was despondent?

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Dylan? No.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
He was a smart,happy kid.

142
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,700
Problems at school?You know,uh.

143
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,000
spending too much time on the Internet?

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
Anything like that

145
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,600
His whole life centered around  this girl that he was seeing.

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,100
Was this Kelly Morris?

147
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,900
Yes.

148
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,700
I suppose you read the missing persons report.

149
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,200
So,you know Kelly's in a foster situation?

150
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,400
Have you seen her since Dylan disappeared?

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,200
No.

152
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
To be honest,we were hoping  they ran away together.

153
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,600
Why would they do that?

154
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,200
We told Dylan to stop seeing her.

155
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Why?

156
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,700
Dylan met her at Harper Plazawhere  the street kids hang out.

157
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,500
Dylan was getting readyto go to M.I.T.

158
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,900
She's already dropped out of high school.

159
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,800
The life we provided him,

160
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
it didn't prepare him for a girl like Kelly.

161
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,300
You mean a foster child?

162
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,100
Bones.

163
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,200
Whatever happened to my son,

164
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
it happened because of Kelly.

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,500
We're going to find her,

166
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
and we're going to talk to her.

167
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,800
Dr.Brennan,I can see that you think that we're being hard on Kelly.

168
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,500
But my son.

169
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,500
My son was a good kidwith his whole  life ahead of him.

170
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,900
Kelly Morris' foster mother is going to meet us at my office.

171
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Okay.

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,900
She says Kelly took off a couple weeks ago with most of her belongings.

173
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,900
You okay,Bones?

174
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
I was a foster child.

175
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
,I know.

176
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Do people always assume the worst of me?

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,100
,I know that you hate psychology,but those people-

178
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
they just lost their son.

179
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,900
They need to blame someone.

180
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,200
Poor Dylan.

181
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,300
He was a good kid.

182
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,900
He was a good influence on Kelly-

183
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,400
trying to get her back into school.

184
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,900
And he was good to Alex,

185
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,000
treated himjust like a little brother.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
To the best of your knowledge,

187
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,600
were Kelly and Dylan sexually active?

188
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,300
Oh,I know they were.

189
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,700
I'm afraid I caught themin Kelly's bedroom,

190
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,300
and I had to forbid Kelly to bring Dylan  into the houseafter that.

191
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,100
Why?

192
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,700
It's the rules.

193
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,500
They're underage,

194
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,100
and Kelly'sa ward of the state.

195
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,200
and I knew that it mightforce Dylan and Kelly to find other placesto be together.

196
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
You know,to feed into their own,uh.

197
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,600
Romeo and Juliet fantasy.

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,100
But Alexlives in the house,too,and he's only 12.

199
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Kelly d her brother,they close?

200
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,300
Very close.

201
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,700
Their parents were killed in a hotel  fire four years ago.

202
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,500
They had no family.

203
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,400
They were put into the system.

204
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I've had them for a little over a year.

205
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,500
That's a pretty good run for a foster kid,

206
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,700
especially a brother and a sister  who want to be together.

207
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,900
Yes.

208
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,700
What?

209
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm not certainhow much longer  I can keep the both of them.

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
I have diabetes,

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,700
and I don't have the energythat I used to, and Kelly is a real handful.

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,300
I've asked Children's Services  to look for alternatives.

213
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,400
Did Kelly know?

214
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Yes.

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,500
I told her.

216
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Did they find Kelly or not?

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
No,Alex,

218
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,500
but they found Dylan.

219
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,500
Is he all right?

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm...I'm afraid not.

221
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,500
Dylan is dead.

222
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,900
Do you know where Kelly is,Alex?

223
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,000
No.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,700
Kelly could be in danger.

225
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I don't know where she is.

226
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
She hasn't called me or anything.

227
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,300
Do you think she's dead,too?

228
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,500
No.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,700
You know,I'm gonna find your sister,

230
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,900
and I'm going to bring her back here to you.

231
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,100
Really?

232
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,700
Absolutely.

233
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,800
This is the FBI,buddy.

234
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Were you lying to the boy?

235
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Do you really think Kelly Morris is still alive?

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,500
I don't know.

237
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,300
You don't know if she's alive?

238
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,400
No,I don't know if I was lying.

239
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,100
You see,I just...

240
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,000
I really don't have a readon the sister yet.

241
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,100
I mean,was she a bad guy?

242
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,500
Was she a victim?

243
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
do you have a read on Dylan Krane?

244
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,900
he had that whole adolescent savior complex thinggoing on big time.

245
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,000
Savior complex?

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,900
,teenage boys love nhing more than the ideaof  saving the damsel in distress.

247
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,100
Well,how do you know?

248
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,800
Well,'cause I was.

249
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,900
You know,I was a teenage boy.

250
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,500
DNA from the tissue under the victim's fingernail?

251
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Female,

252
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,600
and there's nail polish in the gouges on his arm.

253
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
it wasn't necessarily from the murder.

254
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
They were sexually active.

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
She might have scratched him.

256
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,700
No.

257
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Hodgins also found oxidized iron in the scratches.

258
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,400
Oxidized iron.

259
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,300
What's that?

260
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
-Rust. - Rust.

261
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,900
Why didn't you just say "rust"?

262
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,100
she said it.

263
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,800
The same oxidized iron foundon the victim's upper back and shoulder.

264
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,900
Probably left behind by the weapon  that struck him.

265
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,000
So...

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
he was hit with what,a rusty pipe?

267
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
That's a reasonable assumption.

268
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,500
Oh,so,Dylan tells the girlfriend  they're breaking up.

269
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
She whacks him across the carotid with a pipe.

270
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,800
And pushes him out the window.

271
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
Exactly.

272
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
What?

273
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,300
What's with the stink eye?

274
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
It's just a theory.

275
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,700
There was cheap nail polishin the box of Kelly's belongings.

276
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
You should see if there's a match.

277
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,300
Find some hair.

278
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,200
Match the DNAon that,

279
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,500
thenget started on the,murder weapon.

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Where are you going?

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
I thought before we arrest Kelly Morris for murder

282
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,100
based solely on the fact that she's a foster kid,

283
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,900
we might want to find the place  where Dylan Krane actually died.

284
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,500
Point of fact-the pipe-

285
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,700
if that's even what it was-was  not the murder weapon.

286
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,300
The evidence,if anybody cares,

287
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,500
shows that Dylan Krane died from a fall.

288
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,700
No compression fractures to the ulna or phalanges,

289
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
so his arms weren't outstretched  or across his face.

290
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,500
Which means he wasn't bracing for impact.

291
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Suggesting he was unconscious before  he went out the window.

292
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Perhaps from being struck by the rusty pipe?

293
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,400
Oh,don't you start.

294
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,100
Start what?

295
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,900
We don't know what he was struck with yet.

296
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,300
I analyzed the impact damage,

297
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,700
and the weapon was a cylinderapproximately  two inches in diameter.

298
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,400
That plus the oxidation residue suggests,

299
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,100
in the vernacular,a rusty pipe.

300
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,500
Good.If you tell me that,I get it.

301
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,400
It's empirical,not guesswork.

302
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,900
That which we call a roseby any other  name would smell as sweet.

303
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Romeo and Juliet,Act II,Scene II.

304
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,900
The quote considered to most aptly describethe  central conflict of the play.

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,900
which I totally do not understand.

306
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,100
The flower in Dylan's hand was a roseacalyx, a rosebud.

307
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,000
You do not smell like a rose.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've been sifting through two tons of garbage,

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
which you should ask me about.

310
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,700
Ask what exactly?

311
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,900
Poultry skin loaded with garlic and chives,

312
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,300
red beets,empty imported vodka bottles,

313
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,400
and traces of Osetra fish eggs.

314
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,900
Put 'em together,and where are we?

315
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Anyone?

316
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,900
Booth should check the garbage truck  routefor a Russian restaurant.

317
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
,okay,horrible area,

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,100
but,you know,on the upside,

319
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,400
only one Russian restaurant and no Starbucks.

320
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,700
You know,no one we've talked to has  recognizedeither Kelly or Dylan.

321
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,400
Hey,we could ask them.

322
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Why?

323
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,100
Because they share the same uniquesocio-cultural identifiers as Kelly Morris.

324
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,300
You mean,like teenagers?

325
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,900
,exactly.

326
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,600
No,you know what?

327
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,200
They will melt away before we  get half a sentence out.

328
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,300
All right,you just watch.

329
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay,but,hey,you know,what do I know?

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,700
I've only been working the streets  my whole career.

331
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,600
Excuse me?

332
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,200
Excuse me.

333
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Hello?

334
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,200
Hi.

335
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm an anthropologist.

336
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,300
I'm not a cop.

337
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,800
That's most definitely a cop.

338
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,400
Thank you.

339
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,500
See,they're very cooperative,aren't they?

340
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,900
Booth,please.

341
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,700
There they go.

342
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh,excuse me.

343
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Wait,wait,wait.

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,800
Will you just take aookat these pictures

345
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,900
and tell meif you recognize anyone?

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Give me five bucks,and I'll tell you.

347
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,900
Five bucks.

348
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
Booth,please.

349
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,500
Here you go.

350
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,200
So,who is it?

351
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,500
It's his sister.

352
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,700
But hold it this way,right?

353
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,900
'Cause the only time anyone ever  sees his sister is on her back.

354
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,300
,I'm assumingthis isn't your sister?

355
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,000
No,it is.

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,900
Okay,I'd like my money back.

357
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,900
Well,there they go. Bye.

358
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
That really worked now,didn't it,huh?

359
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
Great.

360
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
They just took my money for nothing.

361
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Well,you know,that's becausethey're exploited,

362
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,500
you know,and misunderstood.

363
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,300
Oh,you got to be kidding me,huh?

364
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,700
Geez,they could at least wait until  your back is turned.

365
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,300
What?

366
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,800
FBI.

367
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,300
Hands in the air.

368
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,500
There's no problem here!

369
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
No problem at all!

370
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,900
Katie?

371
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,800
Uh,I'll cover you.

372
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,600
Go see what they're dealing,Bones.

373
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,900
What?I hate this part where you stand with a gun,

374
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,600
and I have to go do the looking.

375
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,500
Bones,I got you covered.Let's go.

376
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,900
What are you selling?

377
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,300
What do they got there,Bones?

378
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,500
What do you got,huh?

379
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Ibuprofen.

380
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
Uh,multivitamin.

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,500
I think these are sandwiches,and condoms.

382
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,800
Franny and I have been doing this for years.

383
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,700
Sandwiches,clothing,vitamins,some basic hygiene supplies for homeless kids.

384
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,400
You must be really embarrassed.

385
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,700
Hey,you know what? It was suspicious behavior,all right?

386
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,000
And besides,uh,they're.

387
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,500
It's not like they're.

388
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
Are you social workers?

389
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
No.

390
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,100
They're not even social workers.

391
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Well,they're good Samaritans.

392
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,600
Well,I apologized,okay?

393
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,300
Do you know how long it takes to  gain some trust around here?

394
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,800
Make a scene like this and these kids won't talk to us for weeks.

395
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh,good.Maybe you could do us a favor in return.

396
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,700
Show them the picture.

397
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,500
We're looking for someone.

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,900
The girl.

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,400
Dylan and Kelly.

400
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
,that's right.

401
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
We haven't seen them around here  in a couple of weeks.

402
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Dylan is dead.

403
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,900
We found him in a garbage truck that services this area.

404
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,300
My God,what happened?

405
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,700
Well,that's what we're trying to figure out.

406
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,900
Warehouse.

407
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Come with us.

408
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,100
What is this place?

409
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,900
It's a squat.

410
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,600
Every one of these old factories houses  junkies and squatters.

411
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,400
,and kids with nowhere else to go.

412
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
What'd this building used to be?

413
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Plumbing supply,I think.

414
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,900
Pipes.

415
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Bones.

416
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,700
Dylan,right?

417
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,900
It's obviously a kind of shrine.

418
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,200
It's something the kids do for each other when somebody dies.

419
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
Still could be traces of Dylan's blood  on the concrete.

420
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,700
I'll call the crime scene unit.

421
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,400
Tell them to start on the fifth floor.

422
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,900
Why?

423
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,500
Because the injuries show that's how far he fell.

424
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
That's Dylan's school jacket!

425
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,700
We're not going to hurt you!

426
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Okay.

427
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,500
*************

428
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,900
******nothing without a social  worker being present.

429
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,400
I know my rights.

430
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,500
I'm not questioning you here.

431
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,900
We're just... We're talking,okay?

432
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Here.

433
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,500
Some gum?

434
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,700
,like that's going to make me trust you.

435
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,900
You know,I'm just asking your name.

436
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,400
C.

437
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,800
Does that stand for anything?

438
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
Carter.

439
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,900
I'm not saying if that's my first or my last name.

440
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,500
Why'd you run?

441
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,200
'Cause this lady was chasing me.

442
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,900
Because you ran.

443
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,800
,it's a brain twister.

444
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,700
You know,that sweatshirtyou're wearing belongs to a kid by the name of Dylan Krane.

445
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,000
Never heard of him.

446
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
Where'd you get it?

447
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm done with the hoodie.

448
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,500
You guys can have it.

449
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,400
What's with the,uh.

450
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,700
the names on the inside of your forearm there?

451
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,900
What does that mean?

452
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,800
Guys I killed.

453
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a list of foster homes.

454
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,700
Ones that threw him out.

455
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Sometimes getting thrown out's the best.

456
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,200
Is the best thing that can happen.

457
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,500
I know.

458
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,900
You were in the system?

459
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,900
Booth,the sunglasses?

460
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,800
They're the same onesthat Dylan was  wearing in the photograph.

461
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,100
These,huh?

462
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,800
Top of the line.

463
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,900
How can you afford these?

464
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
You don't want to know.

465
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,200
Can I go now?

466
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,000
No.

467
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,800
Child Services is on the way.

468
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,700
I tell you something,you'll let me go?

469
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,400
Try me.

470
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
You want to knowwhat happened to Dylan and Kelly?

471
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,900
Check out the sandwich pervs.

472
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,200
Fran Duncan's clean.

473
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Great record in the community,

474
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,900
but Kevin Duncan- the kid got it right.

475
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,700
I mean,he's a perv.

476
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,800
Inside three timeson solicitation  of minor charges.

477
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,500
Boys or girls?

478
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,000
Girls.

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,700
He's a traditionalist.

480
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,500
Oh,so he went after Kelly.

481
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,300
and the white knight from the suburbs steps in,

482
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,100
gets conked with a pipe,and.

483
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,300
tossed out the wind.

484
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,600
Kelly goes into hiding.

485
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Unless he got her,too.

486
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,900
So,what do you want to do next?

487
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
,that's up to Cam,isn't it?

488
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,000
No,Bones,I asked you.

489
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
What do you want to do?

490
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
I think...

491
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,100
I think we shouldn't close off any avenue  of investigation.

492
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,400
We stay on all the evidenceand see where it leads us,

493
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,900
like we did before Cam.

494
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,500
Okay.

495
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,800
Do you have a list like Carter?

496
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,100
Of.

497
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,300
foster families that didn't work out?

498
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,000
,we all did.

499
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,700
I wrote mine on the bottom of a shoe.

500
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
You know,they say with foster kids,

501
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
they're really hard on themselves.

502
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,700
They?

503
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,900
,experts,psychologists.

504
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,400
like that.

505
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
Apparently, foster kids feel so alone in this mean world,

506
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,400
they lose that knack of trusting in other people.

507
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,900
You mean at work?

508
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,200
Well,everywhere,you know?

509
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,900
Weight of the world,it's...

510
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,400
it's-it's profound.

511
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,900
They say that,uh,

512
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,400
they have a hard timeletting themselves  off the hook.

513
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,900
They-they grow up with control issues.

514
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,300
Are you telling me something,Booth?

515
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,600
No,it's just,you know,

516
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
something to keepinto consideration when we catch up with Kelly Morris.

517
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,700
Okay.

518
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,900
If you decide to take some other wisdom out of it,

519
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
none of my business.

520
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,800
How Cam and I get along is none of your business.

521
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,500
,right,which I just said...

522
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,900
said just then.

523
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
None of my business.

524
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Is there anything I can do?

525
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,000
Hey,this schematic is great,Angela.

526
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,700
All the pipes are numbered and located.

527
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,900
Meanwhile,I have hundreds of rust samples,

528
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
and I've covered,

529
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
maybe a quarter of the crime scene.

530
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,800
On the good side,

531
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,100
that is definitely the windowDylan Krane  exited as he fell.

532
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Leaded glass is a match.

533
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a strange place for two people  in love to end up.

534
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,700
What,a forensics lab?

535
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
No,a squat in an abandoned pipe factory.

536
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,900
Right,yes,right.

537
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,100
What were you talking about?

538
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,800
Just... Cam and Booth.

539
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,200
You know,of course.

540
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,500
Given their-their history.

541
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Tension,party of two.

542
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,600
Great.

543
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,900
Great.

544
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,900
Okay.

545
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,900
All my mistakes were made before I met Fran.

546
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,700
Then I fell in love.

547
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,200
Love changes everything.

548
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,500
Your wife know about these mistakes?

549
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Of course.

550
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
We have no secrets.

551
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,200
I got counseling.

552
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm still in counseling.

553
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,900
And I'm out there on the street  making amends every day.

554
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Passing out sandwiches and aspirinand  condoms to street kids?

555
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,600
I have no direct contact with the kids.

556
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,100
Fran does.

557
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,700
I make the sandwiches.

558
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
I drive.

559
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Insure my wife's safety.

560
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,300
That's a tough part of town.

561
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
And your past is all in the past?

562
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,900
No,that's with me every day.

563
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,500
Miranda Tyler,Susan Price,Laura Costello.

564
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,500
All these girls saythat you traded sandwiches for sex in the past six months.

565
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,800
Well,they're street kids. They lie.

566
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,000
These girls came on to me,and they wanted money.

567
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
When I rejected them,they got angry.

568
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,400
We catch up to,uh,Kelly Morris,

569
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,700
is sh-she going to say the same thing?

570
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,060
Hairbrush from Kelly's room provided her DNA.

571
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,200
The nail polish from her room also

572
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,400
matches the nail polish we found in  
the scratch marks on the victim's arm.

573
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,570
It doesn't mean she pushed him  
out that window.

574
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,410
If he finds it,and it matches the 
rust found in the scratch marks,

575
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,510
then we can tie Kelly to the weapon.

576
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,020
Oh,young love.

577
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,610
You pour your soul out to some  
pimple-faced jock

578
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,480
with a great body and the emotional  
maturity of an 11-year-old,

579
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,460
only to get your heart broken in  
the back of a red Camaro.

580
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,440
Remember that first slow dance?

581
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,350
-Oh,God. 
-Some horrible power ballad.

582
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,660
Oh,that special boy with the  
pipe in his pocket.

583
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,540
Oh,God.Lewis Cole.

584
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,350
he was a drummer.

585
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,810
He had this hair,it was...

586
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,370
Wait-Wait,excuse me.

587
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,490
Marching to the beat of a different 
drummer here.

588
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,630
I'd like Hodgins to identify the species  
of rose found in Dylan Krane's hand.

589
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,240
What can that possibly tell us?

590
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,840
I won't know until he identifies it.

591
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,650
I'd prefer he keep looking for the pipe.

592
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,370
It could have Kevin Duncan's DNA on it.

593
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,240
Which will prove only that  
Kevin Duncan struck Dylan,

594
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,650
not that he killed him.

595
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,130
I want Hodgins on that rose.

596
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,980
It's my call.No.

597
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,790
I can't work like this.

598
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,890
Are you telling me I should start  
looking for your replacement?

599
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,090
Dr. Saroyan,I don't want to be  
overly dramatic or anything,

600
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,590
but if you lose Brennan,
you lose us all.

601
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,180
Really?

602
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,400
Really.
And Booth,too.

603
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,880
In the interests of this investigation, 
I am going to defer to you,Dr.Brennan.

604
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,340
Thank you.

605
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,040
Thank you.

606
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,780
But I will start the search  
for your replacement.

607
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,290
-Agent Booth? 
-Yeah.

608
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,590
This young man says he has information  
he won't tell anyone but you.

609
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,170
All right.Thanks.I got him.

610
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,820
Come on in,Alex.Have a seat.

611
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,840
So,you want a Coke or anything?

612
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,210
No.

613
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,550
You a big shot?

614
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,420
Yeah.

615
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,190
Look at that?
Special Agent in charge,Seeley Booth.

616
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,200
So,how'd you get here?

617
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,950
Bus.Kelly called me...on the phone.

618
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,640
And what'd she say?

619
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,470
That she's okay...

620
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,990
and that we'll be together...soon.

621
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,470
Did she say where she was?

622
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,040
Does she know about Dylan?
About being dead?

623
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,150
Yeah.She couldn't stop crying about it.

624
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,810
She had to hang up.

625
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,930
I think she's lying. 
I think she's never coming back.

626
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,150
Hey,it's okay,Alex,all right?

627
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,180
Everything's going to be okay.

628
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
I think I'm all alone now.

629
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,610
Hey,look,man, you're never going 
to be alone,okay?

630
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,830
All right,we know for certain  
that Kelly is alive,

631
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,890
and I promise,we're going to  
find your sister.

632
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,890
Okay?All right.

633
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,930
Let's get out of here. 
I give you a ride to home.

634
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,100
Got your call.

635
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,950
It was urgent.
Why didn't you answer?

636
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,170
I was busy.
What's so important?

637
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,580
-Kevin Duncan. 
-Single gunshot wound to the chest.

638
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,370
You're just in time for the autopsy.

639
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,510
Feeling queasy,Zack?

640
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,350
I'm not used to bodies looking so 
much like actual human beings.

641
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,850
Since this man was just killed, 
and there's plenty of flesh,

642
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,320
how is my presence beneficial?

643
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,970
The number six rib.

644
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,590
The bullet passed through his vital  
organs and lodged in the rear curvature.

645
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,350
Get it out.

646
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,120
So,you're thinking,the perv kills Romeo, 
and Juliet kills the pervert?

647
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,480
Street-smart kid like Kelly Morris would  
have no trouble getting her hands on a gun.

648
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,510
Booth,if Dr.Brennan were to quit...

649
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,320
What?

650
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,160
If she were to leave the Jeffersonian...

651
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,780
Well,the squints would flee this  
institution like the French army.

652
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,400
-And you? 
-Well,I do as I'm ordered.

653
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,730
No,you don't,Seeley.

654
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,640
Okay,here we go.

655
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,090
What's going on,Camille?

656
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,420
What if I fired her?
What would you do?

657
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,980
I'm with Bones,Cam.All the way.

658
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,490
Don't doubt it for a second.

659
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,800
Meet the English Alba Rose.
Climbing varietal.

660
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,630
Non-existent in the United States.

661
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,000
Some say it was the rose by any other  
name Shakespeare wrote about.

662
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,070
And we give a rat's ass because...?

663
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,420
It's what Dylan Krane was clutching  
in his cold dead hand.

664
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,450
So,what,he was killed by Hamlet?

665
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,680
Wrong play.

666
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,130
It's more likely he paid a visit  
to the Rose Wing

667
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,310
of the United States Botanic Garden.

668
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,120
When it comes to bugs,slime, 
crud and compost,you're the man.

669
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,500
You know,Cam,maybe you just got off  
on the wrong foot with this case

670
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,220
with Brennan because,
she was a foster kid.

671
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,050
-Why didn't she tell me? 
-She doesn't do that.

672
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,480
Excuse me.

673
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,610
By the way,I didn't just tell you that.

674
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,160
United States Botanic Garden falls

675
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,940
under the supervision of the  
Architect of the Capitol.

676
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,070
I really don't care.

677
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,820
The Architect is also responsible

678
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,220
for maintaining the grounds of  
the United States Capitol.

679
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,440
Hi.You seen either of these two kids?

680
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,060
It's open every day of the year to  
the citizens of these United States.

681
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,090
Which way to the Romeo and Juliet roses?

682
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,300
It's over there,
where Kelly Morris is standing.

683
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,470
Bones was right.Okay,go distract her.

684
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,650
Well,hey,why me?

685
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,390
Well,because,apparently,I look like a cop.

686
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,290
Well,what do I look like?

687
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,120
What are you,my straight man?Go.

688
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,130
Hey.

689
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,500
The United States Botanic Garden falls

690
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,690
under the supervision of the Architect  
of the-the Capitol.

691
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,010
Get away from me,perv.

692
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,210
Hello,Kelly.FBI.Not a perv.

693
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,800
It's okay,it's okay.
We're just here to help.

694
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,870
We're not going to hurt you.

695
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,340
Just got to talk about 
what happened to Dylan.

696
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,970
Dylan's dead.

697
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,230
Were you there when Dylan died?

698
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,110
Was I there?*****kill Dylan.

699
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,660
-Why'd you kill Dylan,Kelly? 
-Agent Booth...

700
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,800
Well,she already admitted to the murder, 
Ms.Child.

701
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,280
Actually,I believe she asked, 
"Who do you think killed him?"

702
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,560
It's an ambiguous question.

703
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,950
I killed him.I did it.

704
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,800
Because he broke a promise to me.

705
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,470
The promise to stay with you?

706
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,770
He tossed me a couple hundred bucks  
and told me he was going to college.

707
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,000
That we couldn't see each other anymore.

708
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,530
What did you do?

709
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,410
I pushed him out a window.

710
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,430
It was kind of an accident,right?

711
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,130
What do you call it,a crime of passion?

712
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,960
-You pushed him out the window? 
-Yes.

713
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,030
And he was conscious at the time?

714
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,810
Yeah.He screamed,okay?

715
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,370
-What then? 
-I ran away.

716
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,540
No,Kelly,you didn't.

717
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,470
You went down to the alley, 
and you wrapped Dylan in linen,

718
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,660
and then,you put a rose from the  
Botanic Garden in his hand.

719
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,250
The Romeo and Juliet rose.

720
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,100
Yeah,it's a strange thing to do  
right after you murder someone.

721
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,290
Well,I'm pretty screwed up.
Didn't you hear?

722
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,770
Someone shot Kevin Duncan.He's dead.

723
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,970
The sandwich guy?

724
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,420
We were thking that the two  
deaths were connected.

725
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,290
Fine.Yeah,I killed him,too.

726
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,520
She killed him,too.

727
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,250
Okay,I'd prefer that we not pursue  
this line of questioning.

728
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,610
Well,she confessed.

729
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,540
She got it wrong.
She forgot about the pipe.

730
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,760
-Well,she said they fought.
-She's lying.

731
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,130
You know,I'm just trying to  
think of a situation so bad

732
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,540
where a girl would confess to murder  
to try and get out of it.It's just...

733
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,710
-Agent Booth,Dr. Brennan. 
-Mrs.Duncan.

734
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,360
Do you want to sit down, 
have a cup of coffee?

735
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,730
No,thank you.

736
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm sorry for your loss.

737
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,690
-Did Kelly Morris kill Dylan? 
-Well,she confessed.

738
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,050
And now you think she killed  
my husband,as well?

739
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,020
It's very possible.I'd believe that 
before I'd believe she killed Dylan.

740
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,190
Kelly shouldn't take the blame.

741
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,440
You'll find one bullet missing.

742
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,810
You're confessing to your husband's murder?

743
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,020
He used me to get close to young girls.

744
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,740
I don't know how many through the years.

745
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,510
Francis Duncan,you're under arrest.

746
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,070
You have the right to remain silent.

747
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,110
Anything you say can and will be used

748
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,670
-against you in a court of law. 
-Thank you.

749
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,270
You have the right to an attorney.

750
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,360
If you cannot afford an attorney, 
one will be...

751
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,730
Pick up the gun.

752
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,200
Ballistics confirm that the bullet  
that killed Kevin Duncan

753
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,910
came from Fran Duncan's gun.

754
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,360
-Case closed? 
-On Kevin Duncan,definitely.

755
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,560
-And since Kelly Morris has confessed... 
-No,she didn't do it.

756
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,450
What evidence do you have of that?

757
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,100
How about this?

758
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,810
Specimen 268,
right corner of the room schematic.

759
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,410
-You are good. 
-Oh,you have no idea.

760
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,340
Are you having a moment?

761
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,980
How does finding the pipe prove 
that Kelly Morris is lying?

762
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,050
How does her confession not  
include the murder weapon?

763
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,900
For the last time, 
the pipe is not the murder weapon.

764
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,030
Dylan Krane died from a 50-foot fall.

765
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,550
Can you run the scenario through your  
magic holographic crystal ball thingy?

766
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,130
Too many variables.But I have another idea.

767
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,260
Okay,Booth,you're Dylan Krane.

768
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,290
Okay,you know what?I'm out the door.

769
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,820
-Cam... 
-Kelly Morris,right.

770
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,240
Okay,I feel stupid.

771
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,450
Okay,you two...You are young. 
You are in love.

772
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,520
You're about to break up, 
but this is very tragic.

773
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,420
It's very emotionally fraught.

774
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,280
Kelly Morris says she argued with  
Dylan and pushed him out the window.

775
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,680
She pushed him,then tried to  
save him by grabbing his arm?

776
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,930
Well,that would explain the fingernail  
polish in the scratch,but...

777
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,420
Not the oxidized iron.

778
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,820
Kelly would've had to strike  
him with the pipe from behind

779
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,990
and then drive him through the glass.

780
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,720
But she said that they were arguing face-to-face.

781
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,040
He would have seen her coming.

782
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,210
That means there had to be a third person. 
Someone who snuck up behind him.

783
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,820
Guys,I need a Kevin Duncan.

784
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:27,950
I'll do it.

785
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,640
Kelly already called me a perv, 
so I have my motivation.

786
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,320
So Kevin strikes Dylan with the pipe...

787
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,530
Careful.

788
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,090
Which moves him forward.

789
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,240
Kelly grabs the pipe away from him, 
but Dylan is losing consciousness.

790
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,200
He didn't have to throw Dylan out the window. 
He could have simply pushed him.

791
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,900
-Easy. 
-Kelly grabs his arm...

792
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,930
To save him.

793
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,520
Which would put the fingernails  
and rust in the wound.

794
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,480
But she can't hold him,and he falls.

795
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,820
Well,that theory explains the 
physical evidence.

796
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,040
Except,why would Kelly confess to  
murder to protect Kevin Duncan?

797
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,020
-She's afraid of him. 
-But she knows he's dead.

798
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,700
Guys...

799
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:16,030
there's only two people in this world  
that Kelly Morris would cover for.

800
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,800
One of them went out that window.

801
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,140
-We know you didn't kill Dylan. 
-I did,too.

802
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,820
Kelly,I don't want you to admit  
to anything more,all right?

803
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,990
No,you didn't.We can prove there  
was a third person there.

804
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,050
The third person that hit Dylan with a pipe

805
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,000
and when you took away the pipe, 
pushed him through the glass.

806
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,480
No,it was just me.

807
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,030
I hit him with a pipe. 
I pushed him through the glass.

808
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,330
No,you grabbed his arm.
You tried to save him.

809
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,800
No.

810
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:05,060
Dylan made you feel like you  
weren't alone in this world.Right?

811
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,710
He was sweet to you.

812
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,700
He took so much weight off your shoulders.

813
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,150
He was good to Alex.

814
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:22,370
And when Dylan said that you'd be  
together always,you believed him.

815
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,680
Yes.Yes,I believed him.

816
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:34,870
And when Suzanne couldn't take care  
of both you and Alex,you had an idea.

817
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,350
Run away with Dylan.

818
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:46,300
Maybe Suzanne will keep Alex, 
and everybody will be happy.

819
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,460
Dylan loved me.

820
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,610
I know.

821
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,660
But I didn't tell Alex.

822
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,610
He just...He just...

823
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:07,220
he thought that Dylan was trying 
to take me away from him forever.

824
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,880
I...I did it all wrong.

825
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,850
It's not...it's not Alex's fault, 
it's my fault.

826
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,610
Kelly...

827
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,230
You're 15 years old.

828
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,280
This is not your fault.

829
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,110
The weight of the world is not  
on your shoulders.

830
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,520
And we can't let you pay for what Alex did.

831
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,690
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

832
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,380
I didn't tell them, they just...
They just knew.

833
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:37,600
It's okay.Sorry about Dylan.

834
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,230
You were right about the pipe.

835
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,370
You were right about the rose.

836
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,610
Could I sit for a moment?

837
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,630
I wish you would eat some of these fries, 
save me from myself.

838
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,890
They're really good with the garlic mayonnaise.

839
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,180
We have a problem.

840
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,370
Do you see a solution?

841
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,690
It's not completely my fault.

842
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,490
I was a foster child.

843
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,770
And apparently...Booth says that...

844
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,140
Booth says that I have...

845
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,750
something about control issues and  
the weight of the world.

846
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,010
That sounds like Booth.

847
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,740
I think he meant that...

848
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,760
if I'm going to share responsibility 
for these cases,

849
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm going to have to learn to stop  
controlling everything,too.

850
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,250
Does that make sense?

851
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,280
Psychology's not...

852
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,090
I really...I really hate psychology.

853
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,090
Not everyone's brain works as fast as yours.

854
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,770
I have to mull sometimes. 
Are you familiar with that concept?

855
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,940
Yes.I just always thought it 
was a waste of time.

856
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,940
I'm in charge.

857
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,500
But out of respect for you, 
I could extend...

858
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,230
-did you ever play Monopoly? 
-No.

859
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,290
They have this thing called a  
"Get Out of Jail" card.

860
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,670
Think of it as a free pass to defy me.

861
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,280
No explanation needed.No recriminations, 
no repercussions.

862
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,160
-Well,how...how many would I get? 
-One a week.

863
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,450
-Five per case. 
-Three per week.

864
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:07,000
Booth told you I was a foster kid, didn't he?

865
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,880
Okay,yes,he did,but... 
he did it with a good heart.

866
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:17,990
And I'd really appreciate it if  
you didn't let him know.Please.

867
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,620
He's going to know that you told  
me the second he sees us together.

868
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,740
It's true.He's awful like that.

869
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,300
He reads people the way that you read  
pathology reports or I read bones.

870
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,560
Oh,God,I know.
I hate him.

871
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,550
-Well,I don't really. 
-I know.

872
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,040
Maybe...I will take you up on this.

873
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,730
-Thank you 
-Please,I...Help me.
