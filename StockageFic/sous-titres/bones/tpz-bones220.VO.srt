00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,424
- <i>We'd love to tell Carly.</i>
- Uh, she's a little slammed right now...

165
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,022
but I'll be sure to pass on
the compliments, all right?

166
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,431
<i>All right, take care.</i>

167
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,733
- So, Carly's in the kitchen?
- Yeah. She's back there 24/7.

168
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,865
You have to drag her out.
Dr. Brennan, right?

169
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,003
Yes. This is my partner,
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

170
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,980
- Hi.
- We know she's not back there, Dan.

171
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,117
I just can't imagine
that she's... she's gone.

172
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,681
I'm so sorry, Dan.

173
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,659
When was the last time
you saw her?

174
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,428
Friday night.

175
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,863
A lot of the restaurants around here
have been getting robbed...

176
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,800
so Carly didn't want
to leave the cash here.

177
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,394
<i>She and Abby took the cash</i>
<i>and drove it to the A. T.M.</i>

178
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,667
- Who's Abby?
- <i>Abby Singer.</i>

179
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,199
She and her boyfriend Ben
are our business partners.

180
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,371
Well, they're our friends first.

181
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,211
Abby organizes Carly's endorsements.

182
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,650
I mean, it's...
it's not Abby as well, is it?

183
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,019
No, we... we only...
We only found Carly.

184
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,081
Has Ben heard from Abby?

185
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,820
Ben's, uh... He's in the guard.
[Sniffles]

186
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,330
And, um, he's been gone for the weekend.
He should be back in a couple hours.

187
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,662
<i>Help me understand</i>
<i>something here, Dan.</i>

188
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,362
Your wife disappears
and you don't report her missing?

189
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,166
She would take these spur-of-the-moment
trips to Atlantic City...

190
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,936
- with Abby to kind of blow off steam.
- She wouldn't tell you first?

191
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,672
No. She wouldn't tell me
'cause she didn't want me to say no.

192
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,647
- Listen. What... What kind of car did they leave in?
- She, um...

193
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:54,084
[Sniffles]
She had an old Volvo. Abby did.

194
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,112
The picture was taken just before we opened.
[Sniffles]

195
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,283
I'll get a search team on it.

197
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,032

198
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,227

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,243
They say chefs
are the new rock stars.

203
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,611
Huh. They do deal with
knives and fire and food. It's pretty sexy.

204
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,617
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,848
Well, then tonight,
I'll take a knife and fire...

206
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,947
and make you an orgasmic
grilled cheese sandwich.

207
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,788

Oh, good Lord. You have to stop
mounting each other in the office.

210
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,496

Please, Angela, say yes.

211
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,060
- We were working.
- You were working <i>it.</i>

212
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,800
<i>A little professionalism</i>
<i>would be nice, people.</i>

213
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,275
I found some organic material
in a cut on her left hand.

214
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,278
Need to know what it is.

215
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,838
- I'm on it.
- And you? Anything?

216
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,351
Yeah. I found out
how to make braised beef.

217
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,946
- I found out that Carly loved sushi.
I found out that...
- <i>[Hodgins] Oh, my God!</i>

218
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,957
Sushi. Yes.

219
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,823
That is it. You are brilliant.

220
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,557
You're my muse. Check out all the sushi
restaurants on her site.

221

- True.

So you were with the reserves all weekend?

223
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,466
Yeah. Fort Eustis, survival training.

224
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,636
<i>You're sure Carly was murdered?</i>

225
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,579
- Yes.
- Isn't there anything I could be doing?

226
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,139
Helping you look for Abby?
I mean, I can't just sit here.

227
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,311
We're doing everything
we can to find her.

228
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,048
You're looking for whoever's been
robbing the other restaurants?

229
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,148
Mm-hmm. We don't
have a description yet. That's all.

230
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,455
Why didn't Dan report them missing?

231
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:46,464
<i>Well, he said that they would take off</i>
<i>sometimes, go to Atlantic City.</i>

232
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,228
Yeah, but still.
The restaurant was booming.

233
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,826
I mean, he should've known
that she wouldn't just leave.

234
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,896
Listen, do you, uh...
You and Dan, you havin' problems?

235
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,340
What? No.

236
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,310
No, he just doesn't think sometimes.

237
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,212
I mean, we're not in school anymore.

238
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,716
I just would've done something.
That's all.

239
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:13,087
<i>Look, here's Abby's picture</i>
<i>if you need it.</i>

240
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,561
Just find Abby.

241
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,429
Please.

242
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,434
The sushi got me thinking.

243
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:28,405
<i>P. phosphoreum...</i> a bacteria
that grows in seafood.

244
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,841
- A luminescent bacteria?
- Exactly. <i>Vibrio</i> bacteria.

245
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:36,348
Which, when catalyzed by luciferase,
causes the bones to glow.

246
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,712
So if the knife that was used to stab Carly
contained <i>P. phosphoreum...</i>

247
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,352
it would've entered
her bloodstream.

248
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,356
And it would be left on the bones as the tissue
decomposed and was stripped by the rats.

249
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,188
<i>Seafood.</i>
<i>So that narrows it down...</i>

250
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,455
to every restaurant in the area.

251
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:55,728
No. The tissue Cam found,
it's "uni"...sea urchin.

252
00:13:55,801 --> 00:14:00,465
A specialty in one
of Carly's favorite sushi restaurants.

253
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,474
Carly's blog mentions
an old friend...

254
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,033
who's the chef at a sushi restaurant.

255
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,740
<i>"Sushiguy23."</i>
<i>How imaginative.</i>

eat lunch while we're here.

00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,648
Uh, Thursday of last week.

276
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,514
- What? Something happen to her?
- Do you serve sea urchin?

277
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,350
Uni, yeah. It's one of my specialties.
You want some?

Did Dan find out she was with me?

280
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,660
- Why? What's going on between you and Carly?
- Nothing.

281
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,666
We reconnected on MySpace.

282
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,295
She wanted to learn aboutJapanese cuisine,
so I was teaching her how to make sushi.

283
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,305
Secretly?

284
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,500
Why? Because Dan
hated Japanese food?

285
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,409
Because he's so jealous.
Everybody loved Carly.

286
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,676
It drove him crazy.
Carly even left him once.

287
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,310
Why'd she go back?
Delicious.

288
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,914
Thank you.
What's going on? Is Carly okay?

289
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,724
Carly's dead.

290
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,892
Dan?
That son of a bitch.

291
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,869
We don't know who it was.
But she was stabbed, Ernie...

292
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:16,237
and we found bacteria associated
with sea urchin in her system.

293
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,538
It can only enter the body
through the bloodstream.

294
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,044
What? You think I killed her?
Why would I kill Carly?

295
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:25,072
- Well, that's more his area.
- You love her. She says that she'll leave Dan.

296
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,519
She doesn't. You get mad. She's got the fishy virus.
You got all those fishy knives.

297
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,749
Wait, wait.
Last time Carly was here, she cut herself.

298
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,883
And I wanted her to get
stitches, but she wouldn't.

299
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,950
I'd like to borrow
your knives, Ernie...

300
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,553
and compare them to
the injuries we found on Carly.

301
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,363
You know, a lot of people
have knives like mine.

302
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,368
Are you saying no?

303
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,633
Because that really
wouldn't look too good.

304
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,697
Can I get a spicy tuna roll?

305
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:59,714
I fed the measurements
of the knives into the computer...

306
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,276
angles of the blades, thickness...

307
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,822
and compared it to the injuries
we found on the bones.

308
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,916
None of them match the damage
evident on the cortical surface of the ribs...

309
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,257
- or the defensive wounds.
- <i>[Angela] No.</i>

310
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,729
But we do have one match...

311
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,392
this knife...

312
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,265
<i>and the cut on her left hand.</i>

313
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,271
The knife they used
when preparing the uni.

314
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,330
That must be how
it entered her bloodstream.

315
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,774
Sushiguy23 was telling the truth.

316
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:29,143
So he's not the murderer.
We can still eat at the restaurant. What?

317
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,580
Booth said the toro was fantastic.

318
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,414
<i>Are you still torturing Hodgins?</i>

319
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,445
- He loves it.
- Just tell him no. Put him out of his misery.

320
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,790
- What if I wanna say yes?
- You get married?

321
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:48,424
Sometimes your brain
just shuts off because you're in love.

322
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,528
One can't logically base a decision
on momentary happiness.

323
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,302
Haven't you ever just looked
at a guy and said "screw it"?

324
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,779
Well, maybe not the best
choice of words, okay, but...

325
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,974
Like when you were with Sully.

326
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,987
- Don't you regret letting him go?
- I made a decision.

327
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,046
Regrets serve no real purpose.

328
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,787
If you want to be impulsive,
why don't you just say yes?

329
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,625
Because I've also
got you in my head...

330
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,723
telling me that marriage will hobble
my personal and legal freedoms.

333
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,173
I'll grab my things.

334
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,338
Ernie's story checked out.

335
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,712
Carly took out
a restraining order on Dan...

336
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,752
and Dan took out a two-million-dollar
life insurance policy on her.

337
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,522
- See? Marriage, it...
- Oh, just go.

338
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,248
I'm going.

<i>You guys had to shut down, huh?</i>

340
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,091
Yeah. Carly's without Carly
doesn't make much sense.

341
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,461
Yeah. That's gotta be rough.

342
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:57,263

that kind of hit financially.

343
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,601
Look, man, his wife was murdered,
and my girlfriend's missing.

344
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,073
- Money is the last thing on our minds.

- Where's the other knife?

348
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,921
I don't know.
It's been missing for years.

349
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,083
Carly actually got it as a gift
from the first chef that she worked for.

350
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,093
Mmm. Or maybe it's just been missing...

351
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,427
- since you found out about
Carly and Ernie Summers.
- Ernie Summers? The sushi guy?

352
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,932
- I'd like to take this set of knives.
- Sure.

353
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,970
- No.
- Hey, relax, man. Just let them take the knives.

354
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,130
These bastards cannot come
in here and start accusing me.

355
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,572
Carly was meeting up with Ernie secretly.
You assumed the worst.

356
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,974
- It's not true.
- Confronted her. One thing led to another.

357
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:43,276
- Carly was involved with him?
- Maybe Abby heard you fighting
and tried to get in the middle.

00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,475
You son of a bitch!
[Grunts]

359
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,042
She got caught up in the middle.

- Yes, I'm good.

363
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,625
What'd you do, Dan?

364
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,364
Nothing. Okay?
We had some problems.

365
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,430
- I went into rehab.
- You were drinking last week, Dan, before I left.

366
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,341
- A couple glasses of wine, okay?
The stress of everything.
- Carly?

367
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,141
- Yes, and Carly.
- Why didn't you tell us about
that insurance policy?

368
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,650
- That was Ben's idea.
- This restaurant would
be worth nothing without Carly.

369
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,776
We have investors.
We had to protect them.

370
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,116
But if you had a problem
with Carly, I mean...

371
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,646
You wouldn't need the restaurant.
You'd still get your payday.

372
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,659
Take the knives.

373
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,287
- Take anything you want.
- You son of a bitch. You think I...

374
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,297
- Where's Abby?
- For God sakes, are you people crazy?

375
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,662
- [Rings]
- Booth.

376
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,997
I loved Abby. I love Carly. It was...

377
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,197
Thanks. Helicopter
spotted Abby's car.

- You should wait here until we can determine...

00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,375
- if she's in the car and if she's alive.
- You find her?

381
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,476
- <i>No one's in the vehicle, sir.</i>
- How about the trunk?

382
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,147
- I haven't checked yet.
- Get me a crowbar.

383
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,213
Come on.

384
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,231

You're gonna be
all right.

388
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,222
I don't understand.
Why wasn't Abby killed too?

389
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,056
- Funny, but I haven't found
a written confession yet.
- Yeah. But she's a witness.

390
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,585
Blood traces on the dashboard
where the vinyl split.

391
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,600
Lots of blood on the seat, floor mats.

392
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,932
Looks like Carly was definitely
killed inside the car.

393
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:49,269
Maybe whoever did this saw what he'd done
and lost the stomach for it when it came to Abby.

394
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,038
Hello. Possible semen
and vaginal contributions.

395
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,342
Because this wasn't nasty enough.

396
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,090
Ooh! Smells like a urinal.

397
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,094
She was locked up for 36 hours.

398
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,528
I tell you, all she was
worried about was surviving.

399
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,862
Sorry. I forgot you were buried.

But sharp or dull, it couldn't have made

- So the edge was even sharper.
- Yeah.

Do you really think

416
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,519
I mean, it makes sense
he would spare Abby.

417
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,325
I don't think I'm the person...

418
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,459
to ask about psychology
of relationships.

419
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:28,063
Mmm. You know,

420
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,109
you were the difficult friend

421
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,168
it's not necessarily a bad thing.

422
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,180
Yeah, I know...

423
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,708
that sharing a strong emotional attachment
with another human being...

424
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,813
can be a good thing.

425
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,487
But there seems to be a disconnect
between my mind and...

426
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:54,396
You know, I... I shouldn't have
brought up Sully before.

427
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,401
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

428
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,029
It's just...

429
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,973
if a relationship
seems more than casual...

430
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,842
I feel that I need to
posit the potential problems...

431
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:12,475
- probabilities of success and failure, or...
- You get scared.

432
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:20,755
But I miss so much, don't I?

433
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,921

<i>And so does whoever</i>
<i>you're keeping yourself from.</i>

436
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,242
I compared the hairline fracture
on Carly's skull to the damaged dashboard.

437
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,575
The fracture was the result
of her head smashing into it.

438
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,672
Hemorrhaging indicates
it was antemortem.

439
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,150
These white shards were found in the trunk
and some were caught on her socks.

440
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,415
F.B.I. techs also found
similar shards in the old house.

441
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,051
I'm running a chemical analysis,
but I'd say this is some kind of ceramic.

442
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,424
What? Like pottery?

443
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:02,263
Actually, ceramics are used in everything
from semiconductors to medical implants.

444
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,134
- This is a very hard ceramic.
It's probably eight Mohs.
- Yeah?

445
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,037
- Yeah.
- What's that mean?

446
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:13,601
That it was most likely used
for industrial applications.

447
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,272
- Do... Mmm.
- <i>What?</i>

448
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,476
No. I'm not gonna ask you again.

449
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,146
- About the ceramic stuff?
- No. Angela.

450
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,280
No more. I'm done.

451
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,416
Oh. You're done with Angela?

452
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,920
No. But...

453
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,395
Hey, I fell in love with a free spirit...

454
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,991
and if getting married
makes her feel trapped or something...

455
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,228
then I'm... I'm just gonna
have to deal with it.

456
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:42,137
- Right. So you don't want to get married anymore.
- Sure, I do.

457
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,005
You know what? This whole ceramics stuff
was making more sense to me.

458
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,671
But Angela doesn't. And I don't want
to drive her away like you did with Rebecca.

459
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,046
Whoa. I did not
drive Rebecca away.

460
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,814
- We both agreed it wasn't right.
- After you asked and she said no.

461
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,151
Well, when you say it like that, it's...

462
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:03,126
If it had been right, it wouldn't matter
if you were married or not, would it?

463
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,128
Because you'd have a life together.

464
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,427
Great. Then why not get married?

465
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,559
Because then we wouldn't
be able to be together.

466
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:14,036
- See, this is all coming so clear now.
- Not really.

467
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,871
- You put on that macho front,
but inside you understand.
- I don't understand.

468
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,843
That which the mind can't grasp...

469
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,937
I'm trying to catch a murderer,
but you seem to have gone way past that.

470
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,982
It means a lot,
knowing you get it, man.

471
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,814
Most guys... not secure
enough to admit that.

472
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,854
- Hmm. I have a headache.

00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,362
<i>You're... You're sure?</i>
<i>She was stabbed?</i>

486
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,734
- Yes.
- What happened when you got in the car?

487
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,172
We didn't suspect anything.

488
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,507
<i>He must've been</i>
<i>hiding in the backseat.</i>

489
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,570
Did you get a look at him?

490
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,617
No. He was wearing a mask.

491
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,710
<i>I panicked. I,</i> um...

492
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,416
I tried to get out of the car.

493
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:44,155
And... And he must've hit me, uh...

494
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,721
'cause the next thing I remember...

495
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,199
is waking up in the dark.

496
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,498
And, uh, I...

497
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,196
I thought I'd been buried alive.

498
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,603
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

499
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,311
Actually, I was buried alive in a car
just a few months ago with a colleague.

500
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,909
- We were able to use the air bag cannis...
- Bones.

501
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,820
It's a rhetorical question.

502
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,921
I tried to fight.

503
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:22,160
- It's not your fault.
- Was it...

504
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,571
Did she suffer?

505
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,668
It was very quick.

506
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,905
The, uh...

507
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:45,247
The four of us were planning
on taking a vacation together...

508
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,484
after the cookbook came out.

509
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,617
We're sorry.

510
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,435
I took a second look at
Carly's cervical vertebrae.

511
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,202
The damage matches an acceleration
flexion-extension neck injury.

512
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,506
- Whiplash.
- Abby's car stops suddenly.

513
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,480
Carly doesn't have her seat belt on.
She's propelled forward...

514
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,675
slamming her head
into the dashboard...

515
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,446
- <i>and injuring her neck.</i>
- Exactly.

516
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,010
What about what you
found in the backseat?

517
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,648
The vaginal secretions are
consistent with Carly's D.N.A.

518
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:24,024
- So she was raped before she was killed?
- Any match on the semen?

519
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:28,498
I ran the seminal D.N.A. through
CODIS and the military database.

520
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:32,002
- I found a match.
- [Beeping]

521
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,004
Ben Michaelson.

522
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,006
Abby's boyfriend?

523
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,634
It would explain
why he spared Abby.

524
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,237
Carly's husband said Ben was
with the reserves when Carly was killed.

525
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,305
I wonder how hard it is
to sneak off base.

526
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,317
He wasn't on base.

527
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,013
He was alone in the woods
doing survival training.

528
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,818
<i>He could go rape and kill Carly...</i>

529
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,189
and no one would even
find out he left.

530
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,994
You spoke to Captain Gerard?
Why didn't you just talk to me?

531
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,369
Your reserve unit spent last weekend
reviewing survival skills.

532
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,307
<i>Yeah. We were each dropped off</i>
<i>at isolated locations...</i>

533
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,278
and given rudimentary supply
and navigation kits.

534
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:19,180
So basically, you were alone for two days.
No one to corroborate your whereabouts.

535
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,445
What are you saying?

536
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,784
You spent two tours in Iraq.
The captain says you're one of his best men.

537
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,417
Someone as well trained as you would've easily
been able to leave your assigned location...

538
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,428
and return to your rendezvous
point with no one the wiser.

539
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,193
- But I didn't.
- See, first I was wondering...

540
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,030
why would a carjacker
kill one of his victims...

541
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,263
and let the other victim stay alive?

542
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,034
That doesn't make sense.
Hey, unless...

543
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,201
- maybe there's no carjacker.
- Wait. Do you actually think that I...

544
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,735
The insurance money would've given you
over half a million dollars.

545
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,748
You've killed before.
I mean, in the service...

546
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,047
- some guys, they're just numb to it.
- Wait, this is insane.

547
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,212
Then again, killing your
meal ticket is one thing.

548
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,279
And then killing your
girlfriend, that's another.

549
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,818
- So you locked Abby in the trunk.
- No.

550
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,727
- See, the one thing I don't understand... the rape.
- Yeah.

551
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,324
- What?
- We have your D.N.A. from the backseat of the car.

552
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,334
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Yours and Carly's.</i>

553
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,996
So what was it then?

554
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,302
Did you get turned on
thinking about killing her?

555
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,269
I want a lawyer.

556
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,338
I'll bet you do.

557
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,581
[Booth] You know we'll get him, Bones.
All right? Don't worry.

558
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,713
We do this all the time.
You know, I should be used to it.

559
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,122
- It shouldn't bother me.
- No, it should.

560
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,162
Was she, uh, really gonna
teach you how to cook?

561
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:45,225
Yeah. I've always understood the basics
of cooking, the physics of it...

562
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:50,297
but Carly said she was
going to show me what it was really about.

563
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,776
To her, she said
that it was a way of...

564
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:57,975
Well, she said "loving,"
but then, she was prone to hyperbole.

565
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,609
Well, hey, I mean, that's what
family dinners are all about, right?

566
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,280
Those are some of my, uh...
my best memories.

567
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,881
I'm not as cold
as everyone thinks, Booth.

568
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,291
Okay, that was a leap.

569
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,921
Just because I think marriage
is an antiquated ritual...

570
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:16,524
doesn't mean that I don't want
Angela and Hodgins to be happy.

571
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,331
I have an appreciation and a need...

572
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:23,465
for emotional and physical
intercourse, just like you.

573
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,476
Yeah. Sure. I mean, okay.
Good for you with that.

574
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,480
- Did I make you uncomfortable?
- No.

575
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,740
Not at all. I just wanna focus.

576
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,809
Let's just focus on the... on the case.

577
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,015
I did make you uncomfortable.

578
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,052
Listen, Abby, I know it's hard
for you to go through this again...

579
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,188
but do you remember
hearing the carjacker's voice?

580
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,200
- I... I must have.
- Close your eyes for me, okay?

581
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,369
I want you to try and hear that voice again.
Can you do that for me?

582
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:07,618
Does it sound familiar?
Someone you might know?

583
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,210
What are you saying?

584
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:13,189
- We're just asking, Abby.
- Why?

585
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:17,091
Ben's story that night,
it might not check out.

586
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,790
What are you talking about?
Ben would ne...

587
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,026
We're like a family.
It's not Ben.

588
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,399
Abby, it's just a question
we have to ask.

589
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,099
Do you remember the car
making a sudden stop?

590
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,107
No.

591
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,906
But I... I was unconscious
in the trunk.

592
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,311
- Could that be how she broke her wrist?
- Possibly.

593
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,546
<i>Or when she was dragged</i>
<i>or thrown into the trunk.</i>

594
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,111
Abby, may I have permission
to review your medical records?

595
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,919
They could help us
<i>identify</i> Carly's killer.

596
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,927
But do you think
it might really be Ben?

597
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,661
It's just a possibility
we have to pursue. That's all.

598
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,794
Okay.

599
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,863
Thanks.

600
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,845
I did it!
I found the murder weapon!

601
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,849
Or what's left of it anyway.

602
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:17,081
I used the G.C. mass spectrometer
to analyze the ceramic shards in the car.

603
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,623
The murder weapon
was a ceramic bowl?

604
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,318
It's not just the bowl that's ceramic.
The knife is too.

605
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,487
Booth mentioned that companies are sending
her their products to endorse.

606
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,999
- Wait. A ceramic knife?
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

607
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,627
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Brennan.

608
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,764
The murder weapon
was a ceramic knife.

609
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,773
Hodgins found the murder weapon.

610
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,503
<i>[Hodgins On Speakerphone]</i>
<i>Zirconium oxide...supersharp and easy to shatter.</i>

611
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,670
In this case, you shatter
it into a million pieces...

612
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,045
no one knows it's a knife,
except me, of course.

613
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:49,485
Using Angela's program,
I matched the wounds to the blade.

614
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,749
Either that trunk was packed
with invisible pillows...

615
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,121
- or Abby's lying to us.
- [Booth] Why?

616
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,126
- Booth?
- Yeah, Booth.

617
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,652
Talk to me, squints...
as close to English as possible.

618
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,790
According to the medical report,
Abby's got bumps and bruises, yes...

619
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,665
<i>but they aren't at all</i>
<i>consistent with the way...</i>

620
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,670
<i>she would've been thrown around</i>
<i>in that trunk.</i>

621
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,729
She should've had
more broken bones.

622
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,298
Is there any evidence
of Carly being raped?

623
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,742
- None that I found.
- Me either.

624
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:18,373
But the wounds on the ribs...

625
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,078
the directionality of impact
was left to right.

626
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:26,522
- Of course.
- <i>[Angela] It fits the scenario I was working out.</i>

627
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,424
- So obvious!
- English, remember? Okay?

628
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,190
- <i>[Booth] How does Ben figure into all this?</i>
- He doesn't.

629
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,993
<i>The injuries fit if Abby was driving</i>
<i>when the sudden stop occurred.</i>

630
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,261
- Abby?
- Yes, Abby.

631
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,099
- <i>[Booth] Why Abby?</i>
- Look, I'm Abby. You're Carly.

632
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,366
- Why am I always the murder victim?
- Sit.

633
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,840
- Zack's always the murder victim.
- Mmm.

634
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,174
I'm just driving along.
I undo Carly's seat belt, slam on the brakes.

635
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,180
She goes flying into the dash.

636
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,182
Go. Go.
Fly into the dash.

637
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,684
<i>The concussion disorients me.</i>

638
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,778
- Okay, don't overdo it, sport.
- Okay, what are we missing here?

639
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,187
The Stooges?

640
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,192
Abby's scaphoid
fracture was right to left...

641
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,923
which means she could've
received that break while stabbing Carly.

642
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,931
Yes!
[Grunting]

643
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,093
- I was wearing a punk bracelet, lots of metal.
- <i>[Hodgins] Uh-huh.</i>

644
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,660
- That could easily fracture the scaphoid.
- [Groans]

645
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:19,699
<i>Oh, okay. Look, we know that Ben had sex</i>
<i>with Carly in the backseat of that car.</i>

646
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,711
But you didn't find
any evidence of rape.

647
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,111
So the sex they had
was consensual.

648
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,810
This part will be left
up to the imagination.

649
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,980
<i>And since there's no way to pinpoint the time</i>
<i>the sexual activity took place...</i>

650
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,183
Ben and Carly were having an affair.

651
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,692
And they did it in Abby's car?

652
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,752
No wonder she was pissed.

653
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,890
Abby is in charge of, uh... of all the equipment
Carly is sent for endorsement...

654
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,561
so she knows about the knife.

655
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,400
So Abby kills Carly.

656
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,839
<i>Yes! Abby kills Carly,</i>
<i>pulls her out of the car.</i>

657
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,173
- Oh, boy.
- Drags her into the old stone house.

658
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,373
- I don't think this is necessary.
- Destroys the murder weapon...

659
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,439
leaving us little tiny shards to find.

660
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:03,283
Drives the car into the ravine
where she expects it'll be found quickly.

661
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,812
<i>And locks herself in the trunk. Wow.</i>

662
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,554
But there was no hikers
in the area to find her...

663
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,789
because she didn't
count on the rain.

664
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,195
Let's go back, Booth.
