1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,940
Cops say the body washed up on the bay.
They think it could be Carlie Richardson.

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:04,660
And I'm supposed to know who that is?

3
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,550
Yeah. Disappeared a year ago,
she was pregnant.

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:09,760
Come on, Bones.
You have to get a TV, you know.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,220
Or at least just thumb through
a people at the checkout stand.

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,020
Was it in the
Journal of Forensic Anthropology?

7
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:17,610
Oh, you know, I forgot to renew
my subscription. You know what, Bones?

8
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,460
You really need to take up
some other interests.

9
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,350
I'm reading Ted Joya's History of Jazz.
Was she mentioned in there?

10
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:25,821
Or maybe in
McGee's Science and Lore of the Kitchen.

11
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,737
Or perhaps I should develop an interest

12
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:30,133
in the mainstream
media's exploitation of crimes

13
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:31,623
for their entertainment value.

14
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,403
It's amazing, Bones.
You can really be snotty sometimes.

15
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,243
So, Carlie Richardson?

16
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,191
Carlie Richardson, newlywed.
Everyone assumed that she was murdered.

17
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:41,191
Husband was cheating on her,

18
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,822
there was evidence that
they had a fight that day.

19
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:46,323
He was covered in scratches. Witnesses
said that they saw him down by the marina.

20
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:48,791
But, hey, you know, without the body,
they had to kick him free.

21
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,541
Well, if she's been in the water for a year,

22
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,480
the bones will be saturated.

23
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,470
I'll need nylon mesh bagging and...

24
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:57,331
Cam's bringing in everything on the truck.

25
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,451
Well, after a year, there's not going to
be a lot of flesh for Cam to deal with.

26
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:03,563
Well, you know, hey,Bones,
you know, Cam, she's in charge now.

27
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,981
She runs the place, it's her call.

28
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,182
Then let's hurry.
I don't want my remains compromised.

29
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:09,432
Okay.

30
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:12,020
I don't care if she's the boss.

31
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:14,310
The bones belong to me.

32
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:15,941
Booth. Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:18,560
Rebecca. Whoa, wait a second.
Slow down, okay?

34
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,002
This is my weekend with Parker, okay?

35
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:22,430
I am his father, all right?

36
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,543
Stu is your boyfriend.

37
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,562
We're gonna be in the water, Doc.
Remember to bring Traxon and soluble tape.

38
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,191
Does she think I'm new at this?

39
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:32,991
I developed the use of Traxon...

40
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:35,143
- On the phone,Bones.
- I know. Get off. We have to go.

41
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:38,450
Rebecca, he's spending a lot of time with
Parker and I don't even know this guy.

42
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,262
She took Zack. Zack's mine.

43
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,033
Because you know what?

44
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,223
I just want to make sure
that he's a good influence.

45
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:45,781
The fact that he, you know,

46
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:48,583
rocks... rocks your world,
surprisingly that...

47
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:51,542
really, you know doesn't concern me.

48
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:52,601
I'll just meet you there.

49
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,160
Doesn't concern me.

50
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:57,281
I got to run, okay, Rebecca?
We'll talk about this later.

51
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,491
Bones, wait up!

52
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,711
Why can't you go faster?

53
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,140
I don't see why
I couldn't drive.

54
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:05,743
- Because you're agitated.
- I am not.

55
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:08,712
You know what? You've turned this into
a competition between you and Cam.

56
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:11,691
I just like to be first on the scene,
that's all, to protect the evidence.

57
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:14,140
She's not going to disturb anything.

58
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:18,622
No, it's all tissue and blood
and DNA with her.

59
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,710
She doesn't appreciate the skeletal system.

60
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:22,910
You could take the I-70. It'll be quicker.

61
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,113
Don't backseat drive, okay?

62
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,232
Oh, I think I know who's agitated.

63
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:29,162
Someone is annoying me, okay?
That's different.

64
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:30,411
- Your ex.
- Huh?

65
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,862
That's who's annoying you.
Because she has a new man in her life.

66
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:36,761
That's funny, you know, okay?
I am concerned about my son.

67
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:39,702
I want to know what kind of guy
this new boyfriend is.

68
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:43,050
And you know what? If she's not going
to tell me, I'll find out on my own.

69
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,771
Are you gonna run a background check on him?

70
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,152
When you have kids, we'll talk.

71
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,893
It's a lot to ask for a little conversation.

72
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,591
If you make a right,
we can cut through Grafton.

73
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:52,981
Fine.

74
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:16,660
She beat us here and she was in a truck.

75
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,593
Well, you know, you're the one
who wanted to go through Grafton.

76
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,250
Well, you could have used the siren.

77
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,053
I mean, why do you have one if
you're not going to use it?

78
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,003
Oh! What's that smell?

79
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,733
Zack, I need some sterile tubes
before she's fertilizer.

80
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:29,090
Okay, that's the smell.

81
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:33,110
Caucasian, female,

82
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:35,090
25 to 30.

83
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,012
Barnacle and small mussel encrustation

84
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,412
indicates she's been in the water
for about a year.

85
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,692
No. They have.

86
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,692
God.

87
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,680
The size of the fetal bones
indicates the fetus was viable.

88
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,890
How could someone do this to their own kid?

89
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,091
Multiple fractures.

90
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:54,691
They could be from an assault or

91
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:57,490
from being battered by rocks
and debris while in the water.

92
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:02,003
Stab wounds evident on ribs,
manubrium and clavicle.

93
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:05,312
And ulna, radius, one to the sphenoid.

94
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:10,321
This was a very violent attack.

95
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:11,970
You find the murder weapon?

96
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,971
Not yet. The scuba guys just got here.

97
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:17,403
Tell them to look for a left leg
and missing fetal bones.

98
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,141
Looks like we finally get to
put Richardson away.

99
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,072
I love being a hero.

100
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:23,391
A heroine.

101
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:25,710
Mm, sounds too druggy.
I'm going with hero.

102
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,072
Whoa, what are you doing?

103
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:29,732
Scraping the adipocere
from the hands.

104
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,662
No, you could compromise the bone.

105
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,993
You should use suction back at the lab
if you want a conviction.

106
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,793
Of course, it's your call.

107
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:39,181
Are we gonna have
another murder here, or what?

108
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,542
No, no. I have the utmost
respect for the doc.

109
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,733
Glad she works for me.

110
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,533
Good.

111
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,701
You know, the clothes, they match the ones
she was last seen wearing.

112
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,400
The rope could be a match of the type found
in Richardson's house.

113
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:57,051
While you two do your thing,
I'm gonna go bring the son of a bitch in.

114
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:07,042
- Where's Richardson?
- I don't know!

115
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,462
He saw this and then he took off.

116
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:12,283
I tried to stop him, but then he hit me.

117
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,523
He said he's never coming back!

118
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:20,752
Sources indicate both mother and
her fetus were stabbed to death.

119
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:23,483
Kyle Richardson remains the chief suspect.

120
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:27,482
Bones 2x02 - Mother and Child in the Bay

Resynch: hanest

123
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:57,831
Cam, this is the evidence taken from
Kyle Richardson's house a year ago.

124
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:59,850
So, we got rope,

125
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,852
the plastic sheeting, knife set,

126
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,350
one knife missing, Richardson's DNA results.

127
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:06,153
File says witnesses placed Richardson

128
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,452
at the marina on the bay
the night she disappeared.

129
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,363
Looks like he's not walking
this time, Seeley.

130
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,423
Ironic since he's running now.

131
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:14,832
Hodgins, you know Booth is bigger
than you, right?

132
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:16,011
Right.

133
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,362
Wasn't your fault, dude.

134
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:21,662
Let's focus, people.
This should be a slam dunk.

135
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,782
We screw this one up,

136
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm gonna look like a fool and
someone's gonna have to pay for that.

137
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,253
We just started collecting evidence.

138
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:30,312
There are boxes of evidence.
The remains are icing on the cake.

139
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,551
Let's just hand the prosecutor
what she needs

140
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:35,562
so I can have a nice weekend
knocking back shots and playing poker.

141
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,122
Yeah, that should motivate us.

142
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,830
I'm going to strip the flesh and adipocere,

143
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:41,942
remove anything from under the fingernails.

144
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:44,327
There was a dead fish in the plastic.

145
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,333
Ooh, and it's not even my birthday.

146
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,183
He saved the fish.

147
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:52,191
Stomach contents and particulates
could give us drift patterns,

148
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,591
show where she was left
before she washed ashore.

149
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,441
Not much left of the organs.

150
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:59,021
Looks like I can still find a few surprises

151
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,523
from what's left of this lung.

152
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:02,793
Looks like some liver here.

153
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,832
I'll take any tissue
that stuck to the plastic.

154
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,720
There'll be sediment and
organic particulates.

155
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:09,211
What do you want?

156
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,002
George Clooney naked
on a white sand beach, but

157
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:15,342
I can give you faces after
the skull's reconstructed.

158
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,922
Zack will start on them right away.

159
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,613
After you've stripped any tissue,

160
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:21,311
I would like to reassemble
the victim and the fetus.

161
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,262
Sounds like fun.
Let's do it.

162
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:41,592
It was male.

163
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:44,513
He, not it,
Bones.

164
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:48,643
I'm going to go talk to his girlfriend.
No mistakes on this one.

165
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,093
He always was a little touchy.

166
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:55,622
Yeah.

167
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,481
I didn't know Kyle then.

168
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,811
We started going out
after his wife went missing.

169
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,212
Mm-hmm. Did he ever mention
the night she disappeared?

170
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:16,052
Of course.
It was terrible for him.

171
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:19,641
I just tried to support him
and help him get past it.

172
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:24,080
He looks like he had a lot of people...
to help him.

173
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:27,683
And he looks really, really broken up.

174
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,522
I know he dated other women,

175
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,181
but he's not who you think he is.

176
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:36,012
No, of course not.

177
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:44,711
- Oh, my God!
- Agent Booth, is that necessary?

178
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:46,550
Just trying to help her remember.

179
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,931
He would never do this.

180
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:52,143
- He could never do this.
- He hit you when he was leaving, didn't he?

181
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:55,470
I know. That is because
I wanted to go with him,

182
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,471
and he knew everyone would be after him.

183
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:59,060
He was just trying to protect me.

184
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,961
Yeah, he's a real prince.

185
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:05,211
If he contacts you...

186
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,030
call.

187
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:10,141
Otherwise, you're looking at obstruction
of justice, aiding and abetting,

188
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:11,943
and I'm surewe can find a few other charges

189
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,943
to make it worth the money
you're paying your lawyer.

190
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:21,181
There's another gash
on the second rib, right side,

191
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:24,043
approximately 45 degrees, left to right.

192
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:26,932
Why didn't he just divorce her?

193
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,972
Why did they have
to get married in the first place?

194
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,960
It's an antiquated ritual.

195
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,043
Carlie Richardson believed in it,

196
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,240
trusted her husband, and look what happened.

197
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,830
So this is marriage's fault?

198
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:40,393
Committing yourself to one person
isn't in the interest of the species.

199
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,670
I mean, you have multiple partners.

200
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:44,762
Don't say it like that.

201
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:45,882
I date.

202
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:50,141
The notion
of a committed relationship's fantasy.

203
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:54,052
Look at Booth. Fighting with his ex,
his son caught in the middle.

204
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:57,741
We make our lives out of chaos and hope...
and love.

205
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,252
Someday you'll meet somebody.

206
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,750
I don't need anything more
than I have now.

207
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,090
Talk about a fantasy.

208
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:11,203
The skulls are in multiple pieces,
but the damage is from debris in the water.

209
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,141
Then let's start on the stab wounds.

210
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,080
I'd like you to confirm the type
of knife used in each of these.

211
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:18,042
Oh, these all appear to be from the knife

212
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:20,142
that was missing from the set
taken from Richardson's.

213
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:23,230
Appear?
No conclusions without corroboration.

214
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:26,161
But Dr. Saroyan seems
certain that Richardson...

215
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,163
Seems? You're my grad student.
You work for me.

216
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:32,671
Remember, Doc,we're building a case here,
not getting our rocks off on research.

217
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:35,182
Rocks and sediment are Hodgins' specialty.

218
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,023
You're serious?

219
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,003
Okay.

220
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,382
Brought your hand back.

221
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:46,431
I found organic material under
the fingernails. Should match Richardson.

222
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,822
And I found something else
I'd like you to look at.

223
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:52,063
It's here in the lung.

224
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:53,683
It's a locket.

225
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:58,532
Must've been around her neck and melted
into the lung during putrefaction.

226
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,113
Before I remove it,

227
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:04,943
I want to see if any of your cyborgs
can do anything with the photo paper.

228
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,231
There's not enough left.
It's liquefied.

229
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,540
It's probably just another picture
of the lovebirds anyway.

230
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:16,562
Oh, what's this?

231
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,151
- Oh, no.
- Who's Kenny?

232
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,353
I don't know. I don't want to know.
I just want it to be Richardson.

233
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,443
That's right because of
the drinking and the poker.

234
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:40,142
Yeah, I know there's
a lot of animals at the zoo.

235
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:42,971
The monkeys...
monkeys are Daddy's favorite.

236
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:44,832
They're just like people.

237
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,741
Actually, three million base pairs of the

238
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,843
genome differ in protein encodg
and other functional areas.

239
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,291
What?

240
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,881
Genetic differences between
chimps and humans.

241
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,330
I'm talking to a four-year-old, Bones.

242
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,750
Oh, yeah...

243
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:03,392
you're spending a lot of time
with Drew, huh? Oh, that's great.

244
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:06,741
Okay, you've got to go eat. Okay, go eat.
Make sure... okay, I love...

245
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:09,763
Yeah.

246
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:12,061
Her boyfriend spending
a lot of time with your son?

247
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,171
Yeah.

248
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:15,803
So you got any,
uh, new information for me, Bones?

249
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,442
- I'm sorry.
- Nah, it's no need.

250
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,810
It must be hard not being able
to see him when you want to.

251
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:24,100
You see, this is information that I already
know, Bones. Why don't you--

252
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,662
Let's say we just discuss the case, hmm?

253
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:29,553
Sure.

254
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,972
You know, I'm his father.

255
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,800
You know, Parker knows that.

256
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:37,923
I mean, that's-that's what's important,
not some stupid trip to the zoo.

257
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,462
- Yeah,absolutely.
- Right.

258
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,593
- Yeah.
- Done.

259
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:41,991
- Of course.
- Boom.

260
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:48,180
Well, we found this in her lung.

261
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:49,813
What?

262
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,443
- Her lung?
- It was enveloped during decomp.

263
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:56,172
Kenny?

264
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:58,550
Any reference
to a Kenny in the case file?

265
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:01,530
No, but whoever Kenny is liked
her enough to get her a locket.

266
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:03,751
Maybe Kyle wasn't the only
one who was cheating.

267
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:05,803
- Opens up a lot of possibilities.
- Yup.

268
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:10,781
I say we just go talk to Carlie's friends
and see if they know who Kenny is.

269
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,511
The four of us got so close being
in the same Lamaze class.

270
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,220
Losing Carlie was like losing a sister.

271
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,680
It was her idea to start this baby group.

272
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:26,041
We all felt so connected, feeling someone
growing inside, waiting to meet them.

273
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,650
- Do you have kids?
- He does.

274
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,193
They make you feel whole.

275
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:34,903
It's just a release of serotonin
necessary for the survival of the species.

276
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:35,950
Huh?

277
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:39,540
Never mind, um... we found this,
uh... locket on Carlie's remains,

278
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,723
it says, uh, "I love you, Kenny."
Did she ever mention a Kenny?

279
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:45,320
Yes.
She talked about Kenny all the time.

280
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,910
He's never mentioned in the police report.

281
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:49,953
- Kenny was her dog.
- Her dog?

282
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,560
Kyle bought her the dog when things we
better between them. She loved that dog.

283
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:56,270
There used to be
a picture of the two of them in there.

284
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:57,822
Oh, where is her dog now?

285
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,403
It died. Mary took care of it.

286
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,780
I'm a vet; they brought it in...

287
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:04,713
a few months before Carlie disappeared.

288
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:07,151
Kyle said he backed over it accidentally.

289
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,800
Carlie always felt he did it on purpose.

290
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:12,530
He was a real piece of work when he got mad.

291
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,980
A dead dog? Excellent.

292
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:20,400
So, we're back to one suspect: Richardson.

293
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,353
I like this. Good work.

294
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:24,070
Do you want children?

295
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,711
- What?
- Children?

296
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,502
Maybe, if I could
find one that sleeps late and cleans.

297
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,313
Does this apply to the case in any way?

298
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:33,930
No, just curious.

299
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,922
Most people think it's odd when
a woman doesn't want children, but,

300
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,472
obviously, you don't.

301
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:41,742
Are you pregnant?

302
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:44,762
No... I'm not.

303
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,310
Why are you looking at me?

304
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,031
Well, as long as you're not leaving
the lab every two minutes to pee.

305
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:52,121
No intention of it.

306
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,350
So all this back and forth was for nothing.

307
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,653
Good to know.

308
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:59,840
Now, unless the liver has a written
confession in it by a pet parakeet,

309
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,571
we should have enough to build a solid

310
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,071
forensic case against Richardson
for the prosecutor.

311
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:06,811
I found something that might put a new
wrinkle in things.

312
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,030
Great.

313
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,130
Oh, God.

314
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:14,311
The fish was a Pomatomus saltatrix,
a bluefish, common to Delaware Bay.

315
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:17,960
And there were dinoflagellates consistent
with the saltwater in the bay.

316
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,133
Dozing off, Hodge-podge.

317
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:24,101
But I also found didinium,
a ciliate, and oomycota,

318
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:27,000
a mold, both of which are found
in freshwater.

319
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:29,830
So, the body was in fresh
and salt water.

320
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:32,073
Exactly.
Freshwater first for at least six months.

321
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:33,683
Okay, now we have witnesses that put

322
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,880
Richardson at the marina that night;
there is no freshwater in that area.

323
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:40,053
So, maybe Richardson didn't do it?

324
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,642
Richardson is the only logical suspect.
Are we working for the defense now?

325
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,771
I'm working for the victims and

326
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,171
we have to be open
to the evidence as it presents itself.

327
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:53,900
The knife, the rope, the plastic sheeting

328
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,500
are all from Richardson's house,
that's been confirmed.

329
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:57,782
We're trying to build a case here, people.

330
00:15:57,785 --> 00:16:00,663
We don't ignore facts just because they
might change the outcome of a case.

331
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,113
Not asking you to, Doc,
I just want you to fill in the blanks.

332
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,961
There must be freshwater close enough
for Richardson to have dumped the body.

333
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,242
It has to have the same sediment, larvae,
archaea, helminths...

334
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,593
Great. Whatever the hel- minths
those are find them.

335
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,120
And if we find a body of water that

336
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,121
matches, it has to be dredged for
additional body parts.

337
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:17,771
We're still missing the left patella,
tibia and calcaneus.

338
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,371
- And the fetus is missing the...
- Okay,fine.

339
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,341
Just stop talking and do it.

340
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,931
Hey, so... is this the only
freshwater near the bay?

341
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:28,373
The only body of water that might

342
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,173
have algae and sediment that could
match what we found on the remains.

343
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,710
Whoo! Seems to be a lot of gamophyta.

344
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:36,771
Is that good?

345
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,793
I won't know until I compare it to
the samples in the lab.

346
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,242
Then why'd you act so excited?

347
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,903
I guess I just like gamophyta.

348
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:44,291
You know, you really don't
have to act any geekier.

349
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,262
The whole outfit does it for you.

350
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:47,811
Geek chic, dude.

351
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,221
Agent Blondie over there thinks I'm hot.

352
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,802
How ya doing?

353
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:56,701
Anything?

354
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,623
Another Top-Flite.

355
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,993
You know, I went out with a woman
who had a little kid once.

356
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:05,690
Aren't you supposed to be looking for slime?

357
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:08,381
The kid hated me, you know,
he said I used too many big words.

358
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:11,353
- Well, he got that right.
- He hit me in the head with a Tonka truck.

359
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:13,163
I could never sleep with his mom again.

360
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,883
Well, you know,
at least the story ends well.

361
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,262
I was good to him, though, you know?
I mean,

362
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,961
I did not deserve
an 18-wheeler to the parietal bone.

363
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:22,061
Ooh, nematodes and planaria.

364
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:23,522
Does that mean anything?

365
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,440
Not sure.

366
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,612
Anything?

367
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,250
Bones. Could be from the fetus.

368
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:33,420
Hamate, triquetral,
portions of the phalanges

369
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,360
and another Top-Flite.

370
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:44,342
According to the reconstruction with these
new bones, the fetus has seven fingers.

371
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,311
And two right hands.

372
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,580
I don't understand.
Was there another victim?

373
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:51,202
Double the magnification.

374
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:59,583
Here, look at the structure
of the phalanges.

375
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,763
The bones from the lake are from a raccoon.

376
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:07,703
The formation of the hands
is almost identical to an infant's hand.

377
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:09,791
How did you do?

378
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,670
We found a raccoon, you?

379
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,372
The sediment and
organic material from the lake

380
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,171
doesn't match what was
taken from the remains.

381
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,983
I have to look for another body of
freshwater. I don't think it's around here.

382
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,291
What have you got?

383
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:20,011
Nothing.

384
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:23,440
And the next body of freshwater that
might be a match is over 60 miles away.

385
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:26,560
Richardson couldn't have been there.
It wouldn't match the timeline.

386
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,410
I've got the board of the Jeffersonian,
the federal prosecutor

387
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,871
and Nancy Grace ready to devour me if I
don't hand them enough to indict Richardson.

388
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,693
Well, if you want us
to manufacture evidence...

389
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,153
No, I want us to find out who
killed Carlie, and I'm pissed

390
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,962
'cause whoever did it is messing with
me and I don't like that.

391
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,763
I like doing the messing.

392
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,652
Then we have to determine whether we're
wasting our time on Richardson.

393
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:45,962
Tell me what you need.

394
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,740
His plates were found in a ditch
on Route 432.

395
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:51,101
His car in a vacant lot in Huntsville.

396
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,883
He could be using another car
or he could be hiding out.

397
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,152
Can anybody I.D. him?

398
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:57,302
I've got I.D.s coming in from
all over the place.

399
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:59,892
This is where the concerned citizens
all come out for the reward.

400
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,623
Excuse us, Agent Booth?

401
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,623
- Let me know if you find something.
- Sure.

402
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,402
I'm Dennis Campbell.
This is my wife, Patricia.

403
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:14,492
- We're Carlie's parents.
- Yes, I know. Please... sit down.

404
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:19,962
I'm so sorry for your loss.

405
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,502
Well, at least now our daughter can rest

406
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,701
with her baby and Kyle can never
touch them again.

407
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,910
The reason we're here...

408
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,100
We were going through some photos
for the funeral and...

409
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,322
we came across this one.

410
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,410
Kyle used to go out of town on business.

411
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,802
His firm had an office in Boston.

412
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,480
Carlie went with him once.

413
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,522
This is them with some people in Boston.

414
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,881
That woman on the news, Karen Tyler,

415
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,521
she said she met Kyle
after Carlie disappeared,

416
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:47,250
but here she is looking at him.

417
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:50,022
He admitted to being involved
with those other girls.

418
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,301
Why did he lie about knowing her?

419
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,361
- May I keep this photo?
- Of course.

420
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:57,122
We need em to answer for this.

421
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,101
She was our little girl.

422
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,130
She wasn't supposed to go before us.

423
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,141
That's not the way it's supposed to be.

424
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:09,972
I know. We'll find Kyle.

425
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:11,990
I promise.

426
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:21,831
You want me to what?

427
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:23,393
Stab the body for me.

428
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:26,903
We need match force
with the injuries recorded on the remains.

429
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:29,212
Okay, I'm stabbing the body.

430
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,942
Well... it's a replica.

431
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:34,072
We're all going to do it, you're just
the closest to Kyle Richardson.

432
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,371
Okay, you know what, that's great.

433
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:38,440
I'll be there in 20, but in the future
you just have to ask me differently, Bones,

434
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:42,243
because you know what,come over to your
place to stab a body,that is just freaky.

435
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:43,660
Seeley, you son of a bitch.

436
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,922
Oh... I, uh, Rebecca, wow, you look great.

437
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,242
Yeah, okay,s ave it, 'cause I need a lot
more than compliments from you right now.

438
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,360
Okay, just keep it down for a little bit,
you know, 'cause I'm at work, all right?

439
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,283
You sent agents to investigate Drew

440
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,711
because you're going to stop that now.

441
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:56,190
Okay, listen, I'm just being cautious.

442
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:57,430
What do you really know
about this guy anyway, huh?

443
00:20:57,436 --> 00:21:00,202
I know...I-I-I know that he has a good job.

444
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:03,223
And I-I know that he fixes stuff around
the house when he says he's going to.

445
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,172
And I know that Parker is crazy about him

446
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,882
and he's not terrified every time

447
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:10,480
he goes off to work that he's going to
get shot and I know that I love him.

448
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:13,090
I love him.

449
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,611
And now everyone at work
thinks he's a criminal.

450
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,212
Well, he's been spotted with explosives.

451
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:19,200
He is a construction foreman,
he does demolition,

452
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,353
I mean, you must've figured that out
when you were doing all of your snooping.

453
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:23,690
Look, I have a right to know
who's hanging around my son.

454
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:25,501
All right, he spends more time
with Parker than I do.

455
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:27,710
Okay, you think that I would
put Parker in danger?

456
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:29,221
Let me ask you a question, Rebecca.

457
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:32,122
Why is it that you keep all the men
in your life such a secret?

458
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:36,100
Because you always interrogate them or
intimidate them and it freaks them out.

459
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,840
Well, I mean, come on, a lot of them are

460
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:40,140
a little strange, I mean,
the guy with the tattoos on his neck.

461
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:44,092
Hold on, I don't even have to let you
see Parker, okay, not-not legally.

462
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,513
That's one of the upsides
of not being married.

463
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,860
Don't.

464
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:50,881
I'm a good father.
You know that.

465
00:21:53,255 --> 00:21:55,181
You have got to stop trying to run things.

466
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:57,763
I've got things in my life that
have nothing to do with you.

467
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:58,901
All right, look. You know what?

468
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:01,300
We are always going to have
something to do with each other

469
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:03,142
because we share a son.

470
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:06,570
Drew's a good man, and you need to back off,

471
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,201
or you're not going to see
Parker again, I swear.

472
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:13,103
You back off.

473
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:24,930
Here comes Kyle.

474
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:26,630
Ha, ha, funny.
Don't we have something to stab?

475
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:28,740
This. I hate my job.

476
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:30,562
From the depth of the stab wounds,

477
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,153
we can tell the approximate force

478
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:35,151
required in Newton meters to inflict
the marks we see on the bones.

479
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:37,031
So, we have to measure

480
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:41,131
the amount of force generated when
we stab to give us the the size,

481
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:43,233
weight, and body type of the assailant.

482
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,380
You had to dress her up.

483
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:47,670
The clothes she wore figure in
the resistance to the blows.

484
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:51,102
The knife is consistent with the one
that caused the wounds.

485
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,360
We fitted it with an instrument and blade

486
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:57,712
that will give us a digital readout
of the newton meters of each stab.

487
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,953
It's a dual mass drop system.

488
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,623
All I hear is blah, blah, blah.

489
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:04,021
Cliff Note's version:
we all stab, one of us is the killer.

490
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:06,342
- Thank you.
- Sort of like a real creepy party game.

491
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,401
The violence of the attack shows rage,

492
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:11,291
so everyone should stab as hard as they can.

493
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:21,532
This better work!

494
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:29,620
That was weird.

495
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,603
Okay, okay.

496
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:36,962
Results?

497
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:40,531
The force used to make
the injuries on the bones

498
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:42,352
was 24 newton meters.

499
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,680
And the winner is,

500
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:47,921
with 24 newton meters...

501
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:51,391
Angela.

502
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,641
What?

503
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:54,113
Congratulations.

504
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,230
Really?

505
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:56,533
Height and weight?

506
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:57,912
Oh,God.
Uh, uh...

507
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,122
Five, eight, one hundred and..

508
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,773
- What?
- 135.

509
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,123
It's all muscle.

510
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:08,832
Karen Tyler is

511
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:12,083
five-seven and 132 pounds.

512
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:16,490
So, Kyle's girlfriend kills Carlie
so they can be together?

513
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,530
Well, then, why did Kyle run?

514
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:20,500
Maybe he didn't.
It sounds nuts but

515
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:24,551
if she's the killer, maybe Karen got rid
of him too, to keep him from talking.

516
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:30,543
Okey, so you're sure that there's no way
Richardson could have made these wounds?

517
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:33,462
With his strength, the blows would have
sliced deeper into the bone.

518
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:35,370
Well, these seemed to go right through.

519
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:37,832
Well, those were delivered after
she was on the ground.

520
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:42,901
So, Karen does the killing because
they know everyone will be suspecting Kyle.

521
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:45,351
I'd prefer not to make any more assumptions.

522
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:47,910
There are particles in the knife marks.

523
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:50,591
When she was on the ground,
the knife passed through the body

524
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,312
and picked up sediment from the dirt.

525
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:54,762
The next stab imbedded that into the bone.

526
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:56,981
If I can get enough information
from these particulates,

527
00:24:57,085 --> 00:24:58,801
I might be able to locate the site
of the murder.

528
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,411
DNA results came back.
It was Kyle under her nails.

529
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,660
So he was there, too?

530
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:05,810
Maybe. But we know he had a fight
with her earlier that he admits.

531
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,533
Fortunately, there was also the skin
of somebody else.

532
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:10,280
Test showed it was a woman.

533
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:11,822
Hmm. Karen Tyler.

534
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,802
We should get her DNA drawn
as soon as possible.

535
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,552
Smart. Let's go.

536
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,263
I didn't do it.
I swear, I would never hurt her.

537
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:22,312
Hmm. And the other day,you said you
and Kyle didn't know each other until

538
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:23,510
after Carlie disappeared.

539
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:25,760
Because we both knew
what everyone would think.

540
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:27,252
Karen, please don't say anything.

541
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,111
Mm, even your lawyer thinks you did it.

542
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:32,751
Kyle thought we should separate and meet up
in a few months, so,

543
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:35,331
you know, it wouldn't look so bad.

544
00:25:35,338 --> 00:25:36,820
Well, that didn't work out, now, did it?

545
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,302
Open your mouth.

546
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:40,140
Do I really have to do this?

547
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:41,690
They have a warrant.

548
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:43,973
When you were sleeping with Kyle,

549
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,172
didn't it matter to you that
you're destroying a family?

550
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:47,713
We were in love.

551
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:51,312
Oh. Love.
Sorry. Now it's a beautiful story.

552
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,001
Open again.

553
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:54,921
Ouch!

554
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:56,020
Oops.

555
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:59,033
Kyle was going to tell her.
We were going to be honest.

556
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:00,920
Mm, 'cause you know you do that so well.

557
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,801
I would never hurt her.

558
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,333
And neither would Kyle.

559
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:06,691
Kyle.

560
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,770
Right, the love of your life
who no one has seen for two days.

561
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:13,351
Can you see why
I'm leery of relationships?

562
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,442
We hit paydirt.

563
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:22,101
Actually, we hit silt containing the feces
of the gypsy moth, some quartz and mica.

564
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:23,783
That and the zinc levels in the

565
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:26,880
dinoflagellates from the freshwater
as well as the Pinaceae pollen

566
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:31,980
led us to a patch of pitch pines
outside of Gloucester City, New Jersey.

567
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:34,540
She was killed right here.

568
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,582
And when did they move her to the bay?

569
00:26:36,687 --> 00:26:38,920
They didn't.
They left her in New Jersey.

570
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:42,033
In the Rancocas Creek.
She made it to the bay on her own.

571
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:44,211
- Oh, what, he take the shuttle?
- Basically.

572
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:48,252
Two days after Carlie disappeared, there
were thunderstorms in Central New Jersey.

573
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,902
Heavy, heavy rains.

574
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:54,033
The body must have been flushed down
the Rancocas and into the Delaware River.

575
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:58,402
Then, she slowly made her way down
the Delaware and into the bay.

576
00:26:59,446 --> 00:27:02,682
The movement and the battering
on the rocks loosened her weight,

577
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:06,223
so she floated to the surface
and washed ashore.

578
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,841
I'm pretty sure Karen
didn't see that coming, hmm?

579
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:23,311
Now you're sure this is it?

580
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:26,053
Zinc, mica, feces-- this is the place.

581
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:27,691
Uh, it's beautiful here.

582
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:29,891
Yeah, because, you know,
that's important for a murder.

583
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,890
Okay, the bodies were wrapped
on the bank of the river.

584
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:33,930
Sift the soil for the missing bones.

585
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:35,640
Agent Booth?

586
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:37,692
Over here.

587
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:42,352
Look at that-- "C.R."

588
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,443
Carlie Richardson's initials.

589
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:56,923
You don't pack face cream and a nightgown
if you're being abducted.

590
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,741
Lot of vacation cabins nearby.

591
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:01,013
If she was upset, this would be a good place
to unwind.

592
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:03,481
Oh, Karen Tyler said that she liked Carlie.

593
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:06,682
She could have befriended
her to lure her up here.

594
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:10,343
Maybe Carlie's friends
knew that she and Karen...

595
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:12,891
were getting chummy.

596
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:14,980
Did Carlie know about her?

597
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,642
I thought they just started going out.

598
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:19,141
No. They knew each other from before.

599
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:21,431
That bastard.

600
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:24,092
Carlie knew Kyle was cheating on her.
That's why they were fighting.

601
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:26,580
And why she didn't want the baby.

602
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,873
- Did she say that?
- I don't care what's happening.

603
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,782
To say that you don't want your child
when you're getting ready to give birth--

604
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:33,413
it's not right.

605
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,133
I think I did see this woman.

606
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:37,120
I was driving home from work.
They were in front of a Starbucks.

607
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,772
I'm not sure if it was
the day she disappeared,

608
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:41,172
but I'm pretty sure it
was around the same time.

609
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:42,283
Thanks.

610
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:47,850
Your kid's eating sand.

611
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,180
I don't know how they can do it.

612
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:56,572
Self-obsessed. They have no conscience.

613
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:57,463
I don't know.

614
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:00,051
They destroy anything that gets
in their way. They're not even human.

615
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:02,881
- The mothers?
- Huh?

616
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:04,342
Well, I was talking about the mothers.

617
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:05,943
I'm talking about the killers.

618
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:07,312
I understand killers.

619
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:08,713
I just don't know how mothers can do it.

620
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:11,172
I mean, dogs can be
trained in a couple weeks.

621
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,262
With kids, mothers have
to give up their lives for years.

622
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:15,743
I don't know.
When you're looking at your kid,

623
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:16,843
you don't even feel like
you're giving up anything.

624
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:18,680
- So you'd do it again?
- What?

625
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,531
You'd have Parker even with
everything you're going through.

626
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:22,832
What kind of question is that?

627
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:24,883
Wouldn't it be easier if
Parker wasn't caught in

628
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:28,301
this drama of yours with Rebecca,
the new boyfriend?

629
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:30,741
God, no, no. Bones, he's my son.

630
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:33,541
Whatever we're going through,
it's-it's not about that. He knows that.

631
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:36,492
That's what parents say
when they want to justify themselves.

632
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:38,722
You know, I haven't walked
out on Parker, all right?

633
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:41,472
I would never have done
what your parents did.

634
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:43,352
Well, I didn't say you would.
I just...

635
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,733
I don't know.

636
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:49,263
You're the father. I don't know
anything about raising kids, so...

637
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:52,393
Parker's fine.

638
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,362
- It's not Karen Tyler.
- What?

639
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:59,083
The DNA from under
Carlie's fingernails doesn't match.

640
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,203
And something else is weird.

641
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:05,493
Tissue from the fetus shows evidence
of escitalopram.

642
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:06,230
What's that?

643
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,971
It's a drug prescribed for depression.

644
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:09,000
It's not weird.

645
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,752
Carlie Richardson was having
emotional problems with her husband.

646
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:13,600
Carlie Richardson wasn't taking the drug.

647
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,360
Hold on. None of this is making any sense.

648
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:16,512
I agree.

649
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,283
The only way the fetus could have
the drug in its system

650
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:21,481
is if it were passed from
the mother in utero.

651
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:22,880
Or through breast milk.

652
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:24,621
How do you breast-feed an unborn child?

653
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:25,782
Zack?

654
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:31,732
An infant skull is made up of
several separate bones that are...

655
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,333
eventually fuse together.

656
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,393
Look at the molding here.

657
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:38,792
Oh, my God.

658
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,293
I don't believe it.

659
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,502
Yeah.

660
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,530
Okay. Now everybody knows but me.

661
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:45,472
This is not a fetus.

662
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,542
The skull bones have shifted and overlapped

663
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,931
because this child passed
through the birth canal.

664
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:52,932
This baby was born alive

665
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,883
and lived about two weeks.

666
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,253
But Carlie was pregnant
when she was last seen.

667
00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:00,812
This isn't Carlie Richardson's child.

668
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:03,790
The escitalopram in its system
came from breast milk.

669
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,610
Then what happened to her baby?

670
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:10,142
The baby was
cut out of her and stolen.

671
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,032
This child replaced it.

672
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,280
This child was dead before
Carlie was murdered.

673
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:21,903
You can see the traces of
blood pooling in the cranium.

674
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,663
Abusive head trauma.

675
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,601
Evidence of shaken baby syndrome.

676
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:26,970
Oh,God.

677
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,722
You said the little guy was only
two weeks old.

678
00:31:29,728 --> 00:31:33,481
Whoever the mother was was probably taking
the mediation for postpartum depression.

679
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,193
She got upset with the baby--

680
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:37,170
crying's the most common cause--

681
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,961
and she shook him to quiet him down.

682
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:42,841
It can take as little as five seconds
for an infant to die by shaking.

683
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,882
Five seconds?

684
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:47,522
The veins that attach the brain to
the inside of the skull detach.

685
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:49,741
Blood pools, the brain swells...

686
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:51,262
Okay, I get it.

687
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:53,582
All right, so what you're saying is
that the mother kills her own son

688
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:56,020
and replaces him with Carlie's.

689
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:59,680
Fits the pattern-- she feels the guilt about
what she's done and needs to make it right,

690
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:02,013
prove to herself
that she's still a good mother,

691
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:04,673
so she takes Carlie's child
and makes it her own.

692
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:07,252
It's only been two weeks.
Not many people have seen her kid.

693
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:09,323
- Who would know?
- Yeah, but the stab wous?

694
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,642
All of Carlie's stab wounds
are to the upper part of the body.

695
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:16,663
The killer was careful not to
hit close to the uterus

696
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,613
because she wanted the baby alive.

697
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:22,762
Your report indicas there were
knife marks on the lower ribs.

698
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,921
They seem to be made by whatever

699
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:28,461
instrument was used to remove the child
after Carlie was dead.

700
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,343
Yup. I'm working on identifying it.

701
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:36,320
We might be able to use the child's
most prominent

702
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:39,123
genetic characteristics
to see similarities with the mother.

703
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:40,112
Ange,

704
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:43,852
can you input the information
from the infant's skull to give us a face?

705
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:45,300
Sure.

706
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:48,441
Booth.

707
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,563
Yeah. Right away.

708
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,461
They've found Kyle Richardson.

709
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,672
Got to wonder if he even cared,

710
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,570
you know, finding out that his wife is dead.

711
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,740
- He didn't kill her.
- No, but he ran.

712
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:03,811
How do you just cut your family
out of your life like that?

713
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,151
Well, what about Abraham?

714
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,130
Oh, you're going to throw religion
in my face right now?

715
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,521
I thought you found answers
in what you believe.

716
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:11,733
I mean, that's just one Bible story
that I just don't like.

717
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:15,253
I mean, God commands Abraham
to kill his own son, and he does.

718
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,953
No, Abraham does not kill Isaac.

719
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,081
But old Abe, you know, he had theintention.

720
00:33:19,087 --> 00:33:20,402
I thought what he had was faith.

721
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:24,082
Look, I have faith,
but if God himself came down,

722
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,573
pointed at Parker and said,
"I want you to..."

723
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:29,163
You know? That ain't gonna happen.

724
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:31,043
Well, God's messenger stopped Abraham?

725
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:32,803
Yeah. You know,
grabbed his hand at the last second,

726
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:34,701
right before the knife was about to go in.

727
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:37,601
Okay, then the lesson
I would learn from this myth...

728
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:38,543
Myth?

729
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,510
- Well, it fits the definition.
- Okay, fine.

730
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:43,910
That when it comes to your children,
your love has to be absolute.

731
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:47,583
The messenger represents goodness,
what you know to be right.

732
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:51,183
Ergo, you have to remain open
to what you know is true.

733
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,161
Are you sure you're not religious?

734
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,523
Science all the way.

735
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:57,481
Science all the way.

736
00:33:57,486 --> 00:34:00,421
Hey, even an empiricist
can have a heart, Booth.

737
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,121
Too bad Richardson doesn't.

738
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:08,231
Just lock me up.
I can't go through this anymore.

739
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:10,100
We know you didn't do it.

740
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,080
What?

741
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,571
Evidence doesn't fit you.

742
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:17,633
Then who was it? Who killed him?

743
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:20,172
You ran.
Seems like you'd be the one who'd know.

744
00:34:20,178 --> 00:34:21,440
I would have told someone if I knew.

745
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,643
Right, 'cause,you know,
you're such an honorable guy.

746
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,793
The knife, the rope, the sheeting--
it all came from your place,

747
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,763
and why didn't you tell the police
it was missing?

748
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,423
Oh. What, you check out
what's in your garage every day?

749
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,853
If you didn't know anything,
why'd you take off?

750
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,831
Because I'm a bastard.

751
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,713
I'm a selfish, pathetic bastard,

752
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:41,391
and everyone had already decided
that I was guilty.

753
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:43,253
- That's true, Booth.
- Bones.

754
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:45,460
No wanted to find another suspect.

755
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,092
I kept on insisting.

756
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,262
Thank you.

757
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,013
I didn't do it for you.

758
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:52,973
You are a pathetic bastard.

759
00:34:52,977 --> 00:34:55,163
Your wife was having your baby.

760
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:58,890
Look, I did want to leave her, yeah.

761
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:03,013
I was out that night,
trying to figure out how to tell her.

762
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:05,900
What with the baby and everything.

763
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:08,643
But for God sake,
I didn't want them to die.

764
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:10,763
So, you have no idea who did this?

765
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,600
I should,shouldn't I?

766
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:17,162
I mean,

767
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:20,702
I ignored her for so long.

768
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,100
It's like this whole thing
is my fault anyway.

769
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,082
You know, if I had been there that night,

770
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,173
maybe they'd still be here.

771
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:36,491
We think your child might still be alive.

772
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:41,111
I- I don't understand.
The bodies you found?

773
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,031
That wasn't your child.

774
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:48,692
Whoever killed Carlie took your child
and left theirs.

775
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,373
Oh, my God.

776
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:56,803
So, where's my kid?

777
00:35:57,925 --> 00:35:59,382
We don't know.

778
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:03,691
Zack is working
on the other knife mark.

779
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,163
I saw some staining in the groove it left,
so I did some tests.

780
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,711
The stain is from Betadine.

781
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:09,942
It's an antiseptic used to prep
patients for surgery.

782
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,632
Oh, someone was being really careful
when they were cutting her up.

783
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,523
It was the baby they were concerned with.

784
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:18,212
Were you able to get enough detail from
the skull for a digital reconstruction?

785
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,600
Yeah. Since someone this young
is still being formed,

786
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:24,652
the, uh, features are generalized.

787
00:36:26,305 --> 00:36:28,741
The last place I worked had
a drunk sketch artist.

788
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,513
Wow.

789
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,312
It's a baby.
It looks like every baby.

790
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:37,970
That's why I ran the reconstruction
through an aging matrix.

791
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:41,733
It posits the most likely growth pattern
the skull would follow.

792
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:45,022
Now, as it ages,
the features become more distinct.

793
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:47,412
By the time he's about ten,

794
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,480
he shows very definite
genetic characteristics.

795
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:02,931
Robby!

796
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,452
Don't eat that, honey.

797
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:06,982
Hey, there you go.
There you go, there you go!

798
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,511
The mark on the ribs was from a scalpel.

799
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,483
The woman is a vet,
so she has medical training,

800
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:13,230
which also explains the Betadine.

801
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:16,671
Look at her,huh? Playing with the kid.

802
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:17,470
It's okay.

803
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:18,970
Miss Corbus?

804
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,272
I'm gonna have to ask you
to hand us the child.

805
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:22,500
What? Why?

806
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:24,910
I think you know why.

807
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,412
No. You want me to give you my son? No.

808
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,081
He's not your son.

809
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:31,281
We know what happened.

810
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,993
He is. Robby is my son.

811
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:37,113
We have a warrant to take a DNA sample
from you, Miss Corbus.

812
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,823
It'd be pretty hard to argue with that.

813
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,920
She didn't want him.

814
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:50,701
She told me she wished she
had never gotten pregnant.

815
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:52,903
It was wrong for her to have him.

816
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:55,503
And killing your own child wasn't wrong?

817
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:58,112
That was a mistake. I am a single mother.

818
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:00,382
I'm alone. I just...
I just wanted him to stop crying.

819
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:02,741
It was just... it was just a few seconds.

820
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:06,973
The doctor said I was sick,
but I'm all better now.

821
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,321
I know, sweetie.

822
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,411
Miss Corbus?

823
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,250
You can't take him from me.
I'm a good mother.

824
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,493
You can ask anybody. I'm a good mother.

825
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:20,520
Give us the child.

826
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,093
I'm a good mother.

827
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:41,292
Mary Corbus, you're under arrest for the
murder and kidnapping of Carlie Richardson

828
00:38:41,295 --> 00:38:43,363
and the murder of your son Robert Corbus.

829
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,602
No, that's my Robbie, that's my Robbie.

830
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:47,492
Oh, my God!

831
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:51,021
I'm a good mother. I'm a good mother.

832
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:57,410
He's fine?

833
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:58,743
He's perfect.

834
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,571
- And you're sure...
- He's yours.

835
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:06,650
When I thought he was gone,

836
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,282
and Carlie

837
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,702
I wished
I could have changed how things had been.

838
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,210
Don't you want to hold him?

839
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:28,283
I don't know, um...

840
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:31,242
the kind of guy I am...

841
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,853
I'm no father.

842
00:39:32,857 --> 00:39:34,830
You don't get to decide that.

843
00:39:36,328 --> 00:39:37,932
You have a son.

844
00:39:39,498 --> 00:39:41,790
Step up.
Take him.

845
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:47,510
Hey.

846
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:53,753
Thank you.

847
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:55,552
Thank you.

848
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:10,612
So you think Richardson
can rise to the occasion?

849
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:12,680
Be a decent father?

850
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:14,862
He's got Carlie's parents to help him

851
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,921
and I like to think that people can change.

852
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:18,341
Faith and hope, right?

853
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:19,352
Right.

854
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:21,271
Ange will throw in love, too.

855
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:22,933
Love is good.

856
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,340
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

857
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,291
- Parker!
- Look what I did!

858
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:29,171
Wow, look at that.

859
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:34,691
Um, listen, you stay here
with Dr. Brennan, okay?

860
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:36,542
I'm going to go talk to
your mommy, all right?

861
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,982
All right?

862
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:42,523
So this is how it's got to go down.

863
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,882
I've got to meet your boyfriend
with Parker here.

864
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:46,253
Look, man, we're here because we want...

865
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:48,072
I'm talking to Rebecca.

866
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,913
Look, this was Drew's idea.

867
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,122
And, you know, I told him
it was going to be a bad one.

868
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:56,171
- Dad, look.
- One second, bud.

869
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:58,930
Parker wanted you to see
what he made for school.

870
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:01,040
And he kept saying how much
he wanted us to meet.

871
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,101
And we'd be friends.

872
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,112
Look, I got a kid
I don't get to see much myself.

873
00:41:09,545 --> 00:41:11,193
I know what it's like.

874
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:15,192
And I swear,
the explosives were for work.

875
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:16,632
Booth.

876
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:19,313
Okay, look, look, look, look.

877
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:21,283
We are what we are.

878
00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:25,122
And you can fight it if you want, but
you're just going to fight with yourself.

879
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:27,991
Maybe this isn't a good time.

880
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:30,323
Maybe later.

881
00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:35,533
No, no, it's a good time.

882
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:37,943
Let me buy you a cup of coffee,all right?

883
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:41,092
- Thats cool, have a seat.
- Seriously?

884
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,511
Thanks, man.

885
00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:45,590
That's okay, Bones, you can stay.

886
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:47,461
It's a family thing.

887
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,431
Bye, Parker.

888
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:49,850
- Bye.
- Bye.

889
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,883
All right, what do we got here, huh?

890
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:55,190
A diorama.

891
00:41:55,856 --> 00:41:57,702
It's the zoo. Drew helped me.

892
00:41:57,705 --> 00:41:59,350
The zoo? I hoped you thanked him.

893
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:00,772
He did. Yes, he did.

894
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,782
We gotta go to the zoo.

895
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,343
He knows all the animals.

896
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:05,861
All the animals?

897
00:42:05,866 --> 00:42:09,741
Wow. Okay, well, maybe afterwards
we could all go out to dinner

898
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:11,650
if that's okay with your mom.

899
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:16,201
Yeah, that sounds good.

900
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:18,402
My dad knows a burger place.

901
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,680
I used to take him there
after his T-ball games.

902
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:22,571
Tell Drew about the burgers.

903
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:24,050
He says they're as big as my head.

904
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:25,712
As big as your head. We can all go.

905
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:27,350
We can even bring Stu...

906
