1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,974
It's getting thicker
and thicker in here.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,740
That's why the forensic team
got lost.

3
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,740
I've sent somebody back
to find them.

4
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,874
Look, you sure you know
where you're going?

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,207
I still have trouble and I've
been here for three years.

6
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,406
That's why we advise
hikers to stay away.

7
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:21,373
I know I'm pining for concrete.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,640
You just, uh,
you stay close,

9
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:25,107
all right, Bones?

10
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:34,141
I don't want you
to get caught out here

11
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,699
when it gets dark. Okay?

12
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,707
BOOTH:
Bones?

13
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:42,174
Bones?!

14
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,241
Bones, where the hell are you?!

15
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,507
Bones?

16
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:47,573
I'm right here, Booth.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Don't do that, all right?

18
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:49,907
BRENNAN:
What?

19
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:51,740
Take off like that, okay?
You heard the guy.

20
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:52,974
I saw this.

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,640
Some sort of
talisman.

22
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,974
These are bones from a bird,

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,306
and the coloring
on the ornament

24
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,440
looks like dried blood.

25
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,107
There are more
of them, too.

26
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:04,940
They look like eyes.

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,473
Okay, this is weird.

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,940
You see a lot of these?

29
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,107
Not me, but I've heard some
other folks have come across

30
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:13,874
some pretty
strange stuff
in here.

31
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,373
Word is, it's Maggie Cinders.

32
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,273
There's a woman
who lives out here?

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,473
Did. Died in 1780.

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,507
Folks around here thought she
was a witch and beheaded her.

35
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:24,640
Legend is, she still
haunts the woods,

36
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:26,340
looking for her severed head.

37
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:27,840
And you believe this,

38
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:28,774
Ranger Edison?

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,273
Look, I'm just
telling you

40
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,673
what I heard.
Yeah, I'd prefer

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,406
we keep moving, okay?

42
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:35,306
EDISON:
This is one of

43
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,440
the only clearings around here.

44
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,573
The pit was covered
with sticks and leaves.

45
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,253
One of the hikers fell in on
the body, freaked and ran.

46
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,874
Maggie Cinders did say

47
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,998
she'd kill anybody who
dared to look for her.

48
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,207
So you talked
to Ms. Cinders?

49
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:53,540
That must have been difficult,
since she doesn't have a head.

50
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:54,373
Bag the eyes.

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,507
Give me a hand.

52
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,673
You want me to go down there
with you?

53
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,673
No. I don't want
the remains compromised.

54
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:01,905
(grunting):
All right?

55
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:03,037
Yeah.

56
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,673
So, uh, how'd
she kill them?

57
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,974
You know,
in the legend?

58
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,174
Like she was killed.

59
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,040
She cuts off their heads.

60
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:17,074
Iliac crest and pubis show
it's a male.

61
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,040
Epiphyseal fusion

62
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:20,273
puts him between 18

63
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,074
and 25 years old.

64
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,540
He's on a video camera.

65
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,707
Cause of death?
Well...

66
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,007
since I can't find a skull,

67
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:33,241
I'd say his head got cut off.

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,907
Since we don't have a head,

69
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:44,573
do we have enough
for an identification?

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,107
We'll look for older injuries

71
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:47,807
that might be found
in medical records.

72
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:50,241
More wood splinters.

73
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:52,907
Could have been the handle of
whatever lopped off his head.

74
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:55,207
If a ghost isn't comprised
of matter, but is
merely ectoplasm,

75
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:56,940
which is actually
the clear outer layer

76
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,340
of cytoplasm
on amoeboid cells,

77
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,406
how can the victim have suffered
bruising and multiple fractures?

78
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,774
Because there are no such things
as ghosts.

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,640
I thought you never
jumped to conclusions.

80
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,774
Well, it's safe
to dismiss fantasy

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,974
and deluded perceptions.

82
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:13,141
My mother came to me the day
after she died.

83
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,740
I wasn't some kid, I was 23.
She came to me...

84
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:23,174
She came to me... and told me
to look in her dresser,

85
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,507
third drawer,
behind her pink blouse.

86
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,074
There was something there
for me.

87
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:31,673
HODGINS:
The European
hornet queen

88
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,907
I found on
the remains

89
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:35,640
puts time of death at
November of last year.

90
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:36,774
We have more splinters.

91
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,174
The wood is from
a <i>Betula uber,</i>

92
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,141
a sub-species of
round leaf birch tree

93
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,507
that's been extinct since 1800.

94
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,174
The legend says that Maggie
Cinders kills her victims

95
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:52,940
with the same old axe used
to decapitate her in 1783.

96
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,607
Anyone else feeling tingly,
or is it just me?

97
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:59,273
BOOTH:
I checked missing persons.

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,440
A film student from UVA

99
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,707
went missing in the woods
last year.

100
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,874
He was making a documentary

101
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,141
on the
Maggie Cinders legend.

102
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:05,974
Graham Hastings, 21,

103
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,340
five-ten, 176 pounds.

104
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,440
That explains the video camera.

105
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:14,207
I, um, I got something
from the videotape.

106
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,807
<i>I cleaned a section</i>

107
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:17,974
of the tape
with an isopropyl
alcohol solution

108
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,373
and fed whatever digital
information I could salvage

109
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,340
into a restoration program.

110
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,507
WOMAN (faintly):
Brian?

111
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,241
I didn't get much--
maybe I got too much.

112
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,373
WOMAN ON TAPE:
Brian!

113
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,740
(wood chopping in distance)
Where's Brian?!

114
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,007
Where... Brian!
Lori..

115
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:33,174
MAN:
Lori, where are you going?

116
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,840
Lori, stop!

117
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,640
Stop, Lori!
Brian!

118
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:38,141
Brian...

119
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,707
(man panting
and whimpering in fear)

120
00:04:39,774 --> 00:04:43,974
(Lori screaming,
wood chopping in distance)

121
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,740
(panting)

122
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,807
The noises are getting closer.

123
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:53,207
I've lost Lori...
and Brian disappeared.

124
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:54,540
(whimpering in fear)

125
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,673
(chopping continues)
It's her. I can hear her.

126
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,440
She's here! She's here!

127
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,707
Oh... she's here!

128
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,340
Lori, where the hell are you?!

129
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,907
Lori!

130
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,074
Oh, my... Help!

131
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,874
Help me, oh...!

132
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,707
Oh... somebody help me!

133
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:15,007
Somebody help me, please!

134
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:33,864
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

135
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:49,864
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@FADEOUT Sync:FRM@¹¾ßË</font>

136
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:55,325
I never heard screams like that,
Dr. Brennan.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,167
Neither have I.

138
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,333
Narrow focus trauma
on the left humerus,

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,233
posterior side.
Indicates an attempt

140
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
by the victim
to shield his head.

141
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:05,233
>From the axe attack.

142
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,500
What?

143
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,500
It's always an axe, isn't it?

144
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:09,610
Remember <i>The Shining?</i>

145
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,101
My palms perspired profusely
during that film.

146
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,834
Until we complete a series
of blade comparison tests,

147
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,533
there's no way to know what type
of weapon was used.

148
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,751
Forensic team found
this near the pit.

149
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,252
Looks organic.

150
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:22,834
Definitely decomposing.

151
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Victim's preliminary tox screen
came back negative.

152
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,034
No drugs.

153
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:28,101
That's too bad.

154
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,433
Why?
Because drugs
would explain

155
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,201
the writings I found
inside Graham's backpack.

156
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,034
I'm cleaning them
and taking mud samples,

157
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,233
but I think Booth should
show them to a profiler.

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,496
They're handwritten, scrawled;
so far all I can make out is:

159
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:41,633
"Maggie came to me again...

160
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,800
calling me."

161
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,700
And last but not least:

162
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:49,300
"They will scream for air, but
their lungs fill with blood."

163
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:52,101
I'll redo the tox screen.

164
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,433
I may be alone in this,

165
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,206
but I think one of us should
remain a rational human being

166
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,900
during this investigation.

167
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:01,959
Got it.

168
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,067
Comminuted fracture
to the ulna,

169
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,209
professionally set.

170
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,943
ZACK:
>From the degree
of callous formation,

171
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,000
that's a childhood injury.

172
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,276
One that could give us
the ID we want.

173
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,377
I'll call Booth.

174
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,810
Tell him to contact
next of kin.

175
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,243
Zack, place some garlic
around the remains

176
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,110
and chant the Hmong ritual
for preservation of souls.

177
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,210
Really?

178
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,143
This is going to be a long case.

179
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,524
MAN:
Graham broke his arm...
sliding into second base.

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,543
He was... eight.

181
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,200
It's a match.

182
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,009
I'm very sorry.

183
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,655
Thanks.

184
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:43,310
I... can't say
that I'm surprised.

185
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:46,176
He, uh... he was missing
for a year,

186
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:47,909
but still, when you hear...

187
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,276
It was just us, you know?

188
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,810
My parents died in a car
accident, I was 18,

189
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:54,076
he was 13 and, uh...

190
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,744
When something like that
happens,

191
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,510
when you lose your parents
at that age,

192
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,410
it's just people
don't understand

193
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,343
how close
you become.

194
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,577
I lost mine when I was 15.

195
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:05,377
It was just.. me
and my brother, too.

196
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,610
He was 19.

197
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:09,292
Sorry.

198
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:11,043
Did Graham

199
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,143
live with relatives

200
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,377
or did he go into foster care?
No,

201
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,343
I would never let him go
into the system.

202
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,677
I, uh...

203
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,810
I dropped out
of college.

204
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,610
I joined the fire department
to support him.

205
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,043
Your brother didn't...?

206
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,876
It was a difficult situation
for him.

207
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,610
I understand.

208
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,610
I mean,

209
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:38,844
you know, seems like
you turned out okay, though.

210
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,981
Do you know who Graham was with
the night he disappeared?

211
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,915
Yeah. A couple of film students
from school-- there was a guy

212
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:50,915
and a girl.

213
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:52,416
I tried to get
the guy, Brian--

214
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:54,015
his name was-- to help
with the search,

215
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:56,249
but he-he was too freaked
to go back into the woods.

216
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:57,815
I've never seen
someone so scared.

217
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:00,082
So you were involved
with the search?

218
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,982
I've led a lot of search-
and-rescue operations
as a firefighter.

219
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,948
Uh...

220
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,145
I should have found him.

221
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,346
It's not your fault.

222
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:11,740
I should have locked
him in his damn room.

223
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:17,112
I mean, everyone knows weird
things happen in those woods.

224
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,176
The chatter marks mean
the vertebrae weren't split

225
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,543
in one blow.
Makes sense.

226
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,476
Knocking off someone's
head is more like

227
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,876
cutting down a small tree
than splitting a log.

228
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,276
I find your imagery both
colorful and accurate.

229
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,809
Thank you.

230
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,076
Let me know

231
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:36,809
when you've narrowed down
the weapon category.

232
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,543
Dr. Saroyan?

233
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,909
When you say

234
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:40,009
your mother visited you...

235
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,743
She appeared.

236
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,209
In my room.

237
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:45,209
It was early evening.

238
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:45,976
And you were frightened?

239
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,993
No, I felt...

240
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:50,936
loved.

241
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,743
Dr. Brennan says
that's impossible.

242
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,076
What do you think?

243
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,710
I think it would be wonderful
if it were possible.

244
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,743
I found rust flakes on the neck
that were from hand-forged iron.

245
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,809
18th century.
You got it.

246
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,909
My ...!

247
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,743
A little warning, Zack.

248
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,909
I don't usually announce
each phase of my experiments.

249
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,310
Yeah, maybe you should start.

250
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:15,677
Nice follow-through, dude.

251
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,143
It doesn't look like
it was a machete.

252
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,743
Dibs on the next weapon.

253
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:25,410
Looks like you have this
under control.

254
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,883
1

255
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:31,176
It was a free ride worth
about 30 grand a year.

256
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,343
Brian, the other kid,
you know, from the woods?

257
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,243
He applied for it
and lost out to Graham.

258
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,710
After Graham disappeared,
the fellowship went to Bri.

259
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,643
Did you hear me?

260
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,710
Yeah.

261
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,209
Doesn't look good
for Brian Andrews.

262
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,176
You okay?

263
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:49,343
I wonder what my life
would have been like

264
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,176
if Russ had raised me.

265
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:53,009
Well, you know, since
he was a petty thief,

266
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:55,343
you know, in and out
of jail all the time,

267
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,677
I'd, I'd imagine it
wouldn't have been very good.

268
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:02,086
If he'd accepted
responsibility for raising...

269
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,043
I'm romanticizing.

270
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:06,043
It's foolish.

271
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,643
Everyone does it,
Bones, okay?

272
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,643
It's normal.

273
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,909
It's a useless fantasy,

274
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,677
no different than
the childish legend

275
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,176
about the headless woman.

276
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:14,443
I mean, look at Will.

277
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,543
He sacrificed everything
for his brother

278
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,743
and still couldn't save him.

279
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,114
By walking out,
maybe Russ gave me my life.

280
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,677
But you know what Will said.

281
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,276
He was right.
You turned out okay.

282
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,777
I'm going to have coffee
with him.

283
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,109
Oh, that was quick.

284
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,276
He understands something
no one else I know does.

285
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,443
People need connection,
Booth.

286
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,677
Even me.

287
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,009
Obviously, you have one
with Cam.

288
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,243
What?

289
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,476
I thought you'd mention it.

290
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,976
I mean, isn't that
what partners do,

291
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,842
tell each other
about their lives?

292
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:54,909
Wait a second.

293
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:56,876
Look, Bones, I...

294
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:57,942
Sorry.

295
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,310
I'm sorry.

296
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,476
I forgot how self-conscious
you are talking about sex.

297
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:04,076
I am not.

298
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:06,176
I'm...

299
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:09,643
Graham was kind
of the star at school

300
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,109
so we all wanted
to work with him.

301
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:13,109
And he thought
the legend was true.

302
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,436
Said that Maggie Cinders

303
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,136
was talking to him
in his dreams.

304
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,499
She told him where

305
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:19,933
her head was buried.

306
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,534
And you believed him, too?

307
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,301
Not at first.

308
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,810
When we were out there
in the woods...

309
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:34,849
Stuff like that doesn't happen.

310
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,268
What kind of stuff?

311
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:37,967
Chopping sounds...

312
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:42,400
there were these eyes hanging
on all of the trees.

313
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:46,367
Something was moving
out there that wasn't us.

314
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,634
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

315
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,701
but you weren't out there, okay?

316
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:51,968
Lori, she freaked.

317
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,634
She took off
into nowhere.

318
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:57,968
And... that's when
we all got separated.

319
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:01,367
The police report said
that you brought Lori

320
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:02,767
out of the woods.

321
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:06,534
When I found Lori, she was just
curled up on the ground shaking.

322
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:08,367
So you took her out
of the woods,

323
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:09,934
but you left Graham?

324
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,467
I thought he had left <i>us,</i> okay?

325
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:14,491
You don't get it what it was

326
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:15,227
like out there.

327
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:19,034
His brother asked you
to go on the search with him,

328
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,834
but you didn't go.

329
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,001
Why didn't you go?

330
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,583
I'm not proud of myself, okay?

331
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:29,450
But I just couldn't go back out
there.

332
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,152
I couldn't.

333
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:35,101
Uh, Lori seemed to have
disappeared

334
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:36,068
from school.

335
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,068
You wouldn't happen

336
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,367
to know where we could find her?

337
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:41,078
I haven't seen her
since that night.

338
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,968
The last I heard,

339
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,868
she checked back
into the psych ward.

340
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,834
LORI:
I checked back in
because I couldn't sleep.

341
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,467
I haven't slept in days.

342
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,710
Thanks for meeting
with me, Lori.

343
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,771
Sure.

344
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,534
There's not much else

345
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:01,934
to do in here.

346
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:06,335
Hey, do you mind if I ask you
what happened that night

347
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:07,749
in the woods?

348
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,934
I've told the police everything.

349
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,968
But Graham is the only one
that can make things right.

350
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,434
He just got a little lost
in there.

351
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,701
But when he gets back,

352
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:20,667
he's going to make sure
that I'm safe again.

353
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,667
Graham,

354
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,201
he promised to take care of you?

355
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:24,567
Well, sure.

356
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,101
He's my boyfriend.

357
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:28,134
He doesn't want anything
to happen to me.

358
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,667
Your boyfriend?

359
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,251
We keep it a secret.

360
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,534
Other girls get jealous.

361
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,534
Everyone loves Graham.

362
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,834
Did, did you go into the woods?

363
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,567
Is that why you're here?

364
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:47,634
Yeah.

365
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:48,834
You found Graham?

366
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:51,868
He said he was going
to talk to Maggie.

367
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,101
Is that where you found him?

368
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,068
He wasn't with Maggie.

369
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,834
Oh, no.

370
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,400
No, no, no, no, no...

371
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,601
Lori?
Lori, calm down.

372
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,168
She killed him!

373
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,235
Sorry, Lori.
We need to know what happened.

374
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:10,968
That's what happened.

375
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,567
We need to know what happened
to him.

376
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:15,235
Did she take his head?

377
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:19,567
Oh...! No!

378
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,634
The blood...

379
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,068
I-I called for help,
but Brian wasn't there!

380
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:25,667
Rela... relax.
Rela... relax, Lori.

381
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,101
You're safe here.
Come here.

382
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,034
There was so much blood!

383
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:32,793
I tried to run!

384
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,526
Graham! Graham, she's coming!

385
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,659
Run, Graham!

386
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,092
Graham!

387
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,485
1
She freaked, Bones.

388
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,118
It was like
she was out there
in the woods

389
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:47,485
with that witch.

390
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:49,552
Don't let anyone else
hear you talking like
that, Booth.

391
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:51,589
I'm just saying

392
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:53,723
I've seen a lot
of weird things.

393
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,357
It was, like, you know,
 <i>Exorcist</i> weird

394
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:56,357
or <i>Elm Street</i> weird.

395
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,268
What are you 
talking about now?

396
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:58,923
They're movies,
okay, Bones?

397
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,466
Movies so scary
that you end up
peeing your pants.

398
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,699
Good to know.

399
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,668
I noticed some damage
to the subdeltoid bursa.

400
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,303
Looks like the subscapularis
was torn away.

401
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:08,303
BRENNAN:
They're fracture lines.

402
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:10,236
This was a postmortem trauma.

403
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:12,575
Meaning what?

404
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:15,542
The victim's shoulder was
dislocated just after his death.

405
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,142
The injury doesn't fit

406
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,709
into our established scenario
of the struggle.

407
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:22,943
These marks near the
vertebrocostal junction,

408
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,409
there's massive
hinge fracturing.

409
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,242
Zack, lie down
on the ground.

410
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:28,342
Face up or face down?

411
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:29,376
Face up.

412
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,909
This should be good.

413
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:32,509
And give me
your right arm.

414
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,275
Yeah, okay.

415
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,576
If Graham Hastings 
was dragged to the pit

416
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:39,076
by this arm
in this direction,

417
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:43,010
the trauma to the back of his
ribs would result in hinging.

418
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,676
And the exposed wound
where the head

419
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,275
was severed
would have been collecting

420
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:47,275
particulates
along the way.

421
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:48,275
Tell Hodgins we might

422
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,576
have enough for him
to determine

423
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:50,943
where the victim was beheaded.

424
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,576
Oh, yeah!
Double yeah.

425
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,309
I'm waiting to hear
from the psych ward

426
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,209
to see if we can
talk to Lori again.

427
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,509
I'll ask Will what type
of relationship

428
00:16:58,576 --> 00:16:59,943
Graham and Lori
really had

429
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,242
when I have coffee
with him.

430
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,609
Whoa. Wait a second.

431
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:03,876
You know,
we're investigating
his brother's death.

432
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,976
I mean, don't you think
that can get a little messy?

433
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:09,609
I can compartmentalize...
same as you.

434
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:11,309
Mm.

435
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:12,309
The blood on those

436
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,076
talisman things
hanging from the trees?

437
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:16,242
Not human.

438
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,743
I'll be back soon.

439
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,609
<i>I just want to thank you</i>

440
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,609
for everything
you're doing

441
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,209
to find out what
happened to Graham.

442
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,776
Is that why you called,
to thank me for doing my job?

443
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:29,479
That and, uh...

444
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,442
I didn't think you'd come,

445
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,010
so I guess I'm a little nervous.

446
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:37,110
Caffeine affects the adenosine
receptors in the brain.

447
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:39,542
It causes increased
heart rate, so...

448
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,076
There are other causes.

449
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,609
My partner warned me to stay
focused on the case, so...

450
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,342
If you've got questions,
that's cool.

451
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:50,809
Okay, um,

452
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,943
what kind of music do you like?

453
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,175
(chuckles):
That's a good question.

454
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,476
Um...

455
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,509
Snow Patrol.

456
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:02,282
1

457
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:06,142
Gravel voice,
but somehow it's soothing.

458
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,809
Yeah, I wonder why that is.

459
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:08,876
There's actually

460
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,609
no empirical way
of assessing something

461
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:11,876
like that.

462
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,876
But you didn't mean that
literally, did you?

463
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:14,943
Uh-uh.

464
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,776
I'm sorry. My...

465
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:22,643
my social skills
are very limited.

466
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:25,917
Trust me.
They're fine.

467
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,043
You know,

468
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,609
it took a long time
for me to understand how

469
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:37,376
my brother could leave,
and now it's just as odd

470
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:38,843
to meet someone
who stayed.

471
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,976
I thought about leaving
all the time.

472
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:43,209
I mean,
I was a kid.

473
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:47,010
I didn't know
how to be a parent.

474
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,010
I guess it was
my fault

475
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:50,209
that his head got so big,

476
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,809
and he was bossing people around
like he was

477
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:52,976
already Steven Spielberg.

478
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:54,943
Graham couldn't have been
all bad.

479
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,843
I mean, my partner says that
Lori seemed to love him.

480
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:59,843
Poor kid.

481
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,843
I liked her.
She deserved better.

482
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,542
Graham didn't treat her well?

483
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:05,576
No.

484
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:06,776
He juggled a lot of girls.

485
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:08,010
I don't know how he did it,

486
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:09,542
but no one ever found
out about each other.

487
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:10,709
So he cheated on her?

488
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,442
Doesn't run in the family,
by the way.

489
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:17,200
I have to get back to work.

490
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,843
Did I say something?

491
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,342
Maybe.

492
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,076
If I've offended you
in any way,

493
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:23,643
I'm sorry.

494
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,275
Do you like Massive Attack?

495
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:28,442
I don't know Massive Attack.

496
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,909
Very impressive integration

497
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:32,876
of radical politics
into their music.

498
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,307
I'll play 'em for you
next time.

499
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:53,100
I know where Graham Hastings
was murdered.

500
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:56,766
Are you trying to kill me?

501
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,340
What's with the music?

502
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,466
It helps muffle the screams

503
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,008
so I don't pass out
every few seconds.

504
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,710
Smart. We have to go through
all the video again.

505
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,509
Hastings was killed

506
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:09,710
in a patch of eastern
hemlocks like this.

507
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,077
They grow in clusters
throughout the forest.

508
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:12,176
We have to spot
the cluster

509
00:20:12,242 --> 00:20:13,576
Graham and the others
were near.

510
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:16,876
Wait. We have
to go through all
the video again?

511
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:18,309
Don't worry.

512
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,209
I'm right here
for you.

513
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:22,576
GRAHAM:
This is natural.

514
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:23,610
I mean, it's like,

515
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,043
it's like, she left this here
for us,

516
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,376
like, like a guide or something,
you know?

517
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,209
Make it stop.
Lori...

518
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:29,910
Lori...
Make it stop!

519
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:32,910
BRIAN:
Graham, there's something
seriously wrong with Lori, okay?

520
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:33,943
We should go back.

521
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,476
GRAHAM:
What? No, this...

522
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:41,209
No! No!
What is it?

523
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,409
LORI:
Make it go away!

524
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:45,743
Come on!
Let's go!

525
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,343
LORI:
Graham, get back here!

526
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,142
No, Graham!

527
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:53,876
Graham!

528
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,910
Lori was not Graham's
only girlfriend.

529
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:00,309
He had lots
of girlfriends,

530
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:03,610
but he somehow
managed to keep them
secret from each other.

531
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:05,242
So what would happen

532
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,810
if a very jealous Lori
found out?

533
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:07,810
I don't know.

534
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:08,977
That's more your territory.

535
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:10,077
What?

536
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,010
What? What, am I cheating?

537
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:15,276
I just meant that you use
psychology.

538
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:17,409
You're very touchy.

539
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,643
Perhaps because of all
your skulking around.

540
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,743
I am discreet,

541
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,576
okay? It's different.

542
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:25,297
A gentleman is discreet,
okay?

543
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:26,265
What are we talking about?

544
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,265
Nothing that
concerns you.

545
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,697
But I'm quite literally

546
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,064
in the middle
of the conversation

547
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,497
and it seems very interesting.

548
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:32,931
However, your glaring
indicates that I shouldn't

549
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:34,197
press for further information.

550
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:37,197
Mm-hmm. Good genius, yeah.

551
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:38,764
So, Lori loves Graham.

552
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:44,298
He thinks he loves her,
but finds out that he doesn't,

553
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:45,764
That's a perfect
cover, right?

554
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:47,978
"Headless witch
did it, not me."

555
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,411
The whole insanity thing
might be an act.

556
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:53,279
But the victim sustained
extensive defensive wounds.

557
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:54,745
This was a very powerful
attacker.

558
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:56,611
Oh, you know,
when a woman finds out

559
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:59,378
that a man has been cheating on
her, she can get pretty mad.

560
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,645
That's what I heard.
Okay, look,

561
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,245
we got motive and opportunity--
it fits.

562
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,245
No, it doesn't fit.

563
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:06,912
Graham Hastings was

564
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:08,784
five-ten and 176 pounds.

565
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,152
Lori is 120, tops.
The injuries aren't

566
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,785
consistent with a woman Lori
Mueller's size.

567
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:15,219
Of course,
people on PCP

568
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:17,386
have been known to exhibit
extraordinary strength.

569
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,029
PCP? Who
was on PCP?

570
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,896
Hodgins' report on the organic
matter from the baggie

571
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,397
found at the scene
showed that it

572
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:25,196
contained psilocybe mushrooms
injected

573
00:22:25,263 --> 00:22:26,662
with phencyclidine.

574
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,963
Whoa, what a trip.

575
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,829
Well, if Lori ingested those
it's possible

576
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,696
she could've caused
Graham's injuries.

577
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:35,463
Not to mention, combining
dissociative anesthetics

578
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,996
with hallucinogenic
compounds

579
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:38,629
can have a devastating
effect on people

580
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:39,763
with fragile brain chemistry.

581
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,030
So her mental condition
is probably genuine.

582
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:44,263
You know what, I'm going to go
talk to my good old buddy Brian,

583
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,130
see if he knows anything about
the magical mystery tour

584
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:48,130
that Lori might've been on
that night.

585
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,096
Hey, Brian.

586
00:22:57,989 --> 00:22:58,696
Hey, Agent Booth.

587
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:01,230
Um, this is Nate Gibbons,
my film teacher.

588
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,330
This is Agent Booth,
I told you about.

589
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,497
Hello.

590
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,130
Hi.

591
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:09,030
You're here
about Graham Hastings.
Yeah.

592
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,163
Was he one of your students?

593
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:12,896
Yes.

594
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,408
He was an incredibly gifted kid.

595
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:19,241
What happened out there

596
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:20,734
was horrible.

597
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:21,969
Mm.

598
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,302
What are you
doing here again?

599
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,135
You want to find out what
happened to Graham, don't you?

600
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:26,868
Of course.

601
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,501
Yeah.

602
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,565
So what were we watching?

603
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:30,700
That's pretty cool.

604
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:31,900
Nothing, really.

605
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,666
It's this film I'm
doing for my degree.

606
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,233
Brian's being modest.

607
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,833
He wrote and directed
an amazing modern take on

608
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,666
the Gilgamesh story.

609
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:41,666
Nate produced it.

610
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:43,800
I got it accepted
into Sundance.

611
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,066
Oh, congratulations.

612
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,666
If you don't mind,
I'd like

613
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,032
to talk to Brian alone.

614
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,967
Sure.

615
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,032
We'll finish up later.

616
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,999
All right.

617
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,333
Call me if you need anything.

618
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,800
Mm-hmm.

619
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:12,900
Brian, listen, we have evidence
suggesting that, um,

620
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,399
Lori was taking drugs
that night in the woods.

621
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:18,199
No. Those woods are too thick.

622
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,466
We knew that we had to keep
our heads on straight.

623
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,666
So as far
as you know,

624
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,833
Lori Mueller wasn't
under the influence

625
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,066
of any hallucinogens.

626
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:27,500
No.
When she was with
Graham, was she violent?

627
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,867
No way.

628
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:30,233
Did you know that Graham
was cheating on her?

629
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,500
Man, that was
none of my business.

630
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,166
Sure, Graham was a hound
and everyone knew it.

631
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,700
Maybe Lori found out,
got angry with Graham.

632
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,566
No, okay?

633
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,333
There's no way,
it wasn't her, okay?

634
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,466
Whacked out or not,
it wasn't her.

635
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:50,633
There was something else
out there that night.

636
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:56,533
LORI:
Where are we going?
I can't see.

637
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,933
BRIAN:
Don't worry, just stay close.

638
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,700
What is that?

639
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:09,733
You're supposed to be

640
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,666
looking for eastern hemlock.

641
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,399
It's much more effective
with your eyes open.

642
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,533
I just know what's going
to happen here, okay?

643
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,999
This is where they freak out
because they hear the witch.

644
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:23,967
Wait. There.

645
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,500
Did you see that?

646
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,433
Yeah. But where are they?
Go, go forward.

647
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:31,266
Stop.

648
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,433
Dense crown, fine branches,

649
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,933
scaly bark and wide ridges.

650
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,666
Those are eastern hemlocks.

651
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:37,800
Love your eyes.

652
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:40,099
Now we need a landmark.

653
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:43,233
You have to be quiet, okay?
There's something out here.

654
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,333
No!

655
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:47,666
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

656
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,533
(yells)

657
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:54,867
2:37 a.m.

658
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,666
So?
We have a date,

659
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:57,999
plus an exact time.

660
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,099
I can estimate
the position of the moon

661
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,867
from shadowing patterns
on the forest floor.

662
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,299
We should be able to get
the approximate

663
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,099
latitude and longitude.

664
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,299
BRIAN:
Graham, leave the camera!

665
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,800
GRAHAM:
What?! What about Lori?!

666
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:13,299
Let's just work out
the coordinates.

667
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:14,566
Yeah.

668
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:22,466
EDISON:
The axe was found
buried over there.

669
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,633
BRENNAN:
Dried blood on the trunk.

670
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,233
Whoa.

671
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,233
Make that a lot of dried
blood on the trunk.

672
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,199
Someone should
do a scraping here.

673
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:36,800
Where'd you find
the skull?

674
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,733
Buried just behind those bushes.

675
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,199
But there's something else.

676
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,366
BOOTH:
Second skull.

677
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,099
EDISON:
I'm afraid so.

678
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,766
Are there any other outstanding
cases in the area?

679
00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:59,341
1

680
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,370
Based on bony architecture,
this skull's consistent

681
00:27:11,437 --> 00:27:13,002
with that of Graham Hastings.

682
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:15,136
I'll confirm with the blood
from the axe.

683
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:15,802
And the other skull?
Female.

684
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:16,980
Mid-30s at the
time of death,

685
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,446
which was between
the mid-18th

686
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,779
and mid-19th centuries.

687
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,592
This axe handle is birch.

688
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:23,732
<i>Betula uber.</i>

689
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:26,433
Same extinct species as the wood
fragments we found in the bone.

690
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,400
Almost done
with her face.

691
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,201
BRENNAN:
Why are you spending time
on that?

692
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,800
It won't help the case.

693
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,834
Come on, let the kids
have some fun, Mom.

694
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,301
Both skulls have
depressed fractures

695
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:38,100
on the parietal bones.
They could've been

696
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,667
killed with a blow to the head
before they were decapitated.

697
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:42,800
In Graham's case, yes,

698
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,867
but on the female skull...

699
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:49,301
there's evidence of new growth,
what looks like...

700
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:52,667
this person underwent
trepanation.

701
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,134
An antiquated form
of brain surgery.

702
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,134
Practiced in the 1700s

703
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,567
on those suspected of
witchcraft.

704
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,465
Do you think that skull
is your Maggie Cinders?

705
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,500
Of course not.

706
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:06,213
I mean, there's no way
to know, right?

707
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:07,180
I'm just saying.

708
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:09,680
It's interesting.

709
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,546
Hey, Bones, you know those
papers that Hodgins found

710
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,379
in Graham Hastings' backpack?

711
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,580
His hallucinogenic
ramblings?

712
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:21,746
Mm-hmm, you got it.

713
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,314
They were written on
the back of pages

714
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:25,947
from his screenplay.

715
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,880
I don't see the significance.

716
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:31,413
Graham was a film student,
of course he wrote screenplays.

717
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:35,732
Yeah, but this was a modern-day
take on the Gilgamesh story.

718
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:38,247
The same story
that Brian Andrews

719
00:28:38,314 --> 00:28:40,479
is using for his film.

720
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,947
He stole Graham's screenplay.

721
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:47,613
Look familiar?

722
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,080
Where... where'd you find these?

723
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:52,947
Graham Hasting's backpack,
near his murdered body.

724
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:54,113
Care to explain why

725
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,280
a movie that's about
to make it to Sundance

726
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:58,813
sounds a lot like the screenplay
that your dead buddy wrote?

727
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,241
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

728
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,613
Oh, really?
Because what I think

729
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,214
is that you killed him.

730
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,613
No.
I think that you're

731
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,080
the one who drugged Lori, so she
wouldn't know what the hell

732
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,613
was going on
that night.
No, I didn't.

733
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,847
Look, I know that this may
look similar, but this is mine.

734
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:16,013
Really? Because you know
we found an E-mail

735
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,479
on Graham's computer,

736
00:29:17,546 --> 00:29:18,987
sending you a complete
first version draft

737
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:20,070
to you.

738
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,813
He wanted you to read it,
get your thoughts.

739
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,147
So...

740
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:25,247
what'd you think?

741
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:27,147
I thought...

742
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:29,880
I thought that it was better

743
00:29:29,947 --> 00:29:31,180
than anything
I could ever write.

744
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,280
So, yeah, you know,
after Graham was missing

745
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,580
a few months,

746
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:36,847
Nate thought it would be safe
to pass off as our own,

747
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:38,646
but I didn't kill Graham.

748
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:41,580
Anything else you forget
to mention, Brian?

749
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,047
Oh, come on, Brian.

750
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:45,947
You love the movies, right?

751
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:49,479
So, this is the time where
the innocent guy comes clean

752
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:52,047
or the guilty guy
asks for a lawyer.

753
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,680
Okay, so which movie is this
going to be?

754
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:03,947
That night...

755
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:05,780
Lori, when...

756
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,980
when I found her,
she was covered in blood.

757
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:10,346
It wasn't hers.

758
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:11,546
I was afraid.

759
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:12,980
You think she killed Graham.

760
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:14,546
It wasn't her
fault, though.

761
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,379
She was nuts, okay?

762
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,233
She said that the blood
just rained down on her.

763
00:30:18,857 --> 00:30:20,493
I wanted to protect her.

764
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:23,047
So you got rid of
the bloody clothing.

765
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,113
I hid them in the woods.

766
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,413
They're still out there.

767
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,446
Okay, great.
You can take us there.

768
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:33,513
No! Look,

769
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,613
I'll tell you
what I remember,

770
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,479
but I'm never
going out there again.

771
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,947
You can lock me up
for the rest of my life.

772
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm never going back out there.

773
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:47,680
The kid said
he hid her clothes

774
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,613
in a hollow log
near a stream.

775
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,488
Thanks.
Angela looked at
the video again.

776
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:55,047
Tell the forensic team
to fan out across the area

777
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:57,047
south-southwest
of the cabin ruins.

778
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:58,379
Did you hear that, Lou?

779
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,479
Yeah, south-southwest.

780
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,013
Yeah, I know it gets cold
when the sun goes down, Lou.

781
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,413
Well, you should've
brought your blankie.

782
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,913
All right, just call me when
you find her clothes.

783
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Man.

784
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,780
What?

785
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:12,838
He was being a baby.

786
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,413
I didn't say anything.
But you're
looking at me

787
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:17,247
like I'm in trouble
and you're a teacher.

788
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,488
You're very touchy
lately, Booth.
Look, Bones,

789
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:23,432
I don't know why I
didn't tell you about Cam.

790
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,482
Did I mention Cam?

791
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,479
I just didn't want it
to get weird, I guess.
Weird?

792
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,580
We're partners, you know?

793
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:33,047
Together all
the time, right?

794
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:36,013
You're a woman
and I'm a man.

795
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,646
I never had a relationship

796
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:40,181
like this where
we were...

797
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:43,583
like two guys, except
you're not, you know,

798
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:46,113
a guy. Yeah.

799
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,580
No. No, I'm not.

800
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:52,289
Should I feel odd about...

801
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,579
wanting to hang out with Will?

802
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,713
No, of course not.

803
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,580
You know,
because essentially,

804
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,813
I mean, you're a guy like me.

805
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,413
But not really.

806
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,847
That would mean that, to me,

807
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,813
you are essentially a woman.

808
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,913
Yeah, I can see that.

809
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,813
No, no, no, I'd prefer
not to be a woman,

810
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,279
if you don't mind.
I'm merely trying

811
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,246
to follow
your reasoning, Booth.
(cell phone rings)

812
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:15,580
Okay, fine.
What do you say we just,

813
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:16,508
you know,
we'll drop it for now.

814
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,413
Yeah, it's Booth.

815
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,647
They found the clothes.

816
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:21,713
That was fast.
Well, good work, Lou.

817
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,380
All right, now you can come home
before all the monsters get you.

818
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,980
I...

819
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:28,446
Hung up on me.

820
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,780
I thought it was funny.

821
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:35,480
The blood from the axe
was from Graham Hastings.

822
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,279
Okay, well, is the blood

823
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,613
on Lori Mueller's
clothes a match?

824
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,813
No.

825
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,813
Then there's another
victim out there?

826
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,980
Yes, and she's probably
named Bessie.

827
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,047
Bessie?

828
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:46,813
It's cow's blood.

829
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
The hormones
and antibiotics

830
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,014
confirm that it's
from a butcher shop.

831
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,446
Dr. Brennan.
The witch's skull

832
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,499
was cut with a stryker saw.

833
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,533
Wait. Don't you use those
in your autopsies?

834
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,533
They're also used
in teaching institutions.

835
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,234
I found a faded serial number
behind the occipital condyle.

836
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:03,167
It's from the university.

837
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:06,280
So the skull was stolen
from the medical school.

838
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,433
Someone set up one hell
of a horror show

839
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:12,044
1

840
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:16,834
I'll help in any way I can,

841
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,901
but I do have a class
starting in 45 minutes.

842
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:21,240
Yeah, well, you know,
it's film class.

843
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:23,064
You know what? Have
them watch <i>Wedding Crashers.</i>

844
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,731
I can assure you, Agent Booth,
that film class is a lot more

845
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:26,731
than watching movies.

846
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,831
Were you aware

847
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:29,664
that the medical school
at the university

848
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:31,564
has an anatomical
specimen collection?

849
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:35,930
I don't even know
what that means.

850
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,364
This is about Graham, right?

851
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:38,831
BRENNAN:
The research collection

852
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:42,197
can only be accessed by a
faculty member with a key card.

853
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:43,759
BOOTH:
Yours was recorded
entering the building

854
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,831
last November 7--

855
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:49,231
three days before Graham
Hastings disappeared.

856
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:51,064
You often go into
a medical school

857
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,030
at 2:43 in the morning?

858
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,731
I reported my key card
missing last November.

859
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:55,731
I'm sure you'll find

860
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,030
a record
of that.
Yeah.

861
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,131
It's convenient.

862
00:33:58,197 --> 00:33:59,564
Very convenient.

863
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:01,865
Are you accusing me
of something?

864
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,564
Someone
stole a skull.

865
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,464
Planted it in the woods

866
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:07,064
along with
animal bones

867
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,831
blood, weird amulets.

868
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,297
Tricking people into believing

869
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,331
that Graham
was murdered by a ghost.

870
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,331
Okay, but why?

871
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,431
Why would I possibly want
to do something like that?

872
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:20,097
Ride his coattails, you know.
Escape the faculty ghetto.

873
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:21,598
He shut you out.

874
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:24,164
And maybe you were feeling
just a little... bitter

875
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,831
about that, huh, teach?

876
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:34,264
I'm entitled
to an attorney, aren't I?

877
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,197
BOOTH:
 <i>Okay, maybe it was Graham</i>

878
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:38,997
who stole the skull himself.

879
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:40,398
Are you suggesting it was

880
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,798
some convoluted
suicide scheme?

881
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:44,264
He chopped off
his own head?

882
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,798
No. Right? Look,
I'm just saying,

883
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,498
things, they got
out of hand, right?

884
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:49,964
He wanted to make it look
like a documentary, right?

885
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,865
As scary as possible. So, he
sets everything up, right?

886
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,930
He gets Nate to help
him out that night,

887
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,331
but Nate sees
an opportunity.

888
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:59,297
No one knows
he's out there

889
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:00,964
and before you know,
it's chop-chop,

890
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,231
and I'm going
to Hollywood.

891
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:05,631
I found someone else
in the woods.

892
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:07,831
At least, I think
it's a person.

893
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,131
Have you finished
with the particulates

894
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:10,364
from the axe handle?

895
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:11,897
I've determined that the
assailant was wearing

896
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:14,831
rough-hewn leather gloves,
but I still have to check...

897
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,164
Then why
are you in here?

898
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,297
Because
I want him here.

899
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:18,331
Okay.

900
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,297
Look, I ran it through

901
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:22,131
a mass-recognition program.

902
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:23,264
That's Graham.

903
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,264
And <i>that</i> is our mystery guest.

904
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,531
It's not Brian?

905
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:28,590
No.

906
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:30,164
Different height and weight.

907
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:32,331
This person is about six-one.

908
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:35,131
As you can see,
that includes a head.

909
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,831
So, it's definitely not Maggie.

910
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,164
BOOTH:
Nate Gibbons

911
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:41,598
is about six-one.

912
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:42,765
BRENNAN:
I'll ask Will

913
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:44,331
if he can tell us anything about

914
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:45,331
Graham and
his teacher.

915
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:46,364
Maybe he threatened him.

916
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:54,164
His professor?

917
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:55,964
Did Graham tell
you anything about

918
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,997
his relationship
with him?

919
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,264
Yeah, he said
the guy wanted

920
00:35:58,331 --> 00:35:59,364
to help produce his film,

921
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:01,598
but Graham said he wanted
to do it on his own.

922
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,364
His professor <i>is</i>
producing his film.

923
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:06,798
Brian stole Graham's
screenplay.

924
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:08,964
He and the professor
are making it.

925
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,997
The teacher killed
Graham for a script?

926
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:12,564
Make his career.

927
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,030
Brian's, too.

928
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:16,331
I've seen people
murdered for a lot less.

929
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:18,297
It's not certain yet.

930
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:20,698
We're just looking
for evidence that...

931
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:23,664
links one or two of them
to the remains.

932
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:29,531
With all this going on,

933
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:31,598
when I'm with you...

934
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,064
I feel like

935
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:35,930
everything's gonna be okay.

936
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,731
I'd like to see the world
the way you do.

937
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:44,930
Then you'd be looking

938
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:48,030
at a very beautiful woman.

939
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:12,964
Preliminary tests show
only one type of DNA on the axe,

940
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,030
but now the follow-up tests

941
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:15,251
are showing two.

942
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:16,765
Something wrong with our

943
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:17,628
electrophoresis
machine?

944
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:19,364
No, I double-checked it.

945
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:21,364
So this means you got
the killer's DNA.

946
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,564
Right. Attacker
must have been cut

947
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:25,231
by Graham during the struggle.

948
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,964
I'm trying to separate out the
two types of DNA, but it's hard.

949
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,897
That's easy. I'll just
get a warrant

950
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,765
for a blood sample
for Nate Gibbons.

951
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:32,865
HODGINS:
The glove fragments

952
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,131
on the handle were coated

953
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:35,831
with diammonium
phosphate

954
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:37,264
and a guar gum-derivative
thickener.

955
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:39,431
You speak English?

956
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:40,831
It's a flame-retardant.

957
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:44,431
Exactly. Isn't that only used
by professional firefighters?

958
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:48,831
Wait, Graham's brother.
He's a firefighter.

959
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:50,997
MONTENEGRO: He's also about
six-foot-one, right?

960
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,930
And, he has a head.

961
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:54,431
That explains why

962
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:56,731
it looks like there was
only one blood source.

963
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:58,431
Siblings share so many
of the same chromosomes.

964
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:01,264
Will Hastings
killed his brother.

965
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:04,097
That certainly
explains my result.

966
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:08,231
Brennan.
Wait, she's with him now.

967
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,431
...that's your
opinion.

968
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,431
I don't think you're
the one that should
be telling me...

969
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,197
Booth.

970
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,765
What are you doing here?

971
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,398
I'm sorry.

972
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,131
You're under arrest
for the murder

973
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:35,964
of your brother,
Graham Hastings.
What?

974
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,197
You have the right
to remain silent.

975
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:38,331
What is this, Booth?

976
00:38:38,398 --> 00:38:39,464
He did it.

977
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:41,364
Cam found his blood

978
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,398
on the axe, and Hodgins
found chemicals that

979
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:46,164
only a firefighter
would have access to.

980
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:47,231
I didn't kill Graham.

981
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:50,564
We fought, that's all.

982
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:54,531
You were out there
in the woods that night?

983
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,064
Please don't look at me
like that. Please.

984
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:57,331
I was just helping
my brother.

985
00:38:57,398 --> 00:39:00,231
He said the film
was going to make him famous.

986
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,064
BOOTH:
So you got the animal bones

987
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,564
the blood, and you made
the chopping sound with the axe.

988
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:08,097
He wanted me
to stay out of sight.

989
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:09,964
But the girl, Lori,

990
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,531
he slipped her drugs

991
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:13,531
and she was screaming,

992
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:15,498
and I said I wasn't
going to help anymore.

993
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,231
And I said I
wouldn't throw

994
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:18,664
the blood on her, so <i>he</i> did it,

995
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,431
and she went crazy.
You saw her.

996
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,664
Graham did that to her.

997
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:22,987
Will.

998
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:25,097
I had to stop him, okay?

999
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:26,664
I can't be
responsible

1000
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,231
for raising a monster like that.

1001
00:39:28,297 --> 00:39:30,030
So you hit him with the axe.

1002
00:39:30,097 --> 00:39:31,831
He was just
lying there, and I was

1003
00:39:31,897 --> 00:39:33,765
waiting for
him to move.

1004
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:36,531
And I've never... I never
even hit him before, no matter

1005
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:38,498
how difficult he got.
And then you
chopped off

1006
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:39,698
his head and you buried him

1007
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,498
to make it look
like some witch did it.

1008
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:44,498
No. She did it.

1009
00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:46,164
She did it.

1010
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:47,264
Maggie Cinders was

1011
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,097
out there that
night and she

1012
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:51,207
made me do it.

1013
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,997
She told me never
to tell anybody.

1014
00:39:56,064 --> 00:40:00,064
Maggie Cinders made me
cut off his head.

1015
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,798
That's the only
way it could happen.

1016
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:04,664
You know me.

1017
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:05,831
He was my brother.

1018
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:08,097
I could never kill

1019
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:09,964
my own brother.

1020
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,097
It was her.

1021
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,131
What are you waiting for, Booth?

1022
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:25,831
You have the right
to remain silent...

1023
00:40:25,897 --> 00:40:26,997
No!
Understand me?

1024
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:30,431
Anything you say...

1025
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:32,765
Wait. Wait, please.

1026
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,598
...will be used against you
in a court of law.

1027
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:36,738
Please, don't go.

1028
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,331
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

1029
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:43,598
MONTENEGRO:
 <i>The FBI</i>

1030
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:45,297
needs me to finish
cataloguing

1031
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:46,631
the restored footage.

1032
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:47,698
It's cool.

1033
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,598
I don't have anywhere
else to go.

1034
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:53,264
You've been great
today, Hodgins.

1035
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:54,531
No, no.

1036
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:57,197
I haven't seen
that piece.

1037
00:40:57,264 --> 00:41:01,264
Yeah, I was working
on it before.

1038
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:03,464
It just finished rendering.

1039
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,431
Uh, could, could
be a reflection.

1040
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:20,398
Had to be.

1041
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:21,598
Or some moonlight.

1042
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,698
Yeah.

1043
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:24,997
Uh, moonlight
sounds right.

1044
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,631
Can I stay

1045
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:30,297
at your place tonight?

1046
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,297
Sure.

1047
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,531
No problem.

1048
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,297
I sure know how to pick 'em,

1049
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:52,297
Don't I?

1050
00:41:53,364 --> 00:41:55,287
Well, you know.

1051
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,964
Our perceptions are always
colored by what we hope

1052
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,030
and what we fear, what we love.

1053
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,731
We do the best we can.

1054
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,731
I'm afraid my best
isn't good enough.

1055
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:14,431
I can read bones, not people.

1056
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:17,731
I don't know.

1057
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:19,765
You had no trouble
seeing through me.

1058
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:29,398
It's a good thing

1059
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,531
I like being alone.

1060
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,264
You know what?
Bones, you're not alone.

1061
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:34,398
Okay? Come on.

1062
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,798
Booth.

1063
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:41,297
Hey, you're my partner.

1064
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:44,064
Okay? It's a guy hug.

1065
00:42:46,245 --> 00:42:47,631
Take it.

1066
00:42:50,781 --> 00:43:05,781
