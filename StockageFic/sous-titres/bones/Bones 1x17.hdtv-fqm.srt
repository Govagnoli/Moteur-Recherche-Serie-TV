1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,741
Victim was stabbed upward of 30 times.

2
00:00:01,806 --> 00:00:03,096
Every rib was marked-

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,094
vertebra sternal,
vertebra costal...

4
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:06,901
What kind of weapon?

5
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,673
Ooh, vacations in the desert.
It's like lunching at the dump.

6
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:12,897
Uh, pointed
with no cutting edge,

7
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:16,412
like a giant ice pick.

8
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:17,703
Whoa, Angela.

9
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:20,185
Or a sharpened screwdriver.

10
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,959
We warned her about the sun,
right?

11
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:23,539
We told her cover up,
avoid melanoma.

12
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:25,377
Who's the guy?

13
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,538
Her boyfriend,

14
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:27,535
Kirk.

15
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:28,730
Angela has a boyfriend?

16
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,215
Every year for three weeks,

17
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,792
Angela has a boyfriend
and a vacation.

18
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:36,083
Whoa, whoa, playing house
in a post-boho,

19
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:37,857
rustic artist cabin
in the desert

20
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,404
with her overpaid,

21
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:40,983
pseudo-celebrity photographer
boyfriend,

22
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:42,500
that is not a vacation.

23
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,949
Eight months to a year dead,
correct?

24
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,176
Yeah, yeah, pupal
casings, maggots,

25
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,981
blah, blah, blah,
eight months to a year.

26
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:50,368
Angela, we're betting.

27
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:52,432
Are you using Crisco

28
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:53,752
or butter for sunscreen?

29
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,301
Hey, Brennan,

30
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:56,785
could I talk to you
in private, please?

31
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:03,265
You're going to think I'm crazy.

32
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,878
What's up, boyfriend trouble?

33
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,490
No, I-I-I'd just send it to you,
but the sheriff won't let me.

34
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:09,780
Send what?

35
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:12,520
Somebody left a human skull
in a box

36
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,327
on the sheriff's porch.

37
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,389
He says it was probably a Navajo
who respects the dead,

38
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:19,261
but doesn't want to get
pulled into the whole

39
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,518
white justice system.

40
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,871
The thing is, is that Kirk

41
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:24,774
went out into the desert
five days ago

42
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,612
on a photo shoot,
and he hasn't come back.

43
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:28,708
Nobody can find him
or his guide.

44
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,514
You think the skull is Kirk's?

45
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:31,706
No. No.

46
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,287
Kirk's always going out
into the desert

47
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:35,996
for days at a time.

48
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,671
You're really sending me
mixed messages, Ange.

49
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:40,898
Yeah, well, I'm freaking out,
I guess.

50
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,316
I'm sorry.
Look, you know, I'm sorry.

51
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,800
I shouldn't have called.

52
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,347
Pretend I didn't call.
I'll just...

53
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:46,830
I'll talk to you
when Kirk gets back.

54
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,442
Sorry.

55
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,698
You're taking a vacation
in the desert with no notice?

56
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:55,859
I don't get the attraction,
I really don't.

57
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:57,439
Snakes,
scorpions...

58
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,729
It should only be for a few
days. Buzzards and snakes.

59
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:01,308
What about
the stabbing victim?

60
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:02,533
Zack identified
the weapon and the victim.

61
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,115
Our job is done.

62
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,014
<i>I mean, it's not</i>

63
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:15,691
like I actually think that
the skull is Kirk's.

64
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,044
But I mean,
if you could

65
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,333
just look at it

66
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:20,560
and just tell
me it isn't,

67
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,172
then I could stop worrying about
him being dead

68
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,752
and just be mad at him
for being a flaky artist.

69
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,685
You won't get
anything out here.

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,072
We're about 100 miles past

71
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:32,652
where Jesus lost
his sandals.

72
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,747
I assume that's a way of saying
"we're extremely isolated. "

73
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:37,424
Yeah, it's why
we come out here

74
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,295
every year.
It's like you stand

75
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,422
still and the whole universe
just comes at you.

76
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,357
At 110 degrees.

77
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,421
You know, Kirk was out
with a good guide,

78
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,905
our friend Dani.

79
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,775
I mean, he said he'd be back,

80
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:52,644
he said we'd go out
for nachos and beer.

81
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:55,999
And this is a man who's serious
about his beer.

82
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,114
I got the Navajo police
looking between

83
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,950
Doña Ona Canyon
and the Otero Bluffs.

84
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,799
Ben, Dr. Brennan is
a forensic anthropologist

85
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,193
with the Jeffersonian
Institution.

86
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:07,680
I spend
most of my time

87
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,422
helping the FBI conduct
murder investigations.

88
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,290
Angie, I kind of
got my hands full

89
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,253
getting searchers out
to look for Dani and Kirk.

90
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,785
The state police said that
they would lend us a chopper,

91
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,623
but only if we narrowed
down the search area.

92
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:20,980
They got to be
running low on water.

93
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,036
I don't give them more
than a couple of days.

94
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,488
Ben, if you could just
show Dr. Brennan the skull.

95
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,039
Or point me toward
the morgue.

96
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,768
Welcome to
the Merville County morgue.

97
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,378
Prominent brow ridge indicates
the victim is male.

98
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,675
You mind?

99
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,417
Be my guest.

100
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,602
Oh, no, she wants the plate,
Ben, not the muffin.

101
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:10,182
Cranial shape and nasal features
suggest Caucasian.

102
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,113
Died in the last several days.

103
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,299
Critters been at it pretty good.

104
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,294
Pattern of basilar
suture fusion puts age

105
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,684
30 to 35.

106
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:19,205
Well, it doesn't look like Kirk.

107
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,472
Doesn't look like anyone, Angie.

108
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:27,723
Putrascine.

109
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:29,813
Early stages of decomp.

110
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,060
Cause of death?

111
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,612
A man gets caught
unawares

112
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,701
out in the desert, he could be
dead in a few hours.

113
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,697
Uh-oh.
What?

114
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,850
Base of the skull here

115
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,781
detached from the spinal cord.

116
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:45,644
See these little bevel marks?
Perimortem   gunshot.

117
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,936
It wasn't the desert who caught
this man unawares.

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,267
It was someone with a gun.

119
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,353
<i>You can't say that it's Kirk.</i>

120
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,041
I know.

121
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:36,188
You want some tea?

122
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,446
I'd rather have a beer.

123
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,718
This woman modeling
in these pictures,

124
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,340
is this Dani?

125
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,534
Yeah.
Dani Weber.

126
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:56,474
It's Kirk's guide in the desert.

127
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:58,764
She's beautiful.

128
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:00,193
Dani has lived her whole life.

129
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,625
You know, Ben says

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,772
that she knows the desert
better than anybody.

131
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:06,712
Look, there's no way
that she gets lost

132
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,302
or she runs out of water.
There's just no way.

133
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:10,782
No.

134
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,817
What?

135
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,884
Brennan, if you hug me
and you be all caring

136
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,759
it's because you
think Kirk is dead.

137
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,890
Or because he was
sleeping with Dani.

138
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:21,814
No, it's because...

139
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,739
I'm sorry that
my friend is upset

140
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,966
because someone
she loves is missing.

141
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,523
 

142
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,114
All right.

143
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:32,021
I can buy that.

144
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:38,093
You know,
if you don't mind,

145
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:40,828
I'm just going to head to bed.

146
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,609
Good night.

147
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:45,820
 

148
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:48,682
Booth.

149
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,399
How far are you from Dulles?

150
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,243
As far as your office is
from Dulles.

151
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:53,387
Why are you in my office?

152
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:54,818
I need your findings

153
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,313
on the Richmond case.
Listen, Zack,

154
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:57,870
he won't tell me where they are
unless you give him

155
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:00,446
permission.
There's a 9:15 flight to Denver.

156
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,322
Then there's an 11:35 flight
to Santa Fe.

157
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,848
You'll have to run to make
the connection.

158
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,202
Forget it.

159
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:07,855
Booth, please.

160
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,621
Angela's boyfriend is missing.

161
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:12,178
Maybe dead.

162
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,436
It took all of my charm...

163
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,994
just to get the sheriff
Your charm, oh boy!

164
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,378
to let me look at the skull.

165
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,636
When I asked him to let me send
the skull to the Jeffersonian,

166
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,290
he told me I am not a cop

167
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,720
and that I don't have
any jurisdiction.

168
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,406
Which is true.

169
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,218
Okay, what, look...
what do you want me to do?

170
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,506
I want you to get federal
on his ass.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,258
 

172
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,995
Hey. There you go.
Hey.

173
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,553
You know, people
in the desert

174
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,141
don't have
actual addresses.

175
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:51,540
What's up with that?

176
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,035
Booth, you made it.
Yeah.

177
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,325
You know, I'm touring the
hottest places in the universe.

178
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,756
Next stop-- here you go--

179
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,505
hell.

180
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,062
I'm not really awake yet.

181
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,812
Last night

182
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:04,514
before I left,
I used my FBI powers

183
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,295
to force the sheriff
to send the skull

184
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,661
back to the Jeffersonian.

185
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,092
I talked to him this morning.

186
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,586
Ooh, seems a little resentful.

187
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:11,890
What time is it?

188
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,384
Let's go.
Drink that on the way.

189
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,943
Wha-- on the way where?
You know, to go

190
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,154
check out the model,
guide, whatever's

191
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,331
place.
Dani.

192
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,698
Can I come with you?

193
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:21,907
No, no, we can ask
tougher questions

194
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,051
if you're not there.

195
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,418
Wait outside

196
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,389
while I get dressed.
- No.

197
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,297
Uh-uh. Sun's been up
for an hour out there.

198
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:29,728
It's already the surface
of Mercury.

199
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,112
I can stand here
and close my eyes,

200
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,338
eat my doughnuts,
best I can do.

201
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,768
What tougher questions
can we ask

202
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:46,325
without Angela being here?

203
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,598
Things like, did her
boyfriend run off

204
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,154
with a model,
guide, whatever?

205
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,679
Angela and I
discussed this.

206
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:52,652
She said it couldn't happen.

207
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,783
Okay, no offense to
Angela, but she doesn't
really know this guy.

208
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:56,595
She's only with him, what,
three weeks out of the year.

209
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,153
No offense to you, but you're
a stodgy traditionalist

210
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,016
when it comes
to relationships, buddy.

211
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,177
Stodgy? Stodgy?

212
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,671
Okay, okay, here's the deal.
Yeah, stodgy.

213
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,229
Here's the deal, Bones.

214
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,915
We found out that the skull
isn't Kirk, we go home,

215
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:10,267
we let the locals
handle it, okay?
Yeah, of course.

216
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:11,952
 
Yeah, you say "of course,"

217
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,033
but then you get all
caught up in it.

218
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,560
And then... What?

219
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:17,580
Oh.

220
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,648
What do you want?
 
FBI.

221
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:20,632
We're looking for
Dani Weber.

222
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,936
Who are you?

223
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:23,493
Yeah, I'm the guy
holding the big gun.

224
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:25,083
Yeah, on a federal agent,

225
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,611
which I've been
very nice about so far.

226
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:28,199
Let's rush him.
He can't shoot us both.

227
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,789
How about I just show him

228
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,665
my badge, so we both
survive, all right?

229
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:33,955
See?

230
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,117
Name's Alex Joseph.

231
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,516
This is me and Dani's place.

232
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,138
Where's Dani Weber?

233
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,631
Missing...

234
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,126
in the desert for
almost a week.

235
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:43,717
I've been looking for her.

236
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,274
You point your gun
at everybody who comes by?

237
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:46,831
Maybe I'm nervous.

238
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:48,072
 
Anything in particular

239
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:49,280
you might be nervous about?

240
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,488
Maybe something
Dani got caught up in.

241
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:52,014
Nothing I can think of.

242
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:53,922
Could we look
in the trailer?

243
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,894
Not without a warrant.

244
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,198
You have a problem
with law enforcement?

245
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,501
You could say that,

246
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,645
I guess.

247
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,486
Model runs off with
handsome photographer,

248
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,043
jealous boyfriend with a gun
finds them in the desert...

249
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,141
He's definitely twitchy
about something.

250
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:13,604
What if he's escaping

251
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,162
out the back door?

252
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:17,546
You don't spend a lot of time
in trailers, do you?

253
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:24,572
Whoa.

254
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:25,526
What?

255
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,020
That's Sheriff Dawes.

256
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,579
Yeah, he definitely
has a problem

257
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,900
with law enforcement.

258
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,522
 

259
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,225
<i>( music playing,
muffled through earpieces )</i>

260
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:36,783
Dr. Brennan doesn't like
us to listen to music
while we're working.

261
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:41,743
Dr. Brennan is not here.

262
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,318
She thinks the work deserves
our full concentration.

263
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:45,781
I need the skull now.

264
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,403
Well, I'm still finding
particulates.

265
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,469
And since you're only
Dr. Brennan's assistant,

266
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,426
without her, you don't carry all
that much weight around here.

267
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,175
I'm telling Dr. Goodman.

268
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:57,577
 

269
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,029
Why didn't you mention your
relationship to Dani Weber?

270
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:03,809
 
Dani Weber dropped you
for the photographer,

271
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,972
the Indian guy, or both.

272
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,434
Moron.

273
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:08,769
Dani's my sister.

274
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,104
Half sister.

275
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,948
Mostly I raised her.

276
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,443
You can check with Angie.

277
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,778
Okay, well,
I got that one... wrong.

278
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,241
I pretty much
don't like the look

279
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:17,989
of your sister's boyfriend,

280
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,326
Alex Joseph.

281
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,309
<i> 
Assault.</i>

282
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,424
Narcotics.

283
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,172
He bootlegs
for the reservation.

284
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:25,525
Yeah, Dani could do better.
Any chance that

285
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,973
Dani got caught up in something
ugly because of him?

286
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,723
Until I find otherwise,
I'm assuming

287
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:31,376
that Dani and Kirk
are lost in the desert.

288
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,251
Alex Joseph-- is he bad enough
to hurt 'em

289
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,714
if he finds 'em out
in the desert together?

290
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,180
It's on my list of nightmares,
yeah.

291
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,738
<i> 
Brennan.</i>

292
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,440
DNA results are in.

293
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,316
The skull is definitely
Kirk Persinger.

294
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:48,672
Poor Angela.

295
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,231
<i>HODGINS  :
Also, the hair test's</i>

296
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,932
<i>off the charts for
Lophophora williamsii-
derived mescaline.</i>

297
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:54,427
What's that?

298
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,412
Peyote.

299
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,481
Anything on the cranial scoring?

300
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,705
 
I haven't really had a good
crack at the skull yet.

301
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,296
Hodgins hogged it.

302
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,393
The markings traced to
several desert dwelling

303
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,174
species-- it seems
a full-grown male coyote

304
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:06,955
did the most work on it,

305
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,894
but one with
a malformed jaw.

306
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,802
Very unusual bite
formations.

307
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:14,935
Ask Dr. Goodman to find
a naturalist.

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,048
Kirk Persinger?

309
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,306
Yes.

310
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,627
They found traces
of peyote.

311
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,121
 
Drug-related.

312
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,664
Shot to the spine,
execution-style.

313
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:26,413
So, Sheriff, do you
still think this is

314
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,812
a simple
missing persons case?

315
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:33,281
I have to tell Angela.

316
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,351
Listen, Sheriff, um,

317
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:38,781
sorry for
the concern

318
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,689
you must be feeling
for you sister.

319
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,026
I will call the FBI
office in Albuquerque,

320
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,584
and I will officially take
over the investigation.

321
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:56,746
I won't do that.
Why?

322
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,909
Desert dwellers
are very insular.

323
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:02,565
Mongolians,
Bedouins of the Sahara,

324
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:04,251
the Himba of Kalana.

325
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,807
Good hosts but extremely
distrustful of outsiders.

326
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,925
Bone, this is the
United States of America.

327
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,100
It's not outer Mongolia.

328
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,786
The only reason

329
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,551
Sheriff Dawes talks to us at all
is because we know Angela.

330
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,618
Alex Joseph held a gun on us.

331
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,621
I'll admit, I've met
friendlier people.

332
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:21,674
If a bunch of outsiders
come in from Albuquerque

333
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,408
led by an outsider from D.C.,
I promise you

334
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,220
the people here will close ranks

335
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,510
and shut up
until we go away.

336
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,450
Then they'll take care of it
in their own way.

337
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:33,088
Okay, who are
you, Dr. Phil?

338
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:35,059
Who is Dr. Phil,
some kind of expert?

339
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:36,808
He likes to think so.

340
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:38,367
Okay, look, I'll take what
you say under advisement.

341
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,337
In the meantime, we
need to go find out

342
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:42,500
who supplied Kirk
with his peyote.

343
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,853
Well, how are we going
to do that?

344
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,410
Talk to his girlfriend.

345
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:51,434
 
I am so sorry, Angela.

346
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:52,579
We both are.

347
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,900
I knew it was Kirk.

348
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,572
That's why I called you.

349
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,001
We have to find out

350
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,591
what happened to Dani.

351
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:03,231
Angela, I'm going to have
to ask you a couple

352
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:04,694
difficult
questions, okay?

353
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:07,014
What-what can you tell me

354
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,208
about Kirk's drug use?

355
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:12,132
Kirk didn't do drugs.

356
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:15,472
Well, Hodgins found
peyote in his hair.

357
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:17,475
I thought...

358
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,447
I thought
that you meant drug drugs.

359
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:21,386
The peyote
wasn't recreational.

360
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,375
Kirk took part
in some Native Indian rights.

361
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:25,741
While high on drugs?

362
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,014
 

363
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:28,985
Did you do peyote with Kirk?

364
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,861
The peyote has nothing
to do with anything.

365
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,451
Angela,

366
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:35,408
you may have come in contact
with Kirk's killer without even

367
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,061
<i>realizing it.
 </i>

368
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,192
Who was his connection?

369
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,861
 

370
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,769
He's Kirk's friend.

371
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:47,680
I need the name.

372
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,002
<i> :
Wayne.</i>

373
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,528
Wayne Kellogg.

374
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,436
He's an important local artist.

375
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,251
 

376
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,507
<i> 
I don't deny</i>

377
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,064
having participated
in the peyote ritual

378
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:11,750
on several occasions.

379
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,593
Utterly spiritual experience.

380
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,501
You're not Indian.

381
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,141
Not by birth, no,
but as you can see
from my artwork,

382
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:19,571
I have a deep
spiritual connection

383
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,130
to the Navajo.

384
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,228
You sell a lot
of your work?

385
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,422
I sell very well overseas,
enough to keep this place

386
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:27,616
and a beach house
in Los Angeles. Why?

387
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,173
Why not buy Navajo art
created by actual Navajos?

388
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,749
 
Peyote is only legal
if you're a member

389
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,356
of the Native American Church,

390
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,041
which means, you and Kirk
bought it illegally.

391
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:37,600
Buying illegal drugs
involves drug dealers.

392
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,147
I mean, you can follow my train
of thought here, can't you?

393
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,704
Look, I realize
Kirk's missing.

394
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,502
Kirk's not missing.

395
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:47,742
He's dead.

396
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:49,237
What about Dani?

397
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:52,225
Dani Weber remains
unaccounted for.

398
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,564
<i>God, this is terrible.</i>

399
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,585
I need the name
of your drug connection.

400
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,192
No.

401
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:02,718
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,721
These people trust me.

403
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:06,406
I understand the difficulty

404
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,759
in finding the peyote plants
miles out in the desert.

405
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:10,126
Secret places

406
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:13,116
passed on from generation
to generation.

407
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:14,480
Mr. Kellogg,
is that your vehicle?

408
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,039
Yes. Why?

409
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,397
 
Alex Joseph borrowed
that Humvee.

410
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,654
Wait. Alex Joseph
didn't go out

411
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,879
to the desert
to look for Dani Weber.

412
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,041
He went out
to look for peyote.

413
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,346
I never said that.

414
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,134
Mr. Joseph?

415
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,852
It's FBI again.

416
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,109
Like to ask you
a few more questions.

417
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,002
Booth?

418
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,478
Booth.

419
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,178
 
Oh, come on, Sheriff.

420
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,576
Come on, even out
here you know how the
drug world works, huh?

421
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,028
Kirk is found dead.

422
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,450
Joseph is beaten
to a pulp.

423
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,091
It's all connected.

424
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,333
My first priority
is to find Dani.

425
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:11,448
You find Kirk's murderer,
we probably find Dani.

426
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:12,742
Maybe Dani is the murderer.

427
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,204
What? I got to ask.

428
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,635
Dani never hurt anybody
in her life.

429
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,371
Except maybe herself.

430
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:21,204
 
You know,
another thing

431
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,750
I have to consider--
maybe Dani, you know,

432
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,000
calls up her, uh,
brother the sheriff

433
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:27,801
and says, you know,
"This photographer

434
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,632
"raped me.
What do I do now?"

435
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,116
What you're proven

436
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,978
right now--
you don't know anything

437
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,400
about the people
that live around here.

438
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,051
Hmm. Joseph met us
with a rifle.

439
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,376
Maybe because
he was afraid

440
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,892
it was you coming around

441
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,060
the corner
of that house.

442
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:42,670
Alex Joseph is unconscious.

443
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:44,974
You maybe can talk to him
when he wakes up.

444
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,521
Me-- I'm going

445
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:50,152
to help the search parties
find my sister.

446
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:56,434
<i> 
Thanks to Fish and Wildlife,</i>

447
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:58,865
most of the coyote packs
in this region have

448
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,413
at least one member
wearing a GPS collar.

449
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,506
<i>BOOTH  :
You can find one coyote</i>

450
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,179
with a wonky
jaw in the desert?

451
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:06,884
What we do here is process

452
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,525
information from rangers,

453
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,767
amateur naturalists,

454
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,692
conservationists,
even school groups.

455
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,155
The Desert Coyote Packs Range
is not huge.

456
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,365
Perhaps ten square miles.

457
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,165
The pack is typically

458
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:22,479
three to eight animals
led by the alpha mating pair.

459
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,184
Wow.

460
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:25,952
 
Why wow?

461
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,004
 
Professor Inez has found
your coyote,

462
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,677
but he's-he's way out
in the desert.

463
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,077
Three pups,

464
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:34,160
three females, two males--

465
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:35,706
including the leader
with the wonky jaw.

466
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:38,012
With eight coyotes
going at a cadaver.

467
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,347
Wow. You know, we're talking
needle in a haystack,

468
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,021
you know, finding the remains.

469
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,136
Mamas and the pups
feed together,

470
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,598
so I'd expect rib cage
and smaller bones

471
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,113
to be
in a concentrated area.

472
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:49,535
But the males move away
from each other

473
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:50,796
with the larger pieces.

474
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,471
No more than a half a mile.

475
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,259
Three weeks a year.

476
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:58,248
I mean, 15 weeks in total.

477
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,709
You think that's crazy.

478
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,331
Well...

479
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:05,351
it's not typical,
that's for sure.

480
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:09,202
And if he was
yours, 100% yours,

481
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:13,180
for three weeks
a year, that's...

482
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,600
It's more than I've ever had.

483
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,303
Kirk's photographs

484
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,177
show the world as a more
beautiful place than it is.

485
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,913
A-A better place.

486
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:31,110
He made me feel like
it was my real home.

487
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:32,973
That I belonged there...

488
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:35,278
with him.

489
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:40,519
He's the guy
I compare all other guys to.

490
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,065
Now he's gone, and I-I feel like

491
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:47,243
I can't even breathe, sweetie.

492
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,421
I can't even take a breath.

493
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:53,083
You think it's possible

494
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,315
that Dani's still out there?

495
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,798
Could she still be alive?

496
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,040
I don't know.

497
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,251
There's no crime scene, and...

498
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:03,469
we're not even sure where the
rest of Kirk's remains are.

499
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,616
Well, I want to help you
look for her tomorrow.

500
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:06,691
You sure?

501
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,616
Yeah. Dani was our friend.

502
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,268
I have to help find her.

503
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,193
Please?

504
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,696
Thank you.

505
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:27,810
 

506
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:30,463
I love the desert.

507
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,009
Or I used to.

508
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,850
Nothing looks the way it should.

509
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:37,155
Stuff that's far away
looks near, stuff that's near

510
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,384
looks far.

511
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:39,901
 
Yeah, well,

512
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:41,195
you can't trust your eyes
out here.

513
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:42,869
Not your eyes alone.

514
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:44,479
You know, Kirk said

515
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,026
that if you stood still
long enough,

516
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,510
that the desert would actually
speak to you.

517
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:54,581
Show you some kind of truth.

518
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:56,192
That ever happen to you?

519
00:20:56,254 --> 00:21:00,200
No, but he really believed that.

520
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,303
Alex Joseph woke up.

521
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:11,597
Good.

522
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:13,491
You think whoever beat him up

523
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,290
had something to do
with Kirk Persinger's murder.

524
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:16,743
Yeah.

525
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:17,784
Nope.

526
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:20,405
How can you be so sure?

527
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,499
You were the one
that beat him up?

528
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,488
No.
Okay.

529
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,202
Well, uh... do you
know who did?

530
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,750
These guys.

531
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,717
Or guys just like 'em.

532
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:33,694
Why?

533
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:35,083
Peyote ritual.

534
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,452
These people take it seriously.

535
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:39,505
It's their religion.

536
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,177
A guy like Alex Joseph starts

537
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,071
selling it to white guys
like Kellogg and Kirk,

538
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,713
they don't like it.

539
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:46,987
Aren't you going
to arrest any of them?
No.

540
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,534
But I might deputize a couple.

541
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:50,996
You know, Sheriff,
I get how you people

542
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,079
handle things out here,
but I got ask you--

543
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,194
I mean, if they'd
beat up an Indian

544
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:56,961
for selling peyote,
what the hell

545
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,236
are they gonna do to Kirk
for taking it?

546
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,950
Nothing. Kirk's a white man.

547
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:05,108
The way they see it,
he's my responsibility.

548
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,632
 
Hey! I got
something here!

549
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,958
Ange, they found
some bones over here.

550
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,687
It might be Kirk.

551
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,931
It is Kirk.
This is his camera.

552
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:37,084
Are you sure?

553
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:40,239
No, no, no.
Don't, don't.

554
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:42,089
There could be
exposed film in there.

555
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:46,062
It's cracked.

556
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:49,278
Can't let anymore light in,
it'll damage the film.

557
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,311
Maybe Kirk was right.

558
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,101
This could be a good way

559
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:55,588
for the desert to tell us
what happened to him.

560
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,925
Photograph of his murder.

561
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,517
This camera is going straight
to the State Police Crime Lab.

562
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,099
Angela is better
at developing film

563
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,681
than anyone in Santa Fe.

564
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,101
 
Plus I can use
Kirk's equipment.

565
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:14,263
It's top of the line.

566
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:15,684
Yeah, and we won't have

567
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:16,943
to wait
for the results, Sheriff.

568
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,687
 
With your sister maybe

569
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:20,590
still alive out in the desert,
every hour counts.

570
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:26,402
Can't do it.

571
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:28,240
Booth...

572
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,210
Yeah, you know,
according to Homeland Security,

573
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:34,115
Kellogg sold exactly $120,000
worth of art overseas.

574
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,376
What's that
got to do with anything?

575
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,118
 
Well, it sure as hell doesn't
buy him a beach house

576
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,409
in Los Angeles, now does it?

577
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:40,475
He lied.

578
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,765
Let's go check him out.

579
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:43,510
What will we be looking for?

580
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:45,252
 
You know, what we
always look for.

581
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:46,155
You know, something
that doesn't fit.

582
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,509
Something that, you know...

583
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,448
Something.

584
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,420
I can't believe that you
think that I am a suspect.

585
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:59,842
Angie, not to speak ill
of the dead, but, uh...

586
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,520
a woman like you,

587
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:03,102
you're worth
more than

588
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:04,973
three weeks a year,
you understand?

589
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,556
You think I murdered Kirk

590
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,556
because he didn't
give me enough time?

591
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:08,976
I'm just a lawman.

592
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:11,592
People are people.

593
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:14,915
Ben, Kirk wasn't the one who put
limits on our time together.

594
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:17,498
He wanted me to marry him,
and he deserved more,

595
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:19,339
and better.

596
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:22,275
Please, Ben, I want
to help find Dani.

597
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,340
And there could be
evidence on this film.

598
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:27,279
Just let me do what I do
better than anybody else.

599
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,449
Thank you.

600
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:45,193
Angie...

601
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:46,776
Maybe he deserved more,
not my place to say,

602
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:51,553
but he couldn't
have done better.

603
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:53,942
No man could.

604
00:25:00,074 --> 00:25:02,721
I haven't attained
anything like the success

605
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:04,303
Kirk has,
but I do all right-- why?

606
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:06,949
You have a beach house.

607
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:08,499
I applied for a warrant

608
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:09,695
to check for your
assets, your tax returns.

609
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,179
I told you,

610
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,729
I do well in Europe,
Germany especially appreciates

611
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:16,473
Native-themed work.

612
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:18,861
Kirk Persinger's remains were
found way out in the desert.

613
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:20,249
What's that got to do with me?

614
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:21,798
Oh, because you have a vehicle

615
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:23,056
that's capable
of going out that far.

616
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,930
A vehicle I often loan out.

617
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:27,027
What are these?

618
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,156
Engraving plates.

619
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,029
Please don't
touch them.

620
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,191
The oils on your skin

621
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:32,514
will comprise
the integrity.

622
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,031
Why would I kill Kirk?

623
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:36,936
Maybe because, you know,
you had a little thing,

624
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,067
you know, for Dani.

625
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:41,003
Or maybe because you
were jealous of Kirk's

626
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,295
artistic success.

627
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:43,877
These aren't Native designs.

628
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,137
Bones, I'm working
a line of inquiry here.

629
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:47,427
 
All of your work

630
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:49,009
is stolen from Native designs.

631
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:51,172
These are floral.
It doesn't fit.

632
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,980
Not stolen.

633
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,143
Inspired by.

634
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,497
And that piece
is commissioned.

635
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:57,886
Another way I make money.

636
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,145
Hi, Angela.

637
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,954
Well, most of the film
was wrecked,

638
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,857
but I developed
a few usable images.

639
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:05,568
That's great.

640
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:08,053
No, no, because Ben got me
to make a couple of prints

641
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:10,249
and then he bolted with them
and all the negatives.

642
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:12,476
Sheriff Dawes took off
with the negatives.

643
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:14,058
What'd she find on them?

644
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,316
Did you recognize
anything?

645
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:16,639
Dani in the desert,

646
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,416
and that's all.

647
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,706
I have no idea

648
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,320
what he got so excited about.

649
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:22,935
Nothing that meant
anything to Angela.

650
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,451
We'll go take a look
for ourselves.

651
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:26,839
Talk to you again.

652
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:30,941
I wanted to show these
photographs to Alex Joseph.

653
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,230
I don't need your permission.

654
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:33,327
Why Joseph?

655
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:34,974
Angela says
there are only

656
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,556
a few partial photos of
your sister in the desert.

657
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:37,911
That's right.

658
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,235
The only person
that knows the desert

659
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:40,849
as good as Dani is Joseph.

660
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:42,237
This formation here,

661
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,819
I'm not familiar
with it.

662
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:45,562
There's nothing like
this anywhere near

663
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,757
where we found Kirk's remains
or the camera.

664
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:50,081
Well, he was killed
somewhere else and moved.

665
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:52,954
If we find that outcropping,
maybe we find the place

666
00:26:53,018 --> 00:26:54,890
where Kirk was killed
and maybe we find my sister.

667
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:56,504
Did Joseph recognize the rock?

668
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,054
Yeah.
Where?

669
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,635
It's easier I take
you than explain.

670
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,057
Whoa, whoa, okay,
if Joseph is a murderer,

671
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:04,800
he's just sending you
on a wild-goose chase.

672
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,866
Well, then we know
he's the murderer

673
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,416
and all we've wasted is a tank
of gas in a goose chase.

674
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,998
How far out are we going?

675
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:13,515
A ways.

676
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:23,424
One week in the desert and
there's nothing but bone left.

677
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,845
 
Same guy?

678
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:25,976
Looks like it.

679
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,426
Uh, I think

680
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:29,009
it would be better

681
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:30,428
if I went over the bones
for particulates

682
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:31,430
before you start
your thing.

683
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:32,947
I disagree, and you
can't have them

684
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:34,626
unless I release them to you.

685
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:36,207
You're gonna have to do
the "boss thing," boss.

686
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:40,662
Sir, Dr. Brennan needs
to know how this man died,

687
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,759
which is my territory,
more than when

688
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:43,792
and where he died.

689
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:45,407
Dr. Hodgins?

690
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:47,150
Even I can see he got shot
in the back of the head.

691
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:48,441
What Dr. Brennan needs
is the murder scene.

692
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,537
It's the desert.

693
00:27:49,538 --> 00:27:50,636
Insects and particulates

694
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,184
aren't going
to narrow it down

695
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,832
any more than that.

696
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:55,059
We won't know that until
I look at the particulates.

697
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:01,708
Dr. Hodgins will have access
to the bones first, Mr. Addy.

698
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,582
That's the wrong decision.

699
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,423
 
My lungs are going to come
out through my throat.

700
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,688
You know, where I come from,
when you say

701
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:21,169
you're driving a ways,
you know, it means 45 minutes.

702
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,131
Out here,
it means four hours.

703
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,034
We've been driving five.

704
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:27,940
<i>I maybe should have
said quite a ways.</i>

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,116
There it is.

706
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:46,222
 
Well... that it?

707
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:47,401
Yeah,
I think so.

708
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:49,607
Different time of day.

709
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:52,297
You people look for the exact
spot the pictures were taken.

710
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,715
I'm gonna take another
circle in the truck.

711
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,226
Looking for your sister?

712
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,369
I think we want to go
south slightly.

713
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:01,062
Maybe southwest.

714
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,663
You can tell from the shadows?

715
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,143
Yeah, and the angle
on the outcropping.

716
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,007
Where's he going?

717
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:12,303
He's looking for his sister.

718
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,323
Either of you two
bring any water?

719
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,252
Why?

720
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,854
You worried?
Yeah.

721
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:23,486
About what?

722
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:27,051
Because we are way past
where Jesus lost his sandals.

723
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,532
And I don't hear
the truck anymore.

724
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,104
No cell phone service.

725
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,403
No water.

726
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:45,033
How long do you think
we'll survive out here

727
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:47,027
if the sheriff
doesn't come back?

728
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:48,417
Three days, max.

729
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:49,686
Well, how far are we
from the highway?

730
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:51,197
Five days, minimum.

731
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,163
I don't like that math.

732
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:55,790
Wait a second.

733
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,112
 
Kirk's?

734
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:01,685
It looks like it, yeah.

735
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,273
Yeah... distributor's smashed.

736
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:09,602
That's it.

737
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:11,354
All the wires
are pulled out.

738
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,501
It doesn't make sense
that the sheriff brings us

739
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,982
to the scene of the crime and
then leaves us to die, does it?

740
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:17,279
One godforsaken

741
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,759
part of the desert just as good

742
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,240
as another godforsaken
part of the desert.

743
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,023
We don't even know

744
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,954
if Sheriff Dawes actually
called Alex Joseph.

745
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:26,466
I mean,
for all we know,

746
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:27,644
he could have done
all this himself.

747
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,124
Could Dawes do that, Ange?

748
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:32,298
Well, I always thought
Ben Dawes was a good man.

749
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,230
It would take a lot
to change my mind.

750
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,982
Well, like, being
left to die in the desert?

751
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:38,736
 
These tracks here,

752
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,062
they don't match the sheriff's
vehicle, they're too wide.

753
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:42,544
Humvee maybe?

754
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:47,046
This is blood, I think.

755
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,890
The victim

756
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,370
was kneeling here.

757
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:51,398
Bones.

758
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:53,724
Sorry.

759
00:30:55,267 --> 00:31:01,068
He was dragged this way,
then the blood trail ends.

760
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:02,549
He was thrown
into the Humvee.

761
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,783
We've got to be 200 miles from
where we found Kirk's bones.

762
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:07,264
You think the murderer drove
that far to drop the body?

763
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:10,407
Where are you going?

764
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,369
Boo... Hey.

765
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,028
Yup, tracks,
they stop right here.

766
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,509
 
What here?

767
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:18,748
There's no here here.

768
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,897
Landing strip, huh?

769
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:21,468
I knew this was about drugs.

770
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,251
 

771
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,732
Mexico's about
80 miles that way.

772
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,955
Oh, yes.

773
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,632
Only Angela could get a ride
in the middle of nowhere.

774
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,543
Any signs of your sister?

775
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:44,477
She's been out
there a week.

776
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:47,139
She could still be alive if she
had a few canteens of water.

777
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,692
Humvee tracks, Sheriff.

778
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,149
Alex Joseph?

779
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:51,956
Catches Kirk and Dani
out here...

780
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:55,030
Sandy, this is Dawes,
do you receive me?

781
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:57,311
Loud and clear on the satellite,
Sheriff. Where are you?

782
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,339
Hell and gone.
Listen, Sandy, I need

783
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:00,701
a deputy down
at the clinic,

784
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:02,255
slap some cuffs on Alex Joseph.

785
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:04,346
Alex Joseph took off, Sheriff.

786
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,932
We got no idea where he went.

787
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:07,610
Kellogg's Humvee.

788
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:09,163
Sandy, go collect

789
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:10,905
Wayne Kellogg's
Humvee and we'll

790
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:11,983
see you in a few hours.

791
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:15,976
Any blood stains

792
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,307
should flare a bluish-green

793
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,669
when the luminol hits them.

794
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:24,119
Nothing.

795
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:25,990
Well, we know that Kirk's body
was put into the Humvee.

796
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:27,002
Tire treads match.

797
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:29,031
It's clean.

798
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:30,585
Give Kellogg
his truck back.

799
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:31,788
Tell him sorry

800
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:33,279
for the inconvenience.

801
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:35,115
Try the hood.

802
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:36,605
You think they tied Kirk's
bloody, dead body

803
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:38,158
to the hood like an elk

804
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:43,069
then drove him 200 miles
before dumping him for coyotes?

805
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,622
Even out here,
people might notice.

806
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,239
Right there.

807
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,329
I'll be damned.

808
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,214
Zack?

809
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,268
Yes, Dr. Brennan?

810
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,186
I need to know if Kirk's bones

811
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,713
show more damage than can be
explained by animal activity.

812
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:16,591
Preliminary analysis indicates
that the pubic rami

813
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:18,285
are fractured,
and the left hemipelvis

814
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,819
is severely displaced.

815
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:20,776
Congruent with a fall?

816
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:21,961
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

817
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,112
Were the remains found
at the base

818
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:24,200
of a cliff?

819
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:25,830
He wasn't driven 200 miles.

820
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:27,460
He was driven a
couple hundred yards.

821
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,092
Loaded his body in
the airplane...

822
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,818
<i> 
then tossed it.</i>

823
00:33:30,882 --> 00:33:32,544
Zack, I'm not happy
with how long

824
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,109
it took you to get
back to me on this.

825
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:35,741
We'll talk about it
when I get back.

826
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,595
Sorry, Dr. Brennan.

827
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:41,879
 
You could have told her
it wasn't your fault.

828
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:44,916
 

829
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:47,922
I still have some work
to do here.

830
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:54,668
If they dumped Kirk's body
from a plane,

831
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,906
then they could have done
the same to Dani.

832
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:58,472
Yeah, well, Kirk was
dead when they
tossed him, right?

833
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:01,925
Absolutely. And I saw no
evidence of a second
murder at the site.

834
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,834
Which leaves me hoping either
my sister is kidnapped

835
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:07,200
by drug dealers or dying
somewhere in the desert.

836
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:09,054
Kidnapping's a
federal offense.

837
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,133
It's an FBI matter.
I can help you,
if you want.

838
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,594
<i> 
Brennan.</i>

839
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,161
Dr. Brennan,
those cell phone photos

840
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,144
you sent me of engravings...

841
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,615
Kellogg said it was a
commissioned work.

842
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,180
I think these
are engravers' plates.

843
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:22,610
For what?
- Currency.

844
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,392
To be exact, I believe
these are dyes

845
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,270
for the Venezuelan
500 bolivar bill.

846
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,548
Dyes? Counterfeiters' dyes?

847
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,435
Yes.

848
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,472
Did you say
"counterfeiters"?

849
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,475
<i>I got a warrant here</i>

850
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
to search your client's studio
for engraving plates.

851
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:42,519
Well, as Mr. Kellogg's
attorney, I can advise you,

852
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,135
you're certain to find some.

853
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,978
I'm an engraver.

854
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,627
Larry, did you
tell Wayne about
how when someone dies

855
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:50,340
during the commission
of a felony,

856
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,764
everyone involved
in that felony

857
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,992
is charged with murder?

858
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,446
Counterfeiting is a felony.

859
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:59,776
My client will confess to

860
00:34:59,842 --> 00:35:01,523
the counterfeiting charges,
in return for

861
00:35:01,588 --> 00:35:03,236
immunity from the murder charge.

862
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,304
Not good enough.
He will also provide

863
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,567
the time and place
of the next pickup
out in the desert.

864
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,735
You'll be able to arrest
the actual murderers.

865
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,674
When Sheriff Dawes says
"not good enough,"

866
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,354
he means his sister, Larry.

867
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:17,745
My client doesn't know
anything about Dani Weber.

868
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,394
<i>What does he know?</i>

869
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:26,117
One week ago, I arranged to meet
some associates

870
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,218
at an airstrip in the desert

871
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:29,866
to pass on
some commissioned artwork.

872
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,450
He means counterfeit plates.

873
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:33,937
As the plane landed,
my associates

874
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:36,878
noticed two people
spying on them

875
00:35:36,944 --> 00:35:39,206
from a vantage point
above the airstrip.

876
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,210
They became very agitated.

877
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:43,472
They commandeered my vehicle,

878
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:44,959
and they drove
up the hill.

879
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,446
I got my Humvee,
then I drove up there.

880
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,806
But I didn't see anything.

881
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:52,391
Like blood on the hood
of your vehicle?

882
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:58,726
Well... the fact remains
that agreeing to this deal

883
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:01,700
is the only way that
you're going to catch
the actual murderers.

884
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:05,060
You know where to find me.

885
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:08,519
Wayne, I need to know if they
loaded Dani on that plane.

886
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,684
I never saw Dani.

887
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,205
 
Easy, Sheriff.

888
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,306
That's my sister. My sister!

889
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,407
I am truly sorry
about Dani, Ben.

890
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:22,610
Truly sorry. But I don't
think Wayne knows anything.

891
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,517
Come on, Dawes.

892
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:25,776
Easy.

893
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,684
Come on.

894
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:36,828
I guess we're gonna have
to take that deal, right?

895
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,128
I was trained as an Army Ranger.

896
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:43,294
That mean anything to you,
Sheriff Dawes?

897
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,301
I'd be more than happy
to go back out to
that crime scene,

898
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:48,820
see if there's anything
we haven't missed.

899
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:51,890
Appreciate it.

900
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,607
If you expect to win
arguments around here,

901
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,030
you will need
at least one doctorate.

902
00:36:58,095 --> 00:37:00,066
I am Dr. Brennan's
grad student.

903
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:01,651
I'm aware.

904
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,720
Once I get my doctorate,

905
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:05,432
she will take on
another grad student.

906
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:07,112
My job here will go
to that person.

907
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:09,600
You have a first-rate mind,
Mr. Addy.

908
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:11,894
You can't assist
Dr. Brennan forever.

909
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:19,360
I really hope
this is necessary.

910
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,172
He's comfortable here.

911
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:22,981
He's enamored
with Dr. Brennan,

912
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,920
and he's stopped working
on his thesis. It's necessary.

913
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:26,794
<i>It's just...
 </i>

914
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,215
I like the guy.

915
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:29,962
So do I.

916
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:32,934
Which is why we must think of
what's best for him.

917
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,771
It's time for Mr. Addy
to grow up.

918
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:40,697
So, you say Dani knows
the desert pretty well?

919
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:43,324
That's right.

920
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:44,819
If it were you here
stranded, which way
would you go?

921
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,615
Highway's about
a five-day walk that way.

922
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:52,181
Mexico is three days
that way, and...

923
00:37:52,242 --> 00:37:54,135
that way's two days to a ranch.

924
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:56,457
You might find some stock water,
but I wouldn't count on it.

925
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,045
And the terrain is rougher.

926
00:37:58,107 --> 00:37:59,756
So, it all depends on
how much water she had.

927
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:02,108
Is there any way
to know?

928
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,620
All right, look, we'll
take a point off this
compass, all right?

929
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:08,584
Walk out in a straight line
for 15 minutes,

930
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:10,080
we look for tracks.

931
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,401
Good?

932
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:20,771
 

933
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:52,933
 

934
00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:13,001
 

935
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:29,710
You all right?

936
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:33,008
 

937
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,071
Dani went that way.

938
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,783
Okay.

939
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,107
 

940
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:17,939
 

941
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,241
Ready to go home?

942
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,329
Yeah.

943
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:45,918
You're not coming
back again, are you?

944
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:47,023
No.

945
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:49,558
Never.

946
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:54,044
He loved me.

947
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,157
For three weeks a year.

948
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:58,464
No.

949
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,999
He loved me all the time.

950
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:03,828
I was the one who could only
manage three weeks a year.

951
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:09,972
Oh, I'm afraid that I...

952
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:12,474
I'm just afraid that I don't
have a generous heart.

953
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,099
I'm afraid

954
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:15,888
that I won't...

955
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:19,332
have the chance that I had
with Kirk ever again.

956
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,192
You will.

957
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:25,053
How can you be so sure?

958
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:30,514
Because nothing in this universe
happens just once, Angela.

959
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:32,498
Nothing.

960
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:34,903
Infinity goes
in both directions.

961
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:39,583
There is no unique event,
no singular moment.

962
00:41:39,648 --> 00:41:43,224
I don't know what that means.

963
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:45,758
It means
you will get another chance.

964
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:48,782
You promise?

965
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,358
From your heart?

966
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:54,568
Better.

967
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:56,421
From my head.

968
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:57,883
And yes,

969
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,458
Ange, I promise...

970
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:03,669
from my heart...

971
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:05,587
you will get another chance.

972
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:09,942
 

973
00:42:10,008 --> 00:42:11,536
Well, Dawes and his deputies,
they caught the counterfeiters.

974
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,442
Dani gave a statement saying
that it was Kellogg

975
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:18,296
who pulled the
trigger on Kirk.

976
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,376
Dani knows that you saved
her life.

977
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,326
You pointed that helicopter
in the right direction.

978
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:24,017
Obviously, you
subconsciously

979
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,870
sifted through
the rational facts

980
00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:27,820
of the case
and processed

981
00:42:27,885 --> 00:42:29,608
the most likely scenario.

982
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,329
I'm sure that's it.

983
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:33,084
Yeah, what else could it be?

984
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,003
Well, it's the only
rational explanation.

985
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,759
Are you guys
making fun of me?

986
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:38,058
 

987
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,911
You know, let's go back home.
You know?

988
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:42,934
Where there's water, shelter
and living things.

989
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,113
Come on!
