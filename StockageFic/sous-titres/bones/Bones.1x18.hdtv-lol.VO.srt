1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,571
Why do the FBI
always stick their morgues

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:05,304
in the most depressing basement
they can find?

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,271
Don't be such
a snob, Bones.

4
00:00:07,338 --> 00:00:09,804
Okay, not everyone
gets to play

5
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:11,004
in a multi-million-
dollar lab, you know,
with skylights...

6
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,570
It's because,
as a society,

7
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,238
we feel the need
to hide death away.

8
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,104
The people who deal
with the dead

9
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,737
are viewed as freaks.

10
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:19,637
Yeah. I don't know if
it's the basement thing,

11
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,338
but this guy you're
about to meet-- Harry--
he's a bit twisted.

12
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:23,770
You probably think I get
some kind of rush when I work,

13
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:25,338
that I'm somehow
titillated.

14
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:26,004
Uh, choice of
words, Bones,

15
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,071
choice of words.

16
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:31,670
Agent Booth.

17
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:33,271
Harry Tepper,
meet Dr. Temperance Brennan

18
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:34,037
from the Jeffersonian.

19
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:35,570
Hmm, I've read her.

20
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:36,604
Hello.

21
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,670
She's good.

22
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,837
Read your novel, too.

23
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:42,304
The heroine's very aggressive.

24
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,271
Harry, you want to...?

25
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:49,503
Okay, everybody, meet Ted Macy.

26
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,037
Body was found
in a national park.

27
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:52,737
Local coroner wrote it off

28
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,437
as some kind
of an accidental drowning,

29
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:55,770
but you see, we have
to investigate

30
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:56,937
every death on federal land.

31
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,570
During my examination,

32
00:00:58,637 --> 00:01:00,837
I found he had
a crushed larynx.

33
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,004
That didn't seem accidental.

34
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,537
This is a corpse

35
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:04,837
with skin.

36
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:05,670
She <i>is</i> good.

37
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:08,004
Why am I here?

38
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,604
Relax, Bones.

39
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,470
I didn't bring you here
to examine the body.

40
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:12,837
I want you to see what
they found in his hand.

41
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:15,238
Harry, the bone?

42
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,670
What is that?

43
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:22,604
It's a phalanx.

44
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,837
Finger bone.

45
00:01:24,904 --> 00:01:26,370
Figured she'd know that.

46
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:27,837
Yeah, I'd figure

47
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:28,971
any competent medical examiner

48
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,604
would know not to
compromise evidence.

49
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,137
Is this Lysol IC?

50
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,804
We use it
to decontaminate remains.

51
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,338
Are you trying to break down

52
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:36,403
the periosteal surface
of the bone,

53
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,204
wreak havoc
on the marrow?

54
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,604
Did you even dilute this?

55
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,804
Bones...
What?!

56
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,570
You've removed particulates

57
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:44,804
and trace elements
that could potentially lead us

58
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,238
to his killer.

59
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:47,670
Is this your first day
on the job?

60
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,604
18 years next month.

61
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,470
She's intense.

62
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:01,837
Native American.

63
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,470
British Colonial.

64
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,937
American Revolutionary.

65
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,770
Hey, what are we playing?

66
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,704
Dr. Brennan, the destroyer
of evidence is here.

67
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,871
Okay, I assume that's a joke,
so nobody gets hurt.

68
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:12,637
Did Harry really mess up
that bone?

69
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:14,604
He dissolved
any traces

70
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,704
of ingrained particulates
on the surface,

71
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,403
but we were still
able to save

72
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,604
some valuable
attributes.

73
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,370
Like what?

74
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,171
Alternating sclerotic

75
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:23,071
and porotic areas on
subperiosteal surface

76
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:26,271
demonstrates that
whoever this was

77
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,037
suffered from
tertiary syphilis.

78
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,804
Tertiary syphilis. Whoa.

79
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,370
Wow, that's the worst.

80
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,338
It was a common ailment
in the 17th century.

81
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,071
Which is where
the bone dates from.

82
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:37,071
Say what?

83
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,171
We ran a radiocarbon
dating test.

84
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:41,871
The finger's over
300 years old.

85
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:43,770
It's a unique find
for the area.

86
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:44,871
I'm going to change
to French trapper.

87
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:47,271
You can't change yours.

88
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,238
Booth, where did they find
the victim?

89
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,537
They shipped him
over from some resort town

90
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,971
next to a federal
seaside reserve:

91
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,171
Assateague Island.

92
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:54,837
That's where the Money Pit is.

93
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:55,604
Money Pit?

94
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,837
Legend is,

95
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:01,071
Assateague Island is where
Blackbeard buried his treasure.

96
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,604
For 300 years,

97
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,737
people have been
trying to find it.

98
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:06,004
They've dug it
out to something
like 150 feet,

99
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,937
but they've found nothing.

100
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,470
Every time they come close,
they trigger a baffle

101
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,071
that floods the pit
with sea water.

102
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,503
Booby traps.
Cool.

103
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,503
The body was found
at a dig site.

104
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,503
This is the first
concrete evidence

105
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,304
that the treasure
is more than a legend.

106
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,071
I'll bet this is
from one of the men

107
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,403
who buried
the treasure.

108
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,037
Pure conjecture.
Pirate.

109
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,470
Pirate?
Pirate?

110
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,537
It's a pirate.

111
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:27,238
"You can't change yours."

112
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:28,804
Wait, so the victim
finds evidence

113
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,370
that the treasure exists.

114
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:31,770
Somebody else wants it all
for themselves.

115
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,137
That's certainly...
that's a good motive for murder.

116
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:36,971
I'll be glad to help.

117
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:38,137
That's okay. I-I can handle it.

118
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:39,437
Come on, man, share the wealth.

119
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:42,871
We're looking for answers, Jack,
not treasure.

120
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,704
Do you really think
that treasure exists down there?

121
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,238
What do you think?

122
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:49,137
Why are you guys smiling?

123
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,004
Pirates!

124
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,570
It's a guy thing, sweetie.

125
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,937


126
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,437
So, the dead guy, Macy,
ran the dig?

127
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:23,470
With his partner, Hardewicke.

128
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,704
They were hired
by anyone with money to burn.

129
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,370
What, people
would do that?

130
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:29,338
Sane people look
for treasure?

131
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,071
Well, isn't that what
archeologists do?

132
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,537
Archeologists are scientists
who use evidence

133
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,704
on which to base
their explorations,

134
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,670
not some pirate movie
they saw when they were ten.

135
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,937
Yeah, well, that,
uh, 300-year-old bone

136
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:42,704
that we just found
sort of, uh,

137
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,871
changes things now,
doesn't it there, matey?

138
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:50,704
What's going
on over there?

139
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,403
The mayor told me to let him in.

140
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,238
Branson Rose is
funding this dig?

141
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:54,937
Has been
for two years.

142
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,704
But I heard he was pulling out.

143
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,204
All right, thanks.
I'll take it from here.

144
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,271
Sure.
Who's Branson Rose?

145
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:00,704
The billionaire
adventurer.

146
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,637
You know, he
made his fortune

147
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,670
making aircraft
for the military.

148
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,271
He owns about half
the world.

149
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,071
He's the guy
who has that reality show

150
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:09,071
that goes
all over the world and...

151
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:10,704
Still no TV?

152
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,104
Why do I even bother?

153
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:15,670
You can't pull
out now, Mr. Rose.

154
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:16,837
We got a contract.

155
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,204
So you can sue,
but I don't think

156
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:19,338
you have the resources
to take me on.

157
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,637
Mr. Rose,
we just broke 200 feet!

158
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,104
I've been hearing that for
two years, Hardewicke.

159
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,104
Get off your asses

160
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,238
and load my gear!
Excuse me?

161
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:28,937
Mr. Rose, Macy--
he knew it.

162
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,137
He felt it.

163
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,338
This close!
Excuse me.

164
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:33,171
ROSE:
Two years, $2 million.

165
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:34,837
There's nothing
down there, Giles.

166
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,370
Macy died for nothing.

167
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,704
FBI! You're all
under arrest!

168
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:41,737
Come on, Bones,
you don't get to say that.

169
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,304
I'm the one with the badge.
The FBI's involved now?

170
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,503
Oh, yeah. You know,
murder on federal land--

171
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,304
we like to, uh,
poke around a little.

172
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,904
Murder?

173
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,004
Yeah, murder.

174
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,871
You said
it was an accident.

175
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,971
That's what I thought.

176
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:58,971
Oh, my God...

177
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,537
He found something.

178
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,271
Put my stuff back now!

179
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,437
What did Macy find

180
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,470
that would be worth
killing him for?

181

182
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,504
In 1832, a team of six men
looking for the treasure

183
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,970
were killed when a shaft
they were digging collapsed.

184
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:52,737
Blackbeard's curse, man.

185
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:53,837
A curse?

186
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:54,970
We're scientists.

187
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,237
Look at this. 1902.

188
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,004
Two men disappeared
while digging.

189
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,237
Never found
their bodies.

190
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:02,937
Oh, that's very cursey.

191
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:05,137
So you believe
in pirates?

192
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:07,137
Pirates aren't Santa, Zack.

193
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,637
They did exist.

194
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,870
They did have treasures,
and they did bury it.

195
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:12,937
You know, I had an eye
patch when I was six.

196
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:16,137
Who didn't, my friend?
Who didn't?

197
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:19,004
It's not necessary to
lead me like a child.

198
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,538
I'd rather not have
any more evidence compromised.

199
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:23,371
You're squeezing my
arm very tightly.

200
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:24,371
Sorry.

201
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,637
No, no, it's okay.

202
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:28,271
You can give it
to Dr. Hodgins.

203
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:29,404
What is this?

204
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,538
Soil and water collected

205
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,104
from Ted Macy's
throat and lungs.

206
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,804
He was found floating
in his dry suit

207
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,937
at the top of the shaft.

208
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:38,404
All right,
you know what?

209
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:39,670
We need you to do
your dirt thing.

210
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:40,737
You know, match the
slime to the crime,

211
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:42,538
make sure that's
where he was killed.

212
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:46,603
I'd like to look at X rays
of the victim's skeleton.

213
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,837
Bossy.

214
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:49,337
Do not go there.

215
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:51,371
In the interest
of being thorough,

216
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,703
I need to determine
if he died at the top

217
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,570
or died at the bottom
and floated up.

218
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:56,438
I need silt abstracts
from both levels.

219
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,770
Fine. We'll get those for you.

220
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,237
No, no. No.

221
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:00,404
The soil looks
like an odd mixture of clay,

222
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,737
plagioclase feldspar,
pyroxene...

223
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:04,438
I really wouldn't trust
anyone else

224
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:05,670
to harvest the samples properly.

225
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:06,870
You just want
to look for treasure.

226
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:11,538
I am a serious scientist

227
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:14,371
merely trying to do my job
as well as possible.

228
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:17,438
That shaft is
over 200 feet deep, you know.

229
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,137
It requires
an experienced diver.

230
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:20,904
I am a certified cave diver,

231
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,970
which means I can go deeper
than 200 feet.

232
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,937
I dove Mayan Blue,

233
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,337
Dos Ojos, Tortuga...

234
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:27,404
Ever dive Naharon?

235
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:28,703
Once.

236
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,104
I named Naharon.

237
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,104
Well, then how
can you say no to me?

238
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,004
Okay...

239
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,071
but just to collect
soil samples.

240
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,670
Of course.

241
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:39,670
So, you dive, too?

242
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:42,837
I have the time because
I don't own a TV.

243
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:44,271
You wear a rubber
suit, then?

244
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:50,637


245
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,637
Accidents happen, you know.

246
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,703
Macy and I were prepared
for that, but murder?

247
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,271
Murder. Wow.

248
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,271
Anything I can do to help...

249
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,804
Okay, we'll talk about
that a little later.

250
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,770
Right now, I want to get
Hodgins down that shaft.

251
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:03,970
Dane McGinnis.

252
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,737
He-he's the best
I know.

253
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:07,570
Uh, he's worked
for us for years.

254
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:11,304
Agent Booth?
Are you Agent Booth?

255
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,071
You're going to have to stay
behind the yellow tape.

256
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,471
I'm Mayor Ney.

257
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,104
Your men keep pushing
our tourists

258
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,804
further
and further back.

259
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,603
Mayor? Wow.

260
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,438
I-I hope you didn't look
like that when they elected you.

261
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:24,171
Blackbeard's treasure
is what keeps the economy

262
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,870
on this little island running.

263
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,237
sometimes too intensely.

264
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:30,004
Hey, I'm not ashamed.

265
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,870
I've increased tourism 63%
since I took office,

266
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,637
and I can boost it a bit more

267
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,204
if the tourists could get
a closer look.

268
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:36,703
It's a murder scene, not a show.

269
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,870
Blackbeard's curse.

270
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:40,570
Macy would've wanted to give
a little back

271
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:42,637
to the town that he loved.

272
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,737
Frank, the police are
telling them no pictures.

273
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,071
Now, who is this, huh?
The Pirate Queen?

274
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:48,637
That's right.
My wife, Katie.

275
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,404
That's right. Great.

276
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:51,770
Listen, you just tell
the tourists

277
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:53,104
that the bad view
is part of the curse.

278
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,870
Will you please escort
the pirate and his wench

279
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:55,770
behind the
yellow tape?

280
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:57,271
Thank you.

281
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:58,737
I'm the mayor of this town...

282
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,137
So, Dane-- he's, uh,
an experienced guy?

283
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:02,171
I've worked with hundreds.
He's the best.

284
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:03,603
All right.

285
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,071
I hope this guy knows
what he's doing,

286
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,071
'cause it's tight
down there.

287
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:09,438
Avast, ye lubbers!

288
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:15,538
Whoo!

289
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:18,337
Dane, let's
get him ready.

290
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,603
You think it's a pirate?

291
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,304
It's a 300-year-old finger
from the left hand of a male.

292
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:31,171
That's all
I'm sure of so far.

293
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:32,204
Worth killing for?

294
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:34,637
I worked a case once

295
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,071
where a woman was killed,
dismembered and burned

296
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,737
because her friend thought

297
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,504
she'd taken her favorite pair
of slippers.

298
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,703
Cheery.

299
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,304
Maybe they're right.

300
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,670
Maybe this man died
burying the treasure.

301
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:50,204
Ironic... stealing all that
and never enjoying the spoils.

302
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,271
So you believe
there's treasure?

303
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:55,837
I believe there's greed.

304
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:58,171
That's the real curse.

305
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,137
All right, safety line,
air hose.

306
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:08,104
Either one
breaks,

307
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,837
you ain't
coming back up.

308
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:12,037
You got to work
on your bedside manner, dude.

309
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,670
You know, I don't want to be
responsible for some weekender

310
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:16,504
who buys it down there
because he thinks

311
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,970
he's better
than he is.

312
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:19,770
You want to go down, don't you?

313
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:20,703


314
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,271
It's my shaft, okay?

315
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:24,471
I've been working it ten years.

316
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,837
But the Feds-- they say
it's a crime scene,

317
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,337
so I can't help.

318
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,037
You're helping me.

319
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:31,770
BOOTH:
Why's he need
the air line?

320
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,371
Why can't he just
use the tank?

321
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:36,004
Because around 100 foot down,
the shaft gets a little cozy.

322
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,603
You ain't afraid

323
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,703
of a tight squeeze,
are you, Doc?

324
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,404
Gloves.

325
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:43,104
Just take it
slow, okay?

326
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,337
There's a lot
of stuff

327
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,204
to catch your hose on
on the way down.

328
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,137
Yeah, I saw the pictures
Rose took.

329
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:49,504
Rose.

330
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,304
He never went as far
as you're going.

331
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:52,538
No one has.

332
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,603
Maybe he shouldn't
try, you know?

333
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,904
People have died down
there, not just Macy.

334
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,037
I know.

335
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:58,438
My brother was one of them.

336
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:02,404
I'm going
all the way down.

337
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,337
What's at 200 feet?

338
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:05,937
We just hit 200
last week.

339
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:07,870
You're going to have
to tell me.

340
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:08,703
Well, I'm ready.

341
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,804
Okay.

342
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,538


343
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,371


344
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:46,904
Your friend better be as good
as he says he is.

345
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,570
You just feed
him that hose.

346
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,304
Hodgins, you read me?

347
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,304
I hear you loud <i>and</i> clear.

348
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:07,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

349
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:08,670
Hodgins?

350
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,337
It's warm.

351
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,904
Passing the first flood trap.

352
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,804
We lost our first man there.

353
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,271
There's wood here
below the limestone.

354
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:20,504
Does he make any sense to you?
Oh, yeah.

355
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,237
He's passing the site
of the first pit collapse.

356
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:24,404
It's tight down here.

357
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,603
There's lots of debris.

358
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,471
Not sure I can squeeze through.

359
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:31,271
Hey, this guy swims
like a squid.

360
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:32,570
Actually, he swims
like a squint.

361
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,204
What?

362
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,104
Never mind.

363
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,104
Okay, I'm clear now.

364
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:38,870
DANE:
Good picture, too.

365
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:41,237
We can't get resolution
like that.
Yeah, well,

366
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:42,570
he's a geek
who works for the government.

367
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,204
You ever find anything
down here?

368
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,271
Not yet.
Ten years of finding nothing,
and you keep trying.

369
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:47,837
It's all about the search, man.

370
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,670
He's at 170 feet.

371
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,171
One-eighty.

372
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:57,337
One-ninety.

373
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,970
No one's ever been this deep.

374
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,004
He's at 200.

375
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:05,171
Touch down. I am on the bottom.

376
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:08,670
Visibility is surprisingly
good.

377
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:12,603
Wait a minute.
There's-there's something here.

378
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,104
Holy...

379
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,271
What is that?

380
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,071
Whoa, is that...?

381
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:21,204
Oh, my God.

382
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:22,471
Is that...?

383
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,603


384
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,770
I'm amazed
you found a complete skeleton.

385
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:35,870
C-14 dating matches
at 300 years.

386
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:37,204
Subject is male, early twenties,

387
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,603
approximately five feet...

388
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,770
six inches.

389
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,937
Legs are bowed,
result of visible calcium

390
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,538
and phosphate deficiency.

391
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,637
He had rickets as a child,

392
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,737
but his upper body is
extraordinarily well-developed.

393
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:54,438
Epiphyseal separation
in the long bones.

394
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:58,304
Sunken sternum forms
scorbutic rosary

395
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:00,538
at costochondral margin.

396
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:03,204
He suffered from scurvy,
as well as tertiary syphilis.

397
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:05,271
What's with the tertiary? Isn't
plain all syphilis bad enough?

398
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,970
Scurvy, syphilis.

399
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,104
Pirate.

400
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,770
There is

401
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:12,737
anthropological evidence
which supports the claim

402
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,271
that Blackbeard
executed his
burial crews

403
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,570
after they were
done digging.

404
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,904
Okay.

405
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,171
Let's say it's a pirate.

406
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:19,970
Yes!
Oh!

407
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,337
This would be

408
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:23,104
an extraordinary find.

409
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:25,171
And would open up
the reality

410
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:27,404
of the treasure.

411
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:29,137
It would be stupid to dismiss
anything at this point.

412
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:30,837
But we need

413
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:33,071
to discover why the ossein
isn't fully decomposed

414
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:34,670
from being waterlogged
for so long.

415
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,570
About 50
feet down
the shaft,

416
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,504
is a layer of blue putty,
consisting of silicon and clay.

417
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,904
It can be used
to form a watertight seal.

418
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,171
That would explain the condition
of the bones.

419
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,970
I took samples
of the same blue clay

420
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,937
between 200
and 207 feet.

421
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,804
Something is buried
down there.

422
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,104
And these bones were lying
on top of it.

423
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,004
Macy was killed
because of something
that he found.

424
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,538
Silt in his throat
and lungs confirms

425
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,371
he was killed at the top
of the shaft.

426
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:58,104
After he swam back up
with the treasure.

427
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,770
Special Agent Booth.

428
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,204
I hate

429
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:03,237
to interrupt your investigation,
Agent Booth,

430
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:05,304
but there's an angry billionaire
in my office,

431
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:08,438
and he won't go away.

432
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,204
<i>It's simple.</i>

433
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,171
You have something
that belongs to me,

434
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,637
and I'm not leaving here
without it.

435
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:15,271
A day ago, you couldn't wait
to leave.

436
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:17,204
Pull out of the island,
cut your losses.

437
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,037
You remember that?
A lot can change in a day.

438
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,970
Yeah. For Ted Macy,
a lot changed.

439
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,603
Look, I'm sorry about Ted,
but I'll be damned

440
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,703
if the federal government swoops
in here at the eleventh hour

441
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,137
and steals what I've been trying
to find for two years.

442
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:29,404
I fail to see

443
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,171
what this has to do
with the Jeffersonian.

444
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:32,637
Those bones belong to me.

445
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:34,904
They were uncovered
at my site.

446
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,737
I was granted a permit
to dig there and keep

447
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:40,071
what was found.

448
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,570
My attorneys

449
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:43,904
assure me, you have no claim
to those bones.

450
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,870
Sure, I mean, your attorney
wants to go to court

451
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,337
for the next 20 years, and

452
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,337
buy himself a nice vacation home
in Tuscany, but the fact is,

453
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:52,371
when Ted Macy was murdered,

454
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:54,603
your property became
our evidence.

455
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,237
And it's going to stay that way
until we find the killer.

456
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:58,237


457
00:16:58,304 --> 00:17:00,137
I was hoping
to settle this amicably.

458
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:01,870
Really?
Because, you know,

459
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,104
we haven't seen that yet.

460
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,337
Nah.

461
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:07,304
This is going
to be a headache.

462
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,504
He has some very important
friends.

463
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,670
I don't understand
why he's so upset.

464
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:12,304
It's not like
he needs the money.

465
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:14,137
But he has partners that do.

466
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,237
Macy and Hardewicke were going
to split what they found.

467
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,870
But Macy is dead.

468
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,137
Exactly. Leaving Hardewicke
with a bigger

469
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,271
piece of the pie.

470
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:26,104
This is from our very first dig
together.

471
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,970
Oh, we found this-this
chest buried

472
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:30,037
under a flood drain
up in Smith's Cove

473
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,970
in New England.
There was no treasure,

474
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:34,670
but, you know, just
to unearth something
that was that old,

475
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,637
had that much history--
we were hooked.

476
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:38,337
Never looked back.

477
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,037
You know, I glanced
through your company history.

478
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,870
I mean, business
was pretty slow,

479
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,404
since you didn't find
any treasure out here.

480
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:44,904
You were getting fewer
and fewer clients.

481
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,438
Yeah, it's been difficult.

482
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,703
Branson Rose was almost
your last chance.

483
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,271
There's always somebody who
wants to look for treasure.

484
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,804
Really?
Yeah.

485
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,037
'Cause, you know,
Branson Rose, he pulls out,

486
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:58,471
and get a lot of publicity,
you could end up, you know...

487
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,737
sinking your business.

488
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,637
Yeah, but Macy found something
finally, and we're going

489
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,670
to share the find
with Rose-- 50% for
him, 50 for us.

490
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:05,438
Exactly.

491
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,271
Oh, I see.

492
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,703
More for me if Macy's out
of the picture, right?

493
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,471
You're forgetting
one thing.

494
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:13,870
Macy was like
family to me.

495
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:14,904
Really?

496
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,837
Look at this. See that?

497
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,737
I got that pulling Macy out
of a sinkhole back in '93.

498
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:21,538
He's got plenty
of scars on him
because of me, too.

499
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,137
Hmm. How'd you get

500
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,104
all those bruises
around your scar there, huh?

501
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,770
Oh...

502
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,237
The Mayor.

503
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:29,271
How does the Mayor figure
into all this?

504
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:32,504
His wife. You
saw her, right?

505
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,804
Well, Macy was a bit of a hound,
if you know what I mean.

506
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,071
He was sleeping
with the Pirate Queen?

507
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:39,304
The Mayor got suspicious,
he came around last week,

508
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,504
and I ended up taking
the heat for Macy,

509
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,670
because Macy's like my
brother, and I'll tell you,

510
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:46,237
that scrawny little
pirate-- he can kick, too.

511
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,504
Lucky he didn't have
time to load that
flintlock. Charlie?

512
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,204
No. Put that down.
Leave it there.

513
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,071
What are you doing?

514
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,770
Zack?

515
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,371
Zack, the bones--
what did you do with the bones?

516
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,071
Nothing,
Dr. Brennan.

517
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:04,670
I left them on the
table just like

518
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,538
you asked.

519
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,180
Where the hell are my bones ?

520
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,170
<i>Bones don't just disappear.</i>

521
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,104
I thought this was
a secure facility.

522
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,903
You assured me this
was a secure facility.

523
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,970
I could be working at
Stanford, you know.

524
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:22,304
This never would have
happened at Stanford.

525
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,638
We spend three quarters
of a million dollars
annually on security.

526
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,937
Obviously that's
not enough.

527
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:27,237
I want my bones.

528
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:29,371
Did you find my bones?!
Oh! Maybe you want just want
to, you know, chill a little?

529
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:30,404
Chill?

530
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,571
Yeah. You know, take a pill.

531
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,471
Listen, dude,
my lab was violated,

532
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,237
my bones were stolen,

533
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,504
so I think I'll remain warm

534
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,304
for a little while longer.

535
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,304
Honey, maybe you should focus
on your breathing.

536
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:41,437
Breathing.
Count to ten.

537
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:42,170
Count to ten.

538
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:43,371
Have a shot of Jack.

539
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,404
Shot of Jack.
Look, we're doing

540
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:45,271
everything that
we can, okay?

541
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:46,271
I promise you,

542
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:47,970
we're going to find your bones,

543
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,037
but you have to allow us
to do our job.

544
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:54,137
I guess I wasn't helping
all that much, was I?

545
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:56,870
I...

546
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:57,337
I'm...

547
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,937
Sorry.

548
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:02,704
It's cool.

549
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,137
Hey, look on the bright side.

550
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,704
I mean, this whole

551
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,738
theft thing could be
good for us, right?

552
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:10,037
I mean, whoever took the bones
obviously had something to do

553
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:12,170
with the murder.
We're getting closer.

554
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:13,604
I've ordered all on-duty
security personnel

555
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,170
to give a minute-by-minute
account of their rounds.

556
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:17,437
I want an account of all
off-duty personnel, as well.

557
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:19,004
They didn't
get everything.

558
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,271
I thought all the bones
were on the table.

559
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:21,704
All the new ones.
I was still examining

560
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,337
the original finger bone
we found for scurvy,

561
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:26,770
so it was
in my room.

562
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:31,537
There is something they don't
want us to find on these bones.

563
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,237
Everyone knew Macy.

564
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,237
Helped Frank get elected.

565
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:37,937
So you would categorize your
relationship as just friends?

566
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,504
Yeah. Friends.

567
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,237
It's a small town.

568
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,871
We're all friends.

569
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:46,671
Well, whoever killed Macy
wasn't too friendly.

570
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:49,470
He wouldn't hurt
a soul-- Macy.

571
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:52,038
He was a sweet guy.

572
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:54,270
The way you're talking
about him, it seems like

573
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,737
you were more
than just friends.

574
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:59,804
Hardewicke told you, right?

575
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:01,304
Like he's such a saint.

576
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,904
How involved were
the two of you?

577
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,304
It was just one
of those things, you know.

578
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,270
I wasn't going to leave Frank
or anything.

579
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:10,637
I guess I wanted to see
what it was like

580
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,304
to be with a real adventurer

581
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,604
rather than a guy
who dresses up like one.

582
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:16,871
So, Frank went after Hardewicke
when he thought it was him.

583
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:18,804
You think Frank killed him?

584
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,604
You saw Frank.
Well, yeah.

585
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,804
You know, he's a little,
uh, a little unstable.

586
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,103
When he finds out somebody
made a fool of him twice, I...

587
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,437
Look, it's Hardewicke
and the rich guy

588
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,804
you should be looking at.

589
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,304
Macy said they were all fighting

590
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,437
over the money
they were spending.

591
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,470
Said Hardewicke didn't
appreciate all the work he did,

592
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:36,270
wanted to break up the company.

593
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,771
Well, we're-we're
looking into everyone.

594
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:38,971
Thanks.
Sure.

595
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:40,871
But all this coming up again.

596
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:46,571
Just try not
to ruin my marriage, okay?

597
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,404
I made a mistake.

598
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,038
But I love that stupid pirate,
and I don't want to lose him.

599
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,504
Well, thanks for talking to me.

600
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:54,938
I'll be in touch.

601
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:02,203
The periosteal surface
on the phalanx

602
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,537
doesn't have any ingrained
particulates that I can recover.

603
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,971
The solution that M.E. used
probably dissolved anything

604
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:10,270
that was lodged
in any surface irregularities.

605
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,038
Who would clean a bone

606
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,904
before extracting all available
information from it?

607
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,304
Not everyone is as thorough
as we are, Zack.

608
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,537
So true, so true.

609
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:18,904
I wonder if there was

610
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,771
gold dust on it.

611
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:22,871
Perhaps you should start working
with a parrot on your shoulder.

612
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,437
You're not curious?
Yes. About the facts.

613
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:29,203
There's a small hole

614
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,704
along the distal articular facet
of the finger.

615
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:33,337
It could be a foramen,

616
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:35,170
but it could be something else,
man-made.

617
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,270
A weapon?

618
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:37,504
Maybe.

619
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,971
See if you can find
any possible matches.

620
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:42,637
I wonder if there are any other
similar marks on Macy?

621
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:44,470
I'll find out.

622
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:52,270
And don't let that bone
out of your sight.

623
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,537
Dr. Brennan thought you might
have overlooked

624
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,504
a weapon of some kind.

625
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,604
He wasn't killed
by any weapon.

626
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,771
He was strangled.

627
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,604
The larynx is crushed.

628
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:04,004
It's plain.

629
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,671
And C2 through C4 are fractured.

630
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:09,304
That wouldn't have occurred
if he were merely strangled.

631
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,971
If the victim was shaken
while being strangled...

632
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,971
The fractures
are all left to right,

633
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:15,837
approximately 45-degree angles
on each bone.

634
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:17,504
That means the head

635
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:19,337
was jerked to the left and up,

636
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:22,370
making sure that the spinal cord
would tear.

637
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:25,070
The larynx was crushed
when his neck was broken.

638
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,470
I'm always open
to being corrected.

639
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:30,370
Why do you think
there might have been a weapon?

640
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:32,404
I saw a small perforation
in the finger bone,

641
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,771
which you decided to put
in the solvent.

642
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:37,040
Still angry.

643
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:39,107
I handled it according
to protocol:

644
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:41,907
rubber gloves
right into the solvent.

645
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:48,808
Something damaged that bone, and
it didn't happen 300 years...

646
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:50,174
Wait a minute.

647
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:56,603
I have alternatives
that could have caused the hole.

648
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,371
This is a disposable
acupuncture needle.

649
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,470
He was healed to death?

650
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:04,704
This is a filament used
for an angioplasty.

651
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,371
Hand me the wire.

652
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:14,404
BOOTH:
What are you doing?

653
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,037
Diminished fluorescence.

654
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,404
That only happens if the bones
have been cleaned and treated.

655
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,870
These bones didn't start out
in the shaft.

656
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:25,503
What?

657
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,237
Who has got
300-year-old bones?

658
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,770
I assure you everything here
is authentic, Dr. Brennan.

659
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,570
I curated this exhibit
for the Jeffersonian myself.

660
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:41,104
Could you please
open the case?

661
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:44,004
This is a beautiful specimen.

662
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:46,237
Found in Jamaica.

663
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:48,937
We believe he sailed
with Henry Morgan.

664
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,271
He's never been on a boat
in his life.
Absurd.

665
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:54,271
Oh, my God.

666
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:55,870
These bones
are artificial.

667
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:57,071
It's acrylic, not bone.

668
00:24:57,137 --> 00:25:00,404
You can see the hole

669
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,937
where the wire
was threaded

670
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:05,503
when the bones were assembled
for display.

671
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,570
Then where's the rest
of my sailor?

672
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,870
He was planted in the shaft
in Assateague Island

673
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:12,837
to make the whole
treasure business seem real,

674
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:13,870
but somebody found out.

675
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:15,004
Who?

676
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,704
A murderer.

677
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,834
Okay, let me see
if I get this straight.

678
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:27,234
The pirate bones you recovered
came from the Jeffersonian

679
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,534
to start with?
Correct.

680
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:32,067
300-year-old bones stolen
from our own pirate exhibit.

681
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,868
And then recovered
by one of your own people...

682
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,601
Dr. Hodgins.

683
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,601
...who brought them back
to the Jeffersonian,

684
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,467
where they were stolen again?

685
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:41,000
Re-stolen, sir.

686
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:42,868
You have a security problem,
Dr. Goodman.

687
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,234
And when I find out
who did this,

688
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,434
you may have a murder problem.

689
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,200
But I'm on top of it, okay?

690
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,200
You didn't have to come
down here, sir.

691
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,667
That's what I thought,
until I got a call

692
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,868
from someone
at the Department of Defense.

693
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,267
Defense? How do they figure
into a murder investigation?

694
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,133
Branson Rose,
he has friends in high places,

695
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,100
and they don't like
it when the guy

696
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,601
who builds their bombers
is unhappy.

697
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:02,367
They afraid he'll bomb them?

698
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:04,934
What is that, squint humor?

699
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,534
Because I'm not laughing.

700
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:07,767
Defense doesn't need
a reason to go to war,

701
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:12,734
and I'm not about to be
their next target.

702
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:14,267
Well, of course not.

703
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:15,734
You're too busy
looking for your bones.

704
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:17,133
Let's not make this personal.

705
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,300
Rose wants to keep
playing in the mud,

706
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,801
and his big-shot friends
are going to see that happens,

707
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,100
unless we get some answers fast.

708
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,133
At this point, it appears as if
the stolen 300-year-old bones

709
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,868
are being used to, you know,
salt the shaft.

710
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:31,567
Salt the shaft?

711
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:34,267
Yeah, you know, an investor
spends a million bucks,

712
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:35,801
gets antsy when nothing happens,
and then, voil? you know,

713
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:38,300
pirate bones appear, and the
golden goose keeps, you know...

714
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,534
...laying those eggs.

715
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:43,000
Okay, that is
a convoluted metaphor, Booth.

716
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,801
It's a hoax, Dr. Brennan,

717
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:46,767
like Piltdown Man.
Oh, got it.

718
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,767
Why can't you be clear
like that?

719
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:51,200
Assuming the bones
were stolen...

720
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,834
Re-stolen?
...re-stolen so you wouldn't
find out they were bogus,

721
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:54,701
how did you?

722
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:55,868
How did I what?

723
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,334
From the finger.

724
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
They didn't get
the entire skeleton.

725
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,834
Would you like Dr. Brennan
to take you through the process?

726
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:01,968
I really, really wouldn't.

727
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,100
So who do you like?

728
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,901
I like the partner.
Giles Hardewicke.

729
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:07,434
Access, motive,
ability...

730
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,968
Dr. Goodman,
the FBI will provide

731
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,701
whatever help you need to solve

732
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,300
your breach of security
at the Jeffersonian.

733
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,234
You work the partner angle.

734
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,734
Well, my father
worked a fishing boat,

735
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,934
his dad before that.

736
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,601
Heck, me and
my brother,

737
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,534
we never knew
anything but the sea.

738
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:27,133
Hunting for treasure just sort
of grew out of that I guess.

739
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,567
Any regrets?

740
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:31,400
Sure. My brother.

741
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:34,667
Yeah.

742
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:38,133
That and the fact they might
shut us down.

743
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,234
Hey, not if we find something.
Huh?

744
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,000
You know, I thought you were
going to turn out

745
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,334
to be just another desk jockey
who'd read a few books

746
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,701
and was looking for something
to brighten up

747
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,467
his boring-ass life.

748
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,534
I'll tell you what,
I'd be down that shaft right now

749
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:52,801
if Big Brother didn't have
a minimum time requirement

750
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:53,868
between dives.

751
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:58,400
You deserve to be here.

752
00:27:58,467 --> 00:27:59,701
You really do.

753
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:05,100
Thanks for that, man.

754
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,834
The bones were planted.

755
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:12,667
You don't seem surprised.

756
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,234
Eh, nothing surprises me
out of that ... pit anymore.

757
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,667
Nah.

758
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,667
I mean, you dig down far enough,
you'll come out in hell.

759
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:23,234
So, uh...

760
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,701
if you don't find anything,
are you gonna shut us down?

761
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,200
Hey, I'm not FBI.

762
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:29,467
I'm just a scientist.

763
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:31,033
It's a crime scene.

764
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,634
I'm surprised
they let you down there.

765
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:34,067
I'm an expert in silt, plants,

766
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,734
and insects--
that's right.

767
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,767
I got three doctorates.

768
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,934
When you got three doctorates,
and you tell the FBI

769
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,100
you need more samples,
who's gonna argue?

770
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,367
One doctorate, yeah,
maybe they argue, but three?

771
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,334
You want to go back down again,
don't you?

772
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:54,901
I could use your help, man.

773
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:58,133
You got the bug, man!

774
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,033
Hey, like I said,
I <i>am</i> the bug man.

775
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
Arr!
Arr!

776
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,467
<i>If you lost the bones,</i>

777
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,234
how do you know
they're fake?

778
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,434
Thieves, they didn't
get everything.

779
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,501
Ah. Stroke of luck
for the good guys.

780
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,400
We will find out
how those bones were stolen

781
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,234
from the Jeffersonian.

782
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,334
You still think I
did it, don't you?

783
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,901
Why were you going to break up
the company?

784
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:21,868
Let me guess,
Katie Ney tell you that?

785
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:24,534
What makes you think
it was Katie?
That was a stock part

786
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,567
of Macy's seduction technique,
and it was very effective.

787
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,334
"I risk my life

788
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,434
down in that hole while my
partner stays safe topside."

789
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:34,267
That's how he
positioned himself

790
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,634
as the heroic explorer...

791
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:39,701
which he was, by the way,
when it came to the ladies.

792
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:40,901
Your partnership was intact?

793
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:43,167
Till death did us part.

794
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:44,634
I'll tell you what.

795
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,033
I'm gonna give you guys

796
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,968
full access to the books.

797
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,601
You don't even need
a search warrant.

798
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,801
There's not a single way
in which my life is better off

799
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:54,100
without Macy.

800
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,000
Like I said, I miss the man.

801
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,167
The bones were
stolen twice--

802
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,467
the first time from
the pirate exhibit,

803
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,868
the second from the Bone Room
here in the Medico-Legal Lab.

804
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,868
The security in the lab
is tighter,

805
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,467
so the camera is continuous,
but the camera in the rotunda

806
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:13,534
is stop-action,
every three seconds.

807
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,300
I started with the lab
theft because we know

808
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,801
the bones were stolen
between 9:00 p.m.

809
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,234
and 6:00 a.m.

810
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,100
Okay.

811
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,200
Watch... here.

812
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:25,300
The bones are gone.

813
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,968
Notice the time-code.

814
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,100
What's that?

815
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,133
The camera was
turned off.

816
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,467
Camera was turned off
for one minute and 46 seconds.

817
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:37,200
It would take a lot less time
that to enter the room

818
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,968
and gather up the
bones and escape.

819
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:42,868
Now...

820
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:45,100
Dr. Goodman?
Yes?

821
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,834
Could I ask, why are we
doing this investigation

822
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:49,667
instead of Security?

823
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:51,167
We shouldn't walk too quickly;
it would arouse suspicion.

824
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:52,968
Neither would our thief.

825
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm happy to help,
but we do have

826
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:56,400
actual security
professionals who...

827
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,434
Is there any way to tell if
those tapes have been doctored?

828
00:30:58,501 --> 00:30:59,901
Yeah.

829
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,300
Since they're physical
magnetic tapes,

830
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,834
not stored digitally.

831
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,400
I always did
like analog better.

832
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,067
Now, I know why.

833
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:08,400
My point is is that I'm
only an amateur at this,

834
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,100
and I'm sure the Security
Department is better equipped

835
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:10,934
and trained...
Afternoon, Paul.

836
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,334
Best to Susan and Laura.

837
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,167
I hope Johnny feels better.

838
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:15,801
Okay you don't want
to talk about it.

839
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:16,934
I get it.

840
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,534
Sir?

841
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:22,601
Hit your stopwatch,
please, Ms. Montenegro.

842
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:25,167
35.6 seconds.

843
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:27,000
Double that for
a round-trip.

844
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,834
That's one minute,
ten seconds,

845
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:30,901
leaving approximately
30 seconds to bag the
bones and get back.

846
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:34,400
Get back where?

847
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,434
Oh... ah.

848
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,467
Wow, you must think
I'm an idiot.

849
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:39,567
I was grandstanding.

850
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,400
I can be like that.

851
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,033
So we find out what guards were
on duty during the two thefts

852
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,367
and we might have
our thief.

853
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:51,000
In stealing human remains?

854
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,767
After 300 years,
it's not like

855
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,000
he's got a family
grieving for him out there.

856
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,067
Think of me as a
grieving parent.

857
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:58,601
Grand theft, buddy;
you're looking at eight years.

858
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,467
If I don't kill you.

859
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:03,400
Come on, what's a bunch
of old bones like that worth?

860
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:04,601
Nothing.

861
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,834
How much you get for them?

862
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,567
Couple of hundred bucks.

863
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:12,133
Yeah. So this wire transfer
into your bank for ten grand,

864
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,801
what's that, inheritance?

865
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:20,734
Who did you
steal them for?

866
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,033
We didn't really do
the name-exchange thing.

867
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,601
Somebody approached you?

868
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,434
Yeah.

869
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:27,601
Let's see. Okay.

870
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,334
Which one was it?

871
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,000
Which time?

872
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:34,868
The first time.

873
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,634
Him...

874
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:41,000
but he looked better.

875
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,467
And the second time?

876
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:46,234
Um... him.

877
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,834
Look, guys, I'm cooperating,
all right?

878
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:50,300
I will give back the money.

879
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,167
I will quit my job,
all right?

880
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:53,767
How's about we just
call it even?

881
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,133
How's about we call
the D.A.?

882
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,767
You know, you need a better
screening process

883
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,701
down at the museum.
Ironic, given we
contract that out to the FBI.

884
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,367
The...

885
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,400
You think he's dangerous?

886
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,434
Grand theft, murder, yeah.

887
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:08,934
The music.

888
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,534
Shh. He's
down there.

889
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:11,534
That's not music,
it's bagpipes.

890
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:18,434
Whoa.

891
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,968
Mr. Harde...

892
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:31,801
Maybe we're looking
for someone else.

893
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,777
The larynx was crushed.

894
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,910
Is that going to be your
cause-of-death ruling?

895
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,944
We gonna have
another fight about this?

896
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:43,543
I'm a pretty
open guy, Harry,

897
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,177
but if you keep
pushing like that,

898
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:46,311
it's gonna be me who
smacks you around.

899
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:47,877
How do you know that won't

900
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,510
work for me
just as well?

901
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:53,710
You ruled that Macy died
from a crushed larynx.

902
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:55,744
A crushed larynx is fatal,

903
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,844
ergo it results in death.

904
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,044
You were wrong then,

905
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:00,810
and you're wrong now.

906
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,643
See? He likes it.

907
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,844
I need to see both sets
of X rays, his and Macy's.

908
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:10,478
It's not always about

909
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:13,510
being right or wrong.

910
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:16,610
It's about
the dialogue.

911
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:18,411
An intense conversation

912
00:34:18,478 --> 00:34:20,044
can be the most wonderful
kind of intercourse.

913
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:20,944
Know what?

914
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:22,378
This guy is a pervert.

915
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:26,144
Damage between C-2 and C-4,
45 degree angle,

916
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,710
exact same pattern
of injury as Macy.

917
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,977
His head was wrenched around,

918
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:35,277
probably while the other hand
crushed the larynx.

919
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:37,677
That must really frustrate
you that I missed that.

920
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,344
That's a Special Forces move.

921
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,710
Take a sentry down,
crush the larynx,

922
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:41,977
so he can't scream.

923
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:43,543
You've done that
to people?

924
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,643
No. Our murderer
is Special Forces.

925
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,444
Your Internet bio
says you spent time

926
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,411
in Special Air Services.

927
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:53,077
Mr. Rose has led a diverse
and full life.

928
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:54,977
How did you feel
when you found out

929
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:56,111
the dig site
had been salted?

930
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,610
ROSE:
I was disappointed, certainly.

931
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:59,177
Just disappointed?

932
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,344
Look, I wasn't irked enough
to kill Ted Macy.

933
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:02,977
Now, could we get
to the point, please?

934
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:04,643
What is Special Air Services?

935
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,211
The S.A.S. is widely regarded
as one of the finest

936
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:09,910
and best trained special forces
units in the world.

937
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,944
See any active service?

938
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:14,610
Mr. Rose is not comfortable
discussing specifics.

939
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,710
I don't like to exploit
my role in operations

940
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:18,577
which cost good men their lives.

941
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:20,643
Now, if all you're
interested in is my history,

942
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,044
there's a bio on my web site.

943
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:23,710
Great.
We just want to know

944
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:25,344
if your reputation
is for real, sir.

945
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:26,877
Hey, we'll just
contact the S.A.S.

946
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:27,910
They'll tell us.

947
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:28,677
Look...

948
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:31,543
Fine.

949
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,810
Don't expect

950
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,710
a speedy response.

951
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:36,044
Whoa, Bones.

952
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,643
That's assault!

953
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,810
Would a Special Forces guy
have been able

954
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:40,144
to stop that?

955
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:41,344
I don't know,
you kind of

956
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:42,577
got the jump
on him there.

957
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:43,677
This one won't be a surprise.

958
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,910
You ready?

959
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,510
What?

960
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,111
This is common assault!

961
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,177
Charges will be laid!

962
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:50,077
No way he's Special Ops.

963
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,311
It's just PR crap.

964
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:53,277
All right, no
more questions.

965
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:54,777
I demand she be
arrested for assault!

966
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:59,977
Shut up, Kendall.

967
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:01,411
that I'm taking a woman

968
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,177
to court for
slapping me?

969
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,378
Come on, let's
get out of here.

970
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:04,977
You won't get into
trouble for this?

971
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:08,977
Three degrees.

972
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,977
I'm telling you,
salted or not,

973
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,011
there's something
at the bottom of that shaft.

974
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:15,877
Never got to go
all the way down.

975
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:17,411
The bones
were laying on wood.

976
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:18,610
I want to see
what's underneath.

977
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,710
Always thought it'd
be me who'd find it.

978
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:26,677
Yeah, they were always
pirate-y to me.

979
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:28,677
Let's do this.

980
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:29,510
Let's do it.

981
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:37,344
Okay.

982
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,543
Dispatch, 22705.

983
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,311
Last name: McGinnis; first name:
Dane; middle initial: P.

984
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,577
I need to know which branch
of the military he served in.

985
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:14,677
Affirmative, 22705.

986
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:15,710
Stand by.

987
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,111
Why Dane?

988
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:18,610
He said Hodgins
swam like a squid.

989
00:37:18,677 --> 00:37:19,643
Squint.

990
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,610
He must have said "squint."

991
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:22,077
No, I said
"squint," okay?

992
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,543
Is this what they call
a Hail Mary pass?

993
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,344
HODGINS:
You receiving?

994
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:30,311
Loud and clear.

995
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,577
Man, it's muddy today.

996
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:34,344
Yeah.

997
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:36,411
Usually clears up past the first
flood channel at 12 meters.

998
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:40,844
* Yo-ho-ho
and a bottle of rum. *

999
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,378
Don't conjure up
any ghosts, Doc.

1000
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,011
There's too many
down there already

1001
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:46,311
waiting to claim your ass.

1002
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:47,844
Ghosts.

1003
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,311
Right.

1004
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,510
22705, Dispatch.

1005
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:54,744
McGinnis, Dane,
served in the Navy.

1006
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,144
Rating: Chief Petty Officer,
Naval Special Warfare.

1007
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,677
Oh, yeah. Had to be.

1008
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,211
What?

1009
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,044
Guy was a Navy SEAL.

1010
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:14,944
So? You were a guide.

1011
00:38:15,011 --> 00:38:16,177
A Ranger.

1012
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:18,444
I was a Ranger,
Bones, okay?

1013
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,910
I was not a guide.

1014
00:38:19,977 --> 00:38:20,877
Guides, they show
you waterfalls,

1015
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:21,844
they sell you cookies.

1016
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,510
I was a Ranger.

1017
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:25,710
What's he doing
at the shaft?

1018
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:27,710
Oh.

1019
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:29,277
Are Rangers
afraid of SEALs?

1020
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:30,411
What? Come on,
Bones, no.

1021
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:30,977
Rangers aren't
afraid of anybody.

1022
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:33,844
All right?

1023
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,877
SEALs are
pretty good, though.

1024
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:49,577
Hey, Dane.

1025
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:51,244
Hey. What's up?

1026
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:52,810
We know it was you.

1027
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:53,977
BOOTH:
Bones, please...

1028
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:55,610
Why? You have a gun.

1029
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:57,111
What's he got?
He's got somebody
in the shaft.

1030
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:58,844
How far down am I?

1031
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,944
Is that Hodgins?

1032
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,543
I can't read my depth display.

1033
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:10,510
Hey, is something going on?

1034
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:12,543
Is there anybody up there?

1035
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,344
Why don't you answer me?

1036
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:17,610
CPO McGinnis, step away
from the air hose.

1037
00:39:17,677 --> 00:39:19,177
Yeah?

1038
00:39:19,244 --> 00:39:21,677
Well, I need you to toss
that gun into the shaft.

1039
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,311
Then, toss me your keys.

1040
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:24,011
Then, handcuff yourselves
to that crane.

1041
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:27,344
I take your truck.

1042
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:29,177
Otherwise, I am gonna
cut this hose,

1043
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,444
and your buddy's gonna die.

1044
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,577
Yeah, do that.

1045
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:32,744
Bones.

1046
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,610
Not gonna happen.

1047
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:38,810
Feel a blast of cold water.

1048
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,510
Either a spring or some kind
of conduit from the ocean.

1049
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:44,810
It's clear, clean water,
so visibility is better.

1050
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,877
You killed two men.
I can't just let you drive away.

1051
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,944
Those guys...

1052
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:51,478
putting fake bones in there,

1053
00:39:51,543 --> 00:39:53,810
making the whole thing
into a con job.

1054
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:57,111
My brother died down there
looking for that treasure,

1055
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,077
lot of good men did.

1056
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:01,277
This was their life.

1057
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:02,677
Those men
dishonored them.

1058
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:04,510
Dane, can you hear me, man?

1059
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,877
I am on the bottom.

1060
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:08,510
You good enough
to take that shot

1061
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:09,677
before I cut
this air hose, Ranger?

1062
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:10,677
Pretty good.

1063
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,777
Just pretty good?

1064
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,044
Please, I'm working.

1065
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:20,378
Looks like a sandy loam down,
maybe a little clay.

1066
00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:21,411
I'll get a sample.

1067
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:23,977
I can see where

1068
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:26,844
the shaft walls
collapsed before.

1069
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,478
Oh, my God.

1070
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:32,677
Holy...

1071
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:33,577
Can you see this, Dane?

1072
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:39,411
What is it?
Why don't you take a look?

1073
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,144
Yeah.

1074
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:40,844
I do, you'll shoot me.

1075
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:45,810
Dane!

1076
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,011
Can you see this, man?!

1077
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,478
It's a gold coin.

1078
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:50,444
Yeah, it's probably
something else

1079
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,077
they stole from your museum
and threw in there.

1080
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:53,977
This is real!

1081
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,378
It's a big...!

1082
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:00,910
You want to see it, you're going
to have to bring Hodgins up.

1083
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,311
Please.

1084
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,744
He's down there
because he believes.

1085
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,177
He's no different than you,

1086
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:10,011
no different
than your brother.

1087
00:41:10,077 --> 00:41:11,277
Bring him up.

1088
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:14,044
Do it for your brother.

1089
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:30,677
An original Breen 984
half doubloon,

1090
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:33,744
designed by Ephraim Brasher,
engraved by Ephraim Brasher,

1091
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,744
and, hold your breath,
gentlemen and ladies,

1092
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,577
204 grains.

1093
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:40,510
A real, gold, pirate coin.

1094
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:42,710
How many more
are down there?

1095
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:44,344
Branson Rose has agreed to have
the museum do the authentication

1096
00:41:44,411 --> 00:41:45,944
of the entire treasure
when they bring it up.

1097
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:47,378
There won't
be any more.

1098
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:48,643
What makes you
say that?

1099
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,277
I was down there.

1100
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:52,244
It's not gonna
give it up that easily.

1101
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:54,044
But the treasure's
been located.

1102
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,344
And I'm sure
it's been located before.

1103
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:57,111
I'll take that.

1104
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,944
You think he's happy
to be back home?

1105
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:06,077
Well, he looks that way to me.

1106
00:42:08,877 --> 00:42:12,444
Hah.

1107
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,077
He's not happy.

1108
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:15,144
What do you mean?

1109
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:16,378
Hodgins is right.

1110
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:17,844
He'd be a lot happier

1111
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,011
at the bottom
of that shaft.

1112
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:20,244
With the other pirates.

1113
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:23,877
Arr!

1114
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,277
Arr, matey!

1115
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,543
Arr! Arr, matey!

1116
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:36,044
