1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,190
I never get used to its magnitude,
what it's taken to keep this country free.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,832
All societies build monuments to their dead
to convince combatants it's an honour to die.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,717
For these servicemen, it was.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,635
And for somebody to use this place
to protest the warjust pisses me off.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,678
These lives gave them that right.
They should be respected.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,558
If they were respected, fewer'd be buried here.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,029
- We gonna get into something?
- I don't see why.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,556
We both wish this place were a lot smaller.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,269
Agent Booth, Dr Brennan, right this way.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,712
Must've happened in the middle of the night.
The place is so big no one saw the fire.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,918
- The accelerant was charcoal starter.
- We didn't find a suicide note.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,994
- A protester would leave a note.
- Didrt need to. It's on Charlie Kent's grave.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,437
Press was coming today to do a tribute
to him. One-year anniversary of his death.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,988
- Charlie Kent?
- In the National Guard.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,152
About to be drafted by the NBA
when he got shipped out to Iraq.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,951
He gave his life killing a group of insurgents
to save his unit. Won the Silver Star.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,952
It's male, African descent,

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,512
approximately 20 to 29 years old.
Too early to determine cause of death.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,435
- I'm not a pro, but I'm guessing fire.
- The White House and DOD want an ID ASAP.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,637
- So they can brand him a traitor.
- Why so cynical?

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,757
I'm not. It's a necessary part
of the psychology of warfare.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,197
Heroes and villains. Without clear
distinctions, we'd never be able to fight.

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,353
Well, I always found being shot at
is a motivating factor.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,993
Bag these fragments of his clothing. I also
want any singed plant life or debris you find.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,071
<i>(Zack)</i> I'm on it.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,995
What?

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,877
It's Jamie Richards.

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,520
We were in the Rangers together.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,390
He was hit by a roadside bomb
just... outside the green zone.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,593
He left a... wife and two kids.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,475
- The fact that he was near this...
- You believe somehow he's here watching?

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,154
Yeah. You don't. I get that.

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,435
I know you think he's a good man. That's...

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,511
That's enough for me.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,238
Zack, I want pictures of all remaining tissue
before he's moved.

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,996
<i>(reporter) The unidentified suicide victim</i>
<i>was found at Private Kent's grave today.</i>

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,949
<i>Services had been planned to honour Kent on</i>
<i>the one-year anniversary of his death in Iraq.</i>

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,396
Ah, I used to love watching Kent play.
He could fly.

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,597
He made 46.4% of his three-point attempts
in his last season.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,992
- A basketball fan? I'm surprised.
- Zack, I'd like you to keep cleaning the bones.

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,914
Did you see the game against North Carolina?
53 points <i>and</i> 18 rebounds.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,116
Zack!

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,875
- Sorry. Cleaning.
- It's difficult knowing he'll never play again.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,238
- It makes the war so real.
- Which is odd, since fiction got us there.

45
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,475
- Shouldrt we stand up to tyrants?
- I've waited for the press to do it for 3 years.

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,597
- I can't believe you took the bait.
- Yeah. Me neither.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,432
<i>(ringing)</i>

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,230
Oh! Press Office of Defence.
Please ID him. This is the third call in an hour.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,190
Hello? Yes. It's a pleasure to hear
from you again, sir. Yes. We're very close.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,991
I fed his dentals, approximate age, height
and sketch I made from the tissue markers

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,071
into the DOD database.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,790
The victim had lamb about an hour before
his death. Of course it's overcooked now.

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,509
- Toasted himself. Who cares what he ate?
- Just doing ourjobs, Booth.

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,195
- Been told to sweep this under the rug?
- Can the left-wing conspiracy.

55
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,352
- Probably one of your nut-ball friends.
- Don't think so.

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,513
Fabric at the scene was cotton
with synthetic polymers - dye, olive green.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,037
This dude was wearing a military uniform.
He's one of yours, not mine.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,635
<i>(Angela)</i> OK. His name is Devon Marshall.

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,315
- He served in the Guard with Kent.
- What?

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,392
He was there in Mosul,
the night Kent was killed.

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,996
- He was protesting?
- Marshall could've had a change of heart.

62
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,198
Or it was survivor guilt.
The guy who saved his life didn't make it.

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,555
You can't imagine what that's like.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,875
I don't think so. There's evidence of damage
on the auditory meatus. Here and here.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,394
I'm sorry, but I left my phrase book at home.

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,711
The opening where the auditory nerves
feed into the brain.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,916
- So we're talking ear hole?
- Yes!

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,835
- They simplify these words for a reason.
- Something was jabbed into his ear.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,036
OK, that's clear. But why?

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,069
There's scrapings in the cranium, and marks
on the inside of the parietal and occipital.

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,789
Whatever was used
was pushed completely through his skull.

72
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,839
They then set the fire so there'd be no tissue
to see what had been done.

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,439
Exactly. Devon Marshall didn't die in the fire.
He was murdered first.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,116
Marshall was against the war. He'd look like
a protester so no one would expect murder.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,796
As far as anyone knows, this is still a suicide.
I want the killer to think he got away with it.

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,677
He's smart. I want the edge.

77
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,676
OK, Zack, magnify the marks on the cranium.
Call if you match them to any kind of weapon.

78
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,231
I'm just asking his mother questions. You
could've stayed back, played with your bones.

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,472
- I know. Just wanted to keep you company.
- Company?

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,076
- Yeah. I'm trying to be more sociable.
- Lousy liar.

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,996
I just think inside you're still military, Booth.
You might be too close to this one.

82
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,629
- I just want to make sure you stay objective.
- I know how to do my job.

83
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,669
- I was doing itjust fine long before I met you.
- You're angry.

84
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,276
Because I have people with opinions on war
who don't know what they're talking about!

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,512
I've been in Sudan, Rwanda. For two months,
I sifted through the wreckage of 9/11

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,591
helping the families of the victims.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,800
All I'm saying is that this is just another case.
That's all. It's just another case.

88
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,634
- You're not such a great liar yourself.
<i>- (sighs)</i>

89
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,995
I'm your partner.

90
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,435
Let me be your partner.

91
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,677
Did he have any troubles since he came back?
Any personal problems?

92
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,391
Some days...

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,231
I didn't know him.
He used to be very outgoing, happy.

94
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,393
But since he came back, all he did
was spend time with his little sister -

95
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,789
take her to school, help with her homework.

96
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,228
He said his job now was keeping me safe,
but most of the time I was taking care of him.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,275
It was like he was scared all the time.

98
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,434
Did he, uh... did he talk, you know,
to anyone else that he served with?

99
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,073
Just Jimmy. He talked to him
when Jimmy wasrt in the hospital. The VA.

100
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,278
When he was over there
he really believed in what he was doing.

101
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,151
He wrote us all the time saying
how good he felt seeing the people free.

102
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,519
Voting. Because he remembered
when his grandpa was a young man...

103
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,353
he didn't have the right to vote.

104
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,955
When can I have my son back?
When can I lay him to rest?

105
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,150
Soon, Mrs Marshall. We just want
to make sure we have all the facts.

106
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,311
I know it's his sister, but it's odd for a man
to spend so much time with a 13-year-old.

107
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,996
It's still all over you. You want to be
around something pure, innocent.

108
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,119
Adults want you to relive it. They want
war stories like they're entertainment.

109
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,910
If they hear you survived, then maybe
war isn't so bad - John Wayne syndrome.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,310
- You gonna trash the Duke?
- You kidding? I love the Duke.

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,154
- I wouldn't have guessed, "little lady".
- Remember <i>Stagecoach?</i>

112
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,028
"Courage is being scared to death,
but saddling up anyway."

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,318
- Was that the Duke? It was like Jerry Lewis.
- Was not.

114
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,920
Just a couple of quick questions, Jimmy.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,629
<i>(stammering)</i> I... I... I can't...
I can't talk about Devon now, man.

116
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,317
- Leave him alone. He's got enough troubles.
- I understand. OK? It's...

117
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,359
Readjusting takes time.
It's different for every one of us.

118
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,715
It sure as hell was different for Devon.

119
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,078
He's gone, man. Son of a bitch
should've never checked out on me like that.

120
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,278
That's when Jimmy came back in here -
when he heard about Devon.

121
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,435
- He was doing pretty good before that.
- I can't hold ajob or provide for my family.

122
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,230
- Did you and Devon ever argue?
- We stuck together. It's what it was all about.

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,788
Devon would call
and Jimmy would go meet him.

124
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,236
Middle of dinner, playing with Sarah,
it didn't matter.

125
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,117
He needed me, Karen.

126
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,274
Man, you know what it's like when you return.
You got no one but the guys you served with.

127
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,749
You and Devon
would visit Corporal Kent's grave site?

128
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,389
It never should've happened like that.
Not to Kent.

129
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,597
We would go and tell him that we were sorry.

130
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,195
- We needed him to know.
- I understand.

131
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,556
I don't. How did it happen, Jimmy?

132
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,154
It doesn't matter, Bones.

133
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,356
- But, Booth...
- We'll see you later, OK?

134
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,479
At home. He'll be at home next time
with me and the kids.

135
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,632
- Right, Jimmy?
- <i>(whispers)</i> Yeah.

136
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,714
- Jimmy didn't kill him.
- Now you're a mind reader.

137
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,395
- Maybe. Want me to guess your weight?
- You do and you could lose a tooth.

138
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,268
Stay objective. Jimmy was one of
the last people to see Devon alive.

139
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,635
Jimmy could've killed him.

140
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,236
- I thought you didn't like speculation.
- I don't. That's why I took this.

141
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,030
Cigarette butt. See if we can pull any DNA
from it, match it to anything he left on Devon.

142
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,955
- You got what you need. Why give me grief?
- Because you could've been tougher in there.

143
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,873
- I'm tough.
- Most of the time.

144
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,519
- Do you always have to get the last word in?
- I like to. Yeah.

145
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,032
Booth! Son of a bitch.

146
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,716
- Hank, hey! How the hell are you, man?
- Great. I just got some new wheels.

147
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,633
Sweet ride. Hank Latrell,
Dr Temperance Brennan.

148
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,870
- Oh, the bone lady.
- That's me.

149
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,032
Booth and I were in the same unit in Kosovo.

150
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,669
You gotta come over for dinner.
The kids keep asking about you.

151
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,914
- I'd love to. I'll call. We'll make it a date.
- Great. I gotta roll. I gotta be in court at three.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,560
- They can't start without the judge.
- I'll call.

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,030
Hey, call me or I'm gonna kick your ass.

154
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,429
<i>(sighs)</i>

155
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,512
- What happened to him?
- He got hurt.

156
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,233
There are signs of additional damage on C1
at the base of the skull.

157
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,232
This couldn't have come from
the assault in the cranium.

158
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,836
- Booth went through something over there.
- So I'm not supposed to tell the truth?

159
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,911
Truth? It's opinion, Jack.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,639
Looks like a dimple in the bone.
Could be genetic.

161
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,192
- There were no WMDs. That's the truth.
- All intelligence agencies thought there were.

162
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,511
We should magnify the area
to see what else caused it.

163
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,559
- Are you defending what's going on?
- No. Mistakes were made... obviously.

164
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,234
Yeah. Like establishing military bases there,

165
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,359
instead of investing a fraction
of what this war cost into alternative energy.

166
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,795
- Nothing is that simple.
- To me it is!

167
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,839
- We're ruled by the corporate oligarchy.
- There's also discolouration.

168
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,515
- You should do scrapings.
- Wanna make the world a better place?

169
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,199
Shut your yap long enough to hear something
other than the sound of your own voice.

170
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,396
Hey, where are you going?

171
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,391
The scrapings? Huh?

172
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,630
Oh, yeah.

173
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,756
I thought we were having a good time.

174
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,596
A pleasure. You've helped us with casualties
we never thought we'd be able to ID.

175
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,319
- Someday I won't be needed.
- That's what we hope.

176
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,393
Captain Fuller, give Agent Booth
and Dr Brennan all the help they need.

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,471
Please.

178
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,712
So, this is your third tour in Iraq, Captain?

179
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,349
Yes. A National Guard unit
can be difficult to lead.

180
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,798
Nothing against the Guard, but usually they're
inexperienced, short-changed on equipment.

181
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,952
But Kent's unit,
they were one of the best I ever had.

182
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,510
- And Devon Marshall?
- Marshall was a good soldier.

183
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,310
But after he came back, he seemed to turn
against the military. Saw us as the problem.

184
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,678
- You must've known men like that.
- Some people just aren't cut out for it.

185
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,231
- Like Jimmy Martin.
- He's had troubles, but he still supports us.

186
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,552
Marshall and Jimmy seemed like
they had trouble getting over Kent's death.

187
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,111
Any idea why it was so tough for them?
Tougher than usual?

188
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,471
We were on a patrol in Mosul.

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,638
Intel reports indicated there were insurgents
there. We were canvassing the area.

190
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,113
<i>Private Campbell stayed in the Humvee as</i>
<i>the unit headed to a small house up the street.</i>

191
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,399
<i>There were five of us:</i>
<i>Kent, Marshall, Martin, Leferts, myself.</i>

192
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,869
<i>It was a small house, two rooms.</i>

193
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,431
<i>I looked through a slat and saw three</i>
<i>insurgents in the back room. One a woman.</i>

194
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,514
<i>The men had AK-47s. I sent Kent and Leferts</i>
<i>to cover the back so no one could run.</i>

195
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,718
<i>I was getting the others into position</i>
<i>when one insurgent must've spotted Kent.</i>

196
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,360
<i>I heard the pop-pop-pop of the enemy AK-47.</i>

197
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,228
<i>Kent made entry to take them out</i>
<i>before they could get to the rest of us.</i>

198
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,437
<i>Leferts followed 'em in</i>
<i>while we kicked in the front door.</i>

199
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,913
<i>When we got to them, Kent had already</i>
<i>been killed taking out the insurgents.</i>

200
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,472
<i>A sight like that stays with you. For two</i>
<i>part-timers like that, I guess it was too much.</i>

201
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,116
But whatever Marshall was trying to do
desecrating Kent's grave, Kent saved the unit.

202
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,714
Marshall can't take that away.

203
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,875
Devon Marshall was murdered, Captain.

204
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,712
God.

205
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,032
- Any bad blood between him and Martin?
- Not that I know of.

206
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,271
We only have the after-action summary
of the incident.

207
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,876
I'd like to have the full report,
Kent's autopsy, the photos of the scene,

208
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,474
and any other evidence that exists.

209
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,756
You'll have whatever you need.

210
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,677
- I thought we'd keep the murder to ourselves.
- He's a commander. A decorated officer.

211
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,311
- And a soldier wouldn't kill someone?
- Now it's yourjob to question their motives?

212
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,472
No. It's my job to solve a murder.
Yours, too.

213
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,473
Treat him like you would anyone else
involved in an investigation.

214
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,755
You're not in the military any more.

215
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,799
I will find out who killed Devon Marshall.
That's all you need to know.

216
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,559
- How's Booth doing?
- He's angry. I think I said some things.

217
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,598
- Sweetie...
- He wasrt being objective.

218
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,319
I just had to get him to focus.

219
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,119
- You have to think before you speak.
- Why?

220
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,998
I can say anything to you
without thinking first.

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,232
Men aren't like us.
They're much more fragile and needy.

222
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,835
The fact they think <i>we're</i> needy
is a testament to our superiority.

223
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,150
Yeah. I guess I forgot.

224
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,233
Dr Brennan, the military delivered
all the paperwork you requested.

225
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,357
Kent's autopsy report
is careless and incomplete.

226
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,230
There was no incision, no x-rays so no way to
confirm the amount of bullets he was hit with.

227
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,314
The ME marked seven entry points, but
the report says there were only six bullets.

228
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,073
I could've done better with a Crayola.

229
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,877
Medical records are done on the fly
in combat situation, not falsified.

230
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,155
Booth, the report is a mess.

231
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,836
Ange, input these photos and
enance them for as much detail as possible.

232
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,356
No flesh from Marshall's ear.
I sent anything useful to Pathology

233
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,672
to see if they can match anything
with the DNA from Jimmy Martirs cigarette.

234
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,197
- Were you really mad before?
- Why? Because of your paranoid ramblings?

235
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,990
I'm guessing mad. Fair enough.
Can I at least give you some material to read?

236
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,868
You could try,
but you'd walk funny for a week.

237
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,509
I'd better work on these scrapings for Zack.

238
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,833
This is a murder. We know Devon would
visit Kent's grave, Jimmy said to apologise.

239
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,519
He knew something about Kent, Booth.
Something these reports will never tell us.

240
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,636
So what do you want to do?

241
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,314
- I want to exhume Charles Kent.
- Exhume a war hero?

242
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,837
- Do you have any idea what you're asking?
- It's the only way to know what happened.

243
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,309
- The report.
- Which is sloppy and incomplete.

244
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,756
He is supposed to be honoured this week,
not humiliated.

245
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,389
Doesrt Devon Marshall deserve
as much respect and honour as Kent?

246
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,429
- I'm sorry, Bones. I can't let you do this.
- I'm not asking for your permission, Booth.

247
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,514
I can get the court order on my own.
I was just kind of hoping for your support.

248
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,478
- Agent Booth, I'm Tina Kent.
- Listen, ma'am. I'm very sor...

249
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,475
It's a Silver Star.

250
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,236
- I know how much you hate this, Booth.
- Let's just get it over with, all right?

251
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,633
OK, I want a full set of x-rays
and a clear picture of all fracture patterns.

252
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,076
And a tox screen and analysis
of any particulates in the wounds.

253
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,631
- DOD wants it done fast and out of the press.
- It will take the time it takes to do properly.

254
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,871
Run scenarios on angles
and the entry order of the shots.

255
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,270
Yeah. I should be able to give you something.

256
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,674
I know we don't see eye to eye on a lot cos
politically we live in an Orwellian nightmare...

257
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,558
What... what are you trying to say?

258
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,109
Just... I'm sorry, man.

259
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,191
I really am.

260
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,317
I'll need x-rays of L1 through 4
and the left scapula.

261
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,635
- He's just a kid.
- Anthropologists theorise that wars break out

262
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,397
when there's an increase in the population
of unmarried men under the age of 25.

263
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,992
I'm sorry. I need to create a distance from
the victim. It's how I deal. I... I didn't mean...

264
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,154
Just, you know, do what you have to do.
I'm gonna go do my thing.

265
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,873
I should've been with Kent, man.
Maybe I could've shielded him, you know?

266
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,748
But the captain,
he put me and Devon on the front door.

267
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,435
By the time we got to Kent, it was too late.

268
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,196
- What did you see from where you were?
- Oh, no. I don't need to go through that again.

269
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,718
- The captain told you. You read the report.
- Come on, Jimmy. Please.

270
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,997
This is for Kent and Devon.

271
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,398
It was the first action we saw.
Man, nobody was ready.

272
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,791
We were outside the front door
sweating in the heat, just waiting.

273
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,989
- What's the first thing you heard?
- First? The pop-pop-pop from the enemy AK.

274
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,991
And all hell broke loose.

275
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,199
<i>We broke down the door and made entry.</i>

276
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,717
<i>Those people, the Iraqi ones, they were</i>
<i>already dead when we got to the back room.</i>

277
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,873
<i>Kent, too.</i>
<i>Leferts standing over him all freaked.</i>

278
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,636
<i>We were all freaked, man.</i>
<i>These were real people, you know?</i>

279
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,156
- Did you see them firing on Kent?
- No. But like I said,

280
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,471
it took time to kick in the door
and push through to the back room.

281
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,949
If I'd got there faster, I...

282
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,879
There was nothing I could do, you know?
I swear.

283
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,792
- Six of the bullets are still in the remains.
- I need to see which entries were fatal.

284
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,078
- Anything more on Devon Marshall?
- Still working on the dimple on his neck.

285
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,597
Set up a trace
so we can start extracting the bullets.

286
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,552
Find anything in the wounds that might have
changed the trajectory of the bullets?

287
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,191
Not yet. Just residual sesquioxide
and silica accumulation.

288
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,319
A little decayed organic matter.
Probably food that was on the floor. So...

289
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,868
- Thank you.
- Look, Angela...

290
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,354
I run on sometimes, I know. I guess I think if
I yell loud enough maybe someone will listen.

291
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,876
You have to be careful people don't go deaf.

292
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,234
<i>(sighs)</i>

293
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,556
You know, what you did for Booth before -
showing him you understood - that was good.

294
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,712
<i>Everyone</i> hears something like that.

295
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,791
I joined the Guard
cos they helped pay for medical school.

296
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,670
All my life I wanted to be a doctor.
It's all I ever wanted.

297
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,877
I never thought I'd get sent overseas,
much less Iraq.

298
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,918
Your service record is exemplary.

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,275
I survived.

300
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,633
That's my achievement.

301
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,593
I'm sorry to do this, Miss Campbell. I'm just
trying to reconstruct the night of the firefight.

302
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,150
I was parked in the alley.

303
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,275
The captain told me to stay in the Humvee.
Women can't engage in direct combat.

304
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,148
<i>He took the unit to the house.</i>

305
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,800
<i>The street was quiet. I was waiting.</i>

306
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,111
Then I heard the pop-pop-pop of the AK-47.

307
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,273
Then Kent and Leferts firing. The captain
and the others breaking down the door.

308
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,237
Then everything stopped.

309
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,630
<i>It went quiet again. Then the captain</i>
<i>came back, told me Kent had been hit.</i>

310
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,909
<i>He knew I was a med student, so he sent me in</i>
<i>while he radioed for a medevac.</i>

311
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,516
<i>As an intern,</i>
<i>I've seen a lot of horrible things.</i>

312
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,073
But when it's your friend...
someone you serve with...

313
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,476
Yeah.

314
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,917
Been in the Guard for years. Didrt think
I'd ever get called up again. I mean, I'm 45.

315
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,309
There's just not enough men for this mess.

316
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,393
Look, Mr Leferts, if we could just...

317
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,912
We were 22 hours

318
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,116
into a 12-hour detail.

319
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,593
You try that when it's 110 degrees out.

320
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,992
<i>(sighs)</i>

321
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,959
They called me Dad
because I was the old guy.

322
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,432
<i>Kent was the kid.</i>
<i>Captain sent us around back.</i>

323
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,275
<i>I was supposed to look out for him.</i>
<i>It got like I really was the damn kid's father.</i>

324
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,477
Kent was gung ho, you know?

325
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,472
Would've fought the whole damn war himself.

326
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,517
So, he sees something move inside.

327
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,036
<i>Something shines off the light.</i>
<i>A barrel, he says.</i>

328
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,478
Then we hear people moving around,
somebody coming towards us from inside.

329
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,833
- Then somebody fires.
- What did it sound like? The shots.

330
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,150
It was like a pop-pop-pop.

331
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,916
<i>Then Kent rushes in, sees the first guy.</i>
<i>Blows him away.</i>

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,390
He wasrt supposed to go in by himself,
so I rush in.

333
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,270
I take out the last guy, and then it all stops.

334
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,557
<i>And when it does, Kent is lying there.</i>

335
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,073
I can't believe it!
I'm... I'm... I'm staring down at Kent.

336
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,154
<i>And then the others,</i>
<i>they ask, "What happened, Dad?"</i>

337
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,674
<i>"Dad, what happened?"</i>

338
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,398
And I'm staring down at Kent
like he really is my kid.

339
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,071
I'm a lawyer!

340
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,160
A damn lawyer.

341
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,314
I shouldn't have been there.
None of us should've been there.

342
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,750
- Their stories don't line up.
- You said the events seem consistent.

343
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,549
Exactly. We got a group of traumatised
soldiers who all say the same words

344
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,438
to describe the first shots: "pop-pop-pop".

345
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,511
It was rehearsed.

346
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,112
- They're hiding something.
- That makes sense.

347
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,598
- There's something Devon knew about.
- And someone else didn't want to get out.

348
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,435
- That's all of them.
- The way the blood pooled round the bullets,

349
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,034
these three were the ones that killed him.

350
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,078
These rounds aren't from an AK-47.
These are.

351
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,835
They didn't kill him. Circulation
had stopped when these bullets hit.

352
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:21,075
Wait. The ones that killed him are from
an M...14. Those are from our weapons.

353
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,717
- Friendly fire.
- Oh, God.

354
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,475
- Booth...
- You know what? Let's find out who did this.

355
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,873
Not all personnel carry the same weapons.
We have to find out who was issued the M-14.

356
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,274
- Leferts was the only one issued an M-14.
- So Kent runs in firing.

357
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,993
The insurgents fire back. Leferts follows Kent
in. Leferts is shooting and he kills Kent.

358
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,596
Devon wanted to tell the truth but
Leferts has a legal practice - too much to lose.

359
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,955
Leferts kills Devon.

360
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,031
Son of a...

361
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,473
"I shot Kent that night. I'm sorry."

362
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,792
"I didn't mean to,
but I can't live with it any more."

363
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,589
His assistant says he was out of town
the night Devon Marshall died.

364
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,148
He couldn't have killed him.

365
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,471
The murderer's still out there, Booth.

366
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,559
Devon Marshall was too badly burned.

367
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,792
Hodgins couldn't get enough usable tissue
to match the DNA from Martirs cigarette.

368
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,476
And the one person who had a motive killed
himself but he couldn't have killed Marshall.

369
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,873
- ME confirmed suicide?
- Yeah. Plus no one was in or out of the office.

370
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,557
- He definitely killed himself.
- But we still have no idea who killed Devon.

371
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,598
<i>(knocks at door)</i> Agent Booth?

372
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,671
Mr Kent.

373
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,070
- This is Dr Brennan.
- I know.

374
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,799
I'm sorry I exhumed your son, sir.
But we needed...

375
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,273
No, please. Thank you.
It's important for us to find out how he died.

376
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,550
- Do you want to sit?
- No. I just wanted to ask.

377
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,349
There's conflicting stories.
Now the captain says he can't talk to us.

378
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,238
I just wanted to ask you to find the truth.

379
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,598
My wife and I can't live
not knowing what happened to Charlie.

380
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,636
We need the truth.

381
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,391
Of course.

382
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,270
- I can't talk to the family. This is ongoing.
- Convenient.

383
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,557
Bones!
You had no idea this was friendly fire?

384
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,589
- If I had, I would've reported it.
- There are inconsistencies in the report.

385
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,468
You're good at yourjob, but
you don't know the first thing about combat.

386
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,758
We were taking fire. One of my men
was killed. The area wasrt secured.

387
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,674
Do you think I count bullets
and draw pictures? You've been through it.

388
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,039
Does it ever go the way you want it to?
Is it ever the way it should be in combat?

389
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,715
We have to ask these questions.
It's a murder investigation.

390
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,951
And I'll cooperate.
I don't want more of my men to die either.

391
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,838
Now, if there's nothing else...

392
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,477
Got something. A splinter pattern.

393
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,791
Wood particles blew back
into an exit wound from the AK-47s.

394
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,279
The missing bullet.

395
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,909
He wasrt near wood when shot.
He was in the middle of the room.

396
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,595
- No. He was on the floor.
- Someone stood over him

397
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,037
and squeezed off some rounds from an AK-47
after he was already dead.

398
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,430
The missing round passed through him
and into the wood floor.

399
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,640
But all the insurgents had already been killed.
They were the only ones with AK-47s.

400
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,316
I hate to say "conspiracy",
but, my peeps, we've got a conspiracy.

401
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,872
Someone covered up the incident by making
it look like he was killed by insurgents.

402
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,918
Angela, enance all pictures of the aftermath

403
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,913
so we can see body positions,
bullet holes, damage to the house.

404
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,912
I want to reconstruct
what happened that night.

405
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,638
Look at us. You with a badge, me
in the courtroom, both trying to find justice.

406
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,280
- That's why we fought.
- That's what they told us.

407
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,352
- You don't believe it?
- Sure I do.

408
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,549
You don't look like <i>you</i> do.

409
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,872
- You're not gambling again, are you?
- No, man. Nah, I've been good.

410
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,431
I've been going to my meetings.
I haven't even played a game of Monopoly.

411
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,229
Hey, listen, Hank. I have this case.

412
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,311
Charles Kent.

413
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,431
- It's a friendly-fire.
- God.

414
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,914
Yeah. Covered up. Two other members
of the squad are dead. One murdered.

415
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,833
Whatever went down
must've been pretty ugly.

416
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,671
You know, Hank...

417
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,113
You know what we did?

418
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,589
- Don't go there, Booth.
- Was it won'th it? I mean, look at you.

419
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,070
You saved my life.
I got a great family because of you.

420
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,075
- Yeah, but why was it always a secret?
- We were given a choice.

421
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,119
- They always gave us a choice.
- Yeah, but that last time...

422
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,278
Well, you knew what was at stake.

423
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,510
Yeah... Yeah.

424
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,950
You never talked to anybody about it?

425
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,116
You've got to.

426
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,193
- How about your girlfriend? That doctor?
- No, she's just my partner.

427
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,229
- You know, look, I got work. I should go.
- Sure.

428
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,599
- We're on for Sunday dinner, right?
- Yeah. See you Sunday. Bye.

429
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,675
<i>(Bones)</i> I want to see all the walls.
Can you scan them for bullet holes?

430
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,673
Single out the ones
that came from Leferts' weapon.

431
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,399
This is hard for Booth. He's idealistic.

432
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,950
It's nice to know somebody
that wants to keep honour alive.

433
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,838
I feel like Booth thinks
I'm taking that away from him.

434
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:26,076
OK, it says, "Insurgent A opened fire
when he saw Kent. And Kent took him out."

435
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,151
Let's see A again?

436
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,395
- You're just doing yourjob. He knows that.
- I guess.

437
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,870
- Magnify his hands.
- What are you looking for?

438
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,954
His hands are splayed like he was shielding
himself from the rounds coming at him.

439
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,828
Cadaveric spasm -
the muscles became rigid when he died.

440
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,037
- He might not have held that weapon.
- What do you mean?

441
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,190
Show me insurgent B.

442
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,231
I tell Booth we're on the same side.
I'm not disillusioning him. It's my findings.

443
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,914
But when I look at him, I...

444
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,788
- <i>(sighs)</i> I don't know what else I can do.
- I do.

445
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,629
- Ange.
- As a friend, Brennan.

446
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,316
Yeah. That whole "friends with benefits"
thing, that's not happening.

447
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,315
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about being there for him.

448
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,712
Knowing when a simple touch is enough.

449
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,798
Maybe I could write him a note.
I can be very articulate on paper.

450
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,472
Zoom in.

451
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,829
OK, magnify the blood smear.

452
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,115
Well, you can see by the smear he was
moved, turned, that gun placed next to him.

453
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,389
- OK, show me C.
- OK, this is the third insurgent woman,

454
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,790
about 40, holding
the unexploded grenade in her hand.

455
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,916
Magnify her torso.

456
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,838
<i>(Angela)</i> Wait, she's lying on a dinner plate.

457
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,630
And the serving spoon is next to her.
She'd been holding it when she was shot.

458
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,632
- And a grenade?
- Found anything yet?

459
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,315
Yeah. None of these people were armed
when Kent went in there.

460
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,154
All of the weapons
were planted on them after they died.

461
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,630
Fuller's unit killed an unarmed family.

462
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,998
- Kent shot unarmed people?
- They look like a family.

463
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,071
About to sit down to dinner.

464
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,029
- Any other questionable operations?
- None. They did six months without incident.

465
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,997
How could it have happened?

466
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,312
The woman was going to the back door.
Kent maybe thought the spoon was a weapon.

467
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,188
- A spoon?
- It's dark. It happens. He's inexperienced.

468
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,238
He's scared. You only have an instant
to make a choice.

469
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,074
Kent probably thought
he was being attacked, so he burst in.

470
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,879
From the spray pattern,
he was shooting as he entered.

471
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,192
<i>He must've killed the woman first. The others</i>
<i>as they rushed to the woman to help.</i>

472
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,512
He probably thought they were attacking, too.
Leferts hears firing. He goes in.

473
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,151
<i>Kent turns, weapon still pointed.</i>
<i>Leferts shoots, killing Kent.</i>

474
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,276
- All happens in seconds.
- But if Kent turned to face him...

475
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,514
It doesn't matter. After all the shooting,
all Leferts sees is a weapon pointing at him.

476
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,751
- He just reacted.
- God.

477
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,355
So this was more than
a friendly-fire incident.

478
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,712
Hell of a lot more.

479
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,519
You son of a bitch!
You covered up the whole thing!

480
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,556
- Stand down!
- They were innocents!

481
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,158
- My report clearly states...
- We've taken it apart! We have facts, Captain!

482
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,711
- Your squad blew away a family of innocents!
- Kent! Kent did!

483
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,158
A kid so green he never should've been there.
Do you know what that town was like?

484
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,360
Our guys were getting blown up every day
while we tried to build hospitals and schools.

485
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,958
A mistake was made. No one likes it.
But you know what happens.

486
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,795
If it got out what we did, that neighbourhood,
the whole damn city would've exploded.

487
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,555
What would you have done?
Would you have let the city burn?

488
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,995
This can't come out, Agent Booth.

489
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,073
Don't make this any harder
with an ugly story like this.

490
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,994
I don't know what you're fighting for, Fuller,
but it sure wasrt my country.

491
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,198
- We'll start with obstruction ofjustice.
- You have no jurisdiction here.

492
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,714
But <i>we</i> do, Captain.

493
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,155
We're cooperating fully with Agent Booth.

494
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,189
You will not disgrace us, Captain.
You will be held accountable.

495
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,070
<i>(Booth)</i> Marshall's killer is still free.

496
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,994
Fuller placed weapons on the Iraqis,
pressured the others to be quiet,

497
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,629
but he still has an alibi
for the night of Marshall's murder.

498
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,518
Zack found discolouration
on Devors vertebrae.

499
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,798
It's caused by residue left from pethidene,
an opiate known as Demerol.

500
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,194
Someone jabbed a syringe into his neck,
creating the indentation in the bone.

501
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,912
He was made unconscious, so the instrument
was placed into his ear without a struggle.

502
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,552
- A nine-inch surgical curette like this.
- It's someone with access to tools and drugs.

503
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,359
Someone the army sent to medical school.

504
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,391
All done.

505
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,749
He was gonna tell.

506
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,797
I...

507
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,148
It's like the war was still going on.
I was just trying to survive.

508
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,269
<i>(officer)</i> Forward march!

509
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,275
My boy was just trying to do the right thing.

510
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,273
Thank you for letting people see that.

511
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,156
You can be proud of him.

512
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,118
- I would never have expected to see that.
- Well, people will always surprise you.

513
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,476
That hasn't always been my experience.

514
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,029
I've done some things.

515
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,674
- I know.
- No. You don't.

516
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,310
But it's OK.

517
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,269
Well, not... not as a secret. It's not.

518
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,798
I have to be, uh, honest... about myself.

519
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,838
I have to be able to tell someone.

520
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,990
You will in time, Booth.

521
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,350
You will.

522
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,480
I was sent to Kosovo.

523
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,957
There was this Serb, General Radik,

524
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,433
who led a unit, who would go into villages
and, you know, destroy 'em.

525
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,311
Women, children, all... all killed because
he wanted to ethnically purify his country.

526
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,076
He'd done this twice before.
I mean, we had facts, proof.

527
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,792
232 people just erased.

528
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,434
I was the sniper...

529
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,074
sent in to stop him.

530
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,357
He was set to leave in a couple of hours.

531
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,951
It was his sors...

532
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,591
sors birthday.

533
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,395
A little boy...

534
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,358
maybe about six or seven.

535
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,877
I can still hear the music from the party, you
know? That song just playing in my head.

536
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,028
Nobody knew where the shot came from,
but they knew why it came.

537
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,918
They said I saved over 100 people.

538
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,958
But, you know, that little boy

539
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,797
who didn't know who his father was,
who just loved him,

540
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,311
he saw him die,

541
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,271
fall to the ground,

542
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,309
right in front of him.

543
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,238
That little boy
all covered in his daddy's blood...

544
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,874
was just changed forever.

545
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,276
<i>(sighs)</i> It's neverjust the one person
who dies, Bones. Never... never.

546
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,237
<i>(sniffs)</i>

547
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,439
You know, we all die a little bit, Bones.

548
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,557
With each shot, we all die a little bit.

549
