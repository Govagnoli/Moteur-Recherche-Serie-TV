1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,800
(grunts):
Do you have therapy today?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,900
It's not therapy.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,800
Well, you're seeing
a psychiatrist.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,600
Not for therapy.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,400
It's an official
evaluation, okay?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
Person who found the body
is in the living room.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,900
Great. Crime scene first, then
we talk to the witnesses.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,800
Corpse is going
to be in the den.
Thanks.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
What is that?
What's what?

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,600
Your tie,
it's staid.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,400
Staid?
Yeah, boring.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,500
It looks like J. Edgar
Hoover picked it out.

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,600
Look, it's something
I'm working on, okay?

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,500
In therapy?

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,400
Gordon-Gordon says that the,
you know, the wild socks

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,800
and the fancy ties
are all just, you know,
quiet rebellions

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,300
helping me suppress
other impulses.

18
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,500
Isn't that good?

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,200
You'd think so, right?

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
But you know, apparently,
all the other issues

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
have to just rise
to the top.

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,200
Why do you call
your psychiatrist
Gordon-Gordon?

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,500
Because that's how he
introduces himself, you know.

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
"Hi. I'm Gordon.
Gordon Wyatt."

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,600
Like James. James Bond.

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,200
Bond. James Bond.

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,700
Not James. Ja...
Jam... Whatever.

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
SAROYAN:
We're over here.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And you might want to tuck
your pants into your socks.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,300
The flies get in
everywhere.

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,000
What, no cartoon characters
on the socks?

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,100
Never had cartoon characters
on the socks.

33
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,600
They were just...
Um... Never mind, okay?

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,700
What do we got here?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
Three weeks decomp,
give or take.

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Ah, the place
was tossed, huh?

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,000
No forced entry.

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
The victim is probably
the man of the house:

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,100
Terence Bancroft.

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,800
His wife Clarissa
identified the watch
and wedding ring.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
This isn't good for me.

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,300
Yeah, it's pretty gross.

43
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,200
No, not that.

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,400
There's too much soft tissue
for me to tell anything.

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,700
In fact, why am I

46
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,000
here at all?
The Bancroft family asked for us specifically.

47
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,900
What, they got some kind
of pull?

48
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,600
The Bancroft Wing
at the Jeffersonian?

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,100
60 million bucks
will buy a lot
of goodwill.

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,300
BOOTH:
Typical.

51
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,800
This dried crust
here at the mouth.

52
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,300
When the jugular's cut,
the air mixes with venous blood

53
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
and the negative pressure
causes an air embolism.

54
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Death is very quick.

55
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,500
So just sit there
and stop complaining.

56
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Bound.
Multiple stab wounds.

57
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
We need photos of
these spatter patterns.

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,100
Bet this statue is worth
more than my house.

59
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
You know, you should ask your
therapist about your issues

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
with rich people.

61
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,000
You're in therapy?

62
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,200
He's seen the socks.

63
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
SAROYAN: The victim's
wife is in the kitchen.
(sighs)

64
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,000
I was, I was at
the vineyard
for a month.

65
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
And Terry was supposed

66
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,800
to be at his fishing camp
in Idaho,

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,700
so the house
was closed up.

68
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,300
And you didn't try to contact
him at all during that time?

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We spoke three weeks ago,

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,500
um, the day before
he was supposed to leave.

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,400
The cabin doesn't get
cell service.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,700
I heard the officers talking
about a possible home invasion?

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
Definite possibility.

74
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,400
Well, Terry supports
a youth center

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,300
on the other side
of the Anacostia River.

76
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,000
Rough neighborhood, tough kids.

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,700
I was always afraid to go there,

78
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,200
but he said it was because
I didn't really know them.

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah. Listen, I'd like you
to put a list

80
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
of things together

81
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,200
that might have gone missing,

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,100
and give me a call.

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
(whispers):
Okay.

84
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
The Bancroft case?

85
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,500
Yeah.

86
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Looks like a home-invasion
homicide, right?

87
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,100
Yes, I'm running
dental records now.

88
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,900
Cam is finishing up
the autopsy.

89
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,300
But Booth is pretty sure
it's Terry Bancroft?

90
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,900
Yes.

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
There was a lot
of insect activity.

92
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,400
Samples are
at your work station.

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,700
Also, the extension cord
used to tie him up

94
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,300
and everything that was
on top of his desk.

95
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,300
He was tied up?

96
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,400
His heart was perforated,

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
but there's no blood
in the thoracic cavity.

98
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,400
He was stabbed
after he was already dead.

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,300
What, what killed him?

100
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
His jugular was punctured.

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Multiple stabs
are congruent with killers jacked
on crystal meth

102
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
or just plain adrenaline.

103
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,500
Why kill him?

104
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
No sign of forced entry.
He probably knew his attackers.

105
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
(computer beeps)
We have a match.

106
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,500
Confirmed. Terence Bancroft.

107
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,200
He knew his killers.

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,100
Are you all right?

109
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Yes.

110
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,900
Yeah, absolutely.

111
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll get on insect analysis
right away.

112
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,800
Hodgy?

113
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah? Hey.

114
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Hi, good morning, Angela.

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,100
I have blood splatter
patterns on my computer,

116
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
if you need to match them
to anything you have here.

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Uh, yeah, thanks.
I'll come take
a look after

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
I get through
with the evidence
from the desk.

119
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,800
You okay?
Mm-hmm, yeah.

120
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,100
Yeah?

121
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,800
Want to have
lunch later?

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,300
Okay, yeah.

125
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,100
What? Do I get to play?

126
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,900
Uh, no, you will be cheering
and watching.

127
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,400
What fun is that?

128
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,400
I am a mad sagger.

129
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,000
I-I-I wear my shorts
very, very low.

130
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,700
You suck hugely
at being a girl.

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,900
Okay, okay,
anthropology, anthropology.

132
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,700
Oh, okay, think of it
as a social ritual

133
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,600
in which I impress you
with my manly prowess

134
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
during a game
of basketball.

135
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
You want
to impress me?

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
I'm traditional that way.

137
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,600
Why don't you just
bonk me on the head
with a giant club?

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
I'd much prefer
you came to the game
and ogled my butt crack.

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,500
You know, it's law enforcement
versus public defenders;

140
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,700
guys with pony tails
and love handles.

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
We're heavily favored.

142
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,200
So?

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,800
Hi, Clarissa.

144
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,200
Jack... I...

145
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,500
you heard
about Terry?

146
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Can I come in?

147
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,200
Last time I saw you,
you didn't have a beard.

148
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Yeah, last time you saw me,
I couldn't grow a beard.

149
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm sorry about Terry.

150
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
It makes everything that
happened between us look...

151
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Meaningless.

152
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,900
At least a lot less
important than it
seemed at the time.

153
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
I got over
us, Clarissa.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Then how come it took Terry
getting murdered

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,300
for you to show up
at our door?

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,500
Where did you get this?

157
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,400
I work at the Jeffersonian
Institution.

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm on the case.

159
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,800
They showed up
with the evidence.

160
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,900
I don't understand.

161
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,300
Why are you bringing it to me?

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,600
If my bosses were aware

163
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
that I knew the victim
or his wife,

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,300
they'd remove me from
the investigation,

165
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,000
and I would really like to help
catch whatever son of a ...

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
murdered my friend.

167
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,600
So someone introduces us...

168
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,900
"Nice to meet you,
Ms. Bancroft.

169
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
"And you, too,

170
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Dr. Hodgins."

171
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,100
Got it.

172
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,400
Jack?

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,600
Terry and I were...

174
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,200
...having some marital problems,

175
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
but we were
getting through it.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
That's going to make me
a suspect, isn't it?

177
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,700
I can't talk about it, Clarissa.

178
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,200
<i>MAN:
Terry--</i>

179
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,400
man, we're really gonna miss
that guy around this place.

180
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,200
Foot the bill
for this place?

181
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh, you know, he was more
than a checkbook.

182
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,600
I mean, Terry, he took
a personal interest.

183
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,700
How personal?

184
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,700
Don't even go there,
man, all right?

185
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
Terry, he was one
of the good guys.

186
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,100
These kids are
pretty hardcore, huh?

187
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,800
Oh yeah, yeah, you know, drugs,
gangs, violence.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Any recent arguments
or incidents?

189
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,100
Well, apparently
the night before Terry was gonna

190
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,800
head up to his cabin,
he caught a kid with a couple pounds
of heroin.

191
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
A couple pounds?

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
The kid was a mule.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,300
Yeah, he was running deliveries
to Baltimore on the bus.

194
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Did you see
Bancroft

195
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,600
take the drugs from the kid?

196
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,100
No.

197
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,000
How about any of these kids,
did they see it?

198
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,000
Sure, yeah, you know,
until you ask 'em,

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
and then nobody saw nothing.

200
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Well, did Bancroft call
the police?

201
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Oh, man, come on. We did that,
no kid would ever

202
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,700
set foot back
in this place.

203
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Huh. Then what, huh?

204
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Flushed it down the toilet?

205
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,500
No, no, it's not
like that.

206
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,600
I mean, Terry,

207
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,100
he would always deliver
whatever he snagged to the cops.

208
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Otherwise, the supplier would
think they would get ripped off

209
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,600
and then the mule
ends up dead.

210
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,100
So this... is
Julio Diaz' locker.

211
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,300
Oh, blood on the kid's
sweatshirt.

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
No, no, Julio would never
kill anybody.

213
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
I mean, he might deliver drugs,
but he really liked Terry.

214
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Maybe Julio's supplier?

215
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,900
When was the last time
Julio was here?

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
The day Terry took the heroin.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,900
All right, look,
if it wasn't for Terry Bancroft,

218
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,500
this place wouldn't exist.

219
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,500
Come on. I need
one witness who saw Terry

220
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,900
take the dope from Julio Diaz.
Just one.

221
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Sorry, man.

222
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,400
MONTENEGRO:
What is not to like?

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,000
Go watch Sully play
basketball.

224
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
He still hasn't made
a move on me.

225
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,800
How many times
have you gone out?

226
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,300
Four or six,
depending on how
you define "go out."

227
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,900
Right. Bumping
into each other
at the diner

228
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
does not count
as going out.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Four.
There along the interior cervical
vertebrae.

230
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Is that shadow a glitch?

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
I don't do glitches.

232
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,400
Four, huh?

233
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,200
So the question is

234
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,500
is this Sully damaged goods

235
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,700
or is he just
very respectful?

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,300
Those are my choices?

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,500
Damaged goods, you run away,

238
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,800
very respectful,
you hang in.

239
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,100
I should just make
the first move.

240
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
No, Brennan!

241
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,300
For once can you just pretend
that you're the girl?

242
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,100
Why is everyone so anxious
for me to be a girl?

243
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,100
Listen, go to the basketball
game, let him show off for you,

244
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
and see what happens.

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
I don't know.
It sounds so passive.

246
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,100
Now you've got it.

247
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
<i>BOOTH:
You just don't get it.</i>

248
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,200
What?

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm asking for guy advice,

250
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,100
you are a guy.

251
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,800
What's not to get?
First of all,

252
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
guys, they don't ask for advice
and secondly,

253
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm not going to help you get
my partner into bed.
Why not?

254
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
It's not like you want her.

255
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,600
Unless...

256
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Do you want her?

257
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
Nah, come on, huh?
Bones is, you know...

258
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,200
she's my partner.
Oh...

259
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,600
That is why you need psychiatric
treatment, because you

260
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,000
have the hots
for your partner.

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm not in psychiatric
treatment.

262
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Okay? It's an evaluation.

263
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Big difference.

264
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
I can tell that Brennan
is the go-slow type,

265
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,000
but you gotta help
me out on how slow,

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
because too slow is
worse than not slow enough.

267
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Agent Booth?
Yeah?

268
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
District cops got a
kid matching your APB down at the morgue.

269
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,400
<i>MAN:
John Doe number120806, male,</i>

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
approximately
14 years old.

271
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,000
His body was found

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,100
under the Anacostia Bridge
on the sixth.

273
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,200
That was almost 20 days ago.

274
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,700
I-I-I think
that's Julio.

275
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,300
That's definitely his
gold chain, for sure.

276
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Cause of death?

277
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,700
Single gunshot wound
to the back of the head.

278
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,600
Execution style.

279
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah, if, uh...

280
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,200
if Terry hadn't gotten the drugs
to the cops,

281
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,799
the supplier would've
come after Julio.

282
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Terry Bancroft got killed
for that heroin.

283
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,100
Dr. Brennan saw a
shadow on the x-rays.

284
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
I removed the tissue
from the bones

285
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,000
and found a fungus.
Not odd.

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,700
If you were decomposing
for three weeks,

287
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
you'd probably work
up a fungus or two as well.

288
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
The interior cervical vertebrae.

289
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,600
Spell it out, bone-boy.

290
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,300
The jugular was cut

291
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,400
and the blood pooled here.

292
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,600
He was lying on his back
for several hours.

293
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
BOOTH:
Anything new?

294
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Yes.

295
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
The victim was killed

296
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,500
by the puncturing
of his jugular,

297
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,600
left lying there
for several hours,

298
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
then the murderer came back.

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
Forced the body into his chair.

300
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,500
And stabbed him
14 more times.

301
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,100
Oh, to make it look
like a home invasion.

302
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,500
The blood on Julio's
sweatshirt

303
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,600
found in the locker was
definitely Bancroft's.

304
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

305
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Bancroft confiscates
the kid's dope,

306
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,800
kid runs to the supplier,

307
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
they go to Bancroft's place,

308
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
scare him into telling
them where the dope
is, then kill him.

309
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,000
Only that doesn't scan.
I mean, why murder the kid?

310
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
'Cause he was there.
'Cause he cried.

311
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
'Cause he blew his nose
on a red hankie.

312
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
They don't need
much reason.
Well, I don't like it.

313
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,800
Doesn't mean it's not true.

314
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
<i>HODGINS:
Calliphora vomitoria.</i>

315
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,000
Prepupal stage
of the third instar.

316
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,200
Does that give us
a postmortem interval?

317
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,300
18.5 days.

318
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,600
Whoa, whoa, you can be that
accurate from flies?

319
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,300
DOJ Forensics has new
statistical models

320
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,300
of maggot growth to pinpoint
death within a six-hour window.

321
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Hmm. Then I was right.

322
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,000
About what?
Julio Diaz

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,300
was killed 20 days ago.

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
18.5 days ago is after

325
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
his body was found.

326
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,600
Then how did Bancroft's blood

327
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,100
get on Julio's sweatshirt?

328
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,200
Julio Diaz was dead
under that bridge.

329
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,400
????

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,600
Peanut! Peanut!

331
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,800
Sully's looking good.
Hot.

332
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,200
You know,
Scotty says Sully

333
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
won't shower
with the other guys.

334
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,400
That guy's got some
kind of an issue.

335
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,500
Guys only got one
kind of issue, girl.

336
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,400
Then I guess we know
why they call him Peanut.

337
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,600
Ah, in point of fact,
it is therapy.

338
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,800
What? No. No, it's not.
It's an evaluation.

339
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,300
No, I've already
certified you

340
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
as fit to carry a gun
and go back to work.

341
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay, then why
are we meeting?

342
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,700
Well, because you
discharged your weapon

343
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
at an ice cream truck.

344
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
My provisional certification

345
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
of your mental health
only holds

346
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
as long as you
continue to meet with me.

347
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Great. For how long?

348
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
Till I'm satisfied
that you won't start

349
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,300
firing at confectioners again.

350
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,300
What's your objection
to therapy?

351
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
You know what, Doc?
I am not the kind of guy

352
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,100
who's got anything to hide.

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
Do you know I often find
that when people declare

354
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,800
what they are not, it almost
invariably turns out

355
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,200
that's precisely what they are.

356
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,400
Great. Then you know what?

357
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,900
No more declarations for me.

358
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
You do know what
you just said is,

359
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,700
in fact, the very avatar

360
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
of a declaration?
Avatar?

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
That's great. Can I get
a cup of coffee and a, uh...

362
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,100
Tea, please.
Tea.

363
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,800
Let me ask you a question, Doc.

364
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Why is it that every time
you introduce yourself

365
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,300
you always say
your name twice huh?

366
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,200
(British accent): "Hello, my
name is Gordon, Gordon Wyatt."

367
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,200
Well, now you're simply
lashing out, aren't you?

368
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,400
Why don't we talk about

369
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
the case you're working
on at the moment?
What?

370
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Well, I am trained as
a forensic psychiatrist.
I might be able to help.

371
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,900
Okay, fine. Great.

372
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,800
I have a dead rich guy,
works with at-risk youth,

373
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
gets brutally murdered
after confiscating

374
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
a couple pounds of heroin

375
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,500
from one of his kids.

376
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Interesting the
first word you used

377
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
to describe him is "rich".

378
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,500
Ah, second.
First description was "dead".

379
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Why do you think you have a
problem with wealthy people?

380
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,600
This case, a perfect example.

381
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,700
This guy, he makes up
his own rules.

382
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,000
What's that word that you used?

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
Entitled.
Yeah, entitled.

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,300
That's what got him killed.

385
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
Now did this rich guy,
by any chance, have a wife?

386
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
Oh, what, are we
changing the subject now?

387
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,200
And does the rich guy's
wife have a lover?

388
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,400
I just told you.

389
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,000
The murder has to do
with the heroin.

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,100
The boy the victim
took the heroin from

391
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,600
also turned up murdered.

392
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,200
And is this boy from
a modest background?

393
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,500
Doesn't get any modester.

394
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
So is there any
chance that you would

395
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
rather catch the boy's murderer

396
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
than the wealthy
fellow's murderer,

397
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,700
so you have decided that
they are one and the same?

398
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Any chance that you've
based this assumption

399
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,400
purely on your bias against
rich, entitled people?

400
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,400
You know what?

401
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,200
I did the belt buckle,
I did the tie, I did the socks,

402
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,900
what else do you want from me?

403
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,400
What would you say if I told you

404
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,000
that my name actually
is Gordon Gordon Wyatt?

405
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,700
That my first
and middle names

406
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,200
are the same?

407
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,600
Yeah, baby!
WOMAN:
See you there?

408
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,200
I'll see you
at the restaurant.
Okay.

409
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,900
I'll go get Scotty.

410
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,000
(exhales):
So, you ready to go?

411
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,800
Don't you want
to take a shower?

412
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,100
Eh, I don't sweat that much.

413
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Won't you be uncomfortable
at the restaurant?

414
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,300
It's a skuzzy bar.

415
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,300
I'll be one of the best
smelling things there.

416
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,800
Next to you, of course.

417
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
You played very well.

418
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Thank you.

419
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,200
In fact, you
were the best.

420
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
See, that's why
I wanted you to come.

421
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,100
You know, to be impressed.

422
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
It was an impressive
display of manhood.

423
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,900
Well, thank you.

424
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Athletics as an
analog for battle.

425
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
In effect, you were
a warrior tonight.

426
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,900
Wow. You really were impressed.

427
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,900
There are quite a number
of ways that men judge

428
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,200
their relative maleness

429
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,300
with respect
to other men.
Uh-huh.

430
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Muscles.

431
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,100
Income. Cars.

432
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Attractive mates.
Tolerance to alcohol.

433
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,200
Hair loss. And, of course,
the size of the sexual organ.

434
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Oh...

435
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,600
save something for us
to discuss at dinner.

436
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Well... women don't
care about that.

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,800
Dinner? Or-Or hair loss?

438
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,100
The size of
the sexual organ.

439
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
Ours or yours?

440
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,300
Penis size only matters
to other males.

441
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,800
See, I was hoping you'd
comment on how I shut down

442
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
the other team's offense.

443
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,900
Well, their offense wasn't
really all that good.

444
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,700
Oh, you know how
to hurt a guy.

445
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
It's not a bad thing.
I like it.

446
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
A little sauce, a little zing.

447
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,700
Okay, the flake
on the trachea was India Ink.

448
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,700
It came from this.

449
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
It's a scrimshawed
letter opener.

450
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,900
Wiped clean, but there are still

451
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,400
minute traces
of Terence Bancroft's

452
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,500
blood in the etchings.

453
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,700
I need to pull
a little con on the wife.

454
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,700
Your wife?
No, the victim's wife.

455
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,100
Why?

456
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,600
To find out if she was
cheating on her husband.

457
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,300
I thought the murder
was because of the heroin.

458
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Well, it is,
but, you know,

459
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,500
I need you
to come along and, you know,

460
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
collect some dust
or pollen or seeds

461
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,900
or whatever the hell
it is you do

462
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,300
so I can get in and figure out

463
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,400
if she's got
anything to hide.

464
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,300
How will you do that?

465
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,200
Oh, got my ways. Come on.

466
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,700
Wow, you know,
I'm really busy here

467
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,000
with the murder weapon.

468
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,900
Plus, you found a fiber
in the victim's throat.

469
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,400
It's actually muskrat.

470
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,600
Muskrat, hey, that's a perfect
cover. We'll go to the mansion,

471
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
you go inside and look
for anything made out
of muskrat. Come on.

472
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,100
Why are you dragging
your feet? Let's go.

473
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
I'll... I'll get my kit.

474
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,500
Yeah, get your kit.

475
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,800
Good evening, Ms. Bancroft.

476
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,100
This is, uh... Dr. Hodgins

477
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
from the Jeffersonian.

478
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
I was wondering if...
Very pleased to meet you.

479
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,100
Nice to meet you, Dr. Hodgins.
Clarissa Bancroft.

480
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Dr. Hodgins, uh, needs
to take a look

481
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,500
inside in the den,
if that's all right.

482
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,500
Uh, what are you looking for?

483
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,500
Muskrat.

484
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
How long will
Dr. Hodgins be in there?

485
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,800
Well, you know, a homicide
investigation

486
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
is pretty invasive.

487
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,400
The family and the victim,they lose all their privacy.

488
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,400
I understand.

489
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Do you?

490
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,300
Because, uh... it's inevitable

491
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,400
that we find out everything.

492
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
What kind of doctor is Jack?

493
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Bugs. Slime.

494
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
There's fancier names,

495
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,900
but that's about it.

496
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
You know, don't you?

497
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
You know that I
had an affair.

498
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,600
It's best you tell me
everything.

499
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,700
It ended three months ago.

500
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,700
Terry and I were
working through it.

501
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
Separate vacations?

502
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,600
I didn't say it
wasn't difficult.

503
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,700
You can love someone
and still hurt them.

504
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,700
You need his name?

505
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,200
Yeah.
Leland Oliver.

506
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
He's our financial
consultant.

507
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,300
If you'd divorced
your husband...

508
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
I would've gotten,
at most, half

509
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
of his money.
This way, I get it all.

510
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Leland knew that
better than anyone.

511
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
That's exactly why

512
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,500
I didn't say
anything earlier.

513
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
How did you know Dr. Hodgins'

514
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
first name?

515
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,200
You introduced us.

516
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,600
I never said his first name.

517
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,700
Just tell him, Clarissa.

518
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
All right, look,
I'm sorry.

519
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,100
But it doesn't
change anything.

520
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,800
Hey, this is not a problem.

521
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
Not a problem?
Not a problem, huh?

522
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,100
I ought to arrest you
for tampering with evidence.

523
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,000
This goes to trial,
you're in Ibiza

524
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
or Antarctica on vacation.

525
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,600
Start looking for another job.

526
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,500
Hodgins, what is the
significance of the muskrat fur?

527
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Yeah, Hodgins, what is
the significance of
the muskrat fur?

528
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Muskrats have an under
layer of fur;

529
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,900
the outer layer is coarse hair.

530
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,500
This is muskrat hair.

531
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,100
Fur, hair...

532
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,100
I doubt our victim's jugular
was cut by a muskrat.

533
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,300
Is there something going on?

534
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,400
You want to tell them?

535
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
The muskrat hair was colored
with a new dye

536
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that's just been
patented

537
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
by a menswear
company in Canada.

538
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,800
So the murderer was dressed
in one of these jackets?

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,700
BOOTH:
Wait a second...

540
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,300
That one.

541
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,200
BRENNAN:
The leather bomber
with muskrat liner.

542
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,100
BOOTH:
That's the one
Robert Fraiser was wearing.

543
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
The director of the youth
drop-in center.

544
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,400
Then we have our murderer.

545
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,400
Good job, Hodgins.

546
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Not "Good job, Hodgins."

547
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,400
He might have blown
the whole case.

548
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
I told him it is not a problem.

549
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,100
BRENNAN:
What happened?

550
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,500
I don't care what he does
in his time off,

551
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
but when he screws
around with evidence

552
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,400
to get in the pants
of an old girlfriend

553
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
on one of my murder cases,

554
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,000
????

555
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,800
<i><http://www.fox18wccb.com>[t:p][n:Watch
JULIAN:
I already got no proof</i>

556
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
how the victim got
hold of that heroin.

557
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,100
Now you're saying I can't
put Hodgins on the stand? Why?

558
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,200
You don't want to know
the answer to that.

559
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Why doesn't
she want to know?

560
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,400
As the prosecutor in this case,

561
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm obliged to share everything
I know with the defense.

562
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,400
Just because Clarissa Bancroft
and I...

563
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,300
Whoa.

564
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Good night.

565
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,900
Did you not hear
what she just said?

566
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,200
There are some things
she can't know.

567
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,200
Clarissa and I were engaged.

568
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,400
(scoffs)
She and Terry

569
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,100
started something up and...

570
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,200
it unfolded the way
those things do.

571
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,600
I haven't contacted or
heard from either of
them in eight years.

572
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
Then Terry got killed...

573
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,200
And like every other rich guy
in the world,

574
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
you decided the rules just
didn't apply to you.

575
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Hey, the guy used
to be my friend,

576
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,500
all right?
And Clarissa...

577
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
You tampered with evidence.

578
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,500
The glass and frame
were evidence.

579
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
The photograph
I removed was not.

580
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,600
I wanted
to work Terry's murder.

581
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Obviously,
you're off the case.

582
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,000
He should be off the job.

583
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
That is not your decision,
Booth.

584
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,000
I apologize.

585
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I will deal with this
however you see fit.

586
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,000
<i>JULIAN:
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,</i>

587
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,300
my good friend, Mr. Barron, is
going to give you a long speech

588
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
about what
"reasonable doubt" is.

589
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,800
He's mostly going to be right.

590
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
But facts are facts,
ladies and gentlemen,

591
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,100
and the fact is
Mr. Robert Fraiser

592
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,400
killed Mr. Terence Bancroft

593
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,100
for a few pounds of heroin.

594
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
They've got anthropologists
and psychiatrists

595
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,200
and particulate experts

596
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,900
and blood experts,

597
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,200
the whole weight of the
Jeffersonian Institution,

598
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,900
all interpreting the facts

599
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,600
for you.

600
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,300
And I stress the
word "interpret".

601
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
Because you, as the jury,

602
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,400
are the arbiters
of common sense

603
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,800
that gets lost in
all the science.

604
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Would you describe how
the victim was killed?

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
Mr. Bancroft died
when a sharp instrument

606
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,100
was thrust into his jugular.

607
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,600
ADDY:
This is a dried fleck

608
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,500
of India ink left in the
victim's trachea.

609
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,600
It matches the ink
on a scrimshaw

610
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
letter opener the FBI
found at the scene.

611
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Postmortem, the vicious attack
on the victim continued.

612
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Objection. Categorization
of the attack as "vicious"

613
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
is prejudicial.

614
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,500
14 times a man was stabbed.

615
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,700
How many stabs does it take
to be vicious, exactly?

616
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,600
Sustained.

617
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Using a 2-D image
from a stereomicroscope,

618
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,700
I was able to create
a three-dimensional model.

619
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
These kerf marks are congruent
with a double-edged blade,

620
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,500
<i>one side serrated,
the other not.</i>

621
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, that's the knife
we found in the toolbox

622
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,400
in Robert Frasier's truck.

623
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,100
That would explain the prints
found by the FBI forensics lab?

624
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
It would explain the prints,
but not the victim's blood.

625
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah, this is the jacket
Robert Frasier was wearing

626
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
at the time of his arrest.

627
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
BRENNAN:
The hair on the left came
from the victim's larynx,

628
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,300
the hair on the right
came from the jacket.

629
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,800
And they came from
the same jacket?

630
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
They came from the same muskrat.

631
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,000
How did this hair get
into the victim's larynx?

632
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,600
The larynx and the trachea were
both punctured

633
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,500
by the murder weapon.

634
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,400
And that was most
logically achieved

635
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
by the murderer approaching

636
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,700
the victim from behind,

637
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,200
putting a choke hold on him,

638
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
and plunging the murder weapon

639
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,100
into his throat.

640
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,000
In doing so, the murderer
inadvertently stabbed

641
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
through his own jacket,

642
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,300
thus depositing
the muskrat hair

643
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,600
in the victim's throat.

644
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
JULIAN:
Let the record show
that that witness

645
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
is wiggling his finger
through the jacket

646
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,100
in a very convincing manner.

647
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,200
Objection to the use of the
phrase "very convincing manner."

648
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,100
Sustained.

649
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,200
Why?

650
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,400
Why what?

651
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,200
Why was
Terence Bancroft killed?

652
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,300
Did you discover
a motive, Agent Booth?

653
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
I need five minutes,
Your Honor.

654
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,500
Look, man,
I saw Terry take
the dope from Julio.

655
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,800
I don't see how that's
going to help burn
Frasier, though.

656
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
It's called chain of evidence.

657
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,100
It'll help, okay? Trust me.

658
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,700
I'll say what I saw.

659
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,500
Terry was a good man.

660
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,800
So are you.

661
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,200
Come on, let's go.

662
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,500
Terry was, like,
"Open that bag, Julio."

663
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,700
JULIAN:
What did Julio do?

664
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,800
He just stood there.

665
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Terry went over, took the bag
from him.

666
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
He opened it up--

667
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,400
it was packed with pounds
of blast.

668
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
Tell the jury
what that means.

669
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,800
Heroin.

670
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,200
At least two bricks.

671
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
And like, everybody knows
what happens

672
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,100
if Terry catches you holding--

673
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,000
you get sent out
for 72 hours.

674
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,200
And the drugs?

675
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,500
Straight to the police.

676
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,300
You believe Robert Frasier

677
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,900
killed Terence Bancroft
for that heroin?

678
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,500
Yes. Robert Frasier turned out
to be a junkie.

679
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,400
That's why he wore
that jacket all the time.

680
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Objection. Assuming
facts not in evidence.

681
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,100
What do you mean?

682
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,700
The defendant has every
needle disease in the book

683
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,000
except HIV.

684
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,100
Same objection.

685
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,400
Plus, Ms. Julian seems
to deeply desire

686
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,600
to testify herself.

687
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,100
Yes, I would like
to testify,

688
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,200
because then I'd know
what answers I was getting.
(laughing)

689
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,900
JUDGE:
All right, settle down.

690
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
This is a murder trial,

691
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
not a night
at the Improv.

692
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,600
The victim was killed and left
for between ten and 15 hours.

693
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,400
The murderer returned
and forced him into the chair.

694
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,400
This is also when
he was stabbed 14 times.

695
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
That ten to 15 hours gave
the murderer time

696
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,800
to soak Julia Diaz' sweatshirt
in the victim's blood,

697
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,400
in order to put
the blame on either Mr. Diaz

698
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,800
or the drug suppliers.

699
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,100
But you do not believe that
the defendant killed the boy.

700
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,700
No, but he might
as well have.

701
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,500
Objection!

702
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,400
I'll hear it.

703
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,500
Terence Bancroft intended
to give that heroin

704
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
to the police, in order

705
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,100
to keep Julio Diaz square
with his suppliers.

706
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,900
Thank you.

707
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,600
Julio Diaz was 14 years old.

708
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Your Honor...

709
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,100
The prosecution apologizes,

710
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,000
Your Honor.

711
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
And rests.

712
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,200
<i>MONTENEGRO:
Wait.</i>

713
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,200
You still haven't slept
together?

714
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,300
I know the
problem.

715
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,200
(laughing):
His religious upbringing?

716
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,900
His penis.

717
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,800
What's wrong with it?

718
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
Apparently,
it's small.

719
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,000
(laughing):
Oh...

720
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,900
Oh, well,
that maybe explains

721
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,800
why he hasn't made
any moves on you yet.

722
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
He's insecure.

723
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
So, I should make the
first move, right?

724
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,600
Yeah.

725
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Take Sully
for a little test drive.

726
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,200
Maybe he's got
unlimited mileage.

727
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,000
That'll make up for the
fact that he's a subcompact.

728
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,700
<i>BOOTH:
Hey, Doc,</i>

729
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,600
what we're doing here, would
that be considered therapy?

730
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,700
Oh, absolutely,
especially as I'm about to inquire whether
you've experienced

731
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,200
any outbursts of temper
since I requested

732
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,300
you alter
your dress code.

733
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,300
Yeah, one of the, uh,
the squints-- Hodgins--

734
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
decided the rules, they
didn't apply to him.

735
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
He got entitled

736
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,800
and jeopardized my murder case.

737
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Ah, and you confronted him
physically?

738
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,900
Physical confrontation--
that's my main skill.

739
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,100
Entitled, you said.

740
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,600
Is he a wealthy man?

741
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,500
Yeah, like the guy
who got killed.

742
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,400
The murder victim

743
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,400
who... he tried to help a child
and then died for it?

744
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
And your...

745
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,200
squint?
Yeah, squint.

746
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,100
(mumbling):
Extraordinary.

747
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Your squint tried
to help a friend?

748
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,600
So they both endeavored
to do good.

749
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,500
With no clue
of the way things are.

750
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,100
The way things are as defined
by a working-class lad

751
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,000
from Pittsburgh.

752
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,200
That's right.

753
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Pittsburgh,

754
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,700
where I'm from,
all right, from the streets

755
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,000
where you get a sense
of how the world really is.

756
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,400
Yes, I'm sure that's true,
but has it occurred to you

757
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
that without the distortion
of reality provided

758
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
by a privileged upbringing,

759
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,100
there'd be no such thing
as the Sistine Chapel,

760
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,400
the Taj Mahal or Three
Rivers Stadium,

761
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
home of your
beloved Steelers?

762
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Three Rivers Stadium
was demolished in 2000.

763
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,700
It really was a great place,
though. I mean, that Lambert...

764
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,300
No doubt. The point is...

765
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
you rebel in your way,
your friend rebels in his.

766
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,200
We, all of us,

767
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
have to overcome
our upbringings,

768
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,700
rich and poor alike.

769
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,000
You know what?

770
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,500
I'm going to ask you
to go back to your bilious socks

771
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,400
and your ostentatious ties

772
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,300
and your provocative
belt buckles.

773
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, you're saying
if I wear flashy socks,

774
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm gonna forgive Hodgins?

775
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,300
I'm not sure I'm that good,
but, well, perhaps I am, hmm.

776
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,900
Oh, hey, Doc,
Doc, Doc, uh...

777
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,200
W-Why is it that the,
uh, the belt buckle is provocative?

778
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,700
Oh, it's a
modern-day codpiece.

779
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,500
It forces the eye to the groin.

780
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
<i>BARRON:
What process was used</i>

781
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
to match the India ink
on the letter opener

782
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
with the flake
in the victim's trachea?

783
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,900
Hydropneumatic elutriation.

784
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,600
BARRON:
Which involves dissolving the
sample in a solution, correct?

785
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,600
Yes.

786
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,600
Essentially destroying it?

787
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,700
Yes.

788
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,900
And how was the muskrat hair
processed?

789
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,500
Liquid chromatograph
mass spectrometry.

790
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,500
And did you perform this test
personally, Dr. Saroyan?

791
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,900
No, it was done by a specialist
at the Jeffersonian.

792
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,200
And who might that be?

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
SAROYAN:
Dr. Jack Hodgins.

794
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,000
The same man who used
flies to estimate the time of death?

795
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,900
Yes.

796
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,900
The same Dr. Jack Hodgins
who was once engaged

797
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,200
to the victim's wife,
Clarissa Bancroft?

798
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,500
Objection!
Assumes facts not in evidence.

799
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Sustained.

800
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Quite right, Your Honor.

801
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,600
The defense calls Dr. Jack Hodgins to the stand,

802
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,700
after which, we will be moving
for a dismissal of all charges.

803
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,700
<i>???? they found out about</i>

804
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,100
Hodgins and
Clarissa Bancroft?

805
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,500
That's a classic
defense move.

806
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,000
You just check out
the wife for motive,

807
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,200
run through the ex-lovers.

808
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
Well, the judge didn't
dismiss the case,

809
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,900
which is a miracle.
(sighs)

810
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
"Better you don't
know, Caroline."

811
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,300
I figured it was
something small like a typo

812
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,500
in a search
warrant but, no,

813
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,700
turns out Hodgins had motive
to kill the man himself.

814
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,000
Eight years ago,
maybe, but not now.

815
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
I've got Angela.

816
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,900
Hello. If I might continue.

817
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,800
The judge has
allowed you 24 hours

818
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
to come up with
additional evidence

819
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,200
that has never
been seen,

820
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,300
heard, smelled,
touched

821
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
or considered by Dr. Hodgins.

822
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,900
24 hours.

823
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,300
Hodgins was all over
this case.

824
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,800
We need something
brand-new,

825
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,100
or something that
Hodgins didn't touch.

826
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,800
Both weapons,
blood spatter evidence...

827
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Trace evidence from the scene,
the heroin, the sweatshirt.

828
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
I mean,
we've covered it all.

829
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
The answer is here,
in front of us,

830
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,300
just like always.

831
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
The fungus.

832
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,000
SAROYAN:
What fungus?

833
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,800
The fungus Zack found along

834
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,200
the interior
cervical vertebrae.

835
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,600
Typical cadaver mold.

836
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,100
BRENNAN:
Let's have it
identified.

837
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,100
That would usually
be Hodgins' job.

838
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,500
Not this time.

839
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
It's my letter
of resignation.

840
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,000
Your science was
dead-on perfect.

841
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
That's all I care about.

842
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't need your resignation.

843
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
He didn't actually
tamper with evidence.

844
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,300
Dr. Hodgins endangered a case

845
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,500
by hiding his relationship
with a suspect.

846
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I'm saving Dr. Saroyan
the trouble of firing me.

847
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,900
Well, how much trouble is it?

848
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,500
"You're fired!"

849
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,900
That's no
trouble at all.

850
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,100
A child
could do it.

851
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,700
I appreciate it.

852
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,700
So we all agree
it's aspergillus?

853
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
ADDY:
But there are 185 strains of aspergillus.

854
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,600
Clavatus?

855
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,100
Glaucus? Flavus?

856
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,400
And they all look
totally alike to me.

857
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,900
No, no, these two are different.

858
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,100
I don't see it.

859
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,600
Well, they're both... puddly.

860
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,800
Puddly?

861
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,700
Well, by "puddly" I mean

862
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,200
the hyphae are septate and
hyaline and the conidiophores

863
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
originate from
the basal foot cell

864
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,100
located on
the supporting hyphae

865
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,600
and terminate
in a vesicle.

866
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,200
<i>Aspergillus ustus.</i>

867
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
You found it.

868
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
Exactly how much time

869
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,300
have you been spending
with Hodgins?

870
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,800
Pie good?

871
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,100
I quit.

872
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,500
Handed in my
letter to Cam.

873
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
Idiot.
(sighs)

874
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,400
Should've got fired.

875
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Now... no severance package.

876
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,200
I figure, a guy like you,

877
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,700
I resign, that puts
things right between us.

878
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,700
Do we need to
discuss it past that?

879
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
What are we... girls?

880
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Piece of pie for my friend.

881
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,800
JULIAN:
I will remind the jury that they
have heard previous testimony

882
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
from Dr. Clifford Lonsdale,

883
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,200
a clinical expert
in drug addiction.

884
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,800
Why should the jury care about
some Latin infections?

885
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
We found a fungus on the victim

886
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,900
<i>called Aspergillus ustus.</i>

887
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,400
Is that not very common?

888
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,200
The fungus in the victim
matches exactly

889
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,600
the strain Dr. Lonsdale found
in the defendant.

890
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
What are the chances
of that occurring?

891
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,900
Incalculable.

892
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,100
Which is something
I've never said before.

893
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,700
Ms. Montenegro,
how did this happen?

894
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,800
When the defendant punctured
the victim's jugular,

895
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,600
he nicked himself.

896
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,500
Thus introducing the bacteria

897
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,600
directly into
the victim's blood stream.

898
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,400
The fungus developed only

899
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,600
where blood from
the fatal stab pooled.

900
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,000
Here, along the spinal cord.

901
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,500
It did not spread
throughout the body.

902
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Which means?

903
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,900
That only Mr. Fraiser
could have infected the victim

904
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,000
and only within moments
of the victim's death.

905
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,600
And who found this fungus?

906
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,200
BRENNAN:
Dr. Zack Addy.

907
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,300
And who identified it?

908
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,000
BRENNAN:
Ms. Angela Montenegro.

909
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,900
And who realized
the significance of it?

910
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,300
I did.

911
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,100
BARRON:
Dr. Jack Hodgins
participated

912
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,600
in no way whatsoever?

913
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Objection!

914
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
The implication is offensive.

915
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,000
That objection has no standing
in law, Ms. Julian.

916
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
The witness will answer.

917
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,000
Despite the fact
that I have absolute faith

918
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,400
in Dr. Hodgins' integrity
and objectivity,

919
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,100
in this instance,
he was not involved.

920
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,300
Then the evidence stands.

921
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,600
I don't see how
they can do that.

922
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,500
Who?
Lawyers.

923
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,600
Do what?

924
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
BRENNAN:
Be all friendly.

925
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,800
SAROYAN:
The only people lawyers like

926
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
are other lawyers.

927
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,000
Well, they were married.

928
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,000
Well, they have a daughter,
second year at M.I.T.

929
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,200
Does anyone else
see the irony here?

930
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Listen up, you people.

931
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,300
The verdict is going to
come down any minute.

932
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,300
Maybe we'll win,
maybe we'll lose,

933
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,700
but this I do know.

934
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,000
You people have got to get your
sand together, you hear me?

935
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,400
Booth and you scientist-
android brainiacs,

936
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,200
you got something
very special here.

937
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,700
But you are losing it--

938
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,100
dropping serial killers off balconies

939
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
and blabbing suspects' names

940
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,300
to vengeful fathers,

941
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,200
cutting into heads
before their times,

942
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,300
getting poisoned,

943
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,500
getting blown up because you go grabbing for things
you shouldn't ought,

944
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,900
taking photographs from frames,

945
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,700
getting a perfectly good car
smashed to bits

946
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,300
for no good reason!

947
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Get it together!

948
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,900
Start using
your oversized heads.

949
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,300
This is the
real world.

950
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,600
Now... I know

951
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,500
bug man here handed
in his resignation.

952
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,800
My official Justice Department
recommendation is the following:

953
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,200
we win the case, he
gets his job back.

954
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,300
We lose,

955
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Booth shoots him.

956
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,800
The jury's returned
with a verdict.

957
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,300
Okay, let's go face the music.

958
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Will the defendant please rise?

959
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,400
Madame Foreperson,
please read the verdict.

960
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
FOREPERSON:
We, the jury, find
the defendant

961
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,500
guilty.

962
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,400
JUDGE:
This court is adjourned.

963
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,700
You look happy.

964
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,400
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)

965
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,100
You look really happy.

966
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,500
You made the first move.

967
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,900
You told me
I should.

968
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,200
How was it?

969
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,600
I mean, I don't mean "it."

970
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,600
No, no, I do.
I mean "it."

971
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,200
I discovered something
very interesting

972
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,400
about cops
and nicknames.

973
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,000
Anthropologically
interesting?

974
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,300
Anatomically interesting.

975
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,800
They call the
bald guy "Curly"

976
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,300
and the fat guy "Tiny."

977
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
It's ironic.

978
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,400
So when they call Sully
"Peanut"...

979
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,900
He doesn't like to shower
with the other guys

980
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,800
because he
diverges from

981
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,600
the quantifiable
morphological norm.

982
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,900
What?
What's that mean?

983
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,600
Stands out from a crowd.

984
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,900
Do you have a nickname, Booth?

985
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,800
Something the other
cops call you.

986
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,500
Why? What have you heard?

987
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,500
Congrats, Brennan.

988
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,400
Wow.

989
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Those socks,
those are

990
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,600
amazing.
That's right.

991
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,100
The socks, the tie, the belt
buckle-- all escape valves

992
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,600
for my
socioeconomic rage.

993
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I hate psychology.

994
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,100
Well, you know, they help me
deal with the day-to-day

995
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,800
irritations of dealing with
people that are more privileged.

996
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,800
I slept with Sully last night.

997
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,800
Oh, I thought you already...

998
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,500
No.

999
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,900
Last night.

1000
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Oh, it's really
none of my business.

1001
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,000
Except we're partners.

1002
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Yeah, there's that.

1003
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,800
And you told me
about your socks.

1004
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,800
Sex, socks-- pretty much
the same word.

1005
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,600
Do we have a case,
or are you just visiting?

1006
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,900
Yeah, I'll fill
you in on the way.

1007
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,100
It's messy.

1008
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,200
Better get some protection.

1009
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,000
Let me get my gum boots.

1010
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:14,000
welcome to www.1000fr.com
