1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,210
What I'm saying is,

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,780
in this world
there's the visceral and the ineffable.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,110
Nobody's totally un-effable.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,550
Virgins are.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,350
I mean, but you're, like,
the total opposite of un-effable.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,457
"Ineffable"...
and it doesn't mean what you think.

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,590
It means that you can't like,
describe it in words.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,750
Describe what? Like sex?

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,810
You two have zero vocab skills!

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,550
You're bitter, 'cause you're
the designated driver and...

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,760
we're not.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,540
what's that even mean...
"degsinated"?

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,760
What the hell is that?

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,600
Male, mid-30s...

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,870
attachment sites suggests
he was well-muscled...

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,850
probably due to manual labor
rather than weight traing.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,450
Okay, what killed him?

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,130
The sternal ribs are subluxated

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,250
at both the spine...
and the sternum.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,480
Indicating that he was crushed?

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,950
Not crushed...

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,510
pinned.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,060
Smothered,

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,490
perhaps in an industrial accident?

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,490
This the guy that Bones
is checking out to replace Zack?

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,270
Clark Edison,
meet Special Agent Seeley Booth.

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,480
Hey, what's up?

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,230
"Bones..."
that's funny, that's what...

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,830
all my friends
called me back at college.

30
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,010
Yeah, I like him.
You got a minute?

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,490
One minute...

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,060
Are you going to a crime scene?
Do you need me?

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,640
I'll let you know.

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,080
Did I get it right?

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,950
Yes. Construction worker,
foundation collapse.

36
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,380
But I'm not impressing her.

37
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,850
I'm still not completely certain
what Dr. Brennan thinks of me.

38
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,520
Why am I here?

39
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,355
You used to like
to come out into the field.

40
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,825
No car fires,
no tanker trucks full of acid,

41
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,661
- no explosion...
- You to insist...

42
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,457
Don't tell me you brought me out here

43
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,691
- for a car accident.
- You're so anxious to get back,

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,428
I could barely get you off
your lab coat.

45
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,020
With Zack gone,
I'm need at the Jeffersonian.

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,060
That kid seemed pretty good with
the subluxicated sternaculum... thing.

47
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,170
You used to correct me.

48
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,750
Why am I here, Booth?

49
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,640
Hey, Foster, get a backboard,
we got one we gotta stabilize.

50
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,020
So, it's been, what, three months
since Zack shipped off to Iraq?

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,230
How hard could it be to replace him?

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,050
Male... Caucasian...

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,710
I'm just saying, I mean,
you in the lab, me in the field...

54
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,730
we are not working
at our full symbiotic potential.

55
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,180
Late teens, early 20s.
Completely devoid of flesh or odor.

56
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,220
Seems like maybe
you don't want to work with me anymore.

57
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,900
I work with you.

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,820
You know what I mean, Bones.

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,960
How did this skull get here?

60
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,910
Ask our eyewitness.

61
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,590
Come on. Let's go, buddy.

62
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,530
I'm not high.

63
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,400
Neither am I.
Why is he telling me that?

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,040
The car reeked of dope.
So, tell her what happened.

65
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,290
I was driving
behind a dump truck, and...

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,410
that came flying off the back.

67
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,880
You think the rest of the skeleton
is still in the truck?

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,630
- No.
- Why?

69
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,230
It didn't come flying out,
it came flying off.

70
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,200
- It bounced.
- Oh, bouncing skull.

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
Perhaps you thought that

72
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,730
because you were under the influence
of tetrahydrocannabinol.

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,330
- What?
- Weed.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,200
I wasn't high,
I'm the designated driver, I...

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,090
Piss test me if you want.

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,000
It's possible,

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,210
if the truck were traveling
at a certain rate of speed,

78
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,820
a wind vortex or shear

79
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,860
could occur capable
of flinging the skull like...

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,960
What?

81
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,410
What, Booth?

82
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,780
Bones...

83
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,230
But why would anyone
throw a skull off an overpass?

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,580
So your husband signed his name
to the marriage license with an X.

85
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
Yeah.

86
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,820
So you married a guy
without knowing his name?

87
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,150
It was Fiji,

88
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,960
okay? I was on vacation.

89
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm not being judgmental,

90
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm just trying to ascertain the facts.

91
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,840
Did you consummate the marriage?

92
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,500
A full moon,

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,710
tropics, yeah, there was
definite consummation activity.

94
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,890
We already looked into
having the marriage annulled.

95
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,820
Annulment requires consent
from both the husband and the wife.

96
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,650
Which is why
we need a private investigator.

97
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,190
To find the "husband",

98
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,690
so we can get married.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,520
Right, well, I'm just going
to need any description

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,530
that you can provide of your husband...
details, dates, photographs...

101
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,190
who else was there.

102
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,170
Tall...

103
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,920
I guess.

104
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,730
Muscular.

105
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,740
Black.

106
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,220
That's all I got.

107
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,300
You know what,
I think his name had a "B" in it.

108
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,840
Actually, it could have been a "K"

109
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,370
You know what,
I could make you a sketch.

110
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,590
Well...

111
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,170
There are scoring patterns
here on the forehead,

112
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,710
the cheek bones, around the nose.

113
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,250
I meant Clark Edison.

114
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,740
Who's Clark Edison?

115
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,200
The absolutely brilliant
forensic anthropologist

116
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,910
who'd bite off his own arm
to be your assistant.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,550
I haven't decided yet.
Is that a problem?

118
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,220
No, I want you
to be certain of your choice.

119
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,550
Thank you.

120
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,330
It's just that you've turned down
17 applicants already.

121
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a rarified discipline.

122
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,950
There aren't
many more candidates to check out.

123
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,720
I'll cover the lab work
until I find the right person.

124
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,030
This is good.

125
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,948
It's the first time
you've called me in weeks.

126
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,520
There's scoring on the skull.

127
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Scoring?

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,950
Yes, scrapes.

129
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah, I know what scoring means.

130
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,150
The scraping is uniform in spacing,
but not in depth,

131
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,830
which suggests an ungual pattern.

132
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,240
What's an "uncle" pattern?

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,700
No, ungual. "Gaa"...

134
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,650
Ungual.

135
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,427
How do I say this in a way
that makes sense to Booth?

136
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,209
Something chewed on the skull.

137
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,798
Like a bear or a dog.

138
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:54,137
Human, Booth.

139
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,774
Dr. Brennan is saying human.

140
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,760
In the vernacular,
our victim's face was...

141
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,609
chewed off by a cannibal.

142
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:05,578
Okay.

143
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:10,057
Bones S03E01
"The widow's son in the Windshield"

144
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,893
Capture: swsub.com

145
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,689
Sync: The Lovers - Shadow

146
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:22,319
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

147
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:37,912
The ensuing accident
was called in by a trucker

148
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,685
who saw it in his rearview mirror.

149
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:41,621
Now, the driver
of the "reefer mobile"...

150
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,719
"Reefer mobile"?

151
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:45,897
identified said truck as the one
from which the skull rebounded

152
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:48,632
before said skull
lodged in his windshield.

153
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:52,658
The truck dumped it's contents
at a municipal landfill near Salisbury.

154
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,894
We need a warrant
to shut down the landfill and...

155
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,685
comb it for body parts.

156
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:02,827
You think a cannibal is making a habit
of tossing body parts off of overpasses

157
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,739
into passing dump trucks?

158
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,858
Well, we only got a head, so...

159
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,514
the rest has got to be somewhere.

160
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:11,807
Okay.

161
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,793
What am I looking at?

162
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,526
It's called an osteoma.

163
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:19,762
It's a type of bone spur that grows from
the skull down into the sinus cavity.

164
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:22,671
Clark found it when I gave him
the X-rays to analyze.

165
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,040
An osteoma that size can cause...

166
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,264
headaches, infected sinuses,
maybe worse.

167
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,404
Osteomas are every bit as distinctive
as fingerprints or... retinas.

168
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:33,716
We'll check with local ear,
nose and throat surgeons...

169
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,854
see if the pain drove
our victim to seek help.

170
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:36,991
Nice job.

171
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,031
Thank you.

172
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:42,421
The FBI forensics team just delivered,
like, a million bone chips.

173
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:43,885
From the landfill?

174
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,811
And Booth says there's more to come.

175
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:53,062
You are not going
to hire that one either.

176
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,603
I haven't made up my mind yet.

177
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:58,060
And when you don't hire him,
it just prolongs this lame excuse

178
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,102
for you not to go out
into the field with Booth.

179
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,528
Why would I do that?

180
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:02,856
Because...

181
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,457
when Hodgins and I
ran away from our wedding,

182
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:08,298
we left you and Booth
standing at the alter.

183
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:11,244
And that iconic image...

184
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,325
- totally freaked you out.
- No, it didn't.

185
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:17,339
Sweetie, this is not one of those things
where you try to keep a secret

186
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:18,957
and I ferret out the truth.

187
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,230
This is where I tell you
something that's true,

188
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,696
so you can catch up
to your own reality.

189
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:26,103
Ange, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

190
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,974
Which actually proves my point.

191
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,351
I really love you
to bits and pieces, sweetie.

192
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,915
I know you love me back,
we'll talk again when you catch up.

193
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,684
Most of these are animal remains.

194
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,284
Some are crockery and plastic.

195
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,690
We got anything human?

196
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:46,943
I'll have to go through it and see.

197
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,387
Well, I could do that, Dr Brennan.

198
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,448
Yeah, Clark could do that.

199
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,912
There's too many.

200
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,627
This could take days,
even with the two of us.

201
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:56,129
Come on.

202
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:57,882
Is that true?

203
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:06,068
Dude, you're kind of putting me
in an awkward position there.

204
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:13,503
Well... Zack would have told me.

205
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,326
I mean, how hard can it be
to replace one weirdo squint?

206
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:25,060
I'd hire Clark, but it's not my call.

207
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,281
No, it is. You've given Bones
enough time. Just hire the guy.

208
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:31,786
Usually when you get all blustery, it's
'cause you think something's your fault.

209
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,956
Yeah, well, you know,
I did... arrest her father for murder.

210
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,286
She could be...

211
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:38,885
having trouble with that.

212
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:40,772
Exposing a parent to the death penalty

213
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:42,776
can have a chilling effect
on a partnership.

214
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,724
Look, I asked Bones
if that was a problem, she said no.

215
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:50,115
I got to wonder if deep down
if anybody's that rational.

216
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,253
You're not reassuring me here, Camille.

217
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,908
If you're looking for reassurance

218
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,499
find someone who'd not
such a good friend, Seeley.

219
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,277
Booth.

220
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,859
Yeah, okay, on my way.

221
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:04,976
We got an identity.

222
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,748
This is the skull in the windshield.

223
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,562
These are X-rays from an ear,
nose and throat specialist on M Street.

224
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,758
Okay, we're sure this is Gavin Nichols?

225
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,802
The osteoma's a perfect match.
It's him.

226
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,256
Prodigy violinist disappears...

227
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:20,396
a month later his skull ends up
bouncing off a garbage truck?

228
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:24,384
Obviously we are looking for someone
who really, really hates classical music

229
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:27,697
Look at this... final performance
was at the Library of Congress.

230
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:30,143
He meet with well-wishers,
arranged to meet with...

231
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,224
his girlfriend for drinks
at the Hay-Adams,

232
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,015
never showed and
nobody ever saw him again.

233
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,182
He had a violin worth $3 million.

234
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,497
A 22-year-old willowy kid walking around
with three million bucks under his arm?

235
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,134
I'm telling you, easy pickings.

236
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:46,545
A cannibalistic violin thief
who eats faces?

237
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:49,569
Yeah, it's a stretch.

238
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,707
But, uh...

239
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,115
You see how this is?

240
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,118
Us working together?

241
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:58,315
Very symbiotic.

242
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:02,129
You said that already.
What is it, the word of the day?

243
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:03,343
I'd, uh...

244
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:06,656
like you to be there
when I, uh, question the girlfriend.

245
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,718
Can't.
I found microscopic grit on the skull.

246
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:12,195
Microscopic grit?
That's... Hodgins territory.

247
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:13,853
Yes, and Hodgins works for me,

248
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,940
- so that makes it my territory.
- Take Angela.

249
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:19,198
Let her do that thing where she looks
at photographs and reads peoples minds.

250
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,452
No, actually, what she does
is read minute facial indicators...

251
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,145
Joke, Dr. Brennan.

252
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,677
How did you meet Gavin
Nichols, Ms. Trattner?

253
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,841
I'm a cellist with
the National Symphony.

254
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,904
<i>Gavin guested as first
violinist three years ago.</i>

255
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:43,037
Check out the photo of them kissing...
mega tongue action.

256
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:47,282
<i>How long did you
know him this way?</i>

257
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:50,822
Within a couple
weeks of our meeting.

258
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:52,905
He was barely shaving back then.

259
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:56,474
What is she doing playing squeeze
and squish with a 19-year-old?

260
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,162
Squeeze and squish?

261
00:11:58,457 --> 00:11:59,692
I beg your pardon?

262
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,636
With a 19-year-old?

263
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,572
Gavin pursued me.

264
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,021
His...

265
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,931
<i>tastes ran to older women.</i>

266
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,476
<i>Ms. Trattner, do you think...</i>

267
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,108
Gavin was killed for his violin?

268
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,104
No. No one does.

269
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,355
You can't sell it anywhere.

270
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,658
<i>And we would know by now
if they were trying to ransom it back.</i>

271
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:21,765
Can you think of anyone
who'd want him dead?

272
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:26,115
- Every violinist in the world.
- Why?

273
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,488
No one had seen left-hand technique
like Gavin's

274
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,508
<i>since Franz Von Biber.</i>

275
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:34,072
<i>I mean, his little finger was insured
for ten million dollars.</i>

276
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,657
Great. Thank you, Miss Trattner.

277
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,512
Thank you for your cooperation.
You-you can leave now.

278
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,287
W- Wait a minute, Booth...

279
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,772
Oh, o... one moment.

280
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,633
Check out her face
in the quartet photo.

281
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:49,624
Just one more...

282
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:52,602
question. I'm sorry.

283
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:55,955
What's going on here?

284
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:01,142
It was impossible not to watch him
when he played.

285
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:03,428
You don't look impressed.
You look sad.

286
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,001
Like she losts something.

287
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:06,621
Like you've lost him.

288
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:09,042
Because she knew
he was going to die.

289
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:10,537
Like there was someone else.

290
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,821
There was?

291
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,442
There was someone else in his life,
someone I need to know about.

292
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:20,259
Brilliant, Booth. You are brilliant.
Okay, this time, I...

293
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,416
What?

294
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,396
I'm sorry. Nothing.
Just... quietly...

295
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,363
who was it, Amelia?

296
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,410
Ask her.

297
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:45,547
Rona Sumner?

298
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,785
Who's Rona Sumner?

299
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:50,949
Wife of Leo Sumner...

300
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,733
... deputy director
of the Secret Service.

301
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,214
The particles
we found in the skull

302
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,853
are pink syenite.

303
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:05,134
- It's the Cadillac of granites.
- How dit it get on the skull?

304
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,807
I don't know, but pink syenite
is relatively rare.

305
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,188
Well, how did it get there?

306
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,365
I don't know.

307
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:14,545
At first, I thought it was a Brazilian
stone called sienite balma,

308
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:17,085
but trace amounts
of magnetite and this...

309
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:19,393
this is crucial... chalcocite,

310
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,846
led me to the Omineca tectonic belt

311
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,929
in British Columbia, Canada,

312
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:25,618
and voila!

313
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,739
There's no indication on the skull

314
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:29,602
that he was struck,
so how did it get there?

315
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,250
I don't know, but

316
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:32,948
not a lot of pink syenite

317
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,191
quarried in British Columbia
has been shipped to DC...

318
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,321
none, at all,
in the last hundred years.

319
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,967
Perhaps the skull was
dropped on a stone floor?

320
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,213
I don't know...

321
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:44,162
but I discovered half dozen sources...

322
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,424
a bridge, some garden walls
on private estates,

323
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,086
and one entire bank building.

324
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:49,916
Send the details to Booth.

325
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:53,013
Hodgins,

326
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:56,165
the reason that I'm not going out
in the field with Booth

327
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:58,542
is that I haven't found
a replacement for Zack.

328
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:00,756
Well, there is
no replacement for Zack.

329
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,154
I mean, you know,
he's good with bones,

330
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,123
excellent at math.

331
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,282
He's pretty brilliant
at making contraptions.

332
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:11,646
And when our experiments blew up,
it was easy to pin the blame on him.

333
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:15,807
In my book,
all that makes Zack irreplaceable.

334
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,942
Exactly. Which is
why I'm stuck in the lab. Not...

335
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,730
some other reason.

336
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,795
The only thing you can do
is forget about replacing Zack

337
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:27,772
and find someone who can just...

338
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:30,293
just help out around here.

339
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:37,169
Yes, I was intimately
involved with Gavin Nichols.

340
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:42,391
Mr. Sumner, I have to ask, were you
aware of your wife's infidelity?

341
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,372
What you really want to ask,
Agent Booth,

342
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:47,034
is if I killed the
boy for bedding my wife.

343
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,580
I have a far more interesting question.

344
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:54,166
Why didn't you come armed with the
biggest, baddest lawyer in town?

345
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:56,184
I'm more interested
in the killing question.

346
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:58,816
I did not murder Rona's fiddle-player.

347
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:01,305
Leo and I have no
secrets from each other.

348
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:04,024
What you'd like for us
to believe is that because

349
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,199
your husband knew
about this dalliance,

350
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,693
there's no motive
for jealousy and murder.

351
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,347
Gavin wasn't my only...

352
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,078
I'll use your word... dalliance.

353
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,192
And Mr. Sumner knew
all about them?

354
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,507
Like Rona said,

355
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,438
"no secrets."

356
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:20,009
Would you like names?

357
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:22,824
To see if Leo murdered
them as well?

358
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:24,321
That'd be peachy.

359
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:26,436
Just... tell us about Gavin Nichols.

360
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,459
Every salacious detail?

361
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,424
- Hit the highlights, honey.
- I get it.

362
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,743
That's the part you like, huh?

363
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,051
The play-by-play?

364
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:37,467
I'm heavily involved in arts patronage.

365
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:41,530
After I put together the
funding to get Gavin his violin,

366
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:43,351
we slept together.

367
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:47,758
We met perhaps once
or twice a month after that.

368
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,781
A total of 11 times.

369
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,628
When was the last time
you saw him?

370
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,659
The night he disappeared.

371
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:56,356
At the Library of Congress.

372
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,356
Agent Booth meant sexually.

373
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:00,848
The night he disappeared.

374
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,667
At the Library of Congress.

375
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,057
Nope.

376
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:08,302
Not buying it. I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't feel them. Don't feel them, see,

377
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,735
- don't feel...
- What Agent Booth

378
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,951
means is that unless you can prove

379
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:15,266
that Mr. Sumner knew about
your affair with Gavin Nichols,

380
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:18,324
this could all have been a story
you cooked up after killing him.

381
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,723
We thought you might want proof.

382
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:40,121
So, the kid and the cougar,
bumping the uglies.

383
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,164
He doesn't just enjoy hearing
about his wife's sex life,

384
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,524
he gets off on watching.

385
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,879
Which explains why he
didn't bring in a lawyer.

386
00:17:58,397 --> 00:17:59,941
They didn't murder the kid.

387
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,260
- Where is Bones?
- You arrested the deputy director

388
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,201
of the Secret Service for voyeurism?

389
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,344
Bones in her office?

390
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:14,274
That is awesome,
and really, really stupid.

391
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:16,435
You gotta love
a self-destructive man with values.

392
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:17,486
Right. Where's Bones?

393
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,488
Right behind you.

394
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,360
Oh, great. Listen, I got Charlie
to check out

395
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,774
all the places with that red rock.

396
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,796
Pink syenite.

397
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:26,713
There's only one place that uses the...
pink rock in its foundation.

398
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,999
It's an old deserted bank
on the Anacostia River.

399
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,311
Bingo, baby!

400
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,626
Why "bingo baby"?

401
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,536
I checked into the
ownership of the place.

402
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,525
Why "bingo baby"?

403
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:37,895
Shell companies owning
defective titles...

404
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,934
I don't get the significance.

405
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,537
It's is deserted, isolated.
It's a fortress.

406
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,017
Serial killer heaven.

407
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,265
Look. I want you to come with me.

408
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,012
I've got work to do here.

409
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,035
Dr. Brennan,

410
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:56,160
if this building was used for some sort
of ritual cannibalistic killing...

411
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,958
as indicated by a skull
which has been gnawed upon...

412
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,471
a trained anthropologist's eye
could be crucial to the case.

413
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,160
Rationally speaking.

414
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:09,926
The bank's been closed for years.

415
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:12,346
Door's always locked.
Never a light.

416
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,745
- Nothing.
- No squatters?

417
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,276
Made 'em sturdy back in the day.
I mean, look at this place.

418
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:18,569
It is clean. No dust, nothing.

419
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:22,008
DC Building Conservancy is fighting
to keep the place a historical site.

420
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:25,594
Maybe if you told me what you were
looking for, I could help you out.

421
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,309
Oh, you know. Bloodstains,

422
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:28,559
butcher instruments,

423
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:32,160
Any place where human remains would
have come in contact with granite.

424
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,237
You're not gonna find
nothing like that up here.

425
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,220
- Up here?
- Up here?

426
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:40,888
Old vault, cut right
into the foundation of the place.

427
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,767
Hermetically sealed, insect-proof,

428
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:45,361
constant humidity.

429
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,937
- It's ideal.
- Yeah, well, we gotta get inside.

430
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,459
You want me to kick down the door?

431
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:02,147
When I put your old man in jail,
you said you understood.

432
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,064
Don't start again, Booth.

433
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:07,602
We'll be together
as soon as I replace Zack.

434
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,334
Hey.

435
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,606
How's that going, by the way?

436
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:17,156
We're in. They cracked it.

437
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,068
All right, you got it?

438
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,424
Little bit more.

439
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,524
Easy.

440
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:44,606
You know, maybe you're mad
at me subconsciously.

441
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,487
What? I don't believe in that.

442
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,060
Oh, well, something
has changed between us.

443
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:52,323
You could at least admit
that so we can figure it out.

444
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:56,825
Yeah, I would, yes, if I actually
believed anything had changed.

445
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,651
Get down!

446
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:05,271
Why are your eyes closed?

447
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,957
I thought we were gonna get
blown up.

448
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,151
It's just a transmitter.

449
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:16,868
Now whoever owns this place

450
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,006
knows we're here. Come on.

451
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,852
I'm curious.

452
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,985
In an explosion, how would

453
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:25,332
shutting your eyes help?

454
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,589
It just... it does, okay, Bones?

455
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:30,963
It just does.

456
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,118
Now be careful.

457
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:34,430
We don't know
what else is in here.

458
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:37,311
There's a phrase in ancient Greek

459
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:39,027
burned into the back
of the vault door.

460
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,349
Well, what's it say?

461
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,030
I don't know.
It's in ancient Greek.

462
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:45,742
Dead languages,

463
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,384
Egyptian art,

464
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,454
Pythagorean mathematics,

465
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,372
Hebrew scriptures,

466
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:54,959
Gnosticism, the Kabala,

467
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:57,291
alchemy,

468
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:58,961
Druidism,

469
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:00,924
astrology.

470
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,509
Angela can tell us for sure, but...

471
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,969
I think these artifacts

472
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:06,628
are museum quality.

473
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:10,803
Bingo, baby.

474
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:12,936
I found Gavin Nichols' violin.

475
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:14,690
Bones.

476
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,228
What, Booth?

477
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,213
What did you find?

478
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,652
I... I don't know.

479
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,114
What is that?

480
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,456
Silver?

481
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,217
Not all these bones are silver.

482
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:55,728
It's possible we just found

483
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,106
more of Gavin Nichols.

484
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:00,466
That's Gavin's violin.

485
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:01,709
What else you got?

486
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,073
This altar is made
of the same pink syenite

487
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,614
we found embedded
in Gavin Nichols' skull.

488
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,324
Where's the rest of him?

489
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:11,452
Probably tossed into dump trucks
from overpasses.

490
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:14,831
All of the bones found here
show teeth marks.

491
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,986
Somebody kidnapped a fiddler
and served him for dinner

492
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:21,004
in an old bank vault
stuffed with museum pieces?

493
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,590
I think this is high medieval,

494
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:24,796
Spanish,

495
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:26,676
possibly Calabrian in origin.

496
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:30,927
12th-century Calabrian?

497
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,210
You know what that means?

498
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,562
The Order of Alcantara?

499
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,784
You people have no idea of the reach
of the Illuminati, do you?

500
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:44,584
Tell you what else.

501
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,787
This old bank

502
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,780
is an original vortex point
on the triangular grid

503
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,542
designed by the infamous
architect of D.C.,

504
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,442
Pierre Charles L'Enfant,

505
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,866
not to mention. The way
that this skeleton's displayed...

506
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:57,248
Okay, okay, we get it.

507
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,893
This is the lair of
a cannibalistic secret society.

508
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,247
Hey, you know what?
You know all my answers?

509
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,025
Don't ask me the questions.

510
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:09,163
Someone is replacing the silver bones
in this sculpture with human bones.

511
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:13,201
There's no way this manubrium and
this sternum came from the same person.

512
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,053
We got a multiple murder?

513
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:16,404
Is she pleased?

514
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:20,396
Hell, you could go your whole career
without catching something this juicy.

515
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:22,023
Who had access to the building?

516
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,996
- The building conservancy.
- Run those people.

517
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:27,737
Look for priors.
Childhood cat skinning, all that.

518
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:32,194
I'd like permi move the contents
of this room to the Jeffersonian.

519
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,199
It's a bank vault.

520
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,843
There's room in the basement.

521
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,957
I think this may be one of those "Bring
the mountain to Mohammed" situations.

522
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:47,612
You were married by a John Kakala

523
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,455
who was the head man
of a hamlet called Nakavala

524
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,678
on the island of Vatulolo

525
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:57,590
during a feast in honor
of the shark god Daquwaka.

526
00:24:57,902 --> 00:24:59,408
Uh, doesn't sound wrong.

527
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,993
Can't this head man tell
you who Angela married?

528
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:03,024
He's dead.

529
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:05,231
Town was wiped out
by a tsunami two years ago. The...

530
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:08,052
island is deserted and no one wants
to talk because the whole place

531
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:10,285
is haunted and... cursed.

532
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:11,918
Of course it is. Yeah.

533
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:16,189
Do you happen to rember
any Australians?

534
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:17,929
Okay.

535
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,594
Look, they have this...

536
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:23,334
local drink called kava

537
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,253
that is really...

538
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,822
Anyway, when it comes
to memory, no,

539
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:30,591
not so much.

540
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,938
Which is probably why
when I tried to sketch him...

541
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:39,934
I only came up with this.

542
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,061
Handsome.

543
00:25:45,886 --> 00:25:47,290
Why Australians?

544
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:50,733
Well, on or around the date
of the marriage license, the...

545
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,694
there was a tramp
steamer out of Adelaide

546
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,244
The innocent Citymay or may
not have been docked in Vatulolo.

547
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:00,697
Let's... track that steamer down.

548
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:03,958
- It's gonna cost.
- Not an issue.

549
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,253
Thanks.

550
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,136
You having second thoughts?

551
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,494
You kidding?

552
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,688
Hey, this is great.

553
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,874
Like we're on some
epic adventure.

554
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:28,925
Adventure?

555
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,190
These are the bones
we found on the altar.

556
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:37,559
Can you confirm that any
of these are Gavin Nichols'?

557
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:40,076
To be 100% positive,
we'd have to check DNA.

558
00:26:40,124 --> 00:26:41,699
All right, let's get that going.

559
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:45,413
Bones, I mean, you see
what's going on here, right?

560
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:47,293
What are you talking about?

561
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,995
You're getting them all
to help you now.

562
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,474
Booth, the vault is filled
with priceless artifacts.

563
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:53,893
And probably material stolen
from other victims.

564
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:56,083
It's gonna take months
to sift through that evidence.

565
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,117
No, this is enabling.

566
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,347
You're enabling somebody
with a mental problem.

567
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,146
- Zack...
- No, you.

568
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:04,373
You, Bones. You're the one
with the mental problem.

569
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,925
Oh, it's Zack! It's...

570
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,154
What are you doing here?

571
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:17,972
Can I, can I move back
into the place above your garage?

572
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,702
Are you kidding?

573
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,982
Of course! Come here!

574
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:25,748
Welcome home, Zack.

575
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:27,792
Did you get wounded or something?

576
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:29,961
No, they just sent me home.

577
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:31,921
When can you start work?

578
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:34,918
Nice meeting you, bub.

579
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,593
If you didn't fill my job.
Who's that guy?

580
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:39,522
Nobody.

581
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:41,643
Men...

582
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:43,357
you look like crap.

583
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,096
Iraq's not a vacation.

584
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,461
I think you look very rakish.

585
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:49,088
Are you starving?

586
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:52,794
Actually, what I'd like is to get into
whatever it was you were talking about

587
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,972
before Dr. Brennan's
mental problem.

588
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:03,636
It's hard to concentrate
when you're all staring at me.

589
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:07,222
They're happy to see you.

590
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:10,659
The depth of the teeth scoring on
this skull suggests that it was cooked.

591
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:14,504
Meaning the victim was dead
when his face was eaten,

592
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:18,000
which is good, I guess,
given the alternative.

593
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:20,980
I'm seeing an interesting
pattern in this scoring.

594
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,559
From the windshield?

595
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,576
It appears so,

596
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:25,959
but if you kind of unfocus your eyes

597
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:28,519
and allow patterns to arise
from what looks like chaos,

598
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,920
here, here, here.

599
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,437
I didn't notice that.

600
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:35,779
This scoring is different
from both the gnawing marks

601
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:38,465
and the damage caused by crashing
through the windshield.

602
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:44,018
What is that?

603
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:45,104
I don't know.

604
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:47,719
Did you run it through
the X-ray diffractometer?

605
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,820
And also X-ray microfluorescence.

606
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,135
Neither showed trace evidence
of anything left on the bone

607
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,535
by whatever etched that groove.

608
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,216
Well, that's our answer then.

609
00:28:57,142 --> 00:28:58,869
But the answer was nothing.

610
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:02,495
So our cannibal has a diamond tooth?

611
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:03,997
Well, not the entire tooth.

612
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,362
The diamond inset;
left lateral incisor.

613
00:29:07,265 --> 00:29:09,444
It left a distinct mark on the skull.

614
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,231
So if someone in the building
conservancy

615
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,358
or cleaning crew
has a diamond in his tooth,

616
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,443
that's our guy.

617
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:17,447
You got 'em.

618
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:21,450
I'd like to be in on it
when you interrogate him.

619
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:24,509
What?

620
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:26,248
You would?

621
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,026
Why are you surprised?

622
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,029
Are you serious?

623
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:35,986
I've been trying to get you out
of the lab since Zack left.

624
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,901
Well, Zack's back so here I am.

625
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:38,991
That simple?

626
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:40,049
Why?

627
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:42,337
Did Angela say something to you?

628
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,757
No. Angela, why?

629
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:45,885
What?

630
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:48,204
I told you this isn't about psychology.

631
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,009
Fine, fine.

632
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,429
Hey, you know what I say, huh?

633
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:54,179
Welcome home, Zack.

634
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,470
No, it's not just because
you have a diamond tooth.

635
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,178
You don't know why you're here, Jason?

636
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:03,072
It seems like that part should be
your responsibility.

637
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,498
Think about it.
You're a smart boy, Jason.

638
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:07,260
You went to private school.

639
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:08,408
Six of them.

640
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,511
Got kicked out of every one.

641
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,742
Yeah, for attacking people
in their sleep.

642
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:14,960
I got counseling.

643
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:16,470
I'm cured.

644
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:19,917
So, you did your little community
service, mopping floors

645
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:21,536
for the historical site people.

646
00:30:21,758 --> 00:30:23,637
How the hell did you get in the vault?

647
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:25,067
At the old bank?

648
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:27,414
He just doesn't really strike me
as the kind of guy

649
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,041
who would sit beside a vault
all night listening to tumblers

650
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,083
through a stethoscope.

651
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,942
He probably found the combination
while he was cleaning up somewhere.

652
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:37,594
Nobody can get in the vault.
It's what you call "impregnable."

653
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:39,993
Not true.

654
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,325
This is the transmitter
we found in the vault.

655
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:48,642
Normal guy

656
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:51,197
comes across
a treasure in a vault,

657
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,364
starts, what? Selling it off?

658
00:30:53,922 --> 00:30:55,632
You went a whole different way.

659
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,147
Could you bite this, please?

660
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:09,412
No.

661
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:11,574
Dr. Brennan
was only being polite.

662
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,585
We have a warrant for that,
too, Jason, so

663
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,513
either you bite or I'll make you.

664
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,010
What do you need it for?

665
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:24,774
The diamond in your incisor
left a mark on the skull.

666
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,635
The skull that you gnawed on.

667
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:41,208
It's not like chicken or pork,
you know?

668
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,519
People always say that.

669
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,787
It's more like beef.

670
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:50,896
The face is a little sweeter.

671
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,615
More tender.

672
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,548
The younger the person, the better.

673
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,730
Except for babies.

674
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,505
Babies taste kind of like fish.

675
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:13,001
Have you been to bed yet?

676
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:16,893
Iraq is from a different time zone.
I can't seem to sleep right now.

677
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:21,362
Fibula and tibia of the right leg
are from the same person.

678
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:23,261
Left femur from a different person.

679
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,702
Three phalanges and one metacarpal,

680
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:27,566
essentially an entire little finger,

681
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,432
are from yet another person.

682
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:31,200
Probably the violinist.

683
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:32,262
How can you tell?

684
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:35,016
Pressure indicator's consistent
with years of practice.

685
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,035
Manubrium and gladiolus

686
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:39,576
originate from two additional
separate people.

687
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,094
And this floating rib,

688
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,902
an anatomically superfluous
rib by the way,

689
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:46,553
is from yet another human being.

690
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,182
Ten bones from six separate victims.

691
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,235
Yes.

692
00:32:50,287 --> 00:32:53,028
Obviously, Jason Harkness
was collecting parts

693
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,908
from different people to create...

694
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,255
- what?
- I don't know.

695
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:00,470
There's potential
for a lot of victims here.

696
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,086
But we caught him.

697
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,659
Yes, we did, Zack.

698
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:08,328
Dr. Brennan always says that
catching the bad guy is only part of it.

699
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:11,467
The rest is knowing absolutely
everything about the evidence.

700
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:16,124
Why did they send you back from Iraq?

701
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,025
I failed to assimilate.

702
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,674
Despite my accomplishments,

703
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:23,756
I was detrimental
to a military team approach.

704
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:26,009
You're very good
for our team approach.

705
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,254
The army psychiatrist told me
that I should question

706
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:31,081
why the Jeffersonian is the only place
that I can fit in.

707
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,737
All due respect to
the army psychiatrist,

708
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,584
but that's a hell of a lot more
than some people get.

709
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,921
Go home, Zackaroni.
Get some rest.

710
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,174
Do you recognize
any of these men?

711
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:54,160
How is this any better
than Angela's sketch?

712
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:55,205
That's him.

713
00:33:56,824 --> 00:34:00,064
I mean,
he fits the general silhouette.

714
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,975
You forgot to mention
that he was a giant.

715
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:05,891
Well, this may or may not be

716
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:08,180
the crew of the Australian tramp steamer
lnnocent City.

717
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:10,244
It was scuttled six months after
you were married.

718
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:12,559
His hands are like snow shovels.

719
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:16,429
The man that you're pointing to is known
as "Birimbau"to his crewmates.

720
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:18,809
That's it. His name is Birimbau.

721
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,844
"Birimbau" is obviously a nickname.

722
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,174
It's a Brazilian flute.

723
00:34:23,238 --> 00:34:25,182
Did he speak Portuguese by any chance?

724
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:28,302
Yeah, he most definitely
had an accent.

725
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,559
I mean, look at this man.

726
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:34,845
How hard can it be
to find a guy like that?

727
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:37,276
Probably see him
from the space shuttle.

728
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:39,814
Did Birimbau die
when his ship sank?

729
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,477
Oh, that'd be great.

730
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,147
No, no.

731
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:47,565
What I mean is
we can have him declared dead.

732
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,138
- He didn't die.
- Too bad.

733
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:51,789
Last time I found him
he signed onto a Liberian

734
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,792
oil tanker bound for Tierra Del Fuego.

735
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:57,429
Okay, that narrows it down.

736
00:34:57,781 --> 00:34:58,999
He's a sailor,

737
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:02,273
he's maybe Brazilian
and he's named after a flute.

738
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:05,352
You know what else narrows
it down? He's a titan.

739
00:35:05,763 --> 00:35:07,388
Half man, half god.

740
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,431
I mean, I can see why...

741
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,460
why you...

742
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:13,105
I mean, I totally...
I do, I get it.

743
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,699
Hodgins, stop it.

744
00:35:14,886 --> 00:35:16,712
Do I keep looking?

745
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:19,004
Because...
if you just wait three years,

746
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,423
I mean, you can declare him dead.

747
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:23,853
Do you want to wait three years?

748
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,857
Do you?

749
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:30,202
Definitely, absolutely not.

750
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:33,879
Me either.

751
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,839
Keep searching, Mr. Doyley.

752
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:47,800
- Zack. Zack.
- What did he say?

753
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,241
He said he needed to show us
something immediately.

754
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:51,289
Show us what?

755
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,616
I don't know, he didn't say.
That's why we're here.

756
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:55,176
Look out. Zack.

757
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,514
Why are you listening to my chest?

758
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:03,447
- Because I thought you were dead.
- Why?

759
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:06,283
You're lying on a stainless steel
table for dead people.

760
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,560
I got tired.

761
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:11,923
New rules, okay? Sleeping is for
couches and beds, stuff like that.

762
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:15,568
- Oh... my... God.
- What?

763
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:17,300
I thought you'd want to know.
What?

764
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:19,981
You compared death,
apogee and dimension?

765
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:21,485
Yes, three times.

766
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:25,053
And there's no way it was a case
of pre and post diamond-inset?

767
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:27,261
What? What? What?

768
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:30,525
The newest bones, the phalanges
and the skull

769
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,944
bear only gnaw marks
of Jason Harkness.

770
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:37,702
One bone, the femur, was gnawed
upon by Jason and a second person.

771
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:39,685
See the distinct second pattern?

772
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,247
So Jason invited
a guest over for dinner.

773
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,161
I don't know how to answer that.

774
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:46,498
No, Jason was the one invited.

775
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:47,626
How do you know?

776
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,875
The oldest bones were gnawed
on by another person

777
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,164
with no diamond in his incisor.

778
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:54,558
Another person.

779
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,075
Not Jason.

780
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:59,315
There's... someone else out there.

781
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:02,798
Probably someone older
who pulled Jason into this.

782
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:06,183
Good work, Zack.

783
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:09,869
See why he should never have left?

784
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:13,920
Great, thanks.

785
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,720
Show them your badge again.

786
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:19,056
No, they don't see why we have
to see Jason in the middle of the night.

787
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,882
The shift changes in two hours.

788
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,621
Hell, they could make us
wait till morning.

789
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:36,574
No, you weren't upset
because Zack was gone.

790
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:37,892
Yes, I was.

791
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:40,310
Okay, yeah, but you were
more upset over the fact

792
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,593
that I didn't stop him from
going in the first place.

793
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,931
I mean, look,
I could've said to him,

794
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:46,810
"Zack, Iraq is no place
for a guy like you.

795
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,427
And he'd never have left.

796
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:50,469
You could've stopped him.

797
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:51,908
Why didn't you do that?

798
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:54,759
Whatever Zack's deal is, okay,

799
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,708
his weirdness,
whatever you want to call it...

800
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:57,806
I call it genius.

801
00:37:57,862 --> 00:38:00,067
You know, he's a man, he's a...

802
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:03,383
He's a strange man,
but he's a man

803
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:06,137
who wanted to serve
a larger purpose.

804
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,914
This is some alpha male
rite of passage?

805
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:10,491
You mean go to war?

806
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:11,537
Wrong.

807
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,780
Zack needed to leave the nest.

808
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,463
The same way you did
when you wanted to leave the lab

809
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:18,489
and see the world for the first time.

810
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:20,095
And I helped you do that.

811
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:23,440
How could I stop Zack from doing
the exact same thing in his own way?

812
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,059
Agent Booth.

813
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,716
So, we came in to wake him,
this is what we found.

814
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:32,916
Oh, my God.

815
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,867
We're going to full lockdown.

816
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:55,258
Booth says you need me?

817
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:59,236
I noticed that Jason Harkness
arranged his suicide...

818
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:02,342
If it was a suicide, then somebody
provided him with the dagger.

819
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:06,523
His body is arranged in the same
position as the silver skeleton.

820
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,180
So, Hodgins, you think
that's a coincidence?

821
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:13,192
So suddenly you think my insane

822
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,857
conspiracy ravings are legitimate?

823
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:21,085
But, obviously, there are other
insane people out there

824
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,499
who have the same ravings
and we need your insight.

825
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:25,314
All right.

826
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,074
All right, both the body
and the silver skeleton

827
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:34,688
are in the attitude of what
the ancient Greeks called "Pharmakos."

828
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:37,892
It means "scapegoat"or "sacrifice.

829
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:40,746
So what, like he's being pulled
into the sky against his will?

830
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:42,515
You mean aliens?

831
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:46,344
One definite possibility, yes.

832
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,115
Also the "Rapture."

833
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:50,609
Now, as I tried to tell you before,

834
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:53,746
most secret societies have
this figure deep in their origins.

835
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,388
For Freemasons, it's known
as "The Widow's Son."

836
00:39:56,903 --> 00:39:58,314
Interesting.

837
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:01,553
Gavin Nichols lost his father
when he was 12.

838
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:03,046
A widow's son.

839
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:06,285
So Jason Harkness killed himself
to keep his secret society...

840
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:07,480
secret.

841
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:09,088
Or was sacrificed.

842
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,229
Hey, all the signs point to it.

843
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,367
Strictly speaking,
the evidence so far

844
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:15,463
indicates only one other murder.

845
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,205
This entire vault's filled
with evidence.

846
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,639
Who knows where it'll take us.

847
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:19,976
Deeper than you can imagine.

848
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:22,329
Probably get us all killed,
just so you know.

849
00:40:22,448 --> 00:40:23,458
Thanks, man.

850
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,032
No, no, Hodgins, Hodgins. Really.

851
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,578
Thanks, man.

852
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:31,378
Yeah, man.

853
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,358
Be safe.

854
00:40:42,283 --> 00:40:45,408
Ancient Greek section translated
the motto on the back of the vault door.

855
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:47,698
"Will no one help the widow's son?"

856
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,276
Hodgins was right.
This killer's part of something bigger.

857
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,779
- Here's your coffee.
- Gavin Nichols' violin was in there.

858
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:55,398
I bet there are belongings
from other murder victims, too.

859
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,559
We have to catalogue
every item in that vault.

860
00:40:57,603 --> 00:40:59,240
- Hot coffee.
After we do a visual

861
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,670
and microscopic examination
of each human bone

862
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,186
in the silver skeleton,
we'll take samples

863
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,649
and do an in-depth
auxiological breakdown.

864
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:08,086
We really have a lot to do.

865
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:10,281
Yeah, starting with coffee.

866
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,729
An isotope profile

867
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,141
will allow us to narrow
down possible geographical...

868
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,423
Hey, it's hot.

869
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:23,242
You're going to burn yourself, Bones.

870
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:27,536
Thank you.

871
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:32,795
Listen, this whole serial killer...

872
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,940
it's not going to be our usual case.

873
00:41:35,228 --> 00:41:37,510
- Why?
- Why?Because it's big and he's bad.

874
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:39,247
I don't see
what difference that makes.

875
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:41,712
Because you have to slow down.
All right? Take a breath.

876
00:41:42,352 --> 00:41:44,582
You have to realize that
this is not a sprint,

877
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:45,770
it's gonna be a marathon.

878
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:49,262
Marathon, Bones, coming from the Greek,
meaning really, really,

879
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:50,507
really long run.

880
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,919
That's now how
the word "marathon" originated.

881
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:58,379
Look, there's something else I got
to know, and it's important.

882
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:01,932
We solid?

883
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:03,836
You and me?

884
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:06,938
- Yeah.
- No, not just you and me.

885
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:08,471
The squints, too.

886
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:10,181
Zack is back for good.

887
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:12,671
Angela and Hodgins have
their head back in the game.

888
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:13,964
Cam, she's locked in.

889
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:16,394
- Why are you asking me this?
- Because...

890
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:20,117
you and me, we're the center.

891
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:23,708
And the center must hold.

892
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:25,577
Right, so...

893
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,658
are we gonna hold?

894
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:29,441
Yeah.

895
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,281
We'll hold.

896
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,200
We're the center.

897
00:42:37,236 --> 00:42:38,406
The center.

898
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:44,809
What's funny?

899
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:46,631
I thought you were
gonna kiss my hand again.

900
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,296
I did not kiss your hand.
You put it over my coffee cup.

901
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:53,156
Well... felt like you kissed it.

902
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:54,679
Felt like it.
