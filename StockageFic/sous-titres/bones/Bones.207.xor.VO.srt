4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,650
They found the victim in the filtration system.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,730
Just,you know,some bones,and nobody knows what to make of them.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,860
Look at this-

7
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,380
millions of tax dollars are spent 
to clean and treat tap water

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,390
and yet people spend billions on bottled water.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,330
Well,it's cleaner. Look.
Comes from a clean mountain stream.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,840
Yeah. Which contains fecal matter from animals.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,430
No bones in it,though,is there?

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,660
Excuse me.

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,880
Do you know how long this is going to take?

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,260
Department wants to know when I can get back online.

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,880
Any way to determine where the body originated?

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,590
Water comes here through pipelines

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,300
that travel through five different states.

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,430
That's why I called the Feds in.

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,300
Great. How many miles of pipe?

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,200
About 1,800.

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,250
Okay. I'm going to need a schematic of 
the entire system as soon as you can.

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,410
Sure.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,400
Yeah. Bones?

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,600
Well,swirl treatment sped the rate of decomp.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,600
Death was most likely less than three months ago.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,260
The sacrum is small- still developing.

27
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,480
A kid.

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,650
A little girl.

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,760
About eight to ten years old.

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,470
Okay. Any luck with cause of death?

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,640
Postmortem trauma makes assignation of cause difficult.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,890
Great. "No" would have been just fine.

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,170
There are bands of discoloration on the ribs.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,800
Cam might find out why with a tox screen.

35
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,920
I'd like those clothes as soon as I can get them.

36
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,920
Lots of crusty bugs and slime.

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,480
All yours.

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,050
Zack,spend some time with the teeth.

39
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,610
They should be more discolored.

40
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,710
Everything okay here?

41
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,380
Yeah. Sure. Hey.You know?

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,480
How's things?

43
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,060
You know.Murder and stuff.

44
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,460
Just another day at the office. 
How about you?

45
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,750
Same ol' same ol'.

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,020
Listen,the Bureau's running location checks 
for registered pedophiles in the area

47
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,100
but we can't do much until we,you know,I.D. the girl.

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,460
I'm running DNA on the hairs I pulled from the skull.

49
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,770
There's something funky about it.

50
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,960
The roots confirm brown hair.

51
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,970
The blond is from oxidized thiols evident in the hair shaft.

52
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,070
Her hair was bleached?

53
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,330
Right. Come on,what nine-year-old dyes her hair?

54
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,630
Well,it may explain why my sketch isn't getting any hits

55
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,390
from the Missing Children's database.

56
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,240
Zack,look at the remains again with a focus

57
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,550
on any physical anomalies that could hamper identification.

58
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,260
I've got results cooking,so...

59
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,190
Sure,yeah. See you later.

60
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,220
Don't you have work to do?

61
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,440
Don't you?

62
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,780
Right. Right.

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,970
I should be able to run a tox screen with 
the tissue left on her clavicle.

64
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,930
The scrapings I took from the cheek and eye socket

65
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,610
contain propylene glycol

66
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,610
fragrance,dyes and lanolin.

67
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,110
She was wearing make-up?

68
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,300
I was going to use dentition to narrow down the age range

69
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,740
but look.

70
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,010
She has false teeth?

71
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,370
What the hell happened to this kid?

72
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,570
The false teeth replaced the missing deciduous teeth.

73
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,200
Baby teeth.

74
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,830
And the other teeth were veneered.

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,990
What is she,a midget stripper?

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,750
Okay,this is the color she would've had from the bleaching.

77
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,880
I think the alkaloids would make the color brighter.

78
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,120
Okay,so some twisted psycho killer

79
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,750
gives this little girl a makeover before he kills her?

80
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,460
I hate working with kids.

81
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,670
Childhood should be all about swings.

82
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,000
Swings?

83
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,880
Yeah.

84
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,400
You know,how high can I go?

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,030
If I twist the chains,how fast will I spin?

86
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,350
What if I try to jump off before the swing stops?

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,370
Exactly.

88
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,600
I miss that feeling.

89
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,680
Yeah. Me,too.

90
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,080
I miss organic chemistry class.

91
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,560
Those were good times.

92
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,110
I miss my first microscope.

93
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,830
Great. Yeah. And I miss normal people.
Can we go on?

94
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,810
Factor in the teeth.

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,290
Yeah,you know,because this isn't weird enough.

96
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,100
Hodgins supplied the types of makeup

97
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,130
and that's what we've got.

98
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,330
She looks 30.

99
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,730
Okay. Run the image against the database now.

100
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,390
Oh,my God. That's Brianna Swanson.

101
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,310
Who?

102
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,590
Little beauty queen who disappeared a few months ago.

103
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,470
In the middle of a Little Miss Junior Patriot Pageant.

104
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,300
Just nine years old.

105
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,400
What do you mean?

106
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,630
there isn't even enough of her for me to see?

107
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,350
The body traveled through miles of piping

108
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,650
and then after three months...

109
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,140
She was so beautiful,wasn't she?

110
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,590
I always thought someday she'd come back.

111
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,430
I even filled out her application for 
the Junior Miss Starlight Competition.

112
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,130
She would have won her division.

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,690
We're very sorry for your loss.

114
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,310
Ms. Swanson,

115
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,000
I discovered dental work on Brianna one doesn't

116
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,560
usually see on a child.

117
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,030
The veneers and the caps? Yes.

118
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,520
A lot of the girls have them.

119
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,640
Statistically,that's... that's not true.

120
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,780
Well,Brianna took some antibiotics

121
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,590
when she was a baby that stained her teeth.

122
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,870
She was very self-conscious about that

123
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,550
so I wanted her to feel good about herself.

124
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,090
A nine-year-old is hardly mature enough

125
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,630
to make an informed decision about...

126
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,840
You were at the competition in Delaware

127
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,740
when Brianna went missing. Correct?

128
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,740
Yeah. I never missed a pageant. I never would.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,290
But you weren't...

130
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,880
you weren't with her when she disappeared?

131
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,600
No. I left her alone in our room for a minute.

132
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,460
When I came back,she was gone.

133
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,610
There's not a day that goes by that 
I don't hate myself for that.

134
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,390
According to initial reports
you suspected your ex-husband of kidnapping Brianna?

135
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,370
Well,he was trying to get custody of here for over a year.

136
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,650
David was not fit to be a father.

137
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,280
He wanted Brianna out of spite.

138
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,540
He tried to drown me in lawyer fees.

139
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,430
Was your ex-husband violent with you or Brianna?

140
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,060
Not physically,no.

141
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,590
But once,when we were fighting,

142
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,200
he said that he would rather have Brianna

143
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,900
end up in a ditch somewhere than turn out like me.

144
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,260
It's the "evening wear" category that gets me.

145
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,670
My evening wear is a ratty T- shirt and a mud mask.

146
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,720
There's bleeding evident under the mental foramen.

147
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,580
There was complete disruption of all ventral ligaments

148
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,780
between the victim's skull and the first and second vertebrae.

149
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,110
Her neck was broken.

150
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,760
Dislocated fracture of the mandible

151
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,220
suggests her death was caused by a strong blow to the chin

152
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,050
by an object heavy enough to leave markings on her

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,130
mental foramen.

154
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,020
I found fragments of steel in the victim's jacket.

155
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,600
There was also an excessive amount of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

156
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,650
I assume that means something.

157
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,590
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are found in soot,

158
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,240
pesticides,creosotes,roofing tar...

159
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,470
The original police report said Brianna's father was a roofer.

160
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,950
Yeah. Interesting coincidence,huh?

161
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,790
I'll call Booth.

162
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,780
About this?

163
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,400
You have a roofing business?

164
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,370
Uh... Yeah.

165
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,310
I.. I went out on my own when Brianna was born.

166
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,550
Thought I could make some more money,you know?

167
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,910
Do you use mastic asphalt in your work?

168
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,760
Uh,yeah. For waterproofing. Why?

169
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,020
Were you working the day your daughter disappeared?

170
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,260
No. It was a weekend.

171
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,990
What are you guys getting at?

172
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,270
We're just trying to piece things together.

173
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,400
Damn it,I answered all these questions 
when Brianna first went missing!

174
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,510
This is Jackie's doing.Right?

175
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,240
You wanted your daughter back.

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,010
Sometimes,in a divorce,emotions get a little high

177
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,240
you don't know what you're doing...

178
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,800
No. I know exactly what happened.

179
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,700
Jackie wasted so much time

180
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,630
having the cops check me out the case went cold.

181
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,900
This is all Jackie's fault.

182
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,530
Look.

183
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,630
This was my little girl.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,560
Not what Jackie turned her into.

185
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,800
This is who I wanted back.

186
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,510
You,uh... you didn't give her the remains,did you?

187
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,080
No. We can't release them.

188
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,780
Not before the investigation is completed.

189
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,820
I want her buried right.

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,150
I don't want her funeral to be some 
disgusting show Jackie puts on.

191
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,550
I want to bury her with some love,you know?

192
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,260
How's it going?

193
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,860
FBI sent over the security tapes from the hotel

194
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,550
where Brianna's pageant was held.

195
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,070
I'm running them through the body mass recognition program.

196
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,230
Maybe we'll find a shot of her leaving with somebody.

197
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,080
Could you ever do this to your kid?

198
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,000
You know me.

199
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,690
I'm all about the swings.

200
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,010
Did you bring me something?

201
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,850
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. This was in the zippered pocket

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
of what was left of Brianna's jacket.

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
It's treated cellulose.

204
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,720
Can you get any details from it?

205
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,540
I'll give it a shot.

206
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,120
Listen,Angela

207
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,600
we've been dancing around this for months now

208
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,800
like two pieces of neodymium caught in a magnetic field.

209
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,690
Is that good?

210
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,170
Yeah. But,if the field weakens,they fly apart.

211
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,520
Which is why I thought they should go on a date.

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,170
Hodgins...

213
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,030
You can't say that you don't feel it.

214
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,360
Come on. We owe it to ourselves to give it a try.

215
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,840
I... I just don't think it would be a good idea.

216
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,410
I mean,we work together,Jack.

217
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,410
Angela...

218
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,850
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,400
You're making a mistake.

220
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,250
I'll examine the paper after I go through the videos.

221
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,020
Sure.

222
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,080
This is the rib cage of a healthy ten-year-old girl.

223
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,830
And this is our victim's rib cage.

224
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,060
Ouch.

225
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,360
This is an X ray of a teenage girl who died in 1872.

226
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,480
What caused the deformity? Was it genetic?

227
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,850
It was a corset.

228
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,300
Tightened a little more each day.

229
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,330
Based on the degree of misshaping,

230
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,760
I'd say Brianna slept in one every night.

231
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,140
That's torture.

232
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,360
I imagine it was to give her an hourglass figure

233
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,670
which wouldn't be possible naturally until well into puberty.

234
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,450
You got to be...You're telling me her mom did this did her?

235
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
People have done much worse for beauty.

236
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,460
Neck stretching,foot binding.

237
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,130
Okay,and you're saying that makes it okay?

238
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,200
Well,of course not.

239
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,410
Any major alteration of our underlying architecture demeans us.

240
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,430
You know,we all have aspects of ourselves

241
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,620
we might wish were different.

242
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,490
Yes. I wanted larger biceps

243
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,080
before I became comfortable with my mental acuity.

244
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,620
Here...you can see

245
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,510
cribra orbitalia,suggesting Brianna

246
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,690
suffered from long-term malnourishment.

247
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,900
There's no enamel erosion to indicate bulimia

248
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,270
so it's more likely she's been on a 
calorie-controlled diet for at least two years.

249
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,410
Oh,it gets better.

250
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,020
Oh,how can it not?

251
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,800
Her tox screen came back with traces of somatropin

252
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,460
tetracycline,and glycopyrronium bromide.

253
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,830
Human growth hormone

254
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,340
broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat acne

255
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,620
and a chemical mixture that controls perspiration.

256
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,750
All with serious side effects.

257
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,350
No prescriptions were ever issued.

258
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,050
So Mom bound,starved and drugged her.

259
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,140
That's heartwarming.

260
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,390
Our society puts a premium on beauty

261
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,260
common in declining cultures.

262
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,610
Hey,guys,you should take a look at this.

263
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,310
This was time-stamped a half hour before

264
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,040
Jackie Swanson reported Brianna missing.

265
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,560
There.

266
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,060
She said not a day goes by that she doesn't hate herself.

267
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,620
I can see why.

268
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,320
If Jackie's willing to risk her child's 
life to win these pageants...

269
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,500
What would happen if the daughter refused to be beaten

270
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,840
what you understand is that this was Brianna's dream,not mine.

271
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,200
You put your nine-year-old daughter in a corset,Ms. Swanson.

272
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,880
Corset.

273
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,820
Yeah,Brianna ordered that off the Internet herself

274
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,800
and I didn't tighten it up very much.

275
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,160
Did you ever think to tell Brianna that

276
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,690
she didn't need to alter her physical appearance 
in order to be loved?

277
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,480
Did Brianna disappoint you somehow?

278
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,120
No. She was a perfect angel.

279
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
She won every competition,even her first one.

280
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,450
And after that,it was music and dance classes.

281
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,670
She was a real competitor.

282
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,680
And when she won,it reflected well on you.

283
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,540
That way you wouldn't have to 
deal with your own physical identity.

284
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,280
I don't like her.

285
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh. Let's...

286
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,260
play a little show-and-tell,shall we,hm?

287
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,610
How about this? Can you explain these?

288
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,390
Those there...

289
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,000
And,then,that one.My favorite one.

290
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,810
Okay,these...

291
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,750
these were right before she disappeared.

292
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,960
We had a... disagreement.

293
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,120
About the pageant?

294
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,020
No. About her piano piece-

295
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,180
I suggested she use her elbow to hit 
the last note with her head in her hands

296
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,440
give the audience a little smile- it's called dazzle.

297
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,730
And she didn't want to do that.

298
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,580
No,she didn't want dazzle,she wanted to finish it perfectly.

299
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,070
But it seems very silly now.

300
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,670
Only now?

301
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,450
What happened immediately following this?

302
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,730
I sent her up to our room

303
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,220
and I sent myself to the hotel bar 
for a very large glass of rose.

304
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,190
And believe me,I was not the only mother 
doing the exact same thing

305
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,100
Great.

306
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm sure you can,provide me with a list of the other mothers.

307
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,920
Blood would have rushed to the injured areas

308
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,820
that are evident on her X rays,but

309
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,500
there's no evidence of blood flow here or here or here.

310
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,110
So she was beaten after she died.

311
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,040
The blows appear to be consistent with kicking,

312
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,170
but the dispersal pattern is abnormal.

313
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,290
Can you tell anything about the shoes?Size? Make?

314
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,340
Only that they are quite rigid.

315
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,130
Possibly steel-toed.

316
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,950
And Hodgins said he found fragments of steel in the jacket.

317
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,250
Hodgins asked me out.

318
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,000
Is that why you're hiding in here?

319
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,690
I'm not hiding.

320
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,520
I need advice.

321
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,830
What,on a personal matter?

322
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,200
Yes.

323
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,460
From me?!

324
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,870
Yes. But...

325
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,930
romance is sort of...

326
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,490
This is like me asking you advice on 
phylogenetic systematics.

327
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,070
Phylogenetic systematics?

328
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,700
I have no idea what that is.

329
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,600
Exactly.

330
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,860
Well,I can't ask Cam.

331
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,580
Can't ask Cam what?

332
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,780
Oh,Hodgins asked Angela out on a date.

333
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,700
Brennan!

334
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,380
Wa... Was it a secret?

335
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,960
It was a secret.

336
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,850
I just came to ask if you'd made any progress on the cellulose.

337
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,990
Oh,no.

338
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,290
Okay.

339
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,420
Wait.

340
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,080
You can't pretend you didn't hear about this.

341
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,670
Fine. What'd you tell him?

342
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,930
No.

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
Why?

344
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,610
Because it would be a disaster.

345
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,980
All of a sudden,you have an opinion on this?

346
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,300
You should never indulge in a romantic relationship

347
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,530
with someone you work with.

348
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,540
Why not?

349
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,370
Well,anthropologically?

350
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,620
There's an anthropological answer?

351
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,190
An efficient workplace is predicated upon a simple hierarchy.

352
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,420
Romance undermines that hierarchy.

353
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,470
This is like when I had an affair with 
my thesis supervisor in college.

354
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,990
Don't think we have time for that.

355
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,020
I say go.

356
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,660
What about this hierarchical,sexual...

357
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,060
Won't be an issue.

358
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,850
It's always fun to flirt in the workplace,but out there,

359
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,440
when fantasy becomes a reality,it's a drag.

360
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,110
Wha...? The date will be bad?

361
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,600
It will be awful.

362
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,690
You'll both realize it's not meant to be.

363
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,780
There'll be a couple days of awkwardness

364
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,600
and then everything goes back to normal.

365
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,300
If I were you,I'd go with Cam on this one.

366
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,020
Why?

367
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,880
Phido-genetic systematics.

368
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,400
I have to go to dance class.

369
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,190
Jackie Swanson's alibi checks out-

370
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,170
she was in the bar when Brianna disappeared.

371
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,030
Eh,can't we just prosecute her for being horrible?

372
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,010
Is that the dance teacher?

373
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,010
Yeah. That's Charlotte Craft.

374
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,270
She owns the studio.

375
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,800
She also runs the Junior Miss Patriot Pageant.

376
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,550
I mean,she's got to be able to give us something,right?

377
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,740
I always wanted to take dance,but I was... so

378
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,280
gawky and uncoordinated.

379
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,390
What,you?

380
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,870
Later I understood that the...

381
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,880
gawkiness was caused by an asymmetrical 
development of the iliac crest.

382
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,770
Oh,yeah,because,you know what,

383
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,890
that's what I would've guessed-the old,uh,iliac crest.

384
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,020
Hi. Which one's yours?

385
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,870
Hm? Which what is what?

386
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,580
Mine? Ours? Ours?

387
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh,no,no. Whoa.We're not,heh,no,no,that's not...

388
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,090
We're... FBI.

389
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,170
Oh,wow. Really?

390
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,200
Oh.Are you here about...Brianna Swanson?

391
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,790
Did you know Brianna?

392
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,930
Yeah. Very well.

393
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,450
I'm Kristen Mitchell.

394
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,110
That's my daughter,Ariel,by the bar,with the gray leg warmers.

395
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,660
They...they took classes together

396
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,600
were in the same pageants.

397
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,120
Sometimes I can't help but wonder

398
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,650
what if it had been Ariel who got kidnapped.

399
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,080
Why do you assume she was kidnapped?

400
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,970
Well,I can't imagine Brianna just running away.

401
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,200
Well,these pageants are very competitive,you know.

402
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,430
There's a lot of pressure,probably,on her.

403
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,910
To Brianna?

404
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,080
Uh,no. No way.

405
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,780
I mean,she had the face of an angel,but underneath,

406
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,850
let's just say she had her sights set on winning that pageant.

407
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,140
Why?

408
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,720
I don't understand the question.

409
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,130
What's the draw here?

410
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,980
Oh,my God,the girls,they love it.

411
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,100
They get to dress up all glamorous,all the attention,

412
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,850
the lights and the music.

413
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,050
All right,girls,that's enough for today.

414
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,120
Thank you very much.

415
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,050
There's enough pressure on young females without...

416
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,680
making them prematurely sexualized.

417
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,970
I'm sorry,

418
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,200
but that is just narrow-minded prejudice.

419
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,770
I was in pageants my entire childhood- I loved 'em.

420
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,580
and...they sent me to college a full scholarship.

421
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,170
Mommy,I'm finished.

422
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,210
Hey,hon!

423
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,310
Nice job!

424
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,230
And good focus.

425
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,780
Thanks

426
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,010
Well,I hope you find the man responsible.

427
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,430
Agent Booth?

428
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,010
I've got about 20 minutes till my next class.

429
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,160
Okay.

430
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,160
Oh,you know,why don't,why don't you go mingle.

431
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,110
What? Why me?

432
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,370
Because you're a girl.

433
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,180
What...?

434
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,990
Listen,because it's illegal for me to question any

435
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,270
of these kids without their parents,okay?

436
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,470
Look,you're a civilian,right?

437
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,990
So take your pick.

438
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,630
Good point.

439
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,690
Behold,the keepers of mystery:

440
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,070
the Sphecius speciosus,and his trusty sidekick,

441
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,670
the Tibicen lyricen.

442
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,960
Ooh...Ah...

443
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,270
What mystery?

444
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,310
If Brianna Swanson was kidnapped,they didn't take her far.

445
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,660
The presence of these two species together suggests that

446
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,670
she died within a one-mile radius of the hotel

447
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,040
where she disappeared.

448
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,950
That whole area was thoroughly searched

449
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,550
within hours of her disappearance.

450
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,870
Yeah.

451
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,480
I think her body was jammed into a 
storm culvert for over a month

452
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,840
until those thunderstorms two weeks ago...

453
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,900
Washed the remains down to the treatment plant.

454
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,170
FBI forensics should check out the culverts and drains

455
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,680
large enough for a nine-year-old girl around the hotel.

456
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,280
I'll tell Booth.

457
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,300
Hi.

458
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,420
Don't come around again looking for a second chance.

459
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,580
That was a one-time offer,baby.

460
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,220
Really?Hm.

461
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,750
No. What?No. N...

462
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,060
No,no,not-not really.

463
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,430
I mean,it never occurred to me that you-you would...

464
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,640
Okay,now you talk.

465
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,780
I accept going on a date with you.Soon.

466
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,300
Tonight?

467
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,060
Wow.That is soon.

468
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,450
I don't want to give you time to change your mind.

469
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,310
What do you want to do?

470
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,350
You asked me.

471
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,770
Figure it out.

472
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,430
Thank you.

473
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,360
I took this at the pageant about a 
half an hour before Brianna disappeared.

474
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,770
Did you show it to the police?

475
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,070
No.

476
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,240
Why not?

477
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,050
Because...he's not some murderous pedophile.

478
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,670
He's the 17-year-old brother of one of the contestants.

479
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,010
Then why'd you take his picture?

480
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,050
Well,to show his parents how creepy he seems hanging around.

481
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,630
He could be such a good-looking boy.

482
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,780
What's his name?

483
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,280
Jeremy Farrell.

484
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,280
Look,I know he dresses in black and mopes around

485
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,600
but he's totally harmless.

486
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm gonna need a copy of this picture.

487
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,590
Certainly.

488
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,490
Is that a real skeleton?

489
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,310
Yes. Of a 12-year-old from the Bronze Age.

490
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,740
These bones show she'd already had children.

491
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,810
What killed her?

492
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,150
Having the children.

493
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,600
She should have waited to be married before she had sex.

494
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,390
You said "sex. "

495
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,910
Were you girls in the Junior Miss Patriot Pageant?

496
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,980
I came in fourth.

497
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,140
If Brianna was there,you'd have been fifth.

498
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,780
Must have been hard to lose your friend like that.

499
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,350
Brianna was kind of mean.

500
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,800
She said Liza had cankles.

501
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,290
What are cankles?

502
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,990
Where your calves and ankles are the same thing.

503
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,160
She took my birthday watch,too.

504
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,400
She'd take anything she liked.

505
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,850
So,you weren't friends?

506
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,370
You had to be friends with her.

507
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,170
Why?

508
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,710
Because Brianna was the queen.

509
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,660
So yours was a cultural structure predicated on the equation

510
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,390
of beauty with power.

511
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,960
You instinctively align yourselves with someone

512
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,340
who holds the greatest potential for societal supremacy.

513
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,200
It's...a Darwinian pressure you're too young to bear.

514
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,890
Okay.Come on,Bon,up you go.There you go.

515
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,280
You have huge muscles.

516
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,840
Thanks.Learn anything?

517
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,190
Yeah,I learned about cankles.

518
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,000
How about you?

519
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,010
I found a possible suspect.

520
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,180
Cam and Zack said that Brianna was 
kicked with a steel-toed boot.

521
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,700
Looks like my possible suspect just became our primary suspect.

522
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,920
Of course,I'm at every pageant.

523
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,740
Okay,you see what happens?

524
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,740
I make him come.

525
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,160
To carry Hailey's changes and the 
props for her talent competition.

526
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,040
Well,you know,a lot of kids his age,they'd just refuse.

527
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,370
Okay,so what,so then I'm a bad kid because I'm a good kid?

528
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,860
What do you call this look?

529
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,970
It's not a look.

530
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,770
Emo. It's called emo.

531
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,850
No,it's not.

532
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,710
It's short for "overly emotive. "

533
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,190
No,Mom,no,it's not.

534
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,780
Okay?I like these clothes. I like this hair.

535
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,440
It's not emo.It's not anything.

536
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,430
Do you have a girlfriend?

537
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,120
He does. She looks exactly like him.

538
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,380
Are you guys,like,real boyfriend and girlfriend?

539
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,750
What do you mean?

540
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,460
I mean,what,do we have sex?

541
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,940
I don't know,you tell me.

542
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,170
Why,because if we don't,

543
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,680
then I'm some pervert who's got a thing for little girls?

544
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,850
The day that this picture was taken

545
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,030
did you speak with Brianna Swanson?

546
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,070
Yeah.

547
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,750
Jeremy.

548
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,550
She was picking on my little sister.

549
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,970
Really. And,uh,did you argue?

550
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,050
You don't argue with a nine year old.
You call each other names.

551
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,750
Are you wearing the same shoes that you wore that day?

552
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,080
No. --Yes.

553
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,770
He's worn the same thing every day for a year.

554
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,410
Would you be willing to give us those shoes?

555
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,400
No. --Yes.

556
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,380
Mom! 

557
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,490
Just this once,Jeremy,do what I tell you,okay?

558
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,490
I know you didn't do this,honey.

559
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,760
I know who you are under all this.

560
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,000
Give the FBI your shoes.

561
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,900
Not the shoes.

562
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,190
How do you know?

563
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,760
First,the caps are plasticized chrome
not stainless steel.

564
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,510
And they're too broad and rounded to have

565
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,180
caused the damage to Brianna Swanson's bones.

566
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,010
Tell Cam and Booth.

567
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,250
You do it.

568
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,320
Why?

569
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,550
Because I have a date.

570
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,320
Here's the thing,Angela...

571
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,240
I know you've been out with a lot of guys.

572
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,620
Hey,you have a different girlfriend twice a month.

573
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,120
Yeah,so imagine the pressure to come up with a date

574
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,660
that neither one of us has ever been on before.

575
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,260
So what's up?

576
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,090
Are we here to walk a dog or something?

577
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,220
I remember what you said about

578
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,810
how you used to feel on a swing.

579
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,000
Looks like colored dots,but it's so faded.

580
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,300
Could this be a candy bar wrapper?

581
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,890
I don't think Brianna was supposed to eat candy.

582
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
There were a lot of things I wasn't supposed

583
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,460
to do as a kid,I still did them.

584
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,870
I haven't changed much.

585
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,770
Bones,is anything on the emo shoes?

586
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,410
Not a match. Sorry.

587
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,500
What's with the Milk Blast bar wrapper?

588
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,320
Milk Blast bar?

589
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,650
Yeah.

590
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,100
What's a Milk Blast bar?

591
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,390
It's about the cheapest,worst ice cream bar you can get.

592
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,450
Available only at Red Shed convenience stores.

593
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,420
<i>Red Shed,what you need now</i>

594
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,610
<i>And how!</i>

595
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
I thought they stopped making them.

596
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,640
I thought I just ate them all.

597
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,800
Maybe we should determine how Brianna Swanson got ahold of one.

598
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,890
Brianna Swanson?

599
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,180
Hodgins found the wrapper with her remains.

600
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,570
Yeah,it's Booth. Listen,I need

601
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,570
a search for any Red Shed convenience store

602
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,140
within a one mile radius of the Hyperion Hotel off 171.

603
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,390
Thanks.

604
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,790
Look,I wouldn't have laughed so hard

605
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,850
if I knew it was Brianna Swanson.

606
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,320
Oh,my God

607
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,400
--Put your head back. Put your head back. 
--I'm gonna puke.

608
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,770
Head back,head back.

609
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,030
--I'm gonna puke,I'm gonna puke.
--No,don't.

610
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,360
You all right?

611
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,920
--Yes.
-- Yeah?

612
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,220
--Not... don't do it again.
--It's fun.

613
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,190
I never thought I'd be doing this again.

614
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,630
Really?--Really.

615
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,640
You know,I had a little dream about it last night.

616
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,630
Did you? --Yeah.

617
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,040
It ended well,too.

618
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,410
I'm sure it did.

619
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
But you know what?

620
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,720
You look much better here.

621
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,030
Better than a dream,huh?

622
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,800
You're shameless.

623
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,230
All right,you better... get...

624
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,030
You're going to kill yourself.

625
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,660
I wouldn't do that.

626
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,950
No?

627
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,600
Not yet.

628
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,000
What now?

629
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,860
Well,they carry Milk Blast bars,that's a start.

630
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,960
And these are good.

631
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,730
You kidding me?

632
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,120
These are God's food,right here.

633
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,480
So the FBI forensic units

634
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,880
are sweeping the culverts near the hotel.

635
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,430
So I figured,you know,while we're waiting,

636
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,910
we can just go have a look around.

637
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,370
Right there.There it is.

638
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,250
--It's well hidden.
--Yeah.

639
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,530
Big enough to stuff a child's body into.

640
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,410
Look at that.What have we got there?

641
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,390
It's a pageant medal.

642
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,800
Looks like we got our crime scene.

643
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Crushing and scraping injuries to the scapula

644
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,070
are congruent with Brianna Swanson being forced

645
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,770
into a culvert this size in a prone position.

646
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,900
The kicks to the back were the attacker's attempt to

647
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,950
force the body farther into the culvert 
where it couldn't be seen.

648
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,000
"Little Miss Raspberry Blossom,Culpepper,Virginia... "

649
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,840
There were remnants of blood on the medal 
before I cleaned it.

650
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,090
Waiting to see if it belongs to Brianna Swanson.

651
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,720
It's dated 1976.

652
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,140
I got something.

653
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,730
Okay,I don't know if this helps you,but

654
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,770
"Lisa Fisher,1976 Raspberry Queen,

655
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,150
"Holly Walters,Raspberry Princess,

656
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,120
Kristin Madigan,Little Miss Raspberry Blossom. "

657
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,580
That face.

658
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,090
Kristin Madigan.

659
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,030
The mother that I spoke with at the 
dance school was named Kristin.

660
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,550
Kristin Mitchell.

661
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,990
Oh,my God.

662
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,060
It's like that Texas cheerleading thing

663
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,830
where the mother took out her daughter's main competitor.

664
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,370
Yes

665
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,080
my daughter did win the pageant after Brianna disappeared.

666
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,480
It's not a secret.

667
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,120
The winner,Ariel,went on to a national competition.

668
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,930
And how did Ariel do in the nationals?

669
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,480
Very well.Finished in the top ten.

670
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,870
Top ten. Wow.

671
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,690
That probably wouldn't have happened

672
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,580
if Brianna Swanson hadn't gone missing,right?

673
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,810
You don't know that.

674
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,580
Nobody knows that.

675
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,760
Where'd you get this?

676
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,550
We found it.

677
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,020
At Brianna Swanson's crime scene.

678
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,770
Can you explain that?

679
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,700
Brianna Swanson was a thief,Agent Booth.

680
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,940
Ask anybody. She probably took it out of my bag.

681
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,500
Did you report it missing?

682
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,160
I'm not saying another word until I get a lawyer.

683
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:49,580
One... two...three... four...

684
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,700
And she was kicked twice in the same place here,

685
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,430
twice as deep,so,five... six...

686
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,120
There's an asymmetry both of force 
and distance to these kicks.

687
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,770
The fracture pattern suggests a 
slight rotation to the blows.

688
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,720
How slight?

689
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,580
About 30 degrees.

690
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,100
Left side only?

691
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,110
Yes.

692
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,130
--Hey,it's me.Are you with Kristin Mitchell?
-- Yeah.

693
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,700
We're just sitting here,you know,waiting for a lawyer.

694
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,800
--Why?
--Okay,I need to know if her hips are even.

695
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,190
Is that slang or do you really mean even?

696
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,460
Stand behind her,place your hands on her hips,

697
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,990
then move your hands up to her rib cage,

698
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,430
gauging if it's an equal distance on each side.

699
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,420
That's so not going to happen.

700
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,610
You're videotaping the interview,right?

701
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,790
Of course. We have to.

702
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,890
Okay,uh,then beam me some footage of her walking.

703
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,120
Okay.

704
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,010
Coming at you,Bones.

705
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,170
What was that about?

706
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,500
Yeah,do me a favor and beam those images

707
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,120
of Ms. Mitchell pacing to the Jeffersonian. Thanks.

708
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,410
What's going on here?

709
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,200
Where's my attorney?!

710
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,320
Okay,try and get a shot of her buttocks and freeze it.

711
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,050
Okay.

712
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,320
I'm applying a biometric graph.

713
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,180
You might as well let her go,Booth. Why?

714
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,300
She has very nice,symmetrical buttocks.

715
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,560
Well,yeah,I know that,but,um...

716
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,880
What's that got to do with anything?

717
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Brianna Swanson's attacker has a thoracolumbar curve.

718
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,150
Scoliosis.

719
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,600
Sure. Meaning what?

720
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,010
Kristan Mitchell is definitely not the killer.

721
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,590
Thanks.

722
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,960
Ariel Mitchell says she showed Brianna

723
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,090
her mom's medal the day of the pageant.

724
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,370
Brianna- she must have stolen it,right?

725
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,450
We're nowhere.

726
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,150
Well,we might have found the murder weapon.

727
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,000
The murder weapon,okay.Well,what is it?

728
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,550
A forestop trammel.

729
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,540
A what?

730
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,770
Hello.

731
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,900
It's from the parking lot at 
the Red Shed Convenience Store.

732
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,320
The FBI forensic team found minute traces of blood on it.

733
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,580
We brought it in here to compare the edging with

734
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,360
the marks on the victim's chin.

735
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,910
And we can see here...

736
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,700
It's a match.

737
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,250
The angle and force of the blow suggests

738
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,610
Brianna fell forward,was unable to break her fall

739
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,600
and caught her chin here.

740
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,510
Broke her neck instantly.

741
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,840
Want to hear about steel?

742
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,000
In a minute.So,she was carried from 
the curb to the culvert?

743
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,100
Dragged.

744
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,130
Want to hear about the steel?

745
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,310
How do you know she was dragged?

746
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,590
Remember the polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons I talked about?

747
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,600
Absolutely not.

748
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,260
Turns out that they weren't from roofing tar.

749
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,590
They were from asphalt.

750
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,560
So what you found in her jacket was from her being dragged?

751
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,300
Exactly. Want to hear about the steel?

752
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,050
It wasn't from work boots.

753
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,240
It's the exact same steel used in tap shoes.

754
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,900
It's from another contestant.

755
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,580
okay,booth looking for a tap-dancing 
beauty queen with scoliosis.

756
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,770
Great. Got ya.

757
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,510
Wait,half of these kids have tap shoes.

758
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,810
We just have to examine the symmetry of their hips.

759
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,100
I'll go look at the shoes.You do your thing.

760
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,210
Ahh!Can I help you?

761
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,120
What are you doing there?

762
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,690
Excuse me?

763
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,090
It's okay. I'm a scientist.

764
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,290
Molester! Molester!

765
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,190
--What?
--Bones.

766
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,020
No...

767
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,240
What are you doing?

768
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm not... I'm not a molester.

769
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,540
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

770
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,910
Okay,FBI business.Everybody just simmer down.

771
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,010
She touched me on my rear.

772
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,070
No. Back and rear have totally different connotations.

773
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,330
Point of clarification.I touched her back.

774
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,360
Look,scientist or not,FBI or not

775
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,110
she can't just go around feeling little girls.

776
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,570
I wasn't feeling like that!

777
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,550
That makes me sound like a pervert.

778
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,020
She was just touching.

779
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,450
I was just... well,examining really.

780
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,420
Examining,see?Okay,listen,
bud,we're after a murderer here,okay?

781
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,200
Dr. Brennan just got a little overly excited...

782
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,150
How does feeling little girls solve a murder?

783
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,990
One of them is the murderer.

784
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,850
Okay,look,I know that's hard to believe.

785
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,410
You know what,it's really not.

786
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,910
So what do you need?

787
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,540
I mean,aside from the touching?

788
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,380
If I could just... watch them?

789
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,000
Just watch.

790
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,500
That was good.That was good.

791
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,850
That's her.

792
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,740
Oh,dude,not again.

793
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,830
I thought you said Jeremy was cleared.

794
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,220
We know it's not Jeremy.

795
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,730
We'd like to talk to Hailey for a moment.

796
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,400
No,I don't want to.

797
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,610
This is a special day,Agent Booth.

798
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
You're upsetting her.

799
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,770
Don't be afraid.

800
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,070
No,you know,she should be afraid.

801
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,670
I didn't do anything. I promise.

802
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,680
We know you didn't mean to,Hailey.

803
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,470
Honey,what did you do?

804
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,540
Yeah,what did you do?

805
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,500
Brianna said she was going to buy me an ice cream.

806
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,940
But she just made fun of me.

807
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,330
She said I was ugly.

808
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,790
She said I'd never win anything.

809
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,580
That must have hurt your feelings.

810
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,880
I didn't mean to push her so hard,honest.

811
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,500
Oh,God.

812
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,270
Why didn't you tell me?

813
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,000
The pageant was starting...

814
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,600
I wanted to win...

815
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,740
Hi.

816
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,420
Hi.

817
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,030
We really didn't get a chance to talk today.

818
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,520
Yeah. I was avoiding you.

819
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,690
That whole swing thing wasn't good enough,right?

820
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,370
'Cause I can do better.

821
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,730
It was perfect.

822
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,420
It was?

823
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,690
Maybe the best date I've ever had.

824
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,310
Really?

825
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,320
Great. That's great.Thanks.

826
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,910
Yeah.

827
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,910
That's not great.

828
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,910
How can a great date be not great?

829
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,230
Because it was supposed to fall flat.

830
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,030
That way we'd both know that this wasn't meant to be.

831
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,820
And we'd go back to the way we were before.

832
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,250
I don't like the way it was before.

833
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,940
Look,Brennan is my best friend,

834
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,530
and...

835
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,750
Zack is whatever the hell he is

836
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,070
and when this goes wrong,it...

837
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,260
it pulls everybody else into it.

838
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,590
And what the great date tells us is

839
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,170
that when it goes wrong...

840
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,100
It'll go really,really wrong.

841
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,030
Yeah.

842
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,900
So...

843
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,770
we go back,right?

844
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,430
Friends.

845
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,000
Sure. Friends.

846
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,720
Just one question.

847
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,000
What if it doesn't end that way?

848
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,060
What if it doesn't go wrong?

849
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,710
Friends.

850
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,120
This is what happened when Rome fell.

851
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,050
What,people ate stale donuts?

852
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,920
Objectification of women

853
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,750
beauty as self-esteem.

854
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,600
Well,I think,um

855
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,000
you know,some of those kids actually had a good time.

856
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,060
The girl in the pink could really dance.

857
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,040
But then again,Nero could really play the fiddle.

858
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,840
You know,Bones,I like to think that

859
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,850
someplace deep inside,

860
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,450
people really know what's important.

861
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,620
It's hard to believe when you see women trying to

862
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,000
disguise or change themselves.

863
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,650
I never understood that.

864
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,000
Well,no,of course you wouldn't.

865
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,590
Why?

866
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,480
It's just,you know,someone who looks like...

867
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,460
you...

868
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,970
wouldn't.

869
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,070
Just because of the way you look.

870
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,950
I don't understand.What...

871
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,000
way do I look?

872
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,680
Well,you know,you...

873
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,420
you're structured...

874
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,160
very well.

875
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,300
As are you.

876
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,510
You okay?

877
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,130
Yeah.

878
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,180
It just...

879
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,290
I just... I remembered that I had an appointment.

880
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,980
Oh,so,uh...

881
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,800
I'll see you tomorrow?

882
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,900
No.

883
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,600
You know,you have all the paperwork from the case,right?

884
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,830
No,I was going to stay and do it anyway. So...

885
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,440
No,I would... It's our case- I want to help.

886
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,810
You don't have to,Booth.

887
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,450
Bones,just drop it,okay?

888
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,950
I'm here to help.

889
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,950
Well,what about your appointment?

890
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,490
It's,you know,it's no big deal.

891
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,830
I'll tell you what,how about I order some take-out

892
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,350
and I ditch these donuts.

893
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,160
Sure.

894
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,310
--Thai food. 
--Thai food.

895
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,650
Only,this time,I'm ordering extra mee krob
