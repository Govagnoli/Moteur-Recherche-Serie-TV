1
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:14,341
Did you see? There's a dead body
in the trunk of that car.

2
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,807
Why did they
call in the FBI?

3
00:00:16,873 --> 00:00:18,608
Well, you know, car's
got Virginia plates,

4
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:20,174
it crossed state line.

5
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,740
Then there's the suspected
gang member,

6
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,207
then there's
RICO to deal with.

7
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,674
What... Bones, do you
really want to know?

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,140
No, I was just using it
as an excuse

9
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,507
to make conversation and
reestablish our connection.

10
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:30,974
What?

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Well, I read a book about
improving work relationships.

12
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:35,674
It's not fair to expect you
to tell me everything.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,307
I appreciate
the effort, Bones.

14
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,940
It's like they recreated
their country here.

15
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:44,740
Right down to being terrified
of the police.

16
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,007
Yeah, well, a lot of these
people, they're undocumented.

17
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:49,307
They get nervous around
law enforcement. What do we got?

18
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:52,040
He ran the stop sign.
I pulled him over,
he tried to run.

19
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:53,674
Oh, look at this, huh?

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,341
A <i>Mara Muerte</i> tattoo.

21
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,307
It's one of the most
feared gangs in the area.

22
00:00:57,374 --> 00:00:59,174
No wonder he was chauffeuring
a dead body around, huh?

23
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,541
Couldn't just join
the Boys Club, pal?

24
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:02,107
And I'm here because...?

25
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:03,574
Routine inspection
of the vehicle...

26
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,040
I found this.

27
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,241
Oh!

28
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:11,274
A female.

29
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,807
Recently dug up,
looks like.

30
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,674
Could you hold his hands up,
please?

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,807
We should analyze the dirt on
his hands and compare it

32
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:21,608
to the dirt on the shovel
and the remains.

33
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,740
Where was she buried?

34
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:28,773
<i>¿Sabes adónde estaba enterrada?</i>

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,740
Great. Now he's ignoring us
in two languages.

36
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,574
Well, where's the nearest
cemetery?

37
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,708
Closest one I know about
is Holy Rood,

38
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,474
but it's a good ten miles
from here.

39
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,674
<i>Disculpen, ¿nos podrían ayudar?</i>

40
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:46,675
<i>Es que queremos saber si hay un cementerio por aquí.</i>

41
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:49,075
<i>Señora, no sabemos nada.</i>

42
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,907
Maybe your Spanish
is a little rusty.

43
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:54,207
They come from a place
where getting involved
gets you killed.

44
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:13,074
Hey!

45
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,608
Hey!

46
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:00,674
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-xxy
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-</font>

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,307
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-xxy
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-</font>

48
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:22,608
decomp,
insect activity...

49
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:26,574
volatile fatty acid levels in
the soil, due to putrefaction...

50
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:28,974
suggests she was buried for
approximately six months.

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,907
Typically,
gravediggers

52
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,974
are necrophiliacs looking
for a little action.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,541
Um... ew.

54
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,174
Dental exam shows
shoveled incisors

55
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,608
and striated enamel.

56
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:38,407
Indicating?

57
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,541
Malnutrition.

58
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:40,541
Which is consistent with

59
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,074
anthropometrics,

60
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,174
suggesting the victim
is from Central America.

61
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,007
The body was found
in a Salvadoran neighborhood.

62
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:48,641
In Pikeville, Tennessee,
a guy dug up the graves

63
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,374
of all these people,
because he wanted to make sure

64
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,574
their bodies were still there.
They weren't.

65
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,507
Make a sketch of the face. I'm
not sure if we'll find a match.

66
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:58,207
She might have been
undocumented.

67
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,840
Goodman is an expert
in religious iconography.

68
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,674
Maybe he'll be able to determine
where this rosary was made.

69
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,574
Depression fracture on her
occipital bone straddling

70
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:08,074
the left lambdoidal suture.

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,574
Looks like one hard hit

72
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,507
congruent with, say,
a baseball bat.

73
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,807
She was religious.
She should have had a casket...

74
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:16,574
a proper burial with
her name on a headstone.

75
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:19,474
We are going to find out
who she is, and we are

76
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,140
going to give her that.

77
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:24,241
<i>Miguel Villeda.</i>

78
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:28,474
Warlord of the <i>Venganza</i>
<i>Roja</i> street gang.

79
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,773
According to this, you... you
are one fierce, fierce guy.

80
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,773
Well, it didn't stop your guys
from picking me up.
They tell you why?

81
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,541
Someone took a shot at
some <i>Mara Muerteespuma.</i>

82
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,708
Not a shot, hmm?

83
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:43,541
A couple dozen shots.
A drive-by.

84
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,773
Hardly anyone is stupid enough
to shoot at those guys anymore.

85
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,674
Your name came up.

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,608
It wasn't my people.

87
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:53,574
So, are you gonna charge me with
something or let me go?

88
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:57,507
Extortion, drugs, assault,
attempted murder.

89
00:04:57,574 --> 00:05:00,708
I could hold you for awhile,
if you want to play that game.

90
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,773
What's your problem, man?
What's my problem?

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,407
My problem is that
somebody shot at me.

92
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,907
Shot at me and my partner.

93
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,474
Plus, you know,
a bad guy got away,

94
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,407
so I'm a little cranky
about the whole thing.

95
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:12,441
Hmm.
<i>Mira, gavacho...</i>

96
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,407
I don't really scare
that way, you know,

97
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:16,374
the whole in your face
staring thing?

98
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,674
No?
No.

99
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,807
Give me a chance, man.
I'm just getting start

100
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,507
Hmm. So, somebody
shot at you, huh?

101
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:22,740
That's rTh.

102
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,541
Think about it.
When was tt time

103
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:26,674
you heard of a drive-by
where no one got hit?

104
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Innocent bystanders, mostly.

105
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:30,807
It's not like you always hit
what you aim at.

106
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:34,541
Think, just for
a couple of seconds,

107
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,541
about why the guy never got hit.

108
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,773
Ah, yeah, you see?
You got it now?

109
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,040
You're saying that <i>Mara Muerte</i>
did a drive-by on their own guy?

110
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:50,974
A drive-by happens, yeah.
And you all hit the deck.

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,140
And the gangbanger
makes a run for it.

112
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:07,207
Okay, I have it
on good authority

113
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:09,374
that the guys who shot
at our killer

114
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,840
were doing it so that he'd have
a chance to escape.

115
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,807
The victim was pregnant when
she was hit over the head.

116
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,374
Pregnant?
Yeah, five weeks along.

117
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,140
Get your hands off there.

118
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,074
I ran samples from the body,
shovel and burlap

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,107
through the gas chromatograph,
and it all came back

120
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,974
full of organic compounds:
plant detritus,

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
root remnants, fertilizer.

122
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,873
Sounds like stuff
you'd find in a cemetery.

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Yeah, well,
I also found this.

124
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:33,040
<i>Fernaldiapandurata,</i> otherwise
known as loroco buds.

125
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,708
Loroco is
an edible flowering plant.

126
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,441
It's native to El Salvador.

127
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:38,907
It's grown in vegetable gardens,
not cemeteries.

128
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,174
She was buried
in a vegetable garden?

129
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,274
Okay, can you recognize
this <i>loco</i> plant?

130
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:46,241
Loroco. I've eaten it, but
I wouldn't recognize the plant.

131
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,541
It's quite distinctive.
I'm also analyzing the dirt

132
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,807
and particulates on the shoe
you got off the suspect.

133
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,074
At first glance, it matches the
vegetation we've already found,

134
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,940
but with a couple extras
I'm still checking out.

135
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,474
Okay. Hodgins, suit up.

136
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,040
You're coming with us.

137
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:59,608
We're going
to the <i>barrio.</i>

138
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,674
Field work. Cool.

139
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,207
Do I get a gun?

140
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,074
You can't arm
Hodgins and not me.

141
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,207
What is it with you people
and the guns? Huh?

142
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,040
Look at this.

143
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:16,674
The government bankrupts itself
giving tax breaks to the rich

144
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,241
so there's no money left to help
these people with job training,

145
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,907
educational resources,
health care.

146
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,074
Just look for a garden
with the plant.

147
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,407
And those who do manage
to land a job are working

148
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,740
for a minimum wage that hasn't
seen a hike in eight years.

149
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,341
That's for those who
are here legally.

150
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,541
The undocumented
do a lot worse.

151
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,074
What is this? NPR Radio, huh?

152
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,807
What, are you two
running for office?

153
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:36,740
Over there, a garden.

154
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,674
Loroco plant.

155
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,907
It's the same approximate
maturity that would have yielded

156
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,807
the buds we found.

157
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:53,507
Adipocere.

158
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,940
It forms on the body in response
to moisture on the ground.

159
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,608
Trogid beetles.
They have a thing for
decomposing flesh.

160
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:02,274
I found a couple
on the burlap.

161
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,207
The rest of the rosary.

162
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:07,541
There's another
freshly-overturned
pile of dirt over here.

163
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:18,140
More adipocere.

164
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,374
Not from the same body?

165
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,773
Another body was buried here,

166
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
but it's gone now.

167
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,307
Double homicide.

168
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,574
I spoke to
the City Development Office.

169
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,641
The garden is scheduled
to be excavated

170
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,474
next week for construction.

171
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,307
My guess is we interrupted
a gangbanger

172
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:48,507
moving the body
of two murder victims.

173
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:50,674
A gangbanger who
buries his victim
with a rosary?

174
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,307
What? You find
any gunshot wounds?

175
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:54,773
Nope, just head trauma.

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,274
( <i>whirring</i> )

177
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,940
You really like this part,
don't you?

178
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:00,441
I like answers, yes.

179
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:07,441
Oh, localized staining
on the endocranial surface,

180
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,507
indicating...

181
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,241
Subdural hematoma.

182
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:11,873
The head wound caused
internal bleeding,

183
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,873
but death was not
instantaneous.

184
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,807
She may have been conscious
for some time after the assault.

185
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,740
But there's no sign
of bone remodeling.

186
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,641
She died soon after
the assault.

187
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:27,807
There's patterning
on the ectocranial surface.

188
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:30,207
Whatever weapon was used,
it left a mark.

189
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,507
Our gang unit's gonna bring in
the leader of <i>Mara Muerte,</i>

190
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,807
see if we can identify
the gangbanger who got away.

191
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:37,708
Why would a gang leader
cooperate?

192
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:40,274
'Cause I'm gonna ask him
very, very nicely, Bones.

193
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:41,974
You know that book
I'm reading

194
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,674
about getting along
with your coworkers?

195
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,274
It says that sarcasm
is never helpful.

196
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:48,007
I could lend it to you,
if you want.

197
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:50,140
I found <i>Spodoptera</i>
<i>ornithogalli</i> and
<i>tetranychus urticae</i>

198
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,441
on the suspect's shoe
and on the victim.

199
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,474
I also found notonectidae
and corixidae.

200
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,407
It's aquatic fauna
typically only found

201
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:58,140
in and around
ponds and streams.

202
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:00,641
There are no ponds or streams
at the burial site.

203
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,241
Yeah, and here's the kicker:

204
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:04,241
There was also evidence
of genetic material

205
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:06,507
from a <i>Franklinia alatamaha</i>
on his shoe.

206
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:08,174
You're kidding?
I'm in shock.

207
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,773
Franky Alabama?
You don't say.

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,241
Did you hear what
I said about sarcasm?

209
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,940
It's a rare flowering plant

210
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,507
that hasn't been seen
in the wild since 1800.

211
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,474
The only known specimen
in this area--

212
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,574
outside a specialized botanical
garden-- was given

213
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,207
to Senator Alan
Corman as a gift.

214
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:24,241
Oh, I love going after senators.

215
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:26,007
Whoa, just, you know, simmer
down here, Hodgins, okay?

216
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,541
We're gonna check out
the botanical garden first.

217
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:30,207
Fine.
It's at the White House.

218
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,574
Okay, you guys should do that
even less than normal people.

219
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,773
Make sure to keep your
eyes open for backswimmers

220
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,007
and water boatmen while you're
there, and remember,

221
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:40,641
the notonectidae can be
different colors. You know...

222
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,873
That's a nice try, okay?
You're coming with us.

223
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,608
I call shotgun.

224
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,907
I <i>called</i> "shotgun."

225
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:48,740
What does it mean to a society

226
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:50,608
when the niceties
are no longer observed?

227
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,641
Okay, look, we got two bodies,
all right?

228
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,407
One unaccounted for.

229
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:57,341
We've been shot at, and now we
know that there's a gang member

230
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,040
walking around
a U.S. Senator's place.

231
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,174
Any theories?

232
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,974
Oh, come on, guys.

233
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,474
Let's think of it as a puzzle

234
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,574
and there's a missing piece.

235
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,574
I like puzzles.

236
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:08,040
I find them relaxing.

237
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:09,608
I just finished
The Anatomy Lesson.

238
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:10,608
Rembrandt.

239
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,307
You're kidding, right?

240
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,174
What do you find relaxing?

241
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,940
I restore vintage cars.

242
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,807
I know what I find relaxing.

243
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:21,107
Everybody finds what you
find relaxing, relaxing.

244
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,940
Senator Corman
is a big supporter

245
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,241
of business leaders
in Central America.

246
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:28,207
That means supporting repressive
regimes that use death squads

247
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:30,840
to silence any opposition
from the working people,

248
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,940
which are the same people
who flee to the States.

249
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,074
Okay, that's great, that's good.
Okay, let's focus.

250
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,907
It's good,
'cause now we have a link

251
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,773
between Corman
and the Salvadorans.

252
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,641
Now you think the Senator
murdered two people?

253
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,873
I just think we got another
piece of the puzzle, that's all.

254
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:55,507
<i>Because of my husband's</i>

255
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,407
official work
in El Salvador

256
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:00,773
we've formed a bond with
the country and the people.

257
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,541
In fact, we have several
Salvadoran immigrants

258
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,241
working here at the house.

259
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,274
I've actually sponsored
quite a few for citizenship.

260
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,940
Citizenship screening would keep
out members of death squads.

261
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:11,507
Hodgins...

262
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:13,007
Just because
I'm anti-socialist

263
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,140
doesn't make me
pro-death squad.

264
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,074
Dr. Brennan has found evidence

265
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,007
that a gang member's been
on your property recently.

266
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,541
Well, we employ 20 staff
members, give or take.

267
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:24,007
All of our staff members are
either legal aliens or citizens.

268
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:25,507
Our House Manager
is in charge

269
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:27,174
of hiring them
and managing them.

270
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,807
Do you recognize this man?

271
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:30,974
No.

272
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,840
I assume he did
something worse

273
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:34,674
than trespass
on my property?

274
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,140
House Manager...
is he from El Salvador?
Yes.

275
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,040
Agent, you didn't
answer my question.

276
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:41,040
We're investigating a death,
Senator Corman.

277
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,040
You understand
why I can't talk about it.

278
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:46,074
Perhaps we could show this
picture to your House Manager?

279
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,241
Of course.

280
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:51,107
Franklinia alatamaha.
It's beautiful.

281
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,940
Yes. We're the only people
cultivating it privately.

282
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,374
Senator, do you have a pond
on the property?

283
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,773
Yes, on the other side of
the shrubs. It's small.

284
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,674
Could Dr. Hodgins
take a look at it?

285
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,007
Of course,
be my guest.

286
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:06,840
Logan, come say hello.
We have guests.

287
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,341
It's our son.

288
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:09,374
He's studying landscape
architecture

289
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:10,740
at Georgetown.

290
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,441
He likes to supervise
the men sometimes.

291
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:15,474
Logan, this is
Special Agent Booth

292
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,674
from the FBI and his
associate Dr. Brennan.

293
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,708
What's the FBI doing here?

294
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:22,140
They would like to ask
Hector some questions.

295
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:23,074
Yeah.

296
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,541
Hey, Hector.

297
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:26,441
<i>Ben, ¿hablamos para tú?</i>

298
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:29,341
<i>Sigan trabajando. Ahora vuelvo.</i>

299
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,974
Yes, sir?

300
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,341
Hector, I'm
Special Agent Booth.

301
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:34,840
Do you recognize this guy?

302
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,674
No, I don't think so.

303
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,641
It could be José

304
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,574
He works here sometimes,
as a gardener.

305
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:46,140
Really?
I don't think so.

306
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,074
José who?

307
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,840
José Vargas.

308
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,974
Logan, Agent Booth said
he was in a gang.

309
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,608
A gang? No, no way.

310
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,407
José is a nice guy,
you know, wife and kid.

311
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:00,641
I found both backswimmers
and water boatmen.

312
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:13,740
<i>¿Usted ha estado plantando recientemente por ahí?
No señora.</i>

313
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,907
What is it?
<i>¿Me presta una pala?</i>

314
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,207
<i>Gracias.</i>

315
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,608
Looks like we found
the second body.

316
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:43,807
Puparial casings of Tineid moths

317
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:45,707
puts the time of death
of this one at about a year.

318
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:47,307
Six months
before the girl.

319
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:48,874
Heart-shaped pelvic inlet.

320
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:50,373
Long projections of bone
into the rib cartilage

321
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,108
suggests we have a male over 60.

322
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,474
Anthropometrics suggests
Hispanic origins.

323
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,474
We reassembled the rosary
found on the young woman.

324
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,507
The carving of fire
in the center piece

325
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:02,340
is an archetypal symbol
found in an area of El Salvador

326
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:05,574
since the Chaparrastique volcano
erupted in 1787.

327
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,041
So this might indicate
where the female victim's from.

328
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,774
A village called
<i>Milagro de la Paz</i>

329
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,707
in the southeast of the country.

330
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,373
I was there three years ago,

331
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,208
identifying victims
of the death squads.

332
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,340
I finished the sketch
of the woman.

333
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:21,240
She was pregnant, starting
over in a new country,

334
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,841
so I gave her a smile,

335
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,407
made her look hopeful.

336
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:26,741
Thanks, Angela.

337
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,240
All right, let's clean the bones

338
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,774
so we can find
a cause of death.

339
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,807
I think I just found it.

340
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:38,741
It's a bullet.

341
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,174
Looks like steel
core, copper jacket.

342
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,640
Military issue.

343
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,373
Those are the kinds of weapons
gangs like.

344
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,307
They escape from
the death squads

345
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,007
and wind up being killed

346
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,507
by the same weapons
they were running from.

347
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,841
<i>I got José s address</i>
<i>from Logan.</i>

348
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:59,007
<i>Let's check it out.</i>

349
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:05,874
Thanks.

350
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,807
FBI. Make your
presence known.

351
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:15,108
Look, he has
a family, a baby.

352
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,407
Is anybody here?

353
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,474
You don't have
to be afraid.

354
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,407
<i>¿Hay alguien aquí?
No tiene que tener miedo.</i>

355
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:24,340
Of course they're gonna
be afraid, Bones.

356
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:26,974
I have a gun.

357
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:30,841
<i>Milagro de la Paz.</i>

358
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,208
That's where
the victims are from.

359
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,907
They had to have been here

360
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:34,907
a few minutes ago--
the bottle's still warm.

361
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:35,607
They're still here.

362
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:37,041
How do you know?

363
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,440
They're prepared
for this kind of thing.

364
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,774
Hiding from death squads,

365
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,607
people learned
to build false walls.

366
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,307
Closet.
ay, hold on, Bones.

367
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,108
Let's just pretend that
I'm the cop for a second.

368
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:53,240
Okay? Just...

369
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:18,774
<i>Yo no sé nada.
Por favor, yo no hice nada.</i>

370
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:20,208
What'd you say?

371
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,340
That we just want
to talk to José

372
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,640
That they'd all be safe, they
have nothing to worry about.

373
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:26,240
Do you want to be deported?

374
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:27,273
Do you want
to see your baby again?

375
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,674
Because if he
was born here,

376
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:29,941
he doesn't have
to go back with you.

377
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,474
We can keep him.

378
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,307
Booth. Stop.
She's frightened enough.

379
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:34,474
Bones, we have
a double murder on our hands.

380
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,340
But she didn't do it.

381
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,208
Just tell her what I said, okay?

382
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,607
Tell her we're calling
immigration.

383
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,273
Tell her we'll
get to José

384
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,041
No, she's lived with terror
and intimidation her whole life.

385
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:43,807
I'm not going to add to it.

386
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,174
All right, you know what?
You're acting like

387
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm gonna hurt her or something.

388
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm just trying
to get information.

389
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:49,874
I am asking you, as a favor,

390
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,141
not to make me do this.

391
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,307
Please.

392
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,373
This is interesting.

393
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,108
Interesting or horrible?

394
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,674
Because sometimes
it's the same thing with you.

395
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,540
This hole in the sternum.

396
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:06,941
It's definitely not
a gunshot wound.

397
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:10,273
It's a sternal foramen.

398
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,108
I found the same exact thing
on the female victim's sternum.

399
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,340
It seemed
like a meaningless anomaly...

400
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,273
It's a hereditary condition.

401
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,407
The two victims were related.

402
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,007
Based on their ages...
father and daughter?

403
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:25,208
So father and daughter buried
next to each other, right?

404
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:26,807
Then dug up.

405
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:30,141
But then father is reburied.
Why?

406
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,340
The gangbanger was probably
taking the daughter

407
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,407
to be reburied when the cops
pulled him over.

408
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,874
This is the stuff
that Booth is good at.

409
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,141
The murky ways of
the human heart, all that.

410
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,707
We work the hard evidence.

411
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,674
We've used up all the evidence.

412
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:45,174
Okay, okay, let's just...
You know what?

413
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Let's just pretend
we're Booth, okay?

414
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,307
Ooh, let me try.

415
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,907
The daughter
got pregnant

416
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:54,807
from the killer in El
Salvador, then came here.

417
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,674
He catches up to 'em,
they fight...

418
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,974
( <i>laughing</i> ):
He joins a gang

419
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,707
and then kills her.

420
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,141
The father comes after
him seeking revenge,

421
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,440
and the killer kills him.

422
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,007
No, no.

423
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,707
The father's death
preceded the daughter's

424
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,240
by at least six months.

425
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:10,874
I have found something.

426
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,041
I can't get this bullet
out of the pelvic bone.

427
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,041
Oh, wow.

428
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:17,774
The bone started healing
around the bullet.

429
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,007
See the remodeling?

430
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,907
This wound healed

431
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:21,907
years ago.

432
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,373
He didn't die by being shot.

433
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,707
Tough old bastard.

434
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:28,307
How was he murdered?

435
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,640
He wasn't murdered.

436
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,041
Metastatic carcinoma.

437
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:34,507
Probably originating
in the prostate.

438
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:38,208
So, he survives being shot,
but then he dies of cancer?

439
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:40,208
Mega-tough old bastard.

440
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:41,108
Yeah.

441
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:49,941
Anything?

442
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,208
Yeah.

443
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,941
Immigration has the wife.

444
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:54,440
She got a lawyer

445
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,540
from the Salvadoran League
of Something-Or-Other

446
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,774
and she's not giving
us anything about José

447
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,741
Are you mad at me?

448
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,440
No.

449
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,240
But, you know, I could have
gotten something back there

450
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:07,340
if you hadn't gotten...

451
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,373
all mushy on me.

452
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,941
I was uncomfortable with...

453
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,307
You always say I'm not a cop.

454
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:17,340
You're right.

455
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,240
Especially in a
situation like that.

456
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:21,108
It's okay. We're not going
to need her anyway.

457
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,141
Really? Why?

458
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,440
'Cause I had the gang unit

459
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:24,841
put a lean on Roberto Ortez.

460
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,307
He's the head of <i>Mara Muerte.</i>

461
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:28,108
The gang that
José belongs to?

462
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:31,841
Yeah. They convinced Ortez to
bring José in for questioning.

463
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:32,941
Why would he do that?

464
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,507
Ortez's sister

465
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:36,440
is in the can
on possession charges.

466
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,607
I... I promised him
I could make that go away.

467
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,307
Can you?

468
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,440
I dunno, it's a local beef
I'm Federal,

469
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,941
but, hey, I'm a cop, and, uh...

470
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:46,841
thank God for bad sisters, huh?

471
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:11,627
He has a collapsed lung,
several broken ribs,

472
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,728
one arm is broken,
the other shoulder's dislocated.

473
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,828
But we can
talk to him?
You can try.

474
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:16,761
Hey, thanks.

475
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,860
Wow, your own guys,
they do this to you?

476
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:26,828
Hey, geez,
I wishIhad my own gang.

477
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:28,427
I don't belong to no gang.

478
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,361
I'm a gardener.

479
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:33,227
Oh, a gardener with a <i>Mara</i>
<i>Muerte</i> tattoo on his neck

480
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:36,461
who can now understand English
and who likes to plant bodies.

481
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,361
Hey, maybe that stuff's private.

482
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,927
Hey, you know what?
You're an illegal immigrant.

483
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:41,494
You're a gang member.

484
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,561
You're under arrest
for transporting

485
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,294
a dead body in a stolen car,

486
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,860
and you're under suspicion
for murder.

487
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:47,627
I'm gonna call I.C.E.

488
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:50,227
and have you <i>and</i> your wife
deported

489
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:51,661
back to El Salvador.

490
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,194
I got a son.

491
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,561
Forget it.
We keep the son.

492
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:59,060
That's my son.
It's my only son.

493
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,060
You got kids?
No.

494
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:04,094
Yes, you do.
Difference is,
I'm a fit father.

495
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,761
I'm not going around
murdering guys and...
and little girls,

496
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,661
burying them,
digging them up...
Booth?

497
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,594
I don't think he
murdered those people.

498
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:14,661
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
You can tell
if he murdered someone

499
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:16,794
by looking at his X rays.

500
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,361
He has the same genetic
condition the two victims had.

501
00:22:19,427 --> 00:22:20,794
A sternal foramen.

502
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,561
They were probably

503
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:24,060
his sister and his father.

504
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:25,394
That true?

505
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,461
Hey, you know what, buddy,
you want to be on

506
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:30,361
my good side, because I wasn't
joking about keeping your kid.

507
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,027
Yes.

508
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:38,294
It's my sister,
it was my father.

509
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:40,227
Your father died
of natural causes.

510
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:42,260
Fine, but...

511
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,260
your sister was murdered.

512
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:46,761
Eh, you know what?
Forget it.

513
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:49,927
Gang is the only family
Jose cares about, you know?

514
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,461
Enjoy your trip back home,

515
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:53,094
and have fun
explaining to your wife

516
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
why she doesn't have a baby
in her arms.

517
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,027
Give us something.

518
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:06,394
Help us to do the right
thing for your sister.

519
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,027
I cannot.

520
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:11,594
Just... anything.

521
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:15,027
At least you could
tell us their names.

522
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,561
You want their names, huh?

523
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:22,893
Duarte...

524
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,927
was our family name.

525
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:29,461
Maria was my sister;
our father was named Augustin.

526
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,227
That's all
I can tell you.

527
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,761
Jose's sister hated him.
Hated him? Why?

528
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:45,361
She didn't approve
of his associations.

529
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:48,527
You mean associations, like
the leader of one of the most

530
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,527
murderous street gangs
in the country?

531
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:53,327
If she hated Jose so much,
why was he moving her body?

532
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:55,060
The burial site
was threatened.

533
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,160
He wanted to move her
to a better place.

534
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,294
And his father.

535
00:23:58,361 --> 00:24:01,294
Real family guy, you know?

536
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:05,627
I'm not the leader
of the whole gang,

537
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,893
just the DC chapter.
You shot at us so Jose could
have a chance to get away.

538
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,627
<i>Mara Muerte</i> takes care
of its own.

539
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:13,794
Even a throwaway like Jose.

540
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,361
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, go ahead.

541
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,027
Jose's all beaten up,

542
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:20,227
so he won't tell us
anything, but you,

543
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,828
you don't even ask
for a lawyer,

544
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,227
but you hardly stop talking.
Bones...

545
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,394
Hey, I'm the boss, lady, okay?

546
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,361
Jose's a <i>subordinado.</i>

547
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:29,627
That <i>retraso</i>
not as smart as me.

548
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:31,294
You intimidate him into silence,

549
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:33,361
but you can walk in here
to the FBI,

550
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:36,694
say whatever you want and walk
away like you own the place.

551
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:39,661
That's right.
Look, all I need to know is,

552
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,494
who would have the guts
to kill his sister.

553
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:43,060
Who cares, man?

554
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,828
Come on, Ortez, a sister
of the <i>Mara Muerte.</i>

555
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:45,993
It's the most feared gang
in the city.

556
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,461
She wasn't <i>my</i> sister, man.

557
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,927
It had to be somebody
else in the gang,

558
00:24:49,993 --> 00:24:51,993
somebody more important
than Jose.

559
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,361
You know what, lady?

560
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:56,394
You think too much.

561
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,427
Maybe you need a man like me
to get your mind

562
00:24:58,494 --> 00:24:59,828
off of things,
you know what I'm saying?

563
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,728
I can be

564
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:04,160
your adorin' Salvadoran.

565
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,094
Look, I didn't know
who killed Jose's sister.

566
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,993
But I'll tell you what,
because I like you so much,

567
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,494
I find out who did it,

568
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,127
I'll kill him.

569
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:27,627
( <i>deep sigh</i> )

570
00:25:32,828 --> 00:25:34,627
You been waiting for me?

571
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:38,294
Push that button again,
and we can go down together.

572
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:42,194
You think you can
intimidate people into
doing what you want?

573
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay, I'll push it myself.

574
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:49,160
How do you handle someone
who <i>isn't</i> afraid of you?

575
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,794
Just get out of my way.

576
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:53,527
I said, move your ass.

577
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,327
I wouldn't...

578
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:01,160
That's gonna hurt
in the morning.

579
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,394
Bitch!

580
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:19,027
Feel better?

581
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,361
Yeah.

582
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:23,260
I really do.

583
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:31,527
You beat up a gang leader?

584
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:32,761
Booth told you that?

585
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,160
You did.

586
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:37,561
You got into a fight
with a gangbanger.

587
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:39,893
You're mad at me?

588
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,594
The guy's a killer, Brennan.

589
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,594
Angela, relax.
We were in the FBI building.

590
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:46,761
Look, I know you're all about
self-reliance

591
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:49,394
and fighting your own battles
and standing up for yourself,

592
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:51,527
but now, as your friend,

593
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:55,060
and knowing how much
you hate psychology here...

594
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:57,127
you need therapy.

595
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm sorry I upset you.

596
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:01,761
It's just that I've
dealt with him before.

597
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,127
With who?

598
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:05,327
People who get
what they want through fear.

599
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:08,427
Gangbangers,
members of death squads...

600
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,728
I know it's psychology again,
but you said "him,"

601
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:12,260
like, one guy.

602
00:27:12,327 --> 00:27:15,027
I didn't mean Ortez
specifically, I meant...

603
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,694
people like him.

604
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,327
On my last trip
to El Salvador...

605
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:24,194
Yeah, I remember-- I tried
to get you to go to Italy

606
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,993
with me.

607
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,694
I was in a tent set up
by one of the grave sites.

608
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:36,194
I was working with the remains
of a young girl,

609
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,461
maybe 13.

610
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:44,127
She'd been shot in the head
and dumped into a well.

611
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,594
This cop shows up,

612
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:48,927
and he might have
been a soldier,

613
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:50,860
it's not easy to tell.

614
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:54,327
I thought he was there to guard
me, but he told me to stop.

615
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:57,728
When I refused, he
called in two others.

616
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:01,893
They put a bag over my head
and tossed me into a cell

617
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,828
with a dirt floor
and no windows.

618
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,194
For how long?

619
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,561
Later I found out
it was three days.

620
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:11,860
But I thought it was a week,

621
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,828
maybe more.

622
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,794
He came in every day

623
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,194
and made me believe
I was going to die.

624
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,260
He said that he'd shoot me
and toss me into a well,

625
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,893
and that no one
would ever know who I was

626
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,294
or what became of me.

627
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:36,227
I promised myself, if I ever
had the chance, I'd get even.

628
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,694
That doesn't mean
I need therapy.

629
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:46,594
I identified the type of wood

630
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:47,794
in the weapon
that killed Maria.

631
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,860
Am I interrupting
a female moment?

632
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:55,094
No. What was the wood?

633
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,594
Quarter-sawn cumuru.

634
00:28:56,661 --> 00:28:58,327
Definitely not from
a shovel handle.

635
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:01,027
What is made out of
quarter-sawn cumuru?

636
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,728
Very expensive furniture.

637
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:04,960
Senatorially expensive?

638
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:07,094
Most definitely.

639
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:12,227
I don't recognize her, no.

640
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,294
Neither do I, I'm afraid.

641
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,361
How about you, Hector?

642
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:15,960
Her name was Maria.

643
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:19,828
She used to work as a maid here.
She had papers.

644
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:23,828
Fake ones-- probably supplied by
our friendly neighborhood gang.

645
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:25,294
Hector couldn't
possibly be expected

646
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:26,960
to identify forged papers.

647
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:28,728
What happened to Maria?

648
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:32,327
One day she didn't show up
for work. That's all.

649
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:35,094
Did she interact
with anyone here besides José?

650
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,160
I don't know about
that kind of thing.

651
00:29:38,227 --> 00:29:40,194
What kind of thing, Hector?

652
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:44,327
I don't know anything.

653
00:29:44,394 --> 00:29:45,494
What do you mean, Hector?

654
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:51,761
Was Maria involved
with the senator?

655
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:54,561
What? Of course not.

656
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,594
No.

657
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,327
No, not the senator.

658
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:00,927
Well, tell the truth, Hector--
this is the FBI.

659
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,761
Logan.

660
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,661
She was involved with Logan.

661
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:12,993
What kind of "involved"?

662
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
I'd rather not say.

663
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:19,160
Maria's dead, Logan.

664
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:21,294
M-Maria's dead?

665
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,927
Yes.

666
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,227
Of course that
changes things.

667
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:35,394
Maria and I were...

668
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:37,561
What, you
were lovers?

669
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,927
Bones, what the hell
are you doing?

670
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:43,227
How long have you
had this bed?

671
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:45,794
Uh, since I was,
like, 15. Why?

672
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,427
Do you know what kind
of wood it is?

673
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:52,893
Curu... cumuru.
Something like that.

674
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,127
Why?
'Cause Maria's skull

675
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:59,627
was banged in by something
made out of cumuru wood.

676
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,960
There's dried blood and skin
on this post.

677
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,060
I caught Maria dancing once,
in the hallway.

678
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,494
She thought
no one was watching, but...

679
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:20,060
I was watching.

680
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:23,161
I had noticed her before.

681
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:26,494
She was, uh...

682
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,494
very pretty.

683
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,994
More than what
these pictures tell you.

684
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,660
Logan, I will say again

685
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,227
that I do not advise
answering questions.

686
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,960
You're not under arrest.

687
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,927
Perhaps you'd like to check
with the senator

688
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:41,194
and see if he'd rather
I'd officially arrested Logan

689
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,127
before asking these questions,

690
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,561
because I'm sure the press
would love that.

691
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:48,860
When did you start having

692
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:50,793
a sexual relationship
with Maria?

693
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,561
Perhaps six months ago.
You kept it
a secret?

694
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,660
Maria was certain that...

695
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:58,494
if my parents found out
she'd be fired.

696
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,894
Are you aware that she was
in this country illegally.

697
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,294
I advise you, do not
answer that question.

698
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:05,960
Were you aware
that she was pregnant?

699
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:09,060
M-Maria was pregnant?

700
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,194
Logan, there's no proof

701
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,361
that you were
the father.

702
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:17,027
No, shut up.

703
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:21,094
Of course I'm the father.

704
00:32:23,294 --> 00:32:25,894
( <i>crying</i> ):
Oh, God.

705
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:31,594
What about the father?

706
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,960
A powerful man with lots to
lose, I mean, why kill her?

707
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:36,127
Why not have her deported
in the middle of the night?

708
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:37,693
That leaves Hector.

709
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,127
He's responsible for
hiring the servants.

710
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:40,660
I mean, one
of them gets pregnant,

711
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:43,394
he feels like it's
his mess to clean up.

712
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,594
We still can't figure
out how Maria's skull

713
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,361
was fractured
by the bedpost.

714
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:49,261
Well, that's sort of
your line of work, Bones, okay?

715
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,027
So, go have fun.

716
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,693
<i>Your top three suspects are</i>

717
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,494
Senator Corman,
six foot one,

718
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:57,494
Logan Corman,
five foot ten

719
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,628
and Hector Santiago,
five foot six.

720
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,394
Maria was five
foot one.

721
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,860
The bed is a California
king with seven-foot posts.

722
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:07,261
And assuming
that they argued

723
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:09,194
near the foot
of the bed...

724
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:10,793
Given there

725
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,760
relative heights, the angle
of impact doesn't match.

726
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:14,894
Her skull connects well below

727
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,927
where you found
the traces of blood.

728
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,294
What if they were
standing on the bed?

729
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:20,860
Well, it's high enough,
but her head struck

730
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,060
the outside of the post.

731
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,927
How tall would her assailant

732
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:27,227
have to be to
fit the evidence?

733
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,628
That... that's tall.

734
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,261
Seven foot eight.

735
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,860
Somebody you'd notice
around the house.

736
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,894
Let's think outside the box.

737
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,060
What do you mean--
like go non-human?

738
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,561
No. What else explains striking
the bedpost in that manner?

739
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:46,994
I guess... falling.

740
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,227
Falling?

741
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:51,994
Maria was a maid. Do you have

742
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,194
a schematic version
of the room?

743
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:00,261
If she fell backwards...

744
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:03,327
But it doesn't explain
the damage done to her skull.

745
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:06,127
Okay, what force <i>does</i>
explain the damage?

746
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,960
206 pounds
per square inch,

747
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:11,827
which means she would have had
to have fallen from a height

748
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:15,494
of... it's no good.

749
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,094
I know what happened.

750
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:19,227
She was yanked
off the ladder.

751
00:34:19,294 --> 00:34:21,860
You mean somebody
pulled her off?

752
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,827
Yes. The missing 84 pounds
per square inch

753
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:29,860
can be explained by a hard yank
from a full-grown man.

754
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,827
I don't know if it's murder,

755
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:38,860
but someone is definitely
responsible for Maria's death.

756
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,361
This is not about the gang.

757
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:47,060
The gang had nothing
to do with her death.

758
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,927
Maria was pulled
off that ladder.

759
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,261
Who are you protecting?

760
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,994
I got nothing to say.

761
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,127
What did the senator
offer you, huh?

762
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,261
Asylum?

763
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:00,194
For the whole family?

764
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:03,461
I know what happened.

765
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:05,660
Your father
died of cancer.

766
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:09,194
around the same time,
your wife was pregnant.

767
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:11,960
You wanted your child to be
born an American citizen,

768
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,860
so you couldn't report
your father's death

769
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:16,727
for fear of
being deported.

770
00:35:16,793 --> 00:35:19,294
You buried him yourself.

771
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,294
In the garden.

772
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:24,994
When your sister died,

773
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,827
you buried her
in the same place.

774
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:33,628
When my father died,
he said to me,

775
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:35,194
"You take care of your sister."

776
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:41,960
You joined <i>Mara Muerte</i>
so you can get fake papers,

777
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:43,094
so she could work

778
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,327
for the senator.

779
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:47,327
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Maria...

780
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:51,394
Maria, she was so angry she
would, she'd get so angry

781
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:53,994
sometimes she just
doesn't speak to me.

782
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,927
She didn't understand
what you had to do

783
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:57,860
for her and your family.

784
00:35:57,927 --> 00:36:01,927
It was the only way for me
to keep my promise to my father.

785
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,894
Look at me now, huh?

786
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,427
All because I wanted to give
my sister and my father

787
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:15,860
a beautiful place to rest.

788
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:18,660
It's near... it's near a pond.

789
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:20,760
It's beautiful, huh?

790
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,494
It's all for nothing.

791
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:31,261
My family's ruined.

792
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,427
She didn't fall.

793
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,793
No, she was pushed.

794
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,760
No, Senator, actually
she was pulled,

795
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:42,161
probably off that ladder.

796
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:43,594
Pulled? Pulled by who?

797
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,528
Perhaps by your son
or t senator.

798
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:49,127
Oh, my God. I do not
pull maids off of ladders.

799
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:50,860
Mm. Will you please
open that up?

800
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:53,127
And, and why would they
do something like that?

801
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,894
Because Maria was
pregnant by your son.

802
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,394
What?

803
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,060
Even if that were true,

804
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:00,494
that is not how we
would handle the situation.

805
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:02,194
Yeah, you'd have her deported
in the middle of the night.

806
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,727
It would be handled,

807
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:07,094
and not by pulling
her off a ladder.

808
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,727
Senator, would you
mind reaching up?

809
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,094
What is that gonna prove?

810
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:12,960
Are you refusing, sir?

811
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:15,693
I'm trained in kinesiology,
the study of human movement.

812
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,327
Oh, and you're gonna
be able to tell

813
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:18,660
who pulled her off the ladder.

814
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:20,660
Absolutely, yes.

815
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,261
Oh, for God's sake,
Alan, just do it.

816
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,227
Just do it.

817
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:24,227
Fine.

818
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,960
Well?

819
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:32,528
Was it me?

820
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:35,693
Hector?
<i>Si?</i>

821
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,693
Would you please pull me down
off this ladder?

822
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,161
No.

823
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:41,760
No, I won't.

824
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,161
Hector, just do

825
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,960
as she asks.

826
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:46,693
Hector.

827
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,960
How did it happen, Hector?

828
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:53,161
You told her to stay out
of Logan's room, didn't you?

829
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:54,660
You didn't approve.

830
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,194
You knew what was going on.

831
00:37:56,261 --> 00:37:56,994
Hector?

832
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,094
If it wasn't you,

833
00:37:58,161 --> 00:37:59,060
just pull me down.

834
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:03,394
Maria defied you,
she went to Logan's room.

835
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:05,561
You got angry, you
pulled her off the ladder.

836
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:06,894
It was an accident.

837
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:13,927
Yeah.

838
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,660
It was an accident.

839
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:20,561
I can't believe that worked.

840
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,261
Psychology, Bones,
is a very powerful force.

841
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:27,528
I gave her $500
and I drove her home.

842
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:30,394
I-I thought she was
going to go to a doctor.

843
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:32,628
She was afraid she'd lose
her job and get deported.

844
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,361
You should
have told us.

845
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:36,594
You don't want to know.

846
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,161
You don't want to know
about any of this.

847
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:41,727
I know my job.

848
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:43,461
I know what you want.

849
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:47,660
Hector Alvarado,

850
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:49,060
I'm placing you
under arrest.

851
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,894
on suspicion of manslaughter.

852
00:38:58,727 --> 00:38:59,661
Booth?

853
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:00,828
Yeah.

854
00:39:00,894 --> 00:39:02,461
Message from the Gang
Task Force Unit.

Oh, man.

858
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:09,527
You got a response?

859
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,027
Yeah, just tell 'em...

860
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:13,294
tell 'em I got the message.

861
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,260
Tell 'em thanks.

862
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:15,160
Sure.

She's not FBI.

876
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:33,327
I never said anything about FBI.

877
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:34,993
She's my partner, <i>ese.</i>

878
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,627
and if anything
happens to her

879
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:38,960
I will find you
and I will kill you.

880
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:40,260
I won't think twice.

881
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:41,627
Look at me.
Look in my eyes.

882
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:43,327
( <i>gun cocking</i> )
Look at my face.

883
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:46,027
If anything happens
to her, I will kill you.

884
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:47,661
This is between you and me.

885
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:50,828
Nobody sees, nobody knows.

886
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:52,327
You got nothing to prove.

887
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:53,828
Understand?

888
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,494
You understand?!

889
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:57,327
Uh...
Yeah.

890
00:40:57,394 --> 00:40:58,794
I thought so. Okay?

891
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:00,894
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll leave first

892
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,527
because I have somewhere
I have to be.

893
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:17,060
I will pay you back
for this funeral.

894
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:18,894
Don't worry about it.

895
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
It's my family.

896
00:41:20,027 --> 00:41:21,993
It's <i>my</i> duty.

897
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,928
Aren't you leaving for
El Salvador tonight?

898
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:25,861
My child is an American.

899
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:31,327
He's...

900
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:34,093
He's not gonna grow up
the way that Rosa and I did.

901
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,461
<i>Lo regresamos. De alguna manera.</i>

902
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,394
She says that we're
gonna bring him back.

903
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:42,694
I understand.

904
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,828
One way or another,

905
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:47,027
your son will have
a better life than you did.

906
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:47,993
<i>Gracias.</i>

907
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,127
<i>Gracias.</i>

908
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:02,227
Am I in trouble?

909
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:05,093
You're late
for a funeral.

910
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,561
Of course you're
in trouble.

911
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:08,694
Sorry.

912
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:11,060
I apologize. I...

913
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:12,394
Everything okay here?

914
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,160
Where were you?

915
00:42:14,227 --> 00:42:15,861
I had something to do.

916
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:17,294
More important than a funeral?

917
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:21,627
I thought so at the time.
