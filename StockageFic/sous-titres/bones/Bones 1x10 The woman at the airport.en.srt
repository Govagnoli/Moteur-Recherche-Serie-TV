1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,448
These remains, dating from the Iron Age,
were found at the bottom of shaft 3 of the site.

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,943
There were 5 sets of human remains found.

3
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,460
This is the only one found whole.

4
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:11,548
He's in good shape.
- 1500 years old, he shouldn't look this good.

5
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:15,724
Which is why we're here.
We'd be going to authenticate

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,269
the finest set of human remains 
from the Iron Age ever found,

7
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:19,700
or dash the hopes of a thousand scholars.

8
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:21,578
Let me know what turns out.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,721
Dr Goodman, this is extremely prestigious!
Aren't you going to be part of the team?

10
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,397
No, I have an institution to run.

11
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,338
Didn't you use to be an archaeologist?

12
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,744
Yes, Mr Addy.
Thanks for reminding me.

13
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:38,615
X-rays, pictures. We're going to do this
without touching the actual skeleton as much as possible.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,081
Kid gloves?
- Latex should be all right.

15
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:47,118
Zack -- were you being metaphoric?
- I decided to give it a shot.

16
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,758
Which is also metaphoric.

17
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:57,767
I need a receptionist.
Can't have just anybody waltzing in here.

18
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:00,579
Take a look at this.

19
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:03,002
Bunch of red circles?

20
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,504
Each circle shows where a body part was found.

21
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:07,911
Is this an airport?
- Los Angeles International.

22
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:11,090
Local pathologist says
the remains are in pretty bad shape.

23
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,546
So you punt it to the FBI.

24
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,630
Airports, they fall under federal jurisdiction.

25
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,261
Excellent use of the word "punt".

26
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,842
I can't go to Los Angeles.
I have an Iron Age warrior to authenticate.

27
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,092
Iron Age warrior?

28
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:23,552
When was the Iron Age?
- 1500 years ago.

29
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,357
Fresh body bits is a little bit more urgent.

30
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:30,541
You do realize there are a lot more fresh bodies
than there are perfect specimens from the Iron Age?

31
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:32,954
When you say things like that,
it's just to bug me, right?

32
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,752
Do we have to go through this every time?

33
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,667
Exactly.

34
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:39,440
Booth can't just walk in and say,
"Pack your bags, we're going to L.A.".

35
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,663
Oh yeah, the whole Ice Age warrior thing.

36
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:42,689
Iron Age.
- Iron Age.

37
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:44,026
And that's not the only thing.

38
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:47,878
Homeland Security asked Dr Brennan to identify
three bodies found in...

39
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,025
I'm not allowed to say.

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,794
The point is, Agent Booth,
Dr Brennan is on great demand

41
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:55,110
on several very pressing cases,
and she's needed here at the museum.

42
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,808
Why should I send her to California?

43
00:01:58,153 --> 00:01:59,798
Sexy case in Hollywood.

44
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,270
How much more good press could the Jeffersonian get?

45
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:11,650
But Dr Goodman! You said the Iron Age warrior
was of the highest priority!

46
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:14,175
I can super on that case.

47
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,215
You pack your bags.

48
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,454
This car doesn't feel very FBI.

49
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,447
Bones, this is a 1966 Mustang.
It's a classic.

50
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,262
What goes better than that with the FBI?

51
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:35,574
How come on the rental agreement under "Model"
did the guy write "sedan"?

52
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:39,714
Bah, we're in California!
Look, palm trees!

53
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:41,708
You know, I'd like to drive sometime.

54
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,973
Look, our contact out here
is Special Agent Trisha Finn.

55
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,435
I'm an excellent driver.

56
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:47,656
OK, Rain Man.
- Don't know what that means.

57
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:50,333
I'm always going to drive.
You know that, right?

58
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,976
Me behind the wheel, you over there,
on the grand Mustang.

59
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,817
I'm not above telling Deputy Director Colin
what kind of car you rented.

<i>JEFFERSONIAN INSTITUTE
MEDICO-LEGAL LAB

61
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,511
You want us to do something
or just stay in here and watch?

62
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,676
I'm getting a feel for the fellow.
- A feel?

63
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:18,633
There's no bugs on him.
Haven't been for over 1000 years.

64
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:21,690
But maybe spores and pollens, correct?
- Probably not.

65
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,558
Dozens of species of pollens
have been discovered from the Cretaceous era.

66
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:27,080
How long ago is that?
- 65 million years.

67
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,763
That was a pretty good comeback.

68
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:32,877
When authenticating a find like this,
we have to be at the top of our game.

69
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:36,250
We all know that you're going to say,
"I'm unable to authenticate with confidence."

70
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:37,477
Why would he do that?

71
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:41,419
When you declare something authentic,
you're under risk of being proven wrong.

72
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,123
That doesn't happen if you equivocate.

73
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:48,479
As head of the Jeffersonian, Dr Goodman will
place the reputation of the Institute above anything else.

74
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:52,958
I'm an archaeologist.
My findings will be congruent with the facts.

75
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:56,762
With all due respect,
you used to be an archaeologist.

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,323
I have no idea
what's going on between you two right now.

77
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,925
Agent Finn,
why was the body removed from the crime scene?

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,292
Call me Trisha, Dr Brennan.

79
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:17,670
The body was removed because
parts were visible to arriving flights.

80
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,145
Here's a map of the crime scene with a legend.

81
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,835
Now, there's a marked cone at the location of each body part,
and each photograph corresponds to a cone.

82
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:28,046
It's how they do it in your book.
- She got that from me.

83
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:29,590
This is not a dismemberment.

84
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,807
You sure, Bones?
I mean, this is LA. They're showy.

85
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:35,990
Is it possible that the body parts
were ground up in the landing gear

86
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:39,480
and then dumped when the airplane landed?
- The dispersal rate is wrong.

87
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:43,039
It looks to me like the body was pulled apart
by a pack of dogs.

88
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:45,523
More likely coyotes.
- Coyotes at the airport?

89
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,916
We got coyotes everywhere.
- Did you know that?

90
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:51,461
No, I thought coyotes were a cowboy thing.

91
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,644
I'd like to see the remains now.

92
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:58,324
COLD EXAMINATION ROOM, L.A. COUNTY MORGUE
- I need all the dirt, silt, bits and pieces collected with the body parts

93
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,960
sent back to the Jeffersonian immediately.

94
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:04,497
You know what I like? When there's no flesh on the bones.
Just a personal preference.

95
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:09,343
There's not much left anyway.
- You, Dr Brennan! As a screenplay writer,...

96
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:12,475
I'd be happy to help you in any way I can
with regard to your movie.

97
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,476
Excuse me?

98
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:16,380
Someone told me they're thinking of
making your book into a movie.

99
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:17,911
Say something, Bones.

100
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:21,200
All I know is, I'm supposed to meet
some big movie producer while I'm here --

101
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,548
if I have time, which I probably won't.

102
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,271
Does the pathologist need any further access
to the remaining soft tissue?

103
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:29,516
No. He got everything out of it he could.

104
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:33,252
So, my own screenplay is about this FBI agent

105
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:38,544
who finds herself on the trail of her former boyfriend, and...
oh... um, God...

106
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,013
OK if you have to leave.

107
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,091
This is not good.
- Yeah, thanks for that insight.

108
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:45,870
No.

109
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:49,407
I mean, the architecture of the skull
has been radically altered.

110
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:53,869
You mean, by rotting and being eaten by coyotes
and having the face ripped off by you?

111
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,838
No, by surgery.

112
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,585
Lots of surgery.

113
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,850
Not sure I'll be able to tell who this was.

114
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,989

Are you getting the feed, Zack?

118
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,709
Yes, Dr Brennan.
I'm looking at the X-rays you beamed to me.

119
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:42,901
I'm going to have the bones cleaned,
but there's still vestiges of flesh.

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,679
Are you there, Ange?

122
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:51,592
Hi! Is it sunny, sweetie?
Tell me it's sunny.

123
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,985
It's sunny. I sent you the entire skull.

124
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,474
You want a reconstruction?
- If you can.

125
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,810
If I can?
Have I ever failed you?

126
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:01,104
This one's different.
You'll see what I mean when you get it.

127
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,320
Zack?
- Here, Dr Brennan.

128
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,766
I make this a young woman.
- Early 20s, from the look of the X-rays.

129
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,395
Cause of death?
- I see evidence of stabbing.

130
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,891
One hit to the sternum,
two hits to the costal cartilages.

131
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:13,392
Estimated time of death?

132
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:17,885
Degradation of remains suggests the body was
left out in the open between a week and 10 days.

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,638
And the marks on the bones suggest carnivorous feeding

134
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,380
beyond insects, birds and rodents.

00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,111

00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:25,179
They have coyotes?
- Yes.

137
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:27,173
That would explain the dispersal of remains.

138
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,633
A pack of coyotes finds the body, pulls it apart,
and spreads out to eat it in solitude.

139
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,083
The teeth are veneered?

140
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,888
The jaw has been broken and re-set,
same with the right leg.

141

Have you seen any movie stars yet?
- No, why?

in which the winner is the person who sees the most celebrities.

00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:46,716
You have a whole skull, right?
- Yes.

144
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:48,348
So why is this going to be so difficult?

145
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:51,419
You'll see.
Ange, on the Iron Age project,

146
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,904
Goodman does this thing.
Hodgins isn't going to like it.

147
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:57,731
What thing?
- He theorizes in an way.

148
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:01,028
It seems like he's making things up.
It's hard to explain, but

149
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,170
it's going to irritate Hodgins.

150
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:05,766
Honey, you're in California.

151
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:10,242
Forget the Iron Age.
Say these words: "Sky bar".

Go there tonight.
Tell me everything.

153
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:18,169
Dr Brennan, one of these X-rays shows
two dark clumps near the pelvis.

154
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,914
Behind what's left to the spleen?

155
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,290
I got a list of missing persons,
women in their early 20s.

156
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,846
Oh... Do I really have to be here for this part?

157
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,568
You think she swallowed that?
- Could be because she was a drug mule.

158
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,982
It's an implant.
Breast implant.

159
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:35,319
Those come with serial numbers.

160
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:38,194
We should be able to identify the victim
in a couple of hours.

161
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:42,878
Unlike other burials of the time, in which
the remains were found in semi-fetal position,

162
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:45,666
this fellow was found on his back,
arms at his sides,

163
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:50,174
with a piece of decorated antler on his chest.

164
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,769
Do you actually need me here?

165
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,126
The antler honors him as a hunter,

166
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,794
although his weapons tell us he was a warrior.

167
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:01,304
He was in his mid 30s when he died.
He was 1.88 m tall.

168
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,931
You know, there's all the detritus
from Brendan's Hollywood crime to sift through.

169
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:08,100
6 ft 1?
A big man for his time!

170
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,125
Feared by his foes,
respected by his neighbors.

171
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,567
You encourage that much conjecture
in archaeology, huh?

172
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:18,586
His bones bear the marks of battle.
His weapons are of good quality, well used.

173
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:22,258
He was old for a warrior, yet...
How did he die, Mr. Addy?

174
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,466
Looks like tuberculosis.

175
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:30,093
A proud man.
It was not the ending he would have wanted.

176
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:34,429
And he was surrounded by family and friends.

177
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,098
A good death.

178
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:39,813
Oh, please. Now you're describing a scene
from Lord Of The Rings.

179
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:43,089
I like that movie.
- He was buried with respect.

180
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:47,811
Weapons, jewelry, his family did not stint or pilfer.

181
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,888
Have you found any spore or fungi, Dr. Hodgins?

182
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,567
Yes. They correspond both with the time he lived
and the geography in which he was found.

183
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,349
What?
- I'd like details.

184
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,877
You mean, like a written report?
- Yes!

185
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,414
Our findings will have to bear
scholarly scrutiny from our peers.

186
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:13,684
What's his problem?

187
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:38,244
Our hotel doesn't even have a pool!

188
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,162
You're welcome to use mine.

189
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,028
Well, the breast implant lead
went nowhere.

190
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:45,983
What about the serial number?

191
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:48,133
The implants were reported stolen
6 months ago.

192
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,894
Our victim must have got them
off the black market.

193
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,630
There's a black market in breast implants?

194
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:54,287
Yeah, and we have the name of the doctor
from whom the implants were stolen.

195
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,651
What use is a black market breast implant?

196
00:10:56,687 --> 00:10:59,591
Like L.A. plastic surgeons use them.
They're not even real doctors.

197
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:03,371
Are you gonna write the screenplay?
- What screenplay?

198
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:04,771
The one based on your book.

199
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:07,846
Well, I guess maybe the producer I'm meeting will tell me.

200
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,552
OK guys, let's turn our attention back to the murder victim.

201
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,224
I'd like to go visit Dr. Boobs.

202
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:16,368
Why? If the implants were stolen from him,
he wouldn't know anything.

203
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:19,804
Because it's the only lead
that we've got, Finn.

204
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,473
And leads are great for screenplays, or even
if you're actually working a real case.

205
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,648
I have something for you.

206
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:35,378
Is it chocolate?

207
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,628
No.

208
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,447
Then I find my interest has flagged.

209
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:44,266
Nice. Who is it?

210
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,891
It's the Hollywood murder victim.

211
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:52,723
Oh my god. I see what Brennan means.
This woman has had a lot of surgery.

212
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:54,195
What's with Goodman and Hodgins?

213
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:58,888
They're guys. They should just
lay them out on the table and measure.

214
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:00,805
Lay what out on the table and measure?

215
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,906
OK... Awkward moment.

216
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:06,245
Let's just say, they have different approaches.

217
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,260
And they're guys. OK?
- I'm a guy.

218
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,355
You are more highly evolved.

219
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:15,046
This girl didn't just change her face,
she changed her skull.

220
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,333
This is going to make Brennan nuts.

221
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,904
You know one thing?
- What's that?

222
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,696
She's going to be beautiful.

223
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:24,026
Why would anyone go through all this pain
and not end up beautiful?

224
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:28,554
Do the names Michael Jackson or Joan Rivers
mean anything to you?

225
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,594
One of them.
The other I'll look up.

226
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,462
Every culture nurtures ideas of beauty
towards which people strive.

227
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:43,398
Fine, but in the future, people'll look back upon
the surgical alterations of the nose or breasts or buttocks

228
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:48,363
with the same horror that we regard the binding of feet
or the use of bronze coils to extend the neck!

229
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:52,736
You want to speak up? 'Cause it's hard
to hear every word in this very quiet waiting room.

230
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,238
It's barbaric! It's painful!
It's wrong!

231
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:01,613
This murder victim may never be identified
because some glorified barbar with a medical degree

232
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:05,006
had the arrogance to think that he could
do better than millennia of evolution.

233
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,128
Do you know what producer
you're meeting with, Dr. Brennan?

234
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,185
No, my publisher didn't give me a name.

235
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,480
I don't know what a producer does, specifically.

236
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,987
Nobody does.
But it's really important.

237
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:15,466
Dr. Kostov will see you now.

238
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,432
You're going to remain here, Agent Finn.

239
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:20,477
Yes, Sir.

240
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:25,988
You recognize this, Dr. Kostov?

241
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:28,952
That'd be your high-profile *double-limen fall sea saline*.

242
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:32,594
Yeah, it's from a shipment of implants
you reported stolen 6 months ago.

243
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,163
I have a hard time believing
you're returning one implant to me.

244
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,393
We found it in the remains of a murdered girl.

245
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,335
Any more of those stolen implants been recovered?

246
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,650
Yeah, approximately 3 weeks ago,
there was a faulty one

247
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,931
that had to be removed
by a surgeon down in the Valley.

248
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,373
From whom?

249
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,240
A Heidi.
- I don't know what that means.

250
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,938
L.A. speak for callgirl.

251
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:50,846
LAPD was investigating.

252
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,701
They can tell you
what agency the girl was working for.

253
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:55,144
You have the most beautiful bone structure.

254
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,453
I can't take credit, it's genetic.
- How old are you?

255
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,919
Why do you want to know?

256
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:04,927
Well, it's never too early to watch problem areas.
The jaw, little pouches beneath the eyes...

257
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:08,452
Do you mind?
- You touch her, she'll break your arm.

258
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,924
She thinks what you do is...
- ...barbaric!

259
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,654
No. Don't look at me.
I like my face the way it is.

260
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,378
Sweetie, I'm having a hard time with this skull.

261
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,938
Did you try filling in the surgical scoring?

262
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,348
I can't be definitive.

263
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,774
All the usual indicators have been modified.

264
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,655
I reconstructed three facial variations.

265
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:36,009
She had her cheekbone shaved,
her chin changed, her jaw reconstructed.

266
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:38,420
That's just what she did to her bones.

267
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,467
We don't have a clue
what she did to the soft tissue.

268
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:42,361
Her nose, her brows,
her cheeks.

269
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:45,315
Just start with the basic architecture.
We'll go from there.

270
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,937
The basic architecture is what I can't find.

271
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,896
You're going to have to make your best estimate.

272
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,644
Did you just tell me to guess?

273
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,771
No, I said, make your best estimate
based upon your experience and expertise.

274
00:14:55,806 --> 00:15:00,358
OK, well, dress it up however you want,
but it's still a guess.

275
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:04,992
Look, my experience and my expertise
don't extend to this.

276
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,736
A facial reconstruction
might not be helpful in this case.

277
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:11,689
Angela, I told you to be hard.
Just do what you can.

278
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:16,106
OK. Brennan, you're being a little edgy and tart with me.

279
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:18,497
All I'm trying to do is tell you the truth.

280
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:21,773
What this young woman did to herself

281
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:24,899
is as if she completely removed her own identity.

282
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:30,120
Who hates herself so much that she not only
changes her looks, but her core architecture?

283
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:35,247
If we don't know who she is, then how will we
be able to catch the person who murdered her?

284
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,666
Is that your way of apologizing?

285
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,925
Yes, Angela.

286
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,619
I accept.
I love your guts, sweetie.

287
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,797
According to LAPD, a black market breast implant
from the same shipment

288
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,917
showed up in another girl from Aphrodite Escorts.

289
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,040
Are you missing anyone?

290
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,779
We're not looking into your business,
Ms Bardu.

291
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,510
We're just trying to solve a murder.

292
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,999
I haven't heard from Rachel in 2 weeks.

293
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:05,149
Is that unusual?

294
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,910
I prefer to ask the questions my own way,
Agent Finn.

295
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,245
Thanks.

296
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,995
Rachel booked out at one-week rate.

297
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,978
She knows to check in with me
if the client wants to extend the contract.

298
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:17,308
It's time to worry.

299
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,685
Do any of these women resemble Rachel?

300
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:28,720
If I had to pick one, this is the closest,
but--not really.

301
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:30,395
Did Rachel have a last name?

302
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,626
Rachel wasn't even her real first name.

303
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,788
She goes by Rachel LeChance.

304
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:38,181
Rachel went to Vegas with a long-time customer.

305
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:39,707
I need his name.

306
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:44,979
Ms Bardu, it's always the same story.
Beautiful young woman,

307
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:51,141
somebody wants to meet her,
somebody can't have her, somebody dies.

308
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,208
Dr Anton Kostov, an assembly-line nip-tucker in town.

309
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:00,967
If that's all...
- Do you have a card, Ms Bardu?

310
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:10,953
We provide a law enforcement discount.

311
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,030
Ms Bardu, do you have any idea
what Rachel looked like before her plastic surgery?

312
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,413
Which time?

313
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,764
The skull is in extremely good shape.

314
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,653
Cranial measurements are congruent with
ancient Saxons, Celts and pre-Aryans.

315
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,125
Which matches the location of the find.

316
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,746
I used Saxon tissue depth for the markers.

317
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,234
However, every skull requires its own unique demands.

318
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,639
Are you certain of your calculations,
Ms Montenegro?

319
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,868
A lot more certain than I am on
Brennan's Hollywood hooker case.

320
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,146
This is a Pict.

321
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:50,018
<i>Picti</i> actually means "painted ones" in Latin.

322
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,705
The Romans feared them.
Very little was written about them or by them.

323
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,286
Fierce warriors,
falsely reported to be small in stature.

324
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:58,755
He's a Pict, so what?

325
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:04,064
The Picts are from the far, far north of the British Isle,
far above Hadrian's wall.

326
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:09,631
The remains were found at an archaeological site
in southern England, near Wales.

327
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,089
The Pict didn't go for a walk?

328
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,794
These remains represent
an archaeological anomaly.

329
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:17,733
This is unique in that no Pict
was ever found this far south before.

330
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:21,165
If we could remove the clothing
and take a closer look at the bones...

331
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,636
It's a face. Maybe Angela got it wrong.
- Hey!

332
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,536
Zack screwed up the measurements.
- Hey!

333
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,648
This whole Pict business
sounds like one of your stories.

334
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,144
Enough.

335
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,432
Are you trying to get fired?

336
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,713
Science is no country for storytellers, baby.

337
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:54,215
Kostov knew Rachel as a patient,
and she knew him as a client.

338
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:57,138
Kostov wasn't the victim's only plastic surgeon.

339
00:18:57,173 --> 00:19:00,887
This are 10x magnifications of the victim's jawbone surgery.

340
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,047
Kostov doesn't do work this sophisticated.

341
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,673
Meaning she had
more than one plastic surgeon.

342
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,079
Zack Addy. I live to serve.

343
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,415
Zack, this facial surgery--

344
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,057
The edges of the bone are almost sculpt,
as if the blade simultaneously cut and applied torsion.

345
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:19,374
And you need to know if this procedure is recognized
and sanctioned by the American Medical Association?

346
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,362
You think Kostov is performing
illegal surgical procedures?

347
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:26,636
It won't help us discover the identity of the victim,
but it may help us catch her killer.

348
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,071
That's the point, Bones.

349
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:29,437
What?
- To catch the murderer?

350
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,937
I'm sending you a catalog of all the stuff they sent me.

351
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,341
Soil samples, pollens, particulates etc.
that were on the body parts.

352
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:38,361
Nothing too surprising, except for (e), glass fibers.

353
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,837
She didn't pick that up in a field.
- No, it's marine fiberglass.

354
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:45,238
The victim was on a boat shortly before she died.
Also, look at this.

355
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:47,392
A fingernail. Probably her own.

356
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,512
I sent it to the FBI crime lab so that they can run DNA tests.

357
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:53,247
That's zirconium, by the way, not a diamond.

358
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,654
So I'm guessing she wasn't your
top-drawer high-class prostitute.

359
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:58,886
All the osteological perturbations are consistent
with reasonal acts of surgery,

360
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,890
Except for compound fractures in the right tibia and fibula,

361
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:04,824
which indicate traumatic compression and *adrenachy*.

362
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,070
The victim had her leg crushed,
probably in a car accident around age 13.

363
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:11,444
Excuse me, this is my cellphone!
- I analized the molars.

364
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:15,347
*Atrigen* and strontium isotopes in the enamel indicate
early childhood in New England,

365
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:19,180
while the dentine suggests 6-10 years in Southern California.

366
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:22,407
Hey, Ms Bardu. Hi. Special Agent Booth.
I reconsidered your offer.

367
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,360
I was wondering if I could have
one of your ladies visit me today.

368
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,872
Are you ordering a prostitute from my cellphone?

369
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:29,279
I wonder if Rachel ever took part
in any of those 2-on-1 specials?

370
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:32,190
Hey, the old 2-on-1 special. Classic.
- What's a classic?

371
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:34,426
That's great. Just send me
whoever she worked with the most.

372
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,627
Are you ordering a hooker to my hotel?

373
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:37,700
Did I hear you say hooker?

374
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:39,836
How come I never get to go on these out-of-town trips?

375
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,181
You have much looser daily allowances than I do.

376
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:45,601
Well, have fun.
I have to get up early tomorrow.

377
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:46,454
Why?

378
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,854
I'm meeting the producer.

379
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:55,076
Oh, you're one of those guys.

380
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,752
What guys?
- One of those guys who say they just want to talk.

381
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,826
They do just want to talk.

382
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,084
I'm an FBI agent.

383
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:06,547
OK, I get the drill.
What am I playing?

384
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,352
No, really, Leslie.

385
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:13,915
I'm really an FBI agent.

386
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,502
I just want to ask you some questions, that's all.

387
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,607
About what?
- About your friend Rachel.

388
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,605
Look, I'm sorry, but
I think she's been murdered.

389
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:32,478
This can't be happening.

390
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,576
God. Rachel was so nice.

391
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:42,732
She was really an actress.

392
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,446
You know, the way I'm really a singer.

393
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:49,442
We all say we're something different than what we are.

394
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,546
None of us want to be what we are.

395
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,949
Do you know Rachel's real name?

396
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,513
Candice.
Candice Hayden.

397
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,104
But I doubt that was her real name.

398
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:07,345
She said she was from Sockton,
but I told her I was from Cordaline, and I was lying.

399
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,725
Do you know why anyone would want Candice dead?

400
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:12,420
We see things we shouldn't all the time.

401
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:15,707
We know things about powerful people
they don't want us to know.

402
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,233
Did Candice have anyone in her life?

403
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,679
Nick. For a while.

404
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:25,234
I forgot his last name, but he
played some kind of terrorist on "24".

405
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,581
He got killed in like 4 seconds.

406
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,908
Did Nick know that Candice was a callgirl?

407
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:34,154
Not at first.
And when he found out, he was really mad.

408
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,198
He smashed all the windows of her car.

409
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:40,599
I'm sorry, Miss,
but you're going to have to leave.

410
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:44,329
Listen, buddy, I don't know what your problem is,
but this is my little sister.

411
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:49,596
I'm visiting from Cordaline. I asked her here for a drink.
Which is taking a hell of a long time btw.

412
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:51,862
I'm sorry, sir, but we have strict rules...

413
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,350
You might want to have a little bit of respect...

414
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,005
And check on those drinks for us.
OK, pal?

415
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,643
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

416
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,050
Thank you.

417
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,426
So...

418
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,113
Are we just going to sit here and have a drink?

419
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,662
That's all?

420
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:17,177
That's all, Leslie. Have a drink, enjoy the view.
Pretend we belong here.

421
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:19,728
And later, catch a murderer.

422
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:25,443
Agent Booth, can I have a moment please?

423
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,128
Have I done something to offend you?

424
00:23:30,163 --> 00:23:33,937
Look, I'm not really into this West Coast
"in touch with your feelings" thing, OK? So...

425
00:23:33,972 --> 00:23:37,342
I'm really good at my job.

426
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:40,939
And I've been nothing but
cooperative and helpful to you,

427
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,785
but you just freeze me out.

428
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:47,857
And I know that you have nothing against working with women,

429
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:51,881
because you're partners with Dr Brennan,
so your problem must be with me.

430
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:56,312
Look, I don't have anything against you, Agt Finn.
I just don't like the way you view the FBI.

431
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,253
What do you mean?

432
00:23:57,288 --> 00:24:01,249
This is a proud and noble job,
but you're using it to get to something else.

433
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:07,102
My advice: Write your script. Get an agent.
Hell, have a little plastic surgery.

434
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:12,402
But quit using my Federal Bureau of Investigation
as a stepping-stone into something that you think is better.

435
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:15,666
Because in my book,
there is nothing better.

436
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:22,223
I'm here with Penny Marshall,
one of the most prolific "hyphenates" in Hollywood.

437
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:27,179
Actress, producer and director of such hits as
"A League Of Their Own" and "Big".

438
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:30,000
Her latest project is "Bred In The Bone",

439
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:36,893
a thriller based on the bestselling novel
by crime-fighting anthropologist Dr Temperance Brennan.

440
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:39,650
OK, so how did this all come together?

441
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,358
I have no idea.

442
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:45,174
Well, my brother Gary gave me the book,
and I liked it,

443
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:47,988
And then this whole bidding war started,

444
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:51,137
and I usually don't get into that kind of thing,
but in this case...

445
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:54,534
A bidding war? That's got to be
a thrill for a first-time author.

446
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,869
I wasn't actually there.

447
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:59,434
You must be a big fan of Penny's films.
So which one's your favorite?

448
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:03,212
I enjoyed her humorous treatment
of the time/space paradox.

449
00:25:08,191 --> 00:25:09,457
"Big"!

450
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,259
Very funny.
"Time/space paradox".

451
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:16,843
Penny, who is going to write the script?

452
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:18,827
Don't I get to do that?

453
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,593
We'll talk.

454
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:26,777
Cut, stop. Whatever you say.
Brennan?

455
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:29,197
Well, I want to come with you.

456
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:32,973
I have to go, 'cause we have a suspect,
and I have to go.

457
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:36,336
Would you look at that... passion!

458
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:53,047
Pretty good chance
one of these leaping losers is our killer.

459
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,137
You always think it's the boyfriend.

460
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:58,418
Well, he loved her.
Found out that she was a prostitute.

461
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:05,054
I'd say, anyone who plays this stupid game
is capable of murder.

462
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:08,949
Now then, we got this case sewed up.
Why don't you just go and arrest them all?

463
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:14,776
Excuse me, guys. Ladies.
Ladies, Gentlemen, excuse me.

464
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:15,777
Please?

465
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:24,770
Excused.
- Everyone who isn't Nick Carverson, go get the ball.

466
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:32,578
God, she was so sweet.

467
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,915
I sure thought about getting back together with her.
Even though...

468
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,809
You broke all the windows in her car?

469
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,520
What would you do
if you found out your girlfriend was a prostitute?

470
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,027
When did you last see Rachel?

471
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:45,551
Sandra.

472
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,061
Her name is Sandra Caine.
At least as far as I knew.

473
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,008
When did you last see Sandra?

474
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:54,794
About a month ago. I was tending bar
at a function at the colony.

475
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,685
Did you speak to her?

476
00:26:57,273 --> 00:27:00,099
No. No, I was working. So was she.

477
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,511
But I didn't kill her.

478
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:06,153
How could you not know what she was doing for money?
Did you even know her at all?

479
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:10,338
She said she was modeling.
The thing about Sandra is that...

480
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:14,495
as pretty as she was,
she was just never pretty enough.

481
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:21,000
She'd be all black and blue, and then she would heal,
and she would look beautiful.

482
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:24,982
I mean, really really beautiful.
And we'd be sure that something was going to break for her.

483
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,181
And then she would be back in front of that mirror.

484
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:32,455
And no matter what I said...

485
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:37,962
Look, I never knew her.
I never understood her.

486
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:40,170
I'm probably the last guy
you should be asking about her.

487
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:44,497
He's an actor.
Of course he's convincing.

488
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,101
I don't know. Doesn't seem to work very much,
he's playing volleyball all the day.

489
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:51,027
Just an observation.

490
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,984
I have an announcement.

491
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:57,663
You are unable to
positively authenticate the skeleton.

492
00:27:57,698 --> 00:27:58,958
That is correct.

493
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,833
Told you!

494
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:04,955
Given the inconsistency between
the specimen's geographic location,

495
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,133
physiognomy and artifacts,
I cannot in good faith authenticate the find.

496
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:10,173
Is this because of how I made him look?

497
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:14,193
'Cause there's a certain amout of subjectivity
involved in recreating a face.

498
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:18,008
To a certain amount, yes. But the fact is,
he displays Pictish features.

499
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:21,942
For all we know, this skull
doesn't belong to this body.

500
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:25,840
Even though on X-rays it looks as though
the head is properly attached to the spinal chord,

501
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,710
we could actually go in and look.
Confirm the authenticity.

502
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:33,031
I decline to continue the investigation at this time.
We will store the remains in the interim.

503
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,641
I knew this was going to happen!
- Hodgins...

504
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:43,937
Because we have been colleagues on this,
more than superior and subordinate,

505
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:49,067
I have allowed you to be insubordinate.
But I warn you, Dr Hodgins:

506
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,865
That is over.

507
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,191
Do you want my letter of resignation?

508
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:56,569
You know what'd be better?

509
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:59,668
Put them on the table and measure, right?

510
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:02,952
OK, look. Everybody just turn and walk away.

511
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:06,941
If you want me to resign, just say so.

512
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,595
Ms Montenegro is right.

513
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,826
You think you just won something.

514
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,524
I'm telling you, Goodman was the bigger man.

515
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:29,290
Isn't it against your ethical code to have sexual relations
with a patient? Do you guys even have an ethical code?

516
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:31,377
Sex with patients is frowned upon.

517
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:35,194
That's why he said the implants were stolen.
No way to prove that he was the one who installed them.

518
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:38,853
I did not know Rachel was dead when you last visited.
And I did not kill Rachel.

519
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,203
I made her beautiful.

520
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:44,180
You mean, you took what was unique
and particular about her, and destroyed it.

521
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,022
You have a serious neurosis on this subject.

522
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:46,915
Do you have a boat?

523
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:50,219
I do 4 boob jobs a day, 20 grand a pop.
Of course I have a boat.

524
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,879
That's all you get without a lawyer.

525
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:55,116
What do you do?
Pay him in hairplugs?

526
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:57,930
Still working on the murder weapon?

527
00:29:57,931 --> 00:30:01,272
Maybe it's not a knife.
Maybe it's some kind of sharpened screwdriver.

528
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,513
Why are you being so mean to Dr Goodman?

529
00:30:03,514 --> 00:30:06,134
I'm not being mean.
I'm being critical of his process.

530
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,400
Why are you being so critical of his process?

531
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:12,030
Goodman should be looking at the facts.
Is this skeleton authentic or not. That's all.

532
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,556
Instead, it's all a mish-mash of conjecture.

533
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,240
What I think is, he's forgotten how to do the science
and doesn't want to admit it.

534
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,139
Why a screwdriver?

535
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:25,335
Because there's more torsion in the cut
than a flat-bladed knife can bear without snapping.

536
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,204
It twists without breaking.

537
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:30,990
The killer would have to be incredibly strong.
And even then, the blade would snap.

538
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,236
That's what Brennan said about the jaw surgery thing.

539
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:34,126
What?

540
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:38,725
I don't know, I do bugs and silt,
but she said the words "torsion" and "twist".

541
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:49,696
This is the type of situation
where people say "Oh my god".

542
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:51,521
Pretend you're a person and say it.

543
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,599
Oh my god.

544
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:58,550
Scenario #1: Prostitute gets breast augmentation
from plastic surgeon in return for sex.

545
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:00,504
She threatens to tell on him.
- Plausible.

546
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:03,977
Scenario #2: Jealous boyfriend, well...
yada yada, you know the rest.

547
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,466
Which do you like?
- Neither.

548
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,720
Because there is no hell evidence.
- Unless you count the volleyball.

549
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:10,917
Sounds like you're getting ready to quit.

550
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,608
Quit?
No.

551
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:16,313
Just the Deputy Director wants me to
hand the case over to L.A. Field Office.

552
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:19,224
We're supposed to give Agent Finn what we got,
and go home.

553
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:22,206
What? Forget it! You don't even like Agent Finn.
You think she's an idiot.

554
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,828
Bones, the whole case is a buzz. It's a blank.

555
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:28,178
We don't have anything. We checked her apartment, nothing.
There are no pictures, nothing.

556
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:30,030
We don't know what she looks like,
we don't know her name.

557
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:32,673
It's like she lived on the world instead of in it.

558
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:39,126
Colin is calling you back because he thinks that
I'm at a dead end. You have to tell him he's wrong.

559
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:50,994
Is he wrong?

560
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:54,563
We know we're looking for someone
who grew up in New England,

561
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:56,468
moved here about 8 years ago,

562
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:59,633
her leg was crushed
in a car accident when she was 13,

563
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:02,250
she was on a boat
shortly before she was murdered,

564
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,845
we know some of her names
and some of her faces.

565
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,023
That's all your stuff.

566
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,318
Usually, by now we know more about my stuff.

567
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:11,951
What, we have separate stuff?

568
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:14,497
Yeah, by now I usually have a feel for the person.

569
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,872
What they wanted, how they felt,
what was going on in their lives.

570
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,213
With this girl, nothing.

571
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,228
She thought she was ugly.

572
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:24,714
She did everything she could to make herself beautiful.

573
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,932
And all she did was make herself more invisible.

574
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:32,205
Everybody in this city thinks they're ugly.
And nobody is.

575
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,243
I'm starting to get
why you hate anonymous deaths so much.

576
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:39,882
We are born unique.
Our experiences mold and change us.

577
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,059
We become someone, all of us,
and to have that taken away by murder,

578
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,284
to be erased from existence
against our will, it's just...

579
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,972
Evil?
- Unacceptable.

580
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:52,938
These bones you bring me,
I give them a face, I say their names out loud,

581
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:57,776
I return them to their loved ones,
and you arrest the bad guy. I like that.

582
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,030
So do I.

583
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:04,946
I feel like we should be arresting these doctors
because, whether they killed her or not,

584
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,349
they still erased her.

585
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:10,605
Yeah, maybe I could help calling off for a day.

586
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,056
It's not good enough.

587
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,502
You're welcome.

588
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,675
Brennan.
- Her murder weapon is a larger version

589
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,553
of the surgical implement used on the victim's jaw.

590
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:27,196
You compared the wounds to the marks left on the jaw?
That's brilliant, Zack.

591
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:32,333
It was Hodgins. Well, Hodgins quoting you,
so it was us. Go team.

592
00:33:32,368 --> 00:33:35,367
But get this: According to the National Plastic Surgery Association,

593
00:33:35,402 --> 00:33:38,366
there's only one surgeon who does this procedure.
- Tell me he's in L.A.

594
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,329
He's in L.A.

595
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:44,173
Dr Henry Atlas, Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills. Go!

596
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:50,130
I'm ethically bound to
ask you for a warrant

597
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:54,077
before revealing the identity
of any of my patients.

598
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:58,362
Let me try this, then: The jaw procedure which
Dr Brennan described to you as...

599
00:33:58,397 --> 00:33:59,422
Was my innovation, yes.

600
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:01,778
There's an adage in my business:
"You can't alter the bone."

601
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:05,681
I've proven it incorrect.

602
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:08,979
Given the right patients.
- How many have you done?

603
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:12,595
Perhaps half a dozen.
And if you get a warrant,

604
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,638
I will release the names of my patients. Otherwise...
- Do you use special operating instruments?

605
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:18,660
Yes, I designed them myself,
specifically for the procedure.

606
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:20,462
Have you patented them

607
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:22,706
or shared the design with anyone?
- Not yet.

608
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,060
He's waiting until he'll have
enough success stories to cash in.

609
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:27,380
He's going to be short of one success story.

610
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:32,451
Let's see what we got here...
Sandra Caine, Rachel LeChance, Candice Hayden...

611
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:37,522
Do any of these women there ring a bell?
- As I have reiterated...

612
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:41,638
I have a search warrant here.
To collect your surgical instruments.

613
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:47,714
You'll shut me down.
You will cost me a fortune.

614
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:51,526
The only ones we require, Dr Atlas,
are the ones you designed yourself.

615
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:57,535
She told me her name was Susan Shepard.

616
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:18,353
Brilliant.

617
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:26,310
You wanted to see me?

618
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:34,749
You are a very difficult and stubborn man, Dr Hodgins.

619
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,954
Right now, I'd like nothing more than to fire you.

620
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,962
In my position, very few people tell me the truth anymore.

621
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:50,241
I find I enjoy it.

622
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:51,698
In some perverse way.

623
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,320
You are willing to admit you bailed on the autentication?
- Yes.

624
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,687
Seriously?

625
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:57,775
But not for the reasons you think.

626
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:04,007
True, we might be able to authenticate the skeleton
by taking him apart. Destroying him.

627
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:09,549
If he's a fake, that would be fine. Nothing lost.
But I think he's the real thing.

628
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,010
You do know he's been dead for 1500 years, right?

629
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:18,896
I am an archaeologist. This is what we do.
We step outside the facts

630
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:23,783
and tell ourselves the story of an individual or a culture.

631
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:28,897
And if this story I tell myself about this man
who lived 1500 years ago is true,

632
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:34,139
if he was layed to rest by people who respected and loved him,

633
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:39,346
don't I owe to them
not to let the pure scientist desecrate his remains?

634
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:46,732
Or you could be totally rational and say,

635
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:52,325
you were waiting for imaging technology to improve to the point
where it wasn't necessary to disassemble him.

636
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,466
Ah. Yes.

637
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:02,067
I suppose I could say that, it's less...
- Sentimental.

638
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:05,338
For the pure scientists.

639
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,175
I've got the murder weapon.

640
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:53,028
We have the murder weapon.
We have trace evidence, from your boat.

641
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,123
We have testimony from your staff
that you argued with the woman you knew was Susan Shepard,

642
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:59,183
shortly before she died.
- What you need now is a confession.

643
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:04,024
Your patient list is what's known as an "A list", right?

644
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,045
Oscar winners, supermodels, superagents. Moguls.

645
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,687
So how is it that a callgirl makes the grade?

646
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,537
You can answer that, Henry.

647
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:17,191
I did Susan's procedure pro bono.
- Why?

648
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,519
Because she volunteered.
- She was a guinea pig.

649
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,679
How did you meet her?

650
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:28,043
Now, come on.
Susan just didn't walk into your office, did she?

651
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,985
Oh, just tell them, Henry.

652
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,961
Through another callgirl, one I used regularly.
Sometimes these girls from the high-class establishments

653
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:43,603
start to have expectations
beyond the professional.

654
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:48,178
She thought you were going to marry her?
- Something along those lines, yes.

655
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:51,248
So I made a change.
I started requesting Susan.

656
00:38:51,283 --> 00:38:53,311
Did you trade plastic surgery for sexual favors?

657
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,340
Obfuscate, Henry.

658
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:58,551
We did each other favors.
Went fine for a few months.

659
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,677
Until Susan wanted you to marry her too.

660
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:04,037
No. In my opinion, Susan
had become addicted to plastic surgery.

661
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:06,474
I refused to do any more procedures.

662
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:09,930
That's what my staff heard us arguing about.
- What was Susan like?

663
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:16,135
She was a "girl next door",
simple, healthy.

664
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:20,975
The girl before Susan was the opposite.
She was very flashy.

665
00:39:21,577 --> 00:39:24,123
She had diamonds in her incisives,
diamonds in her fingernails.

666
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:28,397
Bones, didn't Hodgins find a fingernail?
- Yes, with a fake diamond in it.

667
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:30,793
Susan was the girl-next-door type.

668
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:33,823
It wasn't her fingernail.
- Jealousy, like I said. So...

669
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:36,482
What was the name of the escort before Susan?

670
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:40,409
The flashy one.
The one who thought you were going to marry her.

671
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:42,731
Tell the man what he needs to know, Henry.

672
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:39,728
She thought Atlas was going to
take her out of her life.

673
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,615
You wanted the girl next door.
You were right. Jealousy.

674
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:50,299
That's an old story.
But your 1500 year old friend back home, utter diversion.

675
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:54,789
Leslie thought Rachel was stealing her man,
so she killed her.

676
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:57,821
What did she ask you?
- What?

677
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,741
She asked you something after she was arrested.
What was it?

678
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:05,221
She asked me...
if I thought she was beautiful.

679
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:10,690
One more thing. I had the Bureau search for adolescent girls

680
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:14,708
that were injured in car crashes
in the upper northeast, 10-12 years ago.

681
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:20,088
Daughter's right leg was crushed.

682
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:23,411
Allison.
Her name was Allison Holmes.

683
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:25,989
Her father and her brother are still alive.
Somewhere in Bangor, Maine.

684
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:28,533
We'll return the remains.

685
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,163
Thanks, Booth.

686
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:33,471
You know, Bones --
You do your thing,

687
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,641
I do mine.

688
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:39,939
Look at her.
- Yeah.

689
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:42,487
Pretty little thing.
