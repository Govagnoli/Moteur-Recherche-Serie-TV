1
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:33,234
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

2
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,401
<i>Every family</i>
 <i>has its secrets, Bones.</i>

3
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,767
This was Warren's room.

4
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:47,500
No one's been up here since the
detective first looked it over.

5
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,333
The news said there was
hardly anything left of him.

6
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,433
Can you think of anyone
who might have wanted

7
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,134
to... harm Warren in any way?

8
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:59,867
He was always by himself.

9
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:03,400
No friends, no enemies.

10
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:06,367
Spent all his time up here
with his comic books

11
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,500
and toys.

12
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,001
He was a lonely kid.

13
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,867
Boy died before he even
had a life.

14
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,600
I really thought
he had just run away.

15
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,500
We tried.

16
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,934
Tried to get him
out of this place,

17
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,634
into some kind of real life.

18
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,001
I even got him a job
at the bowling alley,

19
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:36,801
but... he just spent
all his money on this stuff.

20
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,667
Unbelievable.

21
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,634
Mm.

22
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,168
That's quite the collection
of comic books.

23
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,634
Hodgins said that

24
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,400
the cellulose mass
was a graphic novel.

25
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:54,667
He sent it to Angela
for analysis and recovery.

26
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:58,134
Sweet.
Sweet?

27
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,667
This is <i>Batman</i> #127, featuring
the Hammer of the Thor.

28
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,168
This is worth about 300 bucks.

29
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,467
Booth, are you a nerd?

30
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,367
First of all, you mean geek,
and no, I'm not, okay?

31
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,967
It's quite normal
for an American male

32
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,834
to read comic books.

33
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,567
I find it hard to believe
you have anything in common

34
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,234
with Warren Granger.

35
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,134
Oh, you mean isolated,
with an inner secret life?

36
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,300
No, I'd say <i>you</i>
were more like Warren.

37
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,034
Zack discovered some significant
hairline parry fractures

38
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,534
on the right and left ulnae.

39
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,867
It's his arms.

40
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:34,901
I know ulna means forearm--
I pay attention.

41
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,734
I also know
that parry fracture means

42
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,600
that the kid fought back, Bones.

43
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:42,268
Small of stature, a geek,
and he fought back.

44
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,500
Yeah, he also got
thrown from a roof.

45
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:49,500
There's nothing but games
on here.

46
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,134
There's no journal.

47
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,067
There's no documents,
nothing personal.

48
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:55,400
What did he do
at his desk?

49
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,534
I mean,
there's a light;

50
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,467
The rug is worn.

51
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:00,867
He used this area
for something.

52
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,333
What was it?

53
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,534
It's probably where he read
his comic books.

54
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:18,300
I think Warren sat here
and wrote, longhand,

55
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,201
with a ballpoint pen.

56
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,433
That's pretty retro for a geek.

57
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,567
Well, at least we know

58
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,134
where he got the idea
for a costume.

59
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:27,734
<i>Citizen 14.</i>

60
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:32,734
Superhero.

61
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,901
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-xxy
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-</font>

62
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:07,500
MONTENEGRO:
Hodgins dried out
and separated the pages.

63
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,600
I digitized them and
adjusted for ink seepage.

64
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,400
Was this printed
commercially?

65
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,034
No, it's a prototype,
it's handmade.

66
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,801
That's what he was writing
at his desk.

67
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,967
A comic book starring himself.

68
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:23,201
A shy, adolescent young man
renders himself as a superhero.

69
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,001
Alone in that room
all the time,

70
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,067
maybe Warren got consumed
by his own fantasy.

71
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:29,500
You think he was actually
out fighting crime?

72
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,234
Well, the boy
got beaten to a pulp

73
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,001
while wearing
his superhero outfit

74
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,300
in the heaviest crime area
of D.C., Bones.

75
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,367
As you know, being a writer
yourself, Dr. Brennan,

76
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,201
Warren Granger's comic book
could be infused

77
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,300
with his real life fears
and conflicts.

78
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,634
Especially in the case
of an adolescent writer.

79
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,767
Can you retrieve any more
of this?

80
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,001
Yeah, sure.

81
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,300
Fine.

82
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,801
What's our next step?

83
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,500
Oh, we'll go see if Warren
had any friends

84
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,534
his mother didn't know about.

85
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,400
MAN:
Wait a minute--
Warren Granger was

86
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,433
the skeleton corpse
those kids found?

87
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah. Sounds like
you were close.

88
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,333
How long was he lying there
all dead like that?

89
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,234
BRENNAN:
Well, for a while.

90
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,001
How well did you know
Warren, Mr. Ellis?

91
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,234
He came in here all the time.

92
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,433
You know, he, uh,
knew his stuff.

93
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,600
He was a nice kid.

94
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,901
Really nice guy.

95
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,168
Something you're not telling us?

96
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,433
What do you mean?

97
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,234
Well, you seem a little nervous.

98
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,867
You just told me
that someone I know

99
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,467
that's been all
over the news.

100
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:31,734
What do you expect?

101
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:33,300
Is there a party upstairs?

102
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,367
Oh, it's the, uh...

103
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,001
Doomsday Group.

104
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,268
I rent it out Thursday nights.

105
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,268
It's a role-playing group.

106
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:46,467
Hey, wait, um, Warren was
actually one of them.

107
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,967
Oh, well, you know, that's
a handy thing to remember.

108
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:51,001
Anything else you forget
to mention to me?

109
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,333
No, that's it, I think.

110
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,901
( <i>speaking indistinctly</i> )

111
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,634
Hey, excuse me,
this is a private function,

112
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,134
So, good-bye.

113
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:11,300
Go ahead--
don't let me stop you.

114
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,700
What are you doing, exactly?

115
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,433
BOOTH:
Guys, this is actually

116
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,168
a real live woman--
something you don't see often.

117
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,500
And like I said, this is
a private function, so...

118
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,001
Hey, it's the FBI,
all right?!

119
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,268
Just turn it off for a minute,

120
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,367
Please?
FBI?

121
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,534
( <i>sirens wailing</i> )
I'm Yasutani the Terrible.

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,700
I speak for this clan.

123
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,300
Okay, well,
we'd like to ask you

124
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:36,867
a few of questions,
if you're not too, uh, busy.

125
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:39,500
BRENNAN:
The costumes,
the social awkwardness,

126
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,234
the active fantasy life,
the victim would fit

127
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,634
right into
this sub-grouping.

128
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,168
BOOTH:
Okay. Hey, Mr., uh...

129
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,001
Yakitori the Horrible?

130
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,367
What's your real name?

131
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,001
Jeremy Kuznetsky.

132
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,567
Do any of you people
know Warren Granger?

133
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,367
Something happened
to Warren, didn't it?

134
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,534
Warren's dead.

135
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,268
He was murdered.

136
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,634
No, I never said anything
about him being murdered.

137
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,934
Neither did the press.

138
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,168
Yeah, well, obviously,
if you're the FBI,
he was murdered.

139
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,101
You guys don't investigate
people getting hit by a bus.

140
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,534
Okay, great--
when's the last time

141
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,901
any of you have seen Warren?

142
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,467
KUZNETSKY:
Couple months ago, when he left.

143
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:11,634
Left?

144
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,268
Citizen 14 was
one of us...

145
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,901
until he went psycho,
and bugged out,

146
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,034
called us all posers.

147
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,934
"Pathetic fantasists."

148
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,500
BRENNAN:
Was he wearing

149
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,367
his, um... outfit?

150
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,201
His identity, yeah.

151
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:26,367
Why do you wear
these identities?

152
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,634
For the game.

153
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,168
How serious do you
take the game?

154
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,268
It's only fun
if you take it seriously.

155
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,967
You always play here?

156
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:35,201
You know, "play" is not exactly
the right verb, okay?

157
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,834
YASUTANI:
Don't even try

158
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,234
to explain it to them.
Shut up! Who cares?!

159
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,801
Didn't you hear?!
Warren is dead!

160
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,534
It's okay, Minnow!

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,700
BOOTH:
What's your name?

162
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,700
Blue Minnow.

163
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:44,867
Okay, guys,

164
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,268
when I ask your names,

165
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,700
I want the ones that
your parents gave.

166
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,500
Abigail Zealey.

167
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,567
Citizen 14 was my partner.

168
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,234
Is that what you
call Warren?

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,700
Citizen 14?

170
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,567
Citizen 14 was my partner.

171
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:58,134
Warren was my friend.

172
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,801
It was a little more
than that.

173
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,801
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Hey, hey, hey.

174
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,600
BRENNAN:
 <i>I don't like to judge</i>
 <i>an entire subculture,</i>

175
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,867
but those people
gave me the creeps.

176
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,101
Because they are creepy.

177
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:18,034
What? Those kids at the school
weren't your good old harmless,

178
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:19,734
tutor-you-in-math geeks.

179
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:23,367
They were the
set-the-school-on-fire geeks.

180
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,934
Dark nerds.

181
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,168
Columbine nerds.

182
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,801
Columbine?

183
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,367
You think Yasutani the Terrible
is actually capable of murder?

184
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,101
I think they get high,

185
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:35,867
they play these games,
they lose their grip on reality.

186
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,934
They start to believe
that they are these characters.

187
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:41,201
You mean like Warren,
out fighting crime?

188
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,567
You know, maybe
Warren and that guy,

189
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,600
the leader, Yasuhama...

190
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,001
Yasutani the Terrible.

191
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:46,934
Yeah, Yasutani
the Terrible.

192
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:49,534
Maybe him and that guy,

193
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,333
they got into this magic fight,
and it became real.

194
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,834
So you're saying it wasn't
Warren who was murdered.

195
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:59,700
It was his character,
Citizen 14.

196
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,268
They're so delusional,
they don't even know

197
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,001
that they've committed a crime.

198
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,300
I'll get Hodgins to see
if there's any signs

199
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,234
of drug use in Warren's hair.

200
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,934
I've managed to get some of
the text back from this panel.

201
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,734
Cheerful little tyke.

202
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,967
The writer was in pain.

203
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,734
I don't think it was

204
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:19,367
purely the adolescent angst
of the outsider.

205
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,333
In fact, I'd go
so far as to say

206
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,967
it wasn't mere
psychological pain.

207
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,834
He's afraid of actual,
physical death.

208
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:29,367
Can you really pull all that
information from a comic book?

209
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,667
Absolutely.

210
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:31,867
All writers reveal
more of themselves

211
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,600
than they intend on every page.

212
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,634
You know, I never bought
all that English 101 stuff.

213
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,534
Sometimes a river
is just a river.

214
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,001
All due respect,
but my writing,

215
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,767
for example, is pure fiction.

216
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,901
GOODMAN:
Dr. Brennan,

217
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,634
I fear you reveal
much more of your world-view

218
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,867
in your writing
than you realize.

219
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,034
Such as?

220
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,901
Such as archaeologists
make good administrators

221
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,967
because they enjoy tedium.

222
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,234
MONTENEGRO:
Such as artists are doomed
to a life of loneliness

223
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,634
because they aren't able
to think

224
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,101
beyond instant gratification.

225
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,034
BOOTH:
Such as FBI guys are hot

226
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:00,767
and Angela here wants
to have sex with me.

227
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,433
All I'm suggesting is that,
while Dr. Goodman

228
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,333
goes through
Warren's writing,

229
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,234
we should concentrate
on the hypotheses

230
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,734
that are congruent
with forensic evidence.

231
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,634
I'm going to take another look

232
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,634
at Warren Granger's remains.

233
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,634
ADDY:
In the last 24 hours, I've read

234
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,867
several dozen comic books
and graphic novels.

235
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,333
Hodgins find any sign
of drug use?

236
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,534
No.

237
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,234
They're quite interesting,

238
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,667
the graphic novels, especially.

239
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,201
After you clean the
bones, look for scoring

240
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:35,567
on the occipital condyle and
the inferior nuchal line.

241
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,500
They're basically a retelling
of the Greek myths

242
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,567
with all superheroes
standing in for Hercules:

243
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,901
half god, half human.

244
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,168
Be very careful here.

245
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:50,801
X ray shows fragmentation
of the cervical vertebrae

246
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,634
consistent
with sharp force trauma.

247
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,400
Invulnerability,
super strength,

248
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:59,268
heightened senses, telekinesis.

249
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,467
I would love to have
some of those powers.

250
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,767
Why?

251
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:06,934
I don't really know.

252
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:08,667
Is it an odd desire?

253
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:09,667
Why fantasize?

254
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,134
You're smart.

255
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,433
In some ways,
my intelligence is a handicap.

256
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,400
For one thing, I'm weird.

257
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,467
For another, I tend to make
people feel stupid,

258
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,134
and they resent me for it.

259
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,801
I suspect it's the same
for superpowers.

260
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,134
The victim was stabbed here

261
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,400
at the base of the spine.

262
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,101
The spinal cord was severed.

263
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,667
That's what killed him.

264
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,367
I'll clean the bones
and try to match

265
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,134
a weapon to the damage done.

266
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,677
????

267
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,871
In this restored panel from
the second and final volume

268
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:46,504
of Citizen 14, we begin
to see a female presence,

269
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:51,971
beautiful, ethereal,
which he calls the Opalescence.

270
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:54,637
A girl he literally
can't approach.

271
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,994
What if Warren was only...

272
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:03,061
you know, supplying his own
masturbatory materials?

273
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:04,127
Yes.

274
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,860
Lonely adolescent boy.

275
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,760
But the story moves
beyond that dimension.

276
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:11,660
Here we see the idealized
female Opalescence

277
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,827
cowering before
a dark male figure

278
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:16,627
referred to
only as the Twisted.

279
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:18,994
So Citizen 14 wants to rescue

280
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:21,794
the Opalescence
from the Twisted.

281
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,994
Could this be Warren's mother
and stepfather?

282
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:27,361
Elements of romantic love.

283
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,261
This girl surrounded by blue.

284
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:38,560
And one of those comic book
geeks was a blue girl.

285
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:41,727
I'd say she's definitely
worth questioning.

286
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,061
BOOTH:
Blue Minnow.

287
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:44,294
That's your alter ego.

288
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,527
Abigail Zealey is my alter-ego.

289
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:49,194
Did you, Abigail,
have a relationship

290
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,660
with Warren Granger,
or did the Blue Minnow

291
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:53,827
have a relationship
with Citizen 14?

292
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:55,994
Or any combination thereof.

293
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,894
Neither.

294
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,860
Warren had a girlfriend

295
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,961
at Capital Bowl.

296
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,493
What's the girlfriend's name,
Abby?

297
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,394
He never told us her name.

298
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,261
It was just a physical thing.

299
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:11,760
And it was almost over.

300
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:13,627
Warren and I had a connection.

301
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:15,493
He couldn't deny that.

302
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,827
Before he disappeared,

303
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,860
he gave me his entire
Neil Gaiman collection--

304
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,328
his favorite work
beside his own.

305
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,794
In his own work,

306
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,261
he describes a woman
known as the Opalescence.

307
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,127
Do you believe
that's supposed to be you?

308
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:33,161
What do you think?

309
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,927
We think it's
another girl entirely.

310
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,361
Does that bother you?

311
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,660
Okay.

312
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,860
Maybe the others told you
I'm obsessed, I know.

313
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,860
Because they never
got Warren like I did.

314
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,394
He was right.

315
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,961
They are posers.

316
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:56,927
And Warren wasn't?

317
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,827
Warren believed.

318
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,760
He believed in truth.

319
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:01,994
He believed in doing
what was right.

320
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,460
He was Citizen 14.

321
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,694
Citizen 14 is real.

322
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,660
Warren didn't fit in
with the others?

323
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:10,660
I just said

324
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:14,027
Warren was better!

325
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,161
He was a really nice guy.

326
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:20,493
Were you aware
that Jeremy Kuznetsky

327
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,394
and Kenneth Vert

328
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,527
have police records?

329
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,527
Yeah.

330
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,760
It's nothing
interesting, though.

331
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:33,927
It's, like,
vandalism and trespassing.

332
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:36,627
You can't take them seriously.

333
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:37,694
What, as criminals?

334
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
As anything.

335
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,527
Okay, well,
what would be interesting?

336
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,493
As a crime.

337
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,161
Something that took courage.

338
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:46,560
Something that meant something.

339
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:49,127
Like murder?

340
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,294
Yeah, like murder.

341
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,894
Warren Granger on the night
he died, wearing his costume.

342
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:06,027
Start the sequence.

343
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:08,860
Cause of death
was a severed spinal cord.

344
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,894
We can rule out Abigail Zealey
as the killer.

345
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,294
How do you figure?

346
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,961
Abigail doesn't have
enough strength

347
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:19,894
to sever Warren's spinal cord
with one blow.

348
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,493
What about his step-dad?

349
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,593
Or the other kids
at the comic shop?

350
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,328
BRENNAN:
Well, if the physicality
of the murderer

351
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,328
is between five-ten and six-two,

352
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:31,593
I'd say yes to them all,
depending on the weapon.

353
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,493
God, what could
he have done

354
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,527
to make somebody
so angry at him?

355
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,794
Zack's cleaning the bones now.

356
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,161
Maybe we'll find
something that we've missed.

357
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:44,994
HODGINS:
What are you reading?

358
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,860
I'm doing research.

359
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,394
By reading a comic book?

360
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,261
Intensely allegorical
modern myths.

361
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:53,927
You're reading Bugs Bunny, man.

362
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:56,527
On the surface, yes,
but if you dig deeper,

363
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,660
the subtext becomes apparent.

364
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,261
The conflict is representative

365
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,827
of the Darwinian struggle
between avians

366
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:04,794
and mammals for dominance.

367
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,694
Based on Bugs giving Daffy Duck
a cigar made out of dynamite?

368
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Yeah.

369
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:13,894
And then here, he explodes,
but not really.

370
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:16,760
You have a problem, my man.

371
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:17,860
What?

372
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:19,527
Looks like you degraded
the bones.

373
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,860
Impossible.

374
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,894
It's only a four-percent
peroxide solution.

375
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,194
Then what's that bubbling
and pitting on the periosteum?

376
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:28,694
Four-percent solution
wouldn't cause that.

377
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,460
So, what, it's some kind
of systemic deterioration?

378
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,927
The intertrochanteric crest
is almost totally eaten away.

379
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,827
What do you think it is?

380
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:44,560
This kid was sick.

381
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,161
BOOTH:
Right.

382
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,394
Smell that?

383
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Yes, I do.

384
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,593
You know what that is, Bones?

385
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,593
Wax, popcorn...

386
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,460
feet, deodorant...

387
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,127
That is America, Bones.

388
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:08,860
Keep your bowling ball
in the car?

389
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,428
Oh, you know, I figure

390
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,394
we ask a few questions
about Warren Granger,

391
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,261
maybe bowl a few frames.

392
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,760
Nothing like a little sport
to take the edge off.

393
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:18,860
This is not a sport.

394
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,961
How do you figure?

395
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:21,493
There's no physical benefit.

396
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,194
So it's really like golf.

397
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:25,428
It's not a sport,
it's an activity.

398
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:28,460
Could you please, Bones,
maybe just for once

399
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,460
try not to piss
everyone off around you?

400
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,927
Yeah, sorry.

401
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:36,261
Are you good at this sport?

402
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:39,061
My average was over 200,
less than two opens per game.

403
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:43,161
One match, I had 211 strikes
out of 431 shots,

404
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:45,194
29 opens in 39 games.

405
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,460
What does that mean?

406
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:48,194
Means I won
some bowling awards.

407
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:50,660
I won the Marshall H.
Dixon award for my paper

408
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,127
on George John Romanes and
physiological selection.

409
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:56,227
My God, it's like we lead
parallel lives.

410
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:57,127
Need shoes?

411
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:58,627
Yeah.

412
00:20:58,694 --> 00:20:59,694
Looking for the manager.

413
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,894
Ted McGruder.

414
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,428
FBI, huh?

415
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:04,994
Yeah.

416
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:06,428
We're investigating the death
of one of your employees.

417
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:08,294
Warren Granger.

418
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:09,794
Warren?

419
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
When he didn't show up
for his last paycheck,

420
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,727
I thought
he'd just found another job

421
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,428
and didn't want to give notice.

422
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:16,961
He was weird like that.

423
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,593
Good kid, though.

424
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,894
Oh, oh, welcome back...

425
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:22,394
Have a bag...?

426
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,428
Ted, I talked to 'em,

427
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,727
but they just keep
giving me lip.

428
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:29,460
Luce, these people
are with the FBI.

429
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:30,927
They're here about
Warren Granger.

430
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,061
Warren?

431
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:33,361
What about him?

432
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:34,860
He's deceased.

433
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,194
Oh, my God.

434
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,294
I told you he didn't quit.

435
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:41,227
I was wrong.

436
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:42,428
This is my wife, Lucy.

437
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,894
Sorry.

438
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:44,961
That's OK.

439
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:46,061
How often

440
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:47,994
do those kids come in here?

441
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,694
TED:
Who, those jokers?

442
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,227
Weekends, mostly, but they used
to come in a lot more,

443
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:54,660
but in these crazy costumes.

444
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:57,961
I told 'em I'd allow it
on Halloween, but that's it.

445
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,827
BOOTH:
Is Warren's girlfriend here?

446
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,027
TED:
His girl...?

447
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:03,560
What?

448
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:05,428
We were informed that Warren's
girlfriend worked here.

449
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:07,094
Well, I mean,
if you ever met Warren,

450
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,328
you'd know he's not
the girlfriend type of kid.

451
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,394
There was a girl who came by
to see him sometimes.

452
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:15,894
Yeah. Yeah, that's-that's her.

453
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,760
I-I don't
know her name, but...

454
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,460
I don't think
Warren was all

455
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:22,328
that glad to see her,
and if she called,

456
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,493
he'd ask me to tell her
that he wasn't here.

457
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,194
Brennan.

458
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:28,927
TED:
Maybe he was
trying dodge her.

459
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,428
Excuse me just
one moment, please.

460
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:35,161
Okay, slow down, Zack,
and repeat that.

461
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:38,294
Hypercellularity with total
effacement of the marrow space.

462
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:40,493
Osteoblasts at 26%.

463
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,827
Okay, good work, Zack.

464
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,593
Keep working
on the weapon I.D.

465
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,161
I take it we're not going
to be getting any bowling

466
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:46,860
in tonight, huh?

467
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:50,061
Zack said that if Warren hadn't
been murdered two months ago,

468
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,127
he'd be dead by now.

469
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:55,494
When you said Warren
was sick as a child,

470
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,060
you meant
leukemia?

471
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,594
Yes, but by the time
he was 11, he was in remission.

472
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:05,127
The hypercellular activity
I saw only exists

473
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:06,861
in advanced cancer cases.

474
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,527
He must have been very ill.

475
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,060
You didn't notice?

476
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,127
MAN:
We tried to be
there for Warren, but...

477
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,660
he wouldn't let us in.

478
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,594
Right when you
thought you'd built

479
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,694
a bridge of trust,
he'd quit on you.

480
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,228
He quit trying to face reality.

481
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,727
Maybe your son didn't want you
to have to face it.

482
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,161
He knew his
situation was dire,

483
00:23:30,228 --> 00:23:31,694
and he decided
to tough it out on his own.

484
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:36,861
Yes.

485
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,627
He saw what it did to
me the first time.

486
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:41,061
It's not that
he quit.

487
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:42,794
It's that he didn't want me
to suffer.

488
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:54,527
You told her
that her son didn't tell her

489
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:56,694
about being sick
to make her feel better.

490
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,594
Uh-huh.
But you don't really
believe that.

491
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,261
Well, people don't
actually do that.

492
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,727
So, you just told her that
to make her feel better?

493
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:03,027
Right.

494
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:05,027
So, you just did
what you said people don't do.

495
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:09,594
I wonder why
he didn't tell his mother.

496
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,328
Well, maybe he
was all caught up
in the romance

497
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:13,460
of being a dying
superhero, you know?

498
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,460
Adolescent angst,
all that.

499
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,393
What do you really think?

500
00:24:19,994 --> 00:24:22,827
The truth is, I think the boy
was looking how to be a man.

501
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,894
All on his own,
without any help.

502
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,861
He was doing the
best that he could.

503
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,161
Heroes don't whine
about being sick.

504
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,393
Something like that.

505
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,861
Poor kid.

506
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,127
Did they know
about the leukemia?

507
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:35,094
No, he kept it a secret.

508
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:36,827
Tough guy, huh?

509
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,427
You were right
on before about
the kid knowing

510
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:39,427
he was facing
imminent death.

511
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:41,127
This changes
motivation.

512
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:42,994
The killer's motivation?
BOOTH:
No.

513
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,061
Warren Granger's.
GOODMAN:
You think he was emboldened

514
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:46,194
by the knowledge
that he was going to die.

515
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:47,393
He went looking for a fight.

516
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,527
He went looking for the Twisted.

517
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:51,294
Wait. No, wait.

518
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,961
We are allowing
the comic book story

519
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:56,194
to generate
too many hypotheses.

520
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,994
I only heard the
"Go get the bad guy" hypothesis.

521
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:00,727
It's too general.

522
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:02,894
BRENNAN:
Yes, perhaps,

523
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,827
the Opalescence represented
Warren's better nature,

524
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:10,961
and the Twisted was a reflection
of his darker sexual impulses.

525
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:14,994
A theme I assume is common
in teenage fiction.

526
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:16,861
And the drawings...

527
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,894
Hello... Bones.

528
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:23,328
The drawings.

529
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:26,228
Warren wrote the comics,
but there was no evidence

530
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,094
in his room
that he knew how to draw.

531
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,627
Dr. Brennan,

532
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,127
I found an extra piece of bone
I can't account for.

533
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:34,660
Someone else drew the comic.

534
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,228
Stew Ellis.

535
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:38,360
What about him?

536
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:39,760
Look.

537
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,627
Warren Granger <i>wrote</i>
this comic book,

538
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:43,660
but it was drawn
by Stew Ellis.

539
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,460
STEW ELLIS:
 <i>Look, I told you, I knew Warren</i>
 <i>from the store, okay?</i>

540
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:51,994
He was a serious investor.

541
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:53,527
Did he owe you
money, Stew?

542
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,994
( <i>sighs</i> ):
What?

543
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,194
Was it, uh, creative
differences, or was it

544
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,094
you just didn't
get enough credit?

545
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,493
No, it was none of that.

546
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,261
Look, why didn't you
tell me you were partners

547
00:26:06,328 --> 00:26:08,328
when I asked you earlier?

548
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:10,460
'Cause we had
a big argument,

549
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,961
and I didn't want you
to think I had a motive.

550
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:16,328
Okay. What did you argue about?

551
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:17,894
Abigail Zealey?

552
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:20,360
No, man. Just
merchandising.

553
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:21,961
You argued about merchandising?

554
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:23,094
Yeah, Warren thought

555
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:25,027
he deserved 70% for the concept,

556
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:27,994
but I think, since I did
the actual drawings, I...

557
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,127
Do you have a publisher?

558
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:30,493
No.

559
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,194
And now we never will.

560
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:34,961
Look, if-if you think
that I killed Warren,

561
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,894
I'm not that
stupid, man.

562
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,061
So, who do you think
killed Warren?

563
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,994
( <i>sighs</i> ):
I don't know, man.

564
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,393
Definitely not me, okay?

565
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,560
Well, you know, Stew,
as of this moment,

566
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:48,961
you're the prime suspect
in Warren's murder.

567
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:49,894
Why?

568
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:51,627
Why? Because you lied

569
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,393
about your relationship
with Warren, so, if I were you,

570
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,961
I would think
really, really hard

571
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,360
if there's anything else
you haven't told me.

572
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:00,560
All right, Abby.

573
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:01,427
Abby?

574
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,328
Triangle.

575
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,660
Look, I hooked up
with her a few times,

576
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,894
but she was obsessed
with Warren.

577
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,294
So, you did argue about her.

578
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,660
No, man.

579
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,294
Warren never wanted Abby.

580
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,261
Okay, maybe it made you jealous
that she wanted him?

581
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:20,694
Dude,

582
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,228
Abby's cute
in a chick-geek kind of way,

583
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:25,061
but she's definitely not
that kind of betty

584
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,760
you go to the death chamber for.

585
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:28,094
Okay, Stew, you know what?

586
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,360
You're just one of those guys

587
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:30,161
who's just way,
way too good at lying.

588
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:31,660
Dude, I'm an artist.

589
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:34,261
What do you want?

590
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:37,161
I found the extra piece of bone
lodged here

591
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:40,627
in the odontoid process of C2.

592
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,027
I-I went through all the
chipping and damage again,

593
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:46,961
but I can't find
where it came from.

594
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:52,027
Well, it's not
from a cervical vertebrae.

595
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:53,194
Oh, it's not?

596
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:54,694
It's from a long bone.

597
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,627
Probably the deltoid process
of a humerus.

598
00:27:56,694 --> 00:27:58,694
Arm bone?

599
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,994
I need you
to set up the microtome

600
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:04,760
and get me paraffin
and an embedding mold.

601
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,627
Are you going to prep
your own bone slide?

602
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:07,961
Yes.

603
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,161
Usually I do
that for you.

604
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:10,660
This is a tough one, Zack.

605
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:13,061
The piece is small,
and I need to make sure

606
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:16,194
there's enough left
for a DNA sample.

607
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,393
Warren Granger's arm
bones are complete.

608
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,094
This extra bone fragment
didn't come from Warren Granger.

609
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,027
Warren Granger was the victim
of a violent attack.

610
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,627
He fought back.

611
00:28:25,694 --> 00:28:28,161
It's possible
that during that struggle,

612
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,927
he struck his attacker
with the same weapon

613
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:32,527
that was later used
to kill him.

614
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,027
Which means that piece of bone

615
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:35,228
could have come
from his murderer.

616
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,961
( <i>loud breath</i> )
( <i>whistles</i> ):
What are you doing?

617
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,961
Breathing on the sample
dissipates static electricity

618
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:53,794
and makes it easier to cut.

619
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,393
You seem nervous.

620
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,493
If I get this right,
I'll be able to tell you

621
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,493
the age, sex and race
of Warren Granger's killer.

622
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,194
Stew was the artist.

623
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:08,294
Really?

624
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,027
You think he killed Warren
over artistic differences?

625
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,961
He also had a
thing for Abby.

626
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,328
Wow.

627
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,393
Yeah, for a recluse,
Warren Granger--

628
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,694
he had his thumb
in a lot of pies.

629
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,627
You said before
that Warren reminded you of me.

630
00:29:23,694 --> 00:29:26,061
You think I'm just like him.

631
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:29,127
That he hid from life

632
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:30,994
by immersing himself
in a fantasy world

633
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,827
where he fought crime,

634
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:34,861
and I do the same thing,
only I don't have superpowers.

635
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,794
I...

636
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:39,328
I have science.

637
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,360
No, Bones, you do fight crime.

638
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:42,994
It's not a fantasy.

639
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:45,027
And as far as any normal
person is concerned,

640
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:46,360
you do have
superpowers.

641
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,393
You're just being nice to me.

642
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,360
No, I don't do that.
Yes, you do.

643
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:55,127
You lied to Warren Granger's
mother to make her feel better.

644
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,328
That seems
to be your superpower.

645
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:59,660
Look, this piece of
bone you're analyzing--

646
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:05,594
how did it get lodged in
Warren Granger's neck?

647
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,427
It was deposited
by the same weapon

648
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:09,161
that severed his spinal cord.

649
00:30:09,228 --> 00:30:10,961
Doesn't make it the
killer's bone.

650
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:17,994
You thinking
a-a separate murder victim?

651
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:19,694
The Opalescence?

652
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,660
The woman he loved?

653
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,894
I don't think she's dead.

654
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,061
Why?

655
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:28,261
This is an arm bone.

656
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:32,161
Has anyone we've seen on
this case been favoring her arm?

657
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:34,827
Not that I've noticed.

658
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:37,527
That's because
you're not an anthropologist.

659
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,360
With superpowers.

660
00:30:41,427 --> 00:30:42,694
Ha!

661
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,527
That's good.

662
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:51,328
Oh... hello.

663
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,194
Any news
about Warren?

664
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:55,127
We're still in the initial phase
of our investigation.

665
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:56,760
Listen, Mr. McGruder,
you didn't happen

666
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:58,161
to keep that, uh,
last payroll check

667
00:30:58,228 --> 00:31:00,560
for Warren Granger
that you told me about?

668
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:02,861
By law I have to, yeah.

669
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,161
You mind digging that out
for us?

670
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:05,493
I mean, I apologize

671
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,027
for the inconvenience.

672
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:08,460
I guess. It's probably
in the file somewhere.

673
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,827
What do you need
the paycheck for?

674
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:13,660
BOOTH:
Ah, it's
technical.

675
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:17,360
Mrs. McGruder, what's wrong
with your left side?

676
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:19,594
Why would you ask me that?

677
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,460
I noticed how you held yourself
the last time I was here.

678
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:23,393
I didn't think anything of it.

679
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,493
Though viewed through
the current context, I...

680
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,794
What is she talking about?
BOOTH:
She wants to know

681
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:28,393
how you hurt yourself.

682
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,493
BRENNAN:
You' walk
as though

683
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,727
your left ribs are cracked.

684
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:32,460
Also, you favor your left arm.

685
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:33,794
Oh, I, um...

686
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:36,727
I-I... fell on the lanes.

687
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,827
They're very slippery.

688
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:40,894
Falling would bruise a number
of ribs.

689
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:42,827
You're favoring
only one or two.

690
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:44,827
Type of damage done by a fist.

691
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:50,427
Look, were you and Warren close?

692
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,360
He was a nice kid.

693
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,961
A really nice kid.

694
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:57,027
Here it is.

695
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:00,927
You two want
to bowl a few frames?

696
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:02,927
Got some empty lanes.

697
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:05,994
I'll see you
in the comic books, buster.

698
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:07,261
What?

699
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:09,194
Thanks. I'll get
this back to you.

700
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,927
It's, "See you
in the funny pages."

701
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:13,460
Okay, I took a liberty.

702
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:15,228
Her husband beats her.

703
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:17,527
Bones, all right, talk
about multiple hypotheses.

704
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:20,061
It's a leap, yes,
but it was bound to happen.

705
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:21,927
Me spending so much time
with you.

706
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:23,927
I mean that as a compliment.

707
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:26,660
Okay, so Warren's former boss
is the Twisted,

708
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,460
and the boss' wife
is the Opalescence.

709
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,127
Go back and arrest him.

710
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:31,094
It's not enough.

711
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:32,527
Okay, for that we need

712
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:34,360
something just
a little bit more real.

713
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:35,627
Evidence.

714
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,870
???

715
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,094
Dr. Brennan, based on
your histology and the DNA,

716
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:54,427
the bone chip found
in Warren Granger's neck

717
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:56,061
came from a Caucasian male,
mid 30s.

718
00:32:56,127 --> 00:32:57,127
McGruder.

719
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:58,360
Can you get any more specific?

720
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:00,294
We need the weapon.

721
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:02,061
I can get a warrant,
search the McGruder house

722
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,327
for whatever you want.

723
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:04,194
That's the trouble--
we don't know exactly

724
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,828
what we're looking for.

725
00:33:05,893 --> 00:33:07,960
We hit a dead end trying
to reverse engineer it

726
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,494
from the mark on the neck.

727
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,527
Too much damage
and fragmentation.

728
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:14,260
Wait, you said that in books
you could find

729
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,594
the real world version.

730
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,127
Yeah, well, I mean...

731
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:18,860
if you know you,
it's pretty obvious.

732
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:20,661
Well, give me an example.

733
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:22,194
Okay, well, in your book,

734
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,728
your partner's
a former Olympic boxer

735
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,294
who graduated from Harvard

736
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:26,294
and spoke
six different languages.

737
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,294
In real life... you got me.

738
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:30,294
So what you're saying is...

739
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:34,327
that reality falls far,
far short of the fictional.

740
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,294
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Bones.

741
00:33:38,794 --> 00:33:40,794
Warren Granger's spinal cord

742
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,394
was severed
by something sharp,

743
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:44,327
but not a knife.

744
00:33:44,394 --> 00:33:47,728
If it wasn't
a knife, what was it?

745
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,260
The closest match
I could find

746
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:54,294
would be a corkscrew
or a Tibetan skull knife.

747
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:56,860
But neither of them explain
how foreign bone

748
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:58,794
was left lodged
in the vertebrae.

749
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,361
Pull up Citizen 14's
weapons, Ange.

750
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:04,294
It was a boomerang
thing, like a sonic gun.

751
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,127
A laser cutlass.

752
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,728
That thing that allowed him
to hear through walls.

753
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,627
We're looking
for something that has

754
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:12,893
a drabber, more banal
version in the real world.

755
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,494
Why would he be
killed by his own weapon?

756
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,427
Well, because he probably
had it on him

757
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:19,027
the night he decided
to confront Ted McGruder.

758
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:22,160
Citizen 14's arsenal.

759
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,060
What's that?

760
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,860
That's his
main weapon.

761
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,561
It's a three-sided
throwing knife
that returns to him.

762
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:29,761
But none of them make
the wounds that resemble

763
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:32,561
the one that severed
Warren's spinal cord.

764
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:35,227
It was just an idea.

765
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:36,761
Bones...

766
00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:39,594
I fell into the exact thing
that I warned you about--

767
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,927
developing too many hypotheses
not grounded in fact.

768
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:46,794
No, Bones, I know exactly
which drab real world thing

769
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,927
was used to murder
Warren Granger.

770
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:53,661
<i>All this kid wants</i>
 <i>is to feel like a hero.</i>

771
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:55,427
<i>Suddenly he's facing</i>
 <i>a damsel in distress.</i>

772
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,294
Lucy McGruder is
ten years older.

773
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,594
No, it's not the damsel
part that matters.

774
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:01,794
It's the distress
that appealed to
the kid, you know.

775
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,594
Look, it wasn't
about the sex or the
romance, it never was.

776
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:07,294
He wanted to make a difference
in the world before he died.

777
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,527
I told you he was more
like you than me.

778
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:16,694
22-705, Dispatch.

779
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:18,627
22-705.

780
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:20,494
Unit sent
to the suspect's residence

781
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,527
reports that the domicile
is empty.

782
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,427
No one's there?
What about the wife?

783
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:26,728
Negative. Search team
is inside the house.

784
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:29,327
It's empty.
Signs of flight.

785
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,594
Affirmative, Dispatch.

786
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:35,794
He beats her, but she
takes off with him anyway?

787
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,194
Spousal abuse syndrome.

788
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,694
Dispatch, 22-705.

789
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:42,993
Dispatch.

790
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
Can you send a backup unit
to Capital Bowl

791
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,194
1123 Seboldt.

792
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,561
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Domestic disturbances
are always weird, okay?

793
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:52,893
You know, the woman gets
beat on by her husband,

794
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,828
the cavalry
turns up to save her.

795
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:56,494
You know, you'd think
she'd be on the same side

796
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:58,227
as the rescuers,
but sometimes...

797
00:35:58,294 --> 00:35:59,794
You're saying
watch out for the wife.

798
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,227
MAN:
Shut up.

799
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:06,327
All I'm saying is just
stay alert, okay, Bones?

800
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:08,260
Okay.

801
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:09,494
MAN:
Shut up.

802
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:11,027
Ed, why are we doing this?
Shut up.

803
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:12,694
You didn't do anything.

804
00:36:12,761 --> 00:36:14,561
Lucy, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up...

805
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:16,027
I know you
wouldn't hurt Warren.

806
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:17,427
BOOTH:
Of course he would.

807
00:36:17,494 --> 00:36:19,027
You see, that's
what he does.

808
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,661
He loves to beat up
people weaker than him.

809
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:21,993
We are closed.

810
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,860
You left your door unlocked.

811
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:26,327
Probably an oversight
due to your state of panic.

812
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:28,060
Yeah, light's were on.

813
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:30,661
We suspected
a robbery.

814
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:33,294
Say, have a bevel knife?
A what?

815
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:35,927
It's a triangular
three-sided knife.

816
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,828
You know, to clean out
bowling ball holes.

817
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:39,294
Say, I used to have one
back in the day.

818
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,761
You wouldn't happen
to have

819
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:41,561
one around here,
would you now?

820
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:42,860
You need
a warrant...

821
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:44,893
you need a warrant
to take any of my stuff.

822
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,561
Lucy, we need a bevel knife.

823
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,527
We keep one in here.

824
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:53,993
Shut up, Lucy!

825
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,194
BOOTH:
Why don't you
smack her around

826
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,127
a little bit
there, Ted, huh?

827
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,227
Keep your woman in line.

828
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:23,794
Yeah.

829
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,993
This could have done it.

830
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,661
Say, Bones,
that bone chip, uh...

831
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,461
second victim
or murderer?

832
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:33,194
For Warren's sake,
I hope it was the murderer.

833
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Me, too.

834
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:37,993
What are you talking about?
Just get out of here.

835
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,993
It'd be
his left arm.

836
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,527
What?
Warren was right-handed,

837
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,960
so the wound would be
on your husband's left arm.

838
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:45,993
Oh, my God.

839
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,927
Bones...

840
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,627
Right there.

841
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,227
I told him, I got him,
I got him, I got him.

842
00:37:56,294 --> 00:37:58,527
All right, all right.

843
00:37:58,594 --> 00:38:01,427
Aw, hell, Bones, it
looks like you opened up
an old wound there.

844
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:02,728
All right, let's go.

845
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,361
You know what,
you're under arrest.

846
00:38:04,427 --> 00:38:05,794
I really hate a wife
beater, I really do.

847
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Almost as much as I hate
someone who kills a dying kid.

848
00:38:18,427 --> 00:38:20,960
Warren knew what Ted did to you.

849
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:24,060
Did you tell him?

850
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,294
I didn't
have to.

851
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,594
He saw one night.

852
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:28,960
Ted hit me, and...

853
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:31,327
Warren...

854
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:34,427
Warren ran away.

855
00:38:34,494 --> 00:38:35,993
Why didn't you go
to the police?

856
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,294
Because...
it's not all the time.

857
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,361
It's just when
things go bad

858
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:44,294
and he's under
a lot of strain.

859
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,494
Ted has a bad temper.

860
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,828
Warren wanted to rescue you.

861
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,594
Oh, my God.

862
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,661
BOOTH:
He probably just wanted
to intimidate your husband.

863
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:56,927
Stop him from attacking you.

864
00:38:56,993 --> 00:39:00,160
Warren stabbed your husband
in the arm with the bevel knife.

865
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,993
Ted took the knife
away from Warren.

866
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,694
It wouldn't have been hard.

867
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,227
The boy was very ill.

868
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,394
After that, it's like you said--

869
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:10,227
your husband has a bad temper.

870
