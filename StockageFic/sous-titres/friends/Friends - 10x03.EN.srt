1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,500
So, you and Rachel tonight?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,040
Yeah. It's actually our first official date 

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,540
So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,410
No. This is the part I'm actually good at.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,480
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,780
It's ok!

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,020
How can you be so confident?

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,690
I know exactly what I'm gonna do!

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,590
Really? Like you have a routine?

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,260
No. See. Each woman is different.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,130
You have to appreciate their uniqueness.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,370
Really?

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,570
No, I do six things! 

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,870
First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. 

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,010
Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,450
You mean like this? 

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,150
No! Not like that.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
No, like this. 

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,530
I see what you mean, that's quite nice. 

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,640
- More foosball?
- And beer!

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,410
FRIENDS SAISON 10 EPISODE 3

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,410
The One With Ross' Tan

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,080
VO: Amariss
synchro: marty9, jeanswey

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,170
Stop staring at my wife's legs! 

25
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,400
No no! 

26
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,400
Stop staring at your sister's legs!

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?

28
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,210
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.

29
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,720
You got a spray-on tan?

30
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,120
Chandler gets pedicures!

31
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,660
Why you do, like with the-the toe separators?

32
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,360
Why?

33
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,200
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. 

34
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,960
I wonder if I should get one!

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,670
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,370
So, do you get colours or just French tips?

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,510
There. Here's their card.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,480
Thanks. 

39
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,990
I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... 

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,460
Florist. 

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,170
You won't believe who moved back to town.

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,430
I know, Amanda! 

43
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,970
She called me too! She's the worst!

44
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,100
Who's Amanda?

45
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,640
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. 

46
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,280
Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. 

47
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,550
On the machine this is her message. 

48
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,420
"Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"

49
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,890
Are you trying to do a British accent?

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,690
Chandler gets pedicures!

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,960
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?

52
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,000
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? 

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,300
"Oh, so sorry to catch one of your Mo-Bile!" 

54
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,680
If you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"

55
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,310
I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.

56
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,980
Oh, I know! 

57
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,820
"Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". 

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,920
All right, who hasn't?

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,360
What are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!

60
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,930
Let's just cut her out!

61
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,130
What?

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,400
Cut her out of our lives! 

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,700
Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,670
I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! 

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,310
Have you ever done that?

66
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,010
No, had it done to me though. 

67
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,840
Feels good !

68
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,250
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! 

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,260
So, how dark do you wanna be? 

70
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,820
We have 1, 2 or 3. 

71
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,330
I like how you look, what are you?

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,930
- Puerto Rican.
- 2, I think a 2.

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,670
You've got to face the red light. 

74
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,840
When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. 

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,510
When the spraying stops, count to 5.

76
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,410
Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. 

77
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,650
- Got it?
- Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.

78
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,220
- Wow, you catch on quick.
- I have a PhD, so... 

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,110
1 Mississipi, 2 Mississipi, 3 Mis...

80
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,980
Wait! I've not finished counting!

81
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,930
You sprayed my front twice!

82
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,060
You've never turned?

83
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,260
No, I barely even got to 3 Mississippi. 

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,000
Mississippi? I said count to 5!

85
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,530
Mississippilesly? 

86
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,240
Well, how bad is it?

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.

88
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,240
So, how dark is it gonna get?

89
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,950
You got sprayed with 2 two' s and...

90
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:24,950
I'm a 4?

91
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,620
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.

92
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,920
Really!

93
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,760
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Ok !

94
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,670
Wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! 

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,500
How do I know when it's gonna start?

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,640
My eyes !!

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
The same thing happened again!

98
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,960
You got two more twos?

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,060
I'm an 8 !

100
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,000
Thanks for dinner. 

101
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,000
I thought you paid. 

102
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,970
Guess we won’t be going back there!

103
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,110
So.

104
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,930
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?

105
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,430
I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.

106
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,190
- What’s the matter?
- I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, 

107
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,960
I don’t know why I did that!

108
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,770
I am sorry! Again... I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!

109
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,740
I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!

110
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,180
Ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. 

111
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,190
- This is gonna be great.
- Ok.

112
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,940
Was that good for you? 

113
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,580
No, don’t get it. 

114
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,810
Let the machine pick up. 

115
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,810
Yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.

116
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,090
- It could be Amanda!
- Oh, you’re right! 

117
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,090
I was just kidding about Rachel. 

118
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,930
Babysitting is a gas!

119
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,860
Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. 

120
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,900
I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!

121
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,240
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!

122
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,440
Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.

123
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,310
Ok, don’t hold thy breath!

124
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,620
Hello? Is someone on the line?

125
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,450
Yes, I was looking for Monica.

126
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,350
Hang on, she’s right here. 

127
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,990
Someone's on the phone, for ya.

128
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,890
We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!

129
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,360
I get pedicures!

130
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,540
Hi Amanda! 

131
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,270
Actually now... it’s not a good time. 

132
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,910
Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!

133
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,780
Why didn’t you just say no!

134
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,150
I said 'no' to her coming over now! 

135
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,520
I couldn’t say 'no' twice! 

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,820
I get this uncontrollable need to please people!

137
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,860
Fine, fine! 

138
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,230
You would not hold up well under torture!

139
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,030
And you would?

140
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,060
I did! 

141
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,740
Rach, you sure you wanna do this? 

142
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,600
Absolutely! 

143
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,510
It’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, 
144
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,840
it's just gonna take some getting used to.

145
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,810
How can we make it easier?

146
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,880
Ok, let’s work from the top down! 

147
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,320
Just work the bra, Joe!

148
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,080
This thing welded shut?!

149
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,650
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.

150
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,860
Sorry!

151
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
Well this is romantic!

152
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,770
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! 

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
I'm an expert at taking off bras! 

154
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,470
I can do it with one hand! 

155
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,940
I can do it with my eyes closed! 

156
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,510
One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! 

157
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,840
I blame your bra!

158
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,280
It’s a standard issue bra clasp!

159
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,150
Then I blame you! 

160
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,220
You threw me off with all your slapping!

161
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, 

162
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,430
you don't want to take off my bra?

163
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,800
I don't have another level!

164
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,420
Hold on! There is something different.

165
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,590
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.

166
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,830
Was that place... 

167
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,790
the Sun?

168
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,460
And it gets worse! 

169
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,470
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!

170
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,380
How could you mess this up? It's so easy.

171
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,150
You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!

172
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,450
How do you count to five?

173
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
- 1, 2, 3...
- Damnit! 

174
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,290
I Know!

175
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,490
What is up with misaligned tropic?

176
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,900
How was your date with Joey?

177
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,600
It was good.. until we got back to our apartment, 

178
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,170
and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg 

179
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,310
and I kept slapping it away!

180
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,810
You didn't like that?

181
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,680
It wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! 

182
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,650
He couldn't even undo my bra!

183
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,250
Really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.

184
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,320
I do not know what's wrong with us.

185
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,390
We have kissed before and that's been great! 

186
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,030
But this time it was leading somewhere

187
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,330
and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.

188
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,270
You guys have been friends forever. 

189
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,540
Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? 

190
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,270
How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.

191
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,350
Ok, that's true. We can do this. We're just gonna power through!

192
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,150
Chandler can I talk to you for a second ?

193
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,120
No need! Problem solved, we are powering through. 

194
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,530
- Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
- You don't know! 

195
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,240
- Hey Phoebe!
- Hey!

196
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,470
Is Amanda here yet?

197
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,110
Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan.

198
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,480
But I have a new plan.

199
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,480
Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.

200
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,080
What kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?

201
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,750
What do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?

202
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,920
Are you kidding, I love it!

203
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,370
It's so nice to see you! 

204
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,570
Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! 

205
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,710
We have so much to catch up on!

206
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,650
But first things first: touch my abs. 

207
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,010
I don't exercise at all! 

208
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,190
Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!

209
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,360
- Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
- Smell my neck! 

210
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,330
It's not perfume! It's me! 

211
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,290
It's my natural scent!

212
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,230
Musty!

213
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,170
This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. 

214
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,410
I'm so happy you two are friends again!

215
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
When were we not friends?

216
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,080
It was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel

217
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,890
We were friends in 1992.

218
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,160
No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls 

219
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,390
and trying to avoid seeing her. 

220
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,530
You were going to cut me out?

221
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,560
- Well... kinda.
- Oh My God!

222
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,630
Bugger. Should I not have said that? 

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,400
I feel like a perfect arse!

224
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,340
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".

225
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,880
Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? 

226
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,290
Oh my God, are you alright? 

227
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,860
Yeah, I'll be right there. 

228
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,790
I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. 

229
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,100
- Was Mike with him?
- No !

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Got champagne?

231
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,700
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!

232
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,070
Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, 

233
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,410
and in the interest of powering through... 

234
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,720
Sexy, sexy, très sexy, sexy.

235
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,320
Alright! Lets do it!

236
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,030
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.

237
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,790
Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! 

238
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,430
You like that, huh?

239
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,270
Let's take this into high gear. 

240
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,570
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!

241
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,610
No! You kneed me in my misters!

242
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,510
What? 

243
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,680
Oh my God! I'm so sorry. 

244
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,550
Joey? Are you ok?

245
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,090
Soldier down! 

246
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,030
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.

247
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,200
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!

248
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,670
Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. 

249
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,010
Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?

250
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,010
I have nothing to say to you.

251
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,580
Wow, my flat is twice this size!

252
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,250
Please, Monica? In the hall?

253
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,020
That accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.

254
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,230
Well, aren't you a treat.

255
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,000
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. 

256
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,570
Why Phoebe, why?

257
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,710
It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? 

258
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,180
You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.

259
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,610
I'm still all those things!

260
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,850
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!

261
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,260
I am scrappy.

262
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,730
Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. 

263
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,570
Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.

264
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,040
It's because I'm scrappy.

265
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,470
Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, 

266
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,380
because I don't know what I would do without you.

267
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,350
I won't know what I would do without you.

268
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,820
I guess we should go back in. 

269
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,920
When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,020
Yeah, I guess you're right.

271
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,400
Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.

272
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,180
Now, let me explain how this works. 

273
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,880
- You go into the booth, and...
- I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? 

274
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,890
Does it look like this is my first time, huh? 

275
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,330
Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.

276
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,910
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?

277
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,210
Which one is it?

278
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,350
Son of a bitch!

279
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,690
What is the matter with us?

280
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,460
I know what's the matter with me.

281
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,270
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?

282
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,770
I don't know.

283
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,180
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!

284
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,950
Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? 

285
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,250
When you and Monica first hooked up, 

286
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,660
was it weird going from friends to... more than that?

287
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,200
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...

288
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,060
No, no... No, I mean... 

289
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,770
se-x-u-ally...

290
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,810
Yeah, was there a part of you that felt like it was... really wrong?

291
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,810
Actually, no. No, it felt right. 

292
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,820
You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.

293
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,620
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... 

294
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,890
I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.

295
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,040
Just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.

296
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:55,380
Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

297
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,810
Right, totally.

298
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,920
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.

299
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,950
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.

300
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,250
That's a... pla-an.

301
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,670
I did not see this coming.

302
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,740
I know.

303
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,680
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted. 

304
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,680
Me too...

305
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,860
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?

306
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,300
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.

307
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,440
I bet you're right.

308
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,450
So...

309
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,020
Yeah.

310
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,790
I love ya.

311
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,630
Love you too... 

312
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,000
- Alright, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

313
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,340
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.

314
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,950
- Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away! 

315
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,050
I don't want to see anybody.

316
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,360
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.

317
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,160
Really? 

318
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,290
Did you count Mississipily?

319
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,170
Dude, you're not tanned.

320
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,800
No, I just had to get a picture of this.

321
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,340
I see you later!
