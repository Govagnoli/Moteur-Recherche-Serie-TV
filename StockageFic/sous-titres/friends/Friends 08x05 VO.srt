1
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:05,445
This one's rare.
This one's medium. Go!

2
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:07,569
Hey, Phoebe!
How was dinner?!

3
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:11,811
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now l'm gonna go!

4
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,443
-Well, hello there.
-Hi.

5
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:18,160
l didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:20,488
This is Tim, my new sous chef.

7
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:24,403
-So you're Monica's boss?
-No, she's my boss.

8
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:28,321
-''Sous'' is French for ''under. ''
-l ''sous-stand. ''

9
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:32,406
Tim, l need a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

10
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:35,206
-You made pesto?
-Yes, l did.

11
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:38,370
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o?

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,770
l don't know.
l would say it's pretty good-o.

13
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,203
l still need the salad.

14
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:48,403
-Great necklace.
-l made it.

15
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:53,009
-You are so talented.
-Well, it's no pesto.

16
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:56,648
Let's just cut to the chase.
You're both single.

17
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:59,606
He gets off at 1 1 .
Call her.

18
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:04,932
l'll give him your number if l could
just get a caesar salad!

19
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:10,604
l did not yell.
l am not putting a dollar in the jar.

20
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,163
The One With Rachel's Date

21
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:54,807
-Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
-You know me, sir.

22
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:58,209
How can l get
around the computer network. . .

23
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,411
. . .so l can access
the really good lnternet porn?

24
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,683
You're a joker, Bing.

25
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,601
What's funny about that?

26
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:13,329
-Sorry l kept you waiting so long.
-Where do you wanna go?

27
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:15,449
l think you know.

28
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:18,086
-The Hard Rock Cafe?
-Yeah.

29
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:21,211
-Again?
-Yeah.

30
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:27,012
-l'm telling you, l like the food.
-You like the <i>Purple Rain</i> display.

31
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:30,889
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

32
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:36,527
-Did that guy just call you Toby?
-Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

33
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:41,444
-Why don't you correct him?
-lt's been way too long now.

34
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:44,809
The first time, l didn't say anything.

35
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:48,328
The next time he said,
''Toby, want a doughnut?''

36
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,211
And l wanted the doughnut.

37
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:55,640
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and l'm still Toby.

38
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:59,851
-Chandler, you have to tell him.
-That would be so awkward.

39
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,209
We don't work together.
He's on the sixth floor.

40
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:06,210
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

41
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,012
lt's not like he's calling me Muriel.

42
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:13,768
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

43
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:19,407
Oh, my God.

44
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:23,408
Chandler ''M. '' Bing.

45
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:29,208
lt's not just an ''M. ''
Your middle name is Muriel!

46
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,006
lt is a family name.

47
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,841
Chandler Muriel Bing.

48
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:40,404
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

49
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:45,690
Drake, l've discovered the reason
for your memory loss.

50
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,725
Your brain transplant
wasn't successful.

51
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,691
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

52
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:53,962
ls it serious?

53
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:57,807
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body. . .

54
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:02,449
. . .and synthesize antibodies
to stop you from rejecting the brain.

55
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:06,128
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

56
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:10,007
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body. . .

57
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:12,407
. . .it was gone.

58
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:17,850
Cut.
Very nice, people.

59
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,128
l'll change and we can go.

60
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:24,689
-What happened to Jessica's body?
-You'll have to see it on TV.

61
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,804
-You don't know, do you?
-Couldn't care less.

62
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:31,808
-Good scene, man.
-You too.

63
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:37,011
What? You weren't in it.

64
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:41,962
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash.

65
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:45,881
-Hi.
-Why haven't l seen you here before?

66
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:51,803
Joey just thinks l'll embarrass him.
He thinks l'm a soap opera nut.

67
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,202
Which l'm not.
l'm not.

68
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:59,527
Although, l do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

69
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:04,007
And your dog's name is Wally.

70
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,409
-Look, l'm just stroking your arm.
-Let's go!

71
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:10,485
Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

72
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,650
-Monica.
-Hi.

73
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:21,647
l had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

74
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:24,406
l can't wait
to get ''sous-neath'' him.

75
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,203
-l have to fire him.
-Why?

76
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,649
He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

77
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:34,452
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

78
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,804
He was nervous.
You can be intimidating.

79
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:41,687
And your pastry chef can stand
to be taken down a peg.

80
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:45,441
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

81
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:48,809
But Monica, he loves his job so much.

82
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:52,607
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

83
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:58,210
All right. But if he lights
someone else on fire, he's gone.

84
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:01,444
That's fair. Thank you so much.

85
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,490
Looks like he got you
a little bit too.

86
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:07,606
l paid to have this done.

87
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,808
Love it!

88
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:18,605
Hey. You know,
Kash really liked you.

89
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:20,843
He thought you were charming.

90
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:24,926
-l thought l was an idiot.
-l'm with you.

91
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:31,205
-He asked if you'd go out with him.
-l think l'm gonna throw up a little.

92
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,448
-What did you say?
-''No. ''

93
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:35,410
What?

94
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:40,606
l figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

95
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:46,009
First of all, Kash Ford?
Not people.

96
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,680
Did you tell him l was pregnant?

97
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:54,444
No. l didn't know if you told people.
This was when Kash was still ''people. ''

98
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:58,281
-Good. Just have him call me.
-l don't think that's--

99
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:03,008
Go do it or l'll come back
to that set. l'll meet more actors.

100
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:08,209
-Hey, Bob.
-How's my pal Toby doing today?

101
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:11,210
lf l see him, l'll ask.

102
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:17,527
Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

103
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,410
-Yeah.
-You know him?

104
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:21,961
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

105
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:26,804
-What about adding him to our team?
-Bob?

106
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:32,729
Working here with us? Every day?
l don't know if he has what it takes.

107
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:36,601
-They love him down on six.
-But this is 1 1 .

108
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:39,844
lt's almost twice as hard up here.

109
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:43,806
-Okay, Bob will stay put.
-l think it's best, sir.

110
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:50,810
We do need to find somebody. l've got
a stack of documents this high.

111
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:55,244
Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.

112
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,283
That's a good one, Bing.

113
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:03,163
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

114
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:11,407
l gave him another chance,
but Tim has got to go.

115
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:15,002
l called the chef
who recommended him to me.

116
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:18,409
He said, ''Ha, ha! Gotcha! ''

117
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:21,291
-But don't fire him today.
-Why?

118
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:25,246
-Because l'm dumping him today.
-You said he was sweet.

119
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,127
He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

120
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:32,762
''Did you get home okay?''
''Was your shower okay?''

121
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,846
-Don't pick up the phone.
-Then he comes over!

122
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,003
''l was worried. ''
Be a man!

123
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,483
So l can't fire him?

124
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,809
And dump him the same day?
He'll kill himself.

125
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:51,247
-Go out with him for another week.
-Are you kidding? l'll kill myself.

126
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:54,603
Then he'll just have to deal with it.

127
00:08:55,292 --> 00:09:00,810
Okay. But who's gonna go first?
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

128
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:04,044
-What?
-Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

129
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,728
Bitch!
And dump a guy that's just been fired?

130
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:09,769
Blond bitch!

131
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:14,250
l wanted to do this days ago,
so l think l should go first.

132
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,722
All right, that makes sense.

133
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:20,810
But screw you! l'm going first!

134
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:27,248
Toby, you got a sec?

135
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:32,202
l wanted to get transferred up here,
but it's not gonna happen.

136
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:36,604
Apparently somebody thinks
l'm not '' 1 1 th-floor material. ''

137
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:40,801
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

138
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:46,520
What's the best excuse for why
l'm not drinking?

139
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:49,605
''l'm a recovering alcoholic,''
''l'm a Mormon'' . . .

140
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:54,004
. . .or ''l got so hammered last night
l'm still a little drunk''?

141
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:58,126
What do you want to do tonight?

142
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:02,245
There's a powerful Ukrainian film
playing. lnterested?

143
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:06,650
No. But l'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

144
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:10,805
-Rach, you wanna come?
-l can't. l've got a date.

145
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,529
-A date?
-Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

146
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:19,328
Why, no. lt's the opposite of weird.
lt's regular.

147
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:23,531
lt's mundane.
lt's actually a little dull.

148
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:26,530
lt's no Ukrainian film.

149
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,802
Earrings!

150
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:35,010
-She's got a date? With who?
-l set her up with this actor.

151
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:39,728
-You set her up?
-No.

152
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,049
-What were you thinking?
-That it was okay. . .

153
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:46,045
. . .because you two haven't dated
in years.

154
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:51,412
l'm worried about my baby.
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

155
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:57,602
-Where is this ''actor'' taking them?
-Hey! l'm an ''actor'' too.

156
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:02,281
They're taking the ferry
to a place on Staten lsland.

157
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:08,408
My baby's going on a ferry? Do you
have any idea how dangerous those are?

158
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:12,571
Aren't we talking about
those big boats that go really slow?

159
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:18,449
Why not just jump out of an airplane
or burn each other with matches?

160
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:25,801
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

161
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,249
Hey, l hear you're going
on a ferry tonight.

162
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:31,722
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

163
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:36,647
Do you guys think this is too slutty?
Hi, Kash.

164
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:41,403
-Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
-Yeah. See you guys later.

165
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:46,203
Have a great time, you guys.
And yes, it is too slutty!

166
00:11:56,692 --> 00:12:00,651
l'm glad you called.
l feel like l'm always calling you.

167
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,725
What's up?
ls everything okay with Phoebe?

168
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:08,243
lt will be in a minute.

169
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:13,008
-Tim, you're a really great guy.
-That's because l'm with you.

170
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:20,371
lt's just, l'm in a place in my life
right now where--

171
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:24,409
So sorry. ''This just in. ''

172
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,086
lt's the restaurant.
Monica needs me.

173
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:31,807
No, she doesn't! l know what that is.
You can stay.

174
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,806
l'll miss you too, Pheebs.

175
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:39,604
And l will be holding you right here.

176
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:51,000
What movie do you wanna see?
And not one l have to read.

177
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,203
l get that from books.

178
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:57,528
-Books?
-Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes. . .

179
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,085
. . .but it's enough!

180
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,290
Let's not see a movie.
We'll just stay here and hang.

181
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:10,601
-Just wait for Rachel to come back?
-Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

182
00:13:10,812 --> 00:13:13,246
Dude, what is going on?

183
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,643
-l have to find out how it went.
-Why?

184
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:21,920
-He could be my baby's stepfather.
-One date and they're getting married?

185
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:24,402
He's not you!

186
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,247
l can't believe she's dating!

187
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:32,644
-What did you think she was gonna do?
-l don't know.

188
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:37,363
-l can't believe this is happening.
-What do you mean?

189
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:41,804
l thought when l had another kid,
it'd be different.

190
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:47,844
l love Ben. But every time
l drop him off at Carol and Susan's. . .

191
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:50,811
. . .it breaks my heart a little.

192
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:55,604
l've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed. . .

193
00:13:55,812 --> 00:14:01,444
. . .my kid comes running in, leaps up
on the bed and we all read the paper.

194
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,809
Maybe fight over the science section.

195
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:11,402
-That's nice. You can still have that.
-No. Rachel's out with some guy.

196
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:14,445
My baby went with her.

197
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:19,403
lf anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

198
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,403
Hey, can l ask you something?

199
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:28,648
ln this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

200
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,806
lt used to be.

201
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,208
Now she doesn't really have a face.

202
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:39,565
Smokin' body, though.

203
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:45,961
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

204
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:50,085
No. But how much easier would it be
if it were?

205
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,323
That's not what she wants.

206
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:56,411
l know. And l can't force myself
to fall in love with her.

207
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:59,809
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

208
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:03,727
lt won't be what you thought.
But no matter what. . .

209
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:08,443
. . .there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

210
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:12,002
Who cares what the picture looks like?

211
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:18,043
Let's you and me go out
and have some fun.

212
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,806
Whatever you want. Come on.

213
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:25,804
-We can catch that Ukrainian film.
-No, l said fun.

214
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:29,410
-Hey, Toby?
-Hey, Bobby.

215
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:32,411
lt's Bob, actually.

216
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:37,608
You work up here. Where's
Chandler Bing's office?

217
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:41,401
Yeah, it's right. . . .

218
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:45,240
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

219
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:49,411
l wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

220
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,131
l'm the reason you didn't get the job.

221
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:56,249
-Toby, don't.
-Bob.

222
00:15:56,492 --> 00:16:00,849
Toby, l'm not gonna let you cover
for him.

223
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:05,244
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

224
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:08,689
That puts me
in a difficult position.

225
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,443
-ls everything okay?
-That depends.

226
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:18,526
-How are you and Phoebe?
-Great. Thanks for introducing us.

227
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:23,601
My pleasure. Okay, l'm afraid
l've got some bad news.

228
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:25,768
-Phoebe!
-Monica!

229
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,885
-You're fired!
-l'm breaking up with you!

230
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,010
l'm breaking up with you.

231
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:35,284
-You're fired.
-Why?

232
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:39,531
l'm sorry. l'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

233
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,930
l'm sorry too.
But l like things done a certain way.

234
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:49,292
-The chemistry's just not right.
-The chemistry thing for us too.

235
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:54,401
Wow. Okay.

236
00:16:55,692 --> 00:17:01,608
l realize l came on a little strong.
lt's because l think you're amazing.

237
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:07,802
l wanna tell you how much l appreciate
you giving me an opportunity.

238
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:11,402
You're the most talented chef
l've ever worked for.

239
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,803
Anyway. . . .

240
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:22,010
-Tim, wait.
-Yeah?

241
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:27,808
l spoke too quickly. There's
a learning curve with this job.

242
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:30,572
Maybe we could try it again.

243
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:34,202
Thank you so much.
l know l can be better.

244
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,011
And Tim, l just want to say
good luck here.

245
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:49,008
-Hello.
-Hi.

246
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,489
How was the date?

247
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:57,005
l'm alone and l just bought $ 1 5 worth
of candy bars. What do you think?

248
00:17:57,212 --> 00:18:01,444
-What happened?
-l told him l was pregnant.

249
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:06,243
-He didn't take it so well?
-Well, better than you.

250
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:09,529
-But still not what you want.
-Oh?

251
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:13,208
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said:

252
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:16,324
''l hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch. ''

253
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,406
-He sounds swell.
-Doesn't he?

254
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:24,604
You want a little cheering up?
Sit down.

255
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,008
Guess whose middle name is Muriel?

256
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:37,008
Chandler M. Bing.
Oh, my God.

257
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,610
-l'm sorry about your date.
-lt's all right.

258
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:47,128
l guess l'm just done
with the dating thing.

259
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:51,650
Just one more thing in my life
that's completely different.

260
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:55,601
-This is hard.
-Yeah, l know.

261
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:03,328
On the other hand, in seven months
you're gonna have something. . .

262
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:09,204
. . .that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

263
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:12,208
Just wait.

264
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:17,650
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

265
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:20,201
You have no idea.

266
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:24,001
Thanks, sweetie.

267
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:33,244
-You wanna grab some coffee?
-No. l'm gonna go eat 1 0 candy bars.

268
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:38,008
-l thought l cheered you up.
-You did. There are 20 in here.

269
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,201
-Good night.
-Good night.

270
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:51,881
Ross? Hey, it's Mona.
From the wedding.

271
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,606
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

272
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:59,641
-How are you?
-l'm good, except you owe me a dance.

273
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:05,489
That's right. Well, would you be
interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?

274
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,411
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

275
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,401
Great. Well. . . .

276
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:18,928
-l think l need another cup of coffee.
-Sure, let me get it for you.

277
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:35,966
Bob?

278
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:37,571
Bob!

279
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:44,649
-What the hell are you doing?
-This is Chandler's office.

280
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:47,804
