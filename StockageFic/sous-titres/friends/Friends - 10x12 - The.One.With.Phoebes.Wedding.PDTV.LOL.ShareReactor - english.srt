1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,400
Oh hey, Joey.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,300
Listen, I need to ask you sth.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,100
Ok, you know how my step-dad's in prison?

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,100
Yeah, well, listen, he was supposed to get a weekend
furlough so he could come to the wedding tomorrow.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,000
But he just called and uhm, well apparently,
stabing iceman in the exercise yard,
just couldn't wait until Monday.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,300
- So he can't come?
- No.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,200
And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And uh,

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,200
well, I'd just really love it if you would do it.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,100
Seriously?

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Yeah, you, you know, you've sorta been like a dad to me.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,300
I mean, you've always, you know,
looked doubt for me and shared your wisdom.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm pretty wisdomas.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,400
So, what do you say?

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,900
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, thank you.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,400
I hope, I hope you know how much you mean to me.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Listen, I hope, I hope you know...

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,900
I don't want you see your father crying.
Go to your room!

Friends*1012 PHOEBE'S WEDDING
English Subtitle Öì³¤Õ÷ cz_z@sina.com

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,933
So no one told you life was gonna be this way

21
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:32,474
Your job's a joke, you're broke,
your love life's D.O.A. (dead on arrival)

22
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:36,676
It's like you're always stuck in second gear

23
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:41,822
when it hasn't been your day,
your week, your month, or even your year

24
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:46,100
but I'll be there for you

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
(When the rain starts to pour)

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,180
I'll be there for you

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,200
(Like I've been there before)

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,300
I'll be there for you

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,500
('Cause you're there for me too)

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Oh, no, no. Let your dad get this.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Oh, it's my wedding planner.
She's driving me crazy.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Hello. Hey, ok, stop screaming!

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,100
Ok, so halibut.

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,200
Alright, so salmon, either way, I don't know.
It doesn't matter to me.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,100
Well, it matters to me!

36
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,500
Well, I don't care, so you pick.

37
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Did you just hang up on me?

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Alright, look. I need you at the rehearsal dinner
tonight at 18:00.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,500
Uhuh, ok, what time is that?

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,200
You don't know military time?

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Well, I must have been in a missile training
the day they taught that.

42
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,500
Just subtract twelve.

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,600
- Ok. So 1800-12 is 1788.
- 6:00!

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh, hold on. Yeah, Galler here.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
No, I said it has to be there by 5:00, goodbye.

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,200
God, how hard is it to make an ice sculpture?

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy.
I told you I just want a simple wedding.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Please, honey. Leave the datails to me.

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,500
Now I want to make this day
as special for you as I can.

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Now ok, I was thinking that
the Harbors should wear white.

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,300
Harbors? My friend Margery
is playing the steel drums.

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,700
Oh, she backed out.

53
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,100
She did? Why?

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,700
I made her.

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,000
Steel drums don't really say elegant wedding.
Nor does Margery's overwhelming scent.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,100
Hey. You look great.

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know?

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I so really get to practice my meals before I eat them.

60
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,100
Hey, what did we say it was your one gift to us.

61
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,700
No stupid jokes. But,
I thought that was for the actual wedding.

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,600
Rehearse it.

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
Hi.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,700
Thanks for coming, you guys.

65
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, I... I was going for a handshake.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
That is why.

68
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,300
So, Rach, where is Emma?

69
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,500
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's.

70
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,900
Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.

71
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,100
Are you still crying about your damn baby?

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Phoebs, you gotta keep the line moving.
Remember, 20 seconds per person.

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
You see these clowns all the time.

74
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,500
Yes, we are.

76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Our little ones are grown up fast, aren't they?

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,900
How's that?

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,500
You know, on the one hand, you're happy for them,
but on the other hand, it's hard to let go.

79
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,500
Who in God's name are you?

80
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Hey I'm not fond of you, either, ok?
But at least I was just trying to be nice for the kids.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
You know what I just realized?

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,200
We have no idea what we're
doing in the wedding tomorrow.

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah, I thougt we'd be groomsmen.
But wouldn't they've just asked us by now?

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,300
When did they ask you to be a bridesmaid?

85
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,400
Uh... November?

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,600
I wanna say it's not looking good.

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,900
- Hey, Phoebs?
- Sorry?

88
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Uh, you haven't told these guys
what they are doing in the wedding yet.

89
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,900
- Uhm, well, they're not in the wedding.
- What?

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Well, this is really awkward.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,100
Oh, and I can leave.

92
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm sorry, you guys. But you know, Mike has got
his brother and his friends from school, so, you know.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,300
You were, if it helps, you were next in line.
You just miss the khi.

94
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,600
Oh, man.

95
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
This is like Figure Skating Team all over again.

96
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,300
I mean Synchronized Swimming.

97
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,500
I mean the Balance Beam.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,100
Help me.

99
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
- Football!
- Thank you.

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Oh, Phoebs, spit that out. That has pork in it.

101
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,300
I thought the pot stew is supposed to be vegetarian.

102
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,600
Yeah, I changed them. I sent you a fax about it.

103
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, I don't have a fax machine.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,300
Huh! Well there are going to be a few surprises.

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,200
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people
that aren't in this way.

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,500
I know, I hate being left outta things.

107
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
And it's a wedding! It'll be weird if I'm not in it.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Hey, guys, how's it going?

109
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,100
Fine. We're just sitting here,
alone, doing nothing.

110
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,400
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,900
Hey look, about tomorrow,
I've got a question for you.

112
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,200
I just found out that one of my groomsman
had an emergency and can't make it.

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,900
- What happened?
- Who cares! And?

114
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,200
And I was wondering if, you know,
maybe one of you guys...

115
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
- I'll do it!
- No, no. Me, me!

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
You both wanna do it? Uh,
there's only room for one.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
Pick me! I look great in tux
and I will not steal focus.

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,100
No, Mike, no. You wanna pick me!

119
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,100
I mean, watch!

120
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,200
Uhm, I really don't feel very comfortable
making this decision.

121
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,200
You know, Phoebe knows you better,
I'm gonna let her chose.

122
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Well, if Phoebe's choosing,
then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.

123
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh, I will. But I'll need a mirror, as he is me.

124
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,100
- Please, you're going down.
- You're going downer.

125
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,200
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it.

127
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
So you know I'm fulfilling Phoebe's
step-dad tomorrow, right?

128
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah. Thanks for doing that.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, hey, my pleasure.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,100
So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?

131
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
I intend to marry her.

132
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,500
Oh, a wise acher.

133
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Now I understand you planned to support your wife
by playing the piano.

134
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,300
It's kinda unstable.

135
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,800
No more so than acting.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,100
Strike 2.

137
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,900
You're right. She probably will support me.

138
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,400
Hey, unless we move in with you, dad.

139
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,900
Strike 3.

140
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,900
You only get one more, Mike.

141
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,100
So? What did you decide?

142
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,200
I decided to pee.

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Mike didn't tell you?

144
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,600
You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding,
one of your groomsman fell out.

145
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh, no. I can't choose between you two.
I love you both so much.

146
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,400
Just not enough to put us
in the original wedding party.

147
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,900
I don't wanna choose. It's...

148
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Oh, ok, wait. Rach!

149
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Uhm, listen, I have a very special bridesmaid test
for you to give.

150
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,200
Goody! What is it?

151
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Well, there is a spot open for one groomsman
and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler.
So, good luck with that.

152
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,200
What, what? No, no, I don't wanna do that.

153
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,100
Alright, I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.

154
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
I'll do it!

155
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,900
Ok, it's 21:00. Time for your toasts.

156
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,300
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?

157
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,900
You had a bathroom break at 20:30.
Pee on your own time, Mike.

158
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
Now.

159
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,100
In regard to the toasts, ok?
You wanna keep them short.

160
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,500
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Ok.

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,800
You just get in, do your thing and get out.

162
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,400
Is that what you said to Chandler?

163
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,400
It's 21:01, and I'm not amused.

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,500
The bride and groom have
a few words they like to say.

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Ok. Hello, everyone, and thank you all
for being here tonight.

166
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,000
So, tomorrow is the big event.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And some of might not know, but
Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.

168
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,300
Uhm, yeah. My friend Joey and I decided to
fix each other up with friends.

169
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,300
So, I, I...

170
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I... I gave it a lot thought and I fixed him
up with my friend Marialen who couldn't be here tonight because...

171
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Which is not important, she is in rehab...

172
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Anyway, so Joey said he was fixing me up with
his friend Mike only he didn't have a friend Mike,

173
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
so he just brought, uh, my Mike, and...

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,800
But despite... you know, it got, it got good.

175
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,400
Ok, I wanna take a moment to metion my mother
who couldn't be here for...

176
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh, god.

177
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,100
And, and moment is over. So, ok, uhm...

178
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Oh no, forget that, I can firget that, and uh...

179
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,900
Oh, this is funny, oh but you need to know that...

180
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Oh, well ok, I...

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Ok, Monica, I can't do it like this!

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,400
This is my wedding! Ok? I don't wanna this,
or this, or this, ok?

183
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I just wanted a simple wedding where
my fiance can go to the bathroom any time he wants!

184
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,500
You know what? You're done.

185
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,900
- What?
- You're fired!

186
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Cheers!

187
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,600
- Hey!
- Happy wedding day!

188
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Oh, happy my wedding day to you.

189
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,300
Ok, Joey, listen, this is going to be
bridesmaid centre, alright?

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,800
We're gonna have hair makeup going on
in bathroom, and...

191
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,700
Oh, I had to move a couple of things in the frige
to make room for the corsages.

192
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,400
Oh, man! I wouldn't have breakfast
if I knew there's gonna be corsages.

193
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,500
Uh, about last night,

194
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,300
I know you're under a lot of stress and...

195
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,700
Even though that the things
you said hurt me a little bad.

196
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,700
My point is... Well,
I'm willing to take my job back.

197
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh, well, that's ok.

198
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,100
I think you and I will do much better if you're just,
you know, as bridsmaid.

199
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,800
Well, if you say so, ok.

200
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,900
If that's really what you want and here,
I give you the headset.

201
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't really wanna give you the headset.

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,500
And I guess if you're taking over,
then you should probably return these messages.

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,600
Wow, this is a lot.

204
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,300
But I'm sure you can handle this.

205
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,800
I mean I have won awards for my orgnizational skills but,

206
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm sure you'll do fine.

207
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,400
You've won awards?

208
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I printed it on my computer.

209
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
- Hey.
- Hi.

210
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,900
Where is Rach?

211
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,200
She's in her room, why?

212
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
I have to talk to her about
this groomsman situation, ok?

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
while I'm sitting in the seat like some chump.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Ah, my God, you're breathtaking.

215
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,500
What do you want?

216
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,500
You haven't by any chance chosen
the groomsman yet, have you?

217
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Oh, Ross, come on, please.
Don't make it harder than it already is.

218
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I'm not. I'm making it easier, pick me!

219
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,700
Well, Chandler said that it's
really important for him, too.

220
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,600
Listen, whoever you pick is gonna
walk down the aisle with you.

221
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,500
Now I promise I won't say a word,
but if you pick Chandler,

222
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,900
he's gonna be whistling stupid jokes
in your ear the whole time.

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, you're the less of two evils.

224
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Stan, I don't understand what you're saying.

225
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,400
What is wrong with the flowers?
Lorgans? What the hell are lorgans?

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
I know.

227
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,100
Hey.

228
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,900
Listen, Mike, if you were swedish, and you were saying
the word lorgans, what flower will that be?

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
- Orchids?
- Right there, that's why I'm marrying you.

230
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Hello, Michael.

231
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,300
Joseph.

232
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,300
May I have a word with you, please?

233
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,700
This is... great.

234
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Have a seat.

235
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family.

236
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:09,500
Instead, you disrespected me.
I can not allow this.

237
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?

238
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,100
More back talk.

239
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:26,100
And yes, I maybe borrowing a few lines from my
recent unsuccessful audition for Family Onitu,
this time isn't personal.

240
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,400
Joey, I kinda have a little lot to do today,
what do you want?

241
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,600
I want you to take this seriously.

242
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,100
Phoebe is very, very important to me, ok?

243
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
And I wanna make sure that
you are gonna take care of her.

244
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,600
Joe, I love Phoebe.

245
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,000
She's the sigle most important thing in my life.
I'd die before I let anything happen to her.

246
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,100
That's what I wanted to hear.

247
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Because she's family, ok?
And now you're gonna be family.

248
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,800
And there's nothing more important
in the whole world than family.

249
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,400
- That must have been one lousy movie.
- That was me!

250
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,100
Hey, can I talk to you about the groomsman thing?

251
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,600
If you pick Ross, you know,
he'll walk you down the aisle just fine.

252
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,600
But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy.

253
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Even so,

254
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
I think I'm gonna pick Ross.

255
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,300
Let me tell you why you need to pick me.

256
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,700
See, when I was a kid,
I was always left outta everything.

257
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,800
you know, and it really made me feel insecure.

258
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I was always picked last in gym,

259
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,200
even behind the big fat exchange student
who didn't even know the rules to baseball.

260
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.

261
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,100
Anyway, if I'm the only one left outta this wedding,

262
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,800
I just know that all those old feelings are gonna
come rushing back.

263
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Alright, fine, I pick you.

264
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Make groom for Chandler.

265
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh, my!

266
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,500
No, we're gonna do it my way.

267
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,200
Because your way is stupid.

268
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Alright, I gotta go,
I have another call reverend.

269
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,500
Hello.

270
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,900
- I'm glad we have this little talk.
- Yes, yeah.

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
And thanks for all the wedding night advice.

272
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,700
That didn't make me uncomfortable at all.

273
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Alright, it's all. See everybody tonight.

274
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,000
Uh, did you guys know that
there's a giant ice sculpture in the hall?

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,100
Oh my god, what's it doing here?

276
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,000
Ah, I guess it got sent to the billing addr
as apposed to shipping addr.

277
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
Oh, What a pickle!

278
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,700
Oh my god! Everything is such a mess.
Why is this happening to me?

279
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
How bad do you wanna stick you tongue on that?

280
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,800
How's it going?

281
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,000
Good. I'm just getting some coffee,
so I'm alert for the wedding.

282
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
That's what I was doing, too.

283
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
Well, you have fun tonight.

284
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,300
- You, too.
- Oh, I will.

285
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Me, too.

286
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Wait a minute,
I know why I'm being such an ass, why you?

287
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm not supposed to tell you.

288
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,100
You told us both we could be in the wedding?

289
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,900
Well, in my defence,
you weren't supposed to tell each other!

290
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Rachel, only one of us can do it.
You have to choose.

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You and me, together again.

292
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,600
Rach, Rach, knock, knock.

293
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,100
- Who's there?
- I'll tell you at the wedding.

294
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,400
Hey. I forgot my scarf.

295
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Well, you know what, I can't do this,
I don't know which one of you guys to pick.

296
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,600
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh, good,
'cause I had an idea.

297
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,400
I thought it would be fun
if the third groomsman was my family dog Chappy.

298
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,500
What, a dog? No, Rachel gets to choose.

299
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,700
Well, this is a tough one.

300
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,100
I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.

301
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,000
Alright, wait, so what you're saying is
the chef is at the Hamilton Club but the food is not,

302
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,400
and the drinks are there but the bartender is not?

303
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,200
Are... are you frigging kidding me!?

304
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,300
How's it going?

305
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,900
- Help me.
- What?

306
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,900
I want you to be crazy bitch again.

307
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,500
Really?

308
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Please.

309
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,100
Do you really want me to come back?

310
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Uh, more than I want to get married.

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Ok, people, we're back in business.

312
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,500
Oh god, I've missed you so much.

313
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,900
Ok, go get you hair makeup done
and I'll take care of everything.

314
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,800
Hey, what are you guys gonna do?

315
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
- About what?
- The blizzard.

316
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,100
I just saw on the news said the worst snowstorm
in 20 years already closed all the bridges and tunnels.

317
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,600
But the band and photographer are coming
all the way from New Jersey.

318
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,500
I don't think they are.

319
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,900
Ha ha, looks you're not gonna be in the wedding, either.

320
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,700
So sorry, Phoebs.

321
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,300
Well, the club lost its power.

322
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah, according to the news, most of the city did.

323
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Since when do you watch the news?

324
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Uh, F.Y.I, since they hired a very hot weather girl.

325
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I can't believe you guys aren't gonna be bale to
get married today.

326
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,100
Well, you know, it's so beautiful out there.

327
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,900
You always wanted to get married outside,
why don't you guys just do it on the street?

328
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,800
What?

329
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,400
Look, it's hardly snowing anymore.

330
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,900
I mean, you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting.

331
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,800
This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted.

332
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,900
What do you think?

333
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,900
I think I wanted to get married to you today.

334
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Me, too.

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Monica, do you think we can do it?

336
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Affirmative.

337
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
Ok. Let's get these chairs out here.

338
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Gunther, hit the christmas lights.

339
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,900
Ok, who left the ice sculpture on the steam grid?

340
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
- Michael.
- Hey, you made it. Great.

341
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Chappy!

342
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Mom, I know getting married in the street
isn't sth you approve of...

343
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,600
No. It's lovely, the lights and the snow.
I can look at them forever.

344
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,000
I crashed the pill and put it in her drink.

345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,500
Come on, sweat heart.

346
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,100
You know, Chappy is too small to handle all the snow,

347
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.

348
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,200
So, technically will this person be in the wedding?

349
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
- I guess.
- I'll do it.

350
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,500
Wait, no. But Chandler, hello,
aren't you scared of dogs?

351
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm not scared. I just take little Chappy and...

352
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,900
He can sense my fear! My throat is exposed!

353
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Oh, I guess I'm in the wedding, then. Ha ha!

354
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,500
He stinks.

355
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,300
Level 1 alert! I repeat, Level 1, this is not a drill!

356
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,800
We've got a situation, the minister just called
he's snowed in, he can't make it.

357
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh, no.

358
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,400
Oh hey, don't worry.
I'm still ordained from your wedding.

359
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
You think I'd give up being a minister
and start paying the ride of subway?

361
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Uh, ministers don't ride the subway for free.

362
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I had to read the bible pretty carefully,
but yeah, we do.

363
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,800
Ok, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to
find someone else to walk Phoebe down the aisle.

364
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,700
I'll do it! Aha ha...

365
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Ok, Mike and Joey, get in position.
Chandler, come with me.

366
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Ok, Joey's throwing the ceremony,
and Chandler's giving you away.

367
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Oh, ok. Hi, new dad.

368
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,600
So, you ready to do this?

369
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Uh uhn. Oh my god, this is really happening.

370
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Oh, Phoebe, I'm so happy for you, honey.

371
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,300
I love you.

372
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, wait wait, no hugs, the dresses!
What the hell.

373
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Come on!

374
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,600
I love you, guys.

375
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,900
Ok, it's 0:00. All teams execute on my count.

376
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Let's get this bad boy on the road!

377
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Is it ok that
I want you to wear that headset in bed tonight?

378
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,000
Uh, I have the schedule for nudity at 23:00.

379
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh yeah.

380
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Ok, Margery, hit it.

381
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,700
Geeze, Ross, you could've showered.

382
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,700
It's the dog!

383
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,400
Groomsman, why are you just stading there?
Where's your bridesmaid?

384
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,600
We've got a broken error, bridesmaid down.

385
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Oh, it's me.

386
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,500
- Ready?
- Ok.

387
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh wait, oh no, wait.

388
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,000
Wow, aren't you gonna be could?

389
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,900
I don't care. I'll be my sth blue.

390
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,300
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

391
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,800
My god, aren't you freezing?

392
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Nuh.

393
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Friends, Family, Dog.

394
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Thank you all for been here to witness this blessed event.

395
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
The could has now spread to my special place.

396
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,000
So I'm gonna do the short version of this.

397
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,900
Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other
and I know I speak for everyone here

398
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,500
when I wish them a lifetime of happiness.

399
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Who has the rings?

400
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,000
When I was growing up,
I didn't have a normal mom and dad,

401
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,200
or a regular family like everybody else.

402
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,900
And I always knew that something was missing.

403
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
But now, I'm standing here today,

404
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,400
knowing that I have the everything I'm ever gonna need:

405
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,400
You are my family.

406
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,900
Phoebe, you're so beautiful.
You're so kind, you're so generous.

407
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,800
You're so wonderfully weird.

408
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,800
Every day with you is an adventure.

409
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
I can't believe how lucky I am.

410
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
And I can't wait to share my life with you forever.

411
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Oh wait, no. I forgot, and I love you.

412
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,600
And you have nice eyes.

413
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,900
I love you, too.

414
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,900
Uh, Joey. Chppy's heart rate has slowed way down.

415
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?

416
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,200
I do.

417
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?

418
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,500
I do.

419
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,800
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

420
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,200
I got married!

421
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,400
Could someone get me a coat?
I'm frigging freezing.

422
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,300
That really was an incredible wedding.

423
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,200
That was, yeah. I kinda don't want to end.

424
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and bite a corsage?

425
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,600
I'd love to but it's 23:00 and I'm about to have
the most organized sex anyone's ever had.

426
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,500
Nice. Hey, what happened to Ross?

427
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,600
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with
that hot girl he was talking to.

428
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Come on, Chappy, do your business, make!

429
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I did not sign on for this.
