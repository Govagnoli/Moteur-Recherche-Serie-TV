1
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,900
Come on, no peeking.

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,869
Our eyes are closed, and we're
crossing the street. very good.

3
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,819
Okay. Open up!

4
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,700
What do you want to show us?

5
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:22,739
Because all I can see
is this bitchin' van!

6
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:26,270
It's for our catering business.

7
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:28,670
I think I know that girl.

8
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,349
We won't keep it this way though.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,459
We'll replace the sword
with a baguette.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,470
Also, we don't know
what to do with this.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,270
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,419
The One Where
They 're Going To Party!

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,819
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

14
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:38,339
Remember that guy that
put cilantro in everything?

15
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,220
Sure, Cilantro Larry!

16
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,220
I'm filling in for him as
food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.

17
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,660
What an amazing opportunity
to influence...

18
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,779
... dozens of people!

19
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,470
What about our catering business?

20
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,349
It's just one night a week.

21
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,019
Plus, I get to take you out
for free dinners.

22
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,269
Well, in that case....

23
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,660
That was me, hopping on board.

24
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,259
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross!

25
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,059
Quick question for you.

26
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,110
Are you ready to party?

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,500
I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

28
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,979
There's this thing about bees
on the Discovery Channel.

29
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,699
I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready...

30
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,110
... to party?

31
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,509
Gandalf?
Gandalf is coming to town?

32
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,139
I have nothing to do, so tomorrow
we are partying with Gandalf, dude!

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,940
Dude, we are so going to party!

34
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,820
Wow, okay. Dude alert!

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,179
Who is this guy?

36
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,509
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only the funnest guy in the world.

37
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,710
I'll call to get off work tomorrow.

38
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,750
I'll call after you!

39
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,350
This will be so cool!
We never party anymore.

40
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,419
Were you smoking something
in the back of our van?

41
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,660
"We never have fun anymore"?
You have fun with me.

42
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:14,830
Remember those strippers?
And you paid me $50 to eat that book?

43
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,820
You are going to love this guy.
Gandalf is the party wizard.

44
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,619
Why do you call him "Gandalf"?

45
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,470
Gandalf the Wizard.

46
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,660
Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?

47
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:32,660
No, I had sex in high school.

48
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:42,220
Joanna? I was wondering if
I could ask you something.

49
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:45,419
There's an opening for
a buyer in Junior Miss--

50
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,139
That'd be a step down for me.

51
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,630
Actually, I meant for me.

52
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,139
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and....

53
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:57,179
I guess you can't stay
my assistant forever.

54
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,460
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

55
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,309
I'm so glad you don't have a problem.
If you did, I wouldn't apply.

56
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:07,470
In that case--

57
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,750
That's why I'm glad
there's no problem.

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,190
I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

59
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:15,710
That's great!

60
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,350
Junior Miss is where I started.

61
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,459
I slept with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

62
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:23,750
Really?

63
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,070
I mean, no.

64
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,660
With your qualifications,
you won't need to do that.

65
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,670
Although I might need
some convincing.

66
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,869
Kidding!

67
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,220
God, I feel wild today!

68
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,059
Man, I am so excited,
I may vomit.

69
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,019
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

70
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,540
You don't understand.
He's amazing.

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,630
You never know what'll happen.

72
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,869
You go out for beer
and end up on a boat to Nova Scotia.

73
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,700
It's beautiful country up there.

74
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,940
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

75
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,589
It won't be exactly like last time.

76
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,859
I'll see you guys.

77
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,029
I have an audition,
but I'll meet you.

78
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,950
Where will you be around noon?

79
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,950
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

80
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,709
It's Gandalf!

81
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:45,859
So are you in town?

82
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,309
Maybe next time, then.

83
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,100
What happened?

84
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,299
He can't come.
He's stuck in Chicago.

85
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,660
Oh, man!

86
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:00,429
Chicago's so lucky.

87
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,700
Stupid, useless...

88
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,339
... Canadian money!

89
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,070
You have a very impressive résumé,
Miss Greene.

90
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,390
I especially like what I see about
implementing a new filing system.

91
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:18,390
Thank you.

92
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:22,940
Filing system? Those colored labels
you put on all the folders?

93
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,510
It did brighten up
the filing cabinets.

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,459
They did more than that.

95
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,500
I notice you've been entrusted with
a lot of important responsibilities.

96
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,859
Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

97
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,989
Rachel has been incredible
at getting my bagels.

98
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,790
She gets it right almost every time.

99
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,070
Of course, I have more
responsibilities than that.

100
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:52,070
Of course!
There's the coffee too.

101
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:55,589
Rachel can carry two things at once.

102
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,940
That's very good.

103
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,739
Now a big part of this job is...

104
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,940
... cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

105
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,540
-Yes, l--
-She shouldn't have any problem.

106
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,059
Her only problem might be getting
too friendly, you know?

107
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,019
I love working with designers.

108
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,059
With them. Under them.
What's the difference?

109
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,790
My first review is out.

110
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:29,109
The Chelsea Reporter.

111
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,869
These used to keep me so warm.

112
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,470
Look, I'm on the back page.

113
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,980
"Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, I'd get two meals.

114
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,670
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head. "

115
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,630
You really laid into this place.

116
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,709
They don't pay me a penny
a word to make friends.

117
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,109
I found a guy who'd fix up
the van for catering.

118
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,309
You want me to go?

119
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,549
It's okay. Are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

120
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,589
Haven't we made this decision?

121
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,950
Yeah, all right.

122
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,540
-Who is it?
-It's Allesandro, from Allesandro 's.

123
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,709
I want to talk to you
about your review.

124
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,750
Call me on the phone.

125
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,859
What? So you can hang up on me?

126
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,899
I'll never let you up,
so just go away.

127
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,299
-Just give me a chance to--
-Do you need to get in?

128
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,909
No, Phoebe!

129
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:34,510
Hey, Monica!

130
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,309
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill. "

131
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,380
I couldn't eat it.

132
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,900
My five friends couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

133
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,349
Our service isn't
"grossly incompetent. "

134
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,510
The waiter carried
the breadsticks in his pants.

135
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,299
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

136
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:01,830
... which we do not!

137
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,510
All right, that I'll retract.

138
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,820
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

139
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,309
Your marinara is like tomato juice.

140
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,869
You should serve it
with vodka and celery.

141
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,659
I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

142
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:19,900
You own an ltalian restaurant,
and you think that tastes good?

143
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:21,270
Where are you from?

144
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,150
Lebanon.

145
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,429
Hand me those tomatoes.

146
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,940
I'll show you
what it should taste like.

147
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,190
How long will this take?
I got another critic I got to yell at.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,909
Joanna, I want to talk
about that interview.

149
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:46,260
I thought it went very well.

150
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,950
No, it didn't. That's what
I want to talk to you about.

151
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,869
Now just to brief you...

152
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,750
... I may cry.

153
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:02,909
But they are not
tears of sadness or of anger...

154
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,460
... but just of us having
this discussion.

155
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,179
Please, don't make a scene.

156
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,859
There's nobody here.

157
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,659
Sophie, get in here.

158
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,270
See? You're making
Sophie uncomfortable.

159
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,340
No, she's not.

160
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:23,309
Congratulations. You crossed
the line into completely useless.

161
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,260
Do you want me to quit?

162
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,830
What makes you think that?

163
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:33,070
Those things you said
in the interview...

164
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,309
... if you believe them,
I must not be a good assistant.

165
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:39,380
You know what?

166
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:43,140
I am just going to pack up my desk...

167
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,539
... and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

168
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,030
There's no use staying
till the end of the day.

169
00:10:55,469 --> 00:10:56,700
Wait, wait.

170
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,619
You can put
your sad little muffin back.

171
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:04,780
If you must know the truth,
I didn't want to lose a good assistant.

172
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,750
That's why I said those things
about your flirting and drinking.

173
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,549
My drinking?

174
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,260
I must have said that
after you left.

175
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,989
Said what, exactly?

176
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,780
You enjoy the occasional drink...

177
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,349
...-ing binge.

178
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,460
Oh, my God!
That is it. I'm leaving!

179
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,510
You are just a horrible person!

180
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,869
Wait, wait.

181
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,820
If you're going to get
all sensitive about it.

182
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,309
I don't want to lose you.

183
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,979
What if I create a position for you?

184
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,950
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

185
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:43,070
Say more things like that.

186
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,390
Your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

187
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,270
-I need an expense account.
-Done!

188
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,630
-And an assistant.
-Sophie!

189
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,059
Hey, I thought you'd be
out partying with Gandol-...

190
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,260
...-dorf.

191
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,590
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

192
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,580
You've been sitting here all day?

193
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,070
I balanced my checkbook.

194
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,229
And I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

195
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,349
I can't believe he didn't come.

196
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:25,659
So what? We can still go out
and party ourselves.

197
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,739
With Gandalf, we'd be out all night.

198
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,619
We'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

199
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,150
We could do that.

200
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,659
There was other stuff too.

201
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,309
We'll do it all and better!

202
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,299
After tonight, Gandalf will want
to party with us, dude!

203
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,109
As if we
don't know how to party!

204
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,539
All right! Let's go.

205
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,469
Maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

206
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,739
All right!

207
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,820
When were we on a boat?

208
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:04,659
Remember that cold morning
when those dogs were licking your face?

209
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,229
Those were seals, man.

210
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,659
How would this suit
look on an assistant buyer--

211
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,859
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me.

212
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:22,469
But I made him sauce, and he
offered me the job as head chef!

213
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,270
You just ruined the thing
I was practicing, but I'm so happy!

214
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:30,780
Can you believe it?
I get to run my own kitchen!

215
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:32,739
Oh, you've waited so long.

216
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,580
Pheebs! Quick question for you.

217
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,659
How would this suit look...

218
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:41,229
... on an assistant buyer
at Bloomingdale's?

219
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,659
It would totally depend
on her coloring and....

220
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,710
You got the job!

221
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,669
You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:55,700
It'll be so great!
I'll help decide what we sell.

223
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,380
I'll have an office
with walls and everything.

224
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,309
I'm going to have walls!

225
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,710
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

226
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,940
The wedding reception.

227
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,070
I kind of need to
talk to you about that.

228
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,059
I think it's time for me to take
a step back from the catering.

229
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:22,070
But we've only had one job.

230
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,549
But now we have this second one,
and it feels like it's snowballing.

231
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,109
What are you saying?

232
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,460
I got offered the head chef job
at Allesandro's.

233
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:37,900
It's okay, because
you don't really need me.

234
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,750
You're the cook!

235
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,510
Without you, it's just me
driving up to people's houses...

236
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,510
... with empty trays,
asking for money.

237
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:53,900
All right. But I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

238
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,630
And you can keep the van!

239
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,109
For what?

240
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,190
I can't believe this!

241
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,909
I got to get out of here.

242
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,549
Phoebe, wait a minute.

243
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,950
I'm an assistant buyer!

244
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,099
We'll get coffee, get energized,
then head back out.

245
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,950
-Yeah, all right.
-Okay.

246
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,349
So we're having fun, right?

247
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,460
We don't need that wizard guy.

248
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,590
We hit some clubs,
talk to some strangers...

249
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,140
... then go down to the docks
and see about that boat thing.

250
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,510
I'm kind of beat.

251
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:38,710
Actually...

252
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,510
... me too.

253
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,549
Are you serious?

254
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,869
Thank God! I'm exhausted.

255
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,380
You guys want coffees?

256
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,669
I don't want to be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

257
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,309
Yeah, me too.

258
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,869
Actually, could I get
some hot water with lemon?

259
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:02,630
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

260
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,710
I can't hear a word.
My ears are ringing so bad.

261
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:09,270
I was glad I had
that extra pair of socks.

262
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,789
I used them as mittens.

263
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,869
I didn't want to touch a thing
in that last place.

264
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,510
How sad are we?

265
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,390
Yeah, I know.

266
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,190
You know what?
We're not sad.

267
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:26,390
We're just not 21anymore.
You know?

268
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,109
I'm 29 years old, dammit!

269
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,789
I want to sit in a
comfortable chair, watch Tv...

270
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,669
... and go to sleep
at a reasonable hour.

271
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:38,820
I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

272
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:43,659
And so what if I like to go home,
put on Kenny G and take a bath?

273
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,349
We're 29.
We're not women.

274
00:16:57,469 --> 00:16:58,750
There you are.

275
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,099
I'm glad you decided to hear me out.

276
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay, I'm hearing.

277
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,189
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

278
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,270
I came up with a bunch of businesses
that you can do with your van.

279
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,140
You could be
a flower delivery person.

280
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,589
Or a bakery delivery person?

281
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,859
Pizza?

282
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,109
I got a whole bunch
of stuff in this area.

283
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,949
But I get the feeling
you don't want to deliver.

284
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,260
I guess if you
don't want to deliver...

285
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,260
... you probably don't want
to pick up stuff either.

286
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,099
You know what?

287
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,150
Let's do the catering business.

288
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:51,500
Really? Are you sure?

289
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,949
Yeah, I made a commitment to you.

290
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,900
It'd be fun.

291
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,869
It will be fun!

292
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,150
Let's plan the wedding reception.

293
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,670
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

294
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:20,069
You know what?
I want you to take the chef job.

295
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,780
Really?

296
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,060
That's what you really want.

297
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:29,260
I don't want to be the reason
you're unhappy. I'd be unhappy.

298
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:32,459
And I really don't want to be
the reason I'm unhappy.

299
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,310
Thank you.

300
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,469
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

301
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,099
Hi, Mrs. Lynch.

302
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,790
Is Joanna in already?

303
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:54,540
Oh, my goodness!
You haven't heard.

304
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,589
What?

305
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,310
Joanna...

306
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,349
... passed away last night.

307
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,109
Oh, my God! How?

308
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,030
She was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

309
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,900
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it!

310
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,469
I know.

311
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,500
I didn't realize
that you were so close.

312
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,430
Yes. So close!

313
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:29,869
I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

314
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,109
But by any chance, did Joanna...

315
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:36,069
... send any paperwork
your way before...

316
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,300
... it happened?

317
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,589
No, nothing.

318
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:40,790
Imagine...

319
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,670
... if she'd just stepped off
that curb a few seconds later.

320
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:49,339
Yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

321
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,459
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

322
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,550
I'm sorry. I have to go.

323
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:57,780
Good morning!

324
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,869
You didn't hear about Joanna.

325
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,469
I sure did!

326
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,310
I'm excited about having
Monica on board with us.

327
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,099
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

328
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,910
It is like losing
a member of the family.

329
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,109
Of course, that literally
is the case for several of you.

330
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,189
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

331
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,270
... please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

332
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,709
I know Monica has a lot
of great ideas for this place.

333
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:38,859
Well, you all read the review.

334
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,270
So without much further ado...

335
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,300
... I present to you
our new head chef.

336
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:55,709
I just want to say that
with a pinch of excitement...

337
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:59,099
... a dash of hard work
and a dollop of cooperation...

338
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:01,180
... we can have the recipe....

339
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,469
Are you going to kill me?

340
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:39,979
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

341
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,930
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

342
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,020
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

343
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,530
London might have gotten started...

344
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,089
... because we needed to take advantage
of the show's popularity...

345
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,530
... and go do the show on
an exotic location...

346
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,050
... and have a good time.

347
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,699
There's so many people here
from all over the world.

348
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:18,489
Lately, the show's been about us
getting excited to go to London.

349
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:22,060
And then we realized in real life,
we're doing that same thing.

350
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,619
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check!

351
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:29,579
Are you ready yet?

352
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,089
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

353
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,689
Yeah!
London, baby!

354
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,900
It's all London, baby!

355
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,060
Here we go.

356
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,739
Ross is getting married...

357
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:43,689
... to this young woman named Emily.

358
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:48,329
And I set them up by accident.

359
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:49,540
Why don't we?

360
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,890
Why don't we what?

361
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,890
Get married.

362
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,140
I've started to...

363
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:01,859
... fall for this character, Emily,
played by Helen Baxendale.

364
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,420
And we decided to go all the way,
I guess, and get married.

365
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,979
Ross has asked me to marry him.
I say yes.

366
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,849
And so we arrange
a big wedding in London.

367
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,250
Things go a bit wrong.

368
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:16,369
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

369
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,619
You have to meet me in the middle.

370
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:21,650
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass!

371
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:25,300
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

372
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:27,569
That's it!

373
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,140
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

374
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,020
This is our wedding day!

375
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:34,540
From now on, everyone gets along.

376
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,930
And if I hear one more word...

377
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,729
... no grandchildren!
That's right!

378
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,209
Sorry, old boy.

379
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,099
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

380
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:50,930
We knew the show
was popular in England...

381
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,219
... and so it seemed like
a natural fit.

382
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,810
I knew how big the show was over here.
It was exciting to be welcomed.

383
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,329
Everywhere, walking down the street...

384
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,939
... bunches of kids watching.
So we've been signing autographs.

385
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,489
They're just big fans of the show,
I guess.

386
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:09,890
I watch it all the time
because my children love it.

387
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,540
They absolutely love it.

388
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,140
Tell my friend you like my hat.

389
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,579
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

390
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,579
Hi, Chandler!

391
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,540
We wanted it to
still feel like Friends...

392
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,500
... and so we shot a lot of it
in front of an audience.

393
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:29,729
And it seemed like
a really exciting opportunity...

394
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:34,500
... to shoot an American sitcom
in front of a British audience.

395
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:38,489
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

396
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,699
I'll be the on-camera guy.

397
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,410
All right. First stop...

398
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,689
... Westminster Abbey.

399
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:47,969
What is that?

400
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,500
That's London, baby!

401
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:54,540
We were really afraid, going over,
that either they'd be...

402
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,099
... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh....

403
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,900
They were great!

404
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,699
-Big laughers!
-They waited in line for hours!

405
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,290
-We traveled 329 miles.
-She's lying. It's more like 200.

406
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,290
The show's doing so well over here
that it just seems like...

407
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:13,689
... they're real, real receptive.

408
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:18,810
It's really wonderful and flattering
and overwhelming, truthfully.

409
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,410
We didn't have
a single bad audience.

410
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,810
Also, there was
a greater sense of "event. "

411
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,890
I think it energized everybody:
the actors, the writers....

412
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,619
We're just excited to be here.

413
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,250
Like, look back there.
Look how cool that is!

414
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,540
We missed Lisa.

415
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,250
That was probably the only
drawback I can think of.

416
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,500
I first thought, "How exciting!
I wonder if I'm going?"

417
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:44,619
It's awful that Lisa's not here.

418
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:47,329
We feel like
we have a limb missing.

419
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,780
Let's try some aversion therapy.

420
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,500
Look at the picture.

421
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:03,010
It's strange when one person's
not there. We miss her.

422
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,140
It's weird for all of us
to be here without her.

423
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:09,329
She's in the episode, on the phone
and things like that.

424
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,780
Hey, Pheebs!
It's Joey.

425
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:12,939
Hey, Joey!

426
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,300
I just saw someone that looks just
like you, on the subway.

427
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,969
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

428
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:24,900
That just cost me four bucks.

429
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,699
Part of me wishes I could go.

430
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:31,300
But I'm very happy to not get
on a plane for a lot of hours....

431
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,819
Sorry.
I'm not a good traveler.

432
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,500
The Waltham residence.

433
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:37,939
Is this Emily's parents' house?

434
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,060
This is the housekeeper.

435
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,099
And by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

436
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,060
First one identifies oneself...

437
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,459
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

438
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,540
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

439
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,500
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

440
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:02,500
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

441
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:06,660
It was also interesting because
we had shot about a third of it here.

442
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,930
And a bit of it
on the streets in London.

443
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,930
All right!

444
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,979
Westminster Abbey!

445
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,020
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

446
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:22,250
What do you think of the Abbey?

447
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:26,300
I think it's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

448
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,660
-To what?
-To "Put the camera away" !

449
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:33,689
Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. "

450
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,339
It was a really gratifying experience.

451
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:40,699
Pretty much everything we'd hoped
to get out of it, we got.

452
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,250
When you can go on location even
in Los Angeles that's exciting...

453
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,060
... much less have your whole crew...

454
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,650
...come out to "jolly old England. "
It's really, really exciting.

455
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,609
Just the idea of bringing
our entire "family" over here...

456
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,369
... is, like, wild.

457
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,420
Yeah!
London, baby!

458
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,410
It's amazing to me how many people
are excited about the show.

459
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,410
I knew how big the show was over here.
It plays a lot on television.

460
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,250
I saw it three times in one week.

461
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,619
They're very popular at home,
but I didn 't know they would be here.

462
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:52,420
It's got a massive following
in Britain...

463
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,050
... particularly among my generation.

464
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,689
It's quite sarcastic.
That's why it's popular.

465
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,209
We have great English character actors
who are working with us.

466
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:05,609
And an opportunity to interact
with the English crew.

467
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,449
We're about to be Ross' in-laws.

468
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,969
We're the Brits
that you love to hate.

469
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,849
We worked with
Sarah Ferguson this morning.

470
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,420
She was great and funny.

471
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:17,260
I was excited to be here today.

472
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,729
It's the first time I've ever done this
and I enjoyed it.

473
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,329
I am a great fan.
I think they are all marvelous.

474
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:28,329
Most British people tried to hate them
for being beautiful and funny.

475
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,849
I got a phone call:

476
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,060
"Small part, a few lines.
Do you want it?

477
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,660
Next to Jennifer Aniston. "

478
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,689
And I went, "Oh, wait a minute....
Oh, okay then. "

479
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,410
It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits
up the butt" episode, really.

480
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:46,819
You're gonna see a lot of comedy,
a lot of romance...

481
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,449
... and a lot of surprises.

482
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:51,420
And you get to see England.

483
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,219
Call the Queen Mum,
say you enjoy watching Friends...

484
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,170
... and that you know us, and she'll
have you over for tea like that.
