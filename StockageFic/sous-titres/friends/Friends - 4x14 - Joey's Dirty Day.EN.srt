1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,119
So what is this?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,119
Googlie Worm.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,640
And this?

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,119
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,069
It's so funny!

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,920
What's this?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,909
A hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,719
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,200
It's the classic struggle
between man--

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,310
Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,119
You know what'll be great
about the fishing trip?

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,919
When my Dad asks, "What are you
doing with your life?" ...

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,319
... I can say, "I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,919
What about you?"

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,159
Don't stop having fun
just because I'm here.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,709
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,520
Well, except you.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,480
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.
They broke up only two days ago.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,199
Go fishing next week.

20
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,160
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,319
That's only phase one.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,480
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,160
Phase two?

24
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,199
Getting drunk
and going to a strip club.

25
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,959
How does going there
make him better?

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,120
There are naked ladies there.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,360
Then to phase three:
seeing yourself with other women.

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,910
There are naked ladies there too.

29
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,519
Would you give me one minute, please?

30
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:49,160
The One with Joey's Dirty Day

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,470
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,520
These match the jacket
you picked out last week?

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
There we go.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,720
There it is.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,240
You know what I need?
Gloves.

36
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,919
Brown leather dress gloves.

37
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Well, let's see....

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,389
This one is large.

39
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,559
And this one....

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Also a large?

41
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,320
Two larges coming right up.

42
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,960
Could I have a moment?

43
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,399
My niece, you see,
is in town from London.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,119
Shropshire, but you know.

45
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,399
She's about your age, I'd say.

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,309
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,830
Would you like to keep her
company tonight?

48
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,520
Sure. You got it!

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,110
Count me in. Me.
Fledermaus. Great!

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,520
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.

51
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,479
So?

52
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,759
-Gloves?
-Sorry, I'll be right back.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,070
Actually, I got to take off.

54
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:44,080
I was curious.
Do you have plans tonight?

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,119
No, nothing!

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,960
I invested in a nightclub.
It opens tonight. Want to come?

57
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,960
That would be great!

58
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,919
You're into hard-core S and M, right?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,880
Well, I guess.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm kidding.

61
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,720
I'll put you on the v. I. P. Iist.
Look for me.

62
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,949
Great! You bet.

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
I'll see you tonight.

64
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,559
-I almost forgot the tickets.
-What?

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,720
For you and Emily. Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,119
Oh, right.

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,519
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,519
I can't believe
Kathy did this to me.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,720
I really thought she was the one.

70
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,350
I'll tell you what.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,119
I'm not getting out
of this chair. Ever!

72
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,920
From now on, this chair is the one!

73
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,119
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

74
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,799
Just take the sweats off, okay?

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,279
Take them off
and we'll have some fun.

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
Did you catch any fish?

77
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,119
You guys have no idea.

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,200
-You stink!
-Are you kidding?

79
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,790
Three days without a shower.
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,920
How's he doing?

81
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,549
He hasn't left
that chair in two days.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,720
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

83
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,119
You see? He just needed
his pal to come home.

84
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,279
I got to memorize my lines.

85
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,029
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby!

86
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,519
What's the matter?

87
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,119
Joshua invited me to this
fancy club opening tonight.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

89
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,359
... that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

90
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,320
So what are you going to do?

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,950
-I don't know.
-No! Help me!

92
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,079
-I can't. I have to work.
-Phoebe?

93
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,519
I would, but I get
my morning sickness in the evening.

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,510
Unless she wants to spend the night
holding my hair back for me.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,600
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.

96
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,359
It's my chance for him
to see the "fun" Rachel.

97
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:12,350
The "wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

98
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,040
Are Joey and Chandler back?

99
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:20,359
Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,549
So....

101
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,559
Come on!

102
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,119
-She's here.
-Wait, wait.

103
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,200
Ross, please?

104
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,109
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,109
... so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

106
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,160
That is a toughie.

107
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,790
She's looking down the hall.

108
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,320
She looked right at me.

109
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,920
You can't see people
through that hole, can you?

110
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.

111
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,279
I thought we had moved on.

112
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,239
I thought we could be happy
for each other.

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,519
I mean, was that just me?

114
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,950
All right, I'll do it.

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,799
Thank you, thank you.

116
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,519
Emily.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm Rachel.

118
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,709
Thank goodness!

119
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,040
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight--

120
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,519
Really?

121
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,519
I must've missed your call, though
I didn't leave the flat all day.

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,799
Well, l--

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
That's not rude.
It's in keeping with the trip...

124
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:46,320
... where I've been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

125
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:49,119
... and been strip-searched
at the airport.

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,109
Apparently, I look like someone who's
got cocaine stuffed up their bum.

127
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,160
I think you look great.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,559
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you.

129
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll get her.

130
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,720
Please, hurry.

131
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,920
Don't you just love
the way they talk?

132
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,440
-What?
-The baby kicked!

133
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,910
No, wait. The elastic
in my underwear busted.

134
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,359
Oh, my God! I overslept!

135
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,760
I was supposed to be
on the set half an hour ago!

136
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,159
You can't go like that!
You stink!

137
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:43,039
I fell asleep.
Now I don't have time!

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,510
Just 10 blocks away.
If I run, I'll make it.

139
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,119
Run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

140
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
Slow down!
No, keep moving.

141
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,599
How did it go last night?

142
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,599
Well, I didn't see Joshua.

143
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,520
But I did punch a girl in the face.

144
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring.

145
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,190
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.
But there was a Rachel Greep.

146
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,919
So did you get to meet her?

147
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,559
There is no Rachel Greep.
But this girl overheard us.

148
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,039
And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep! "
And he let her in.

149
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,520
So you hit her?

150
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,119
No, she was already in.

151
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,119
This big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

152
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,119
... so I clocked her.

153
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,719
All I wanted was a few hours...

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,760
... outside of work to see Joshua...

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,520
... so he could go ahead and
start falling in love with me.

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,719
Pheebs.

157
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,320
Honey, that's your name.

158
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:50,559
That's short for Phoebe? I thought
that's what we called each other.

159
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,549
-You're wearing pants!
-That's right.

160
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,549
Where are the guys? I'm ready
to get drunk and see strippers.

161
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
It's 9:30 a. m.

162
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,119
They got a breakfast buffet.

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Let me talk to him!

164
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,119
-Oh, my God!
-Can't I just--

165
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,159
-It's my phone and she's shush--
-Please!

166
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,679
What's he saying?

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,320
He's with Emily in vermont.

168
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,280
What? Oh, my God!

169
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,630
Who's Emily?

170
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,320
They're in vermont?
How did this happen?

171
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,119
How'd he end up in vermont
with that witch?

172
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,320
Maybe she doesn't hit him
all the time.

173
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,280
When we met her...

174
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:41,159
... she was soaking, her feet were wet.
Who wouldn't be miserable?

175
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,359
With a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.

176
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,960
There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

177
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,919
I got to go! There's a deer
eating fruit from the orchard!

178
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,909
He had to go. There was a deer
eating fruit from the orchard.

179
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,549
I don't get this.
She was horrible!

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,719
I'm going to go stand over there.

181
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,960
Why do you care?

182
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
I don't care.

183
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm just upset that
I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,880
You do not just meet someone
and go flitting off to vermont!

185
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,039
When you first met Barry,
you flitted off to vail.

186
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,719
Could you, just for once...

187
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,719
... not remember every little thing?

188
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,190
So you know, when's he getting back?

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,479
A couple of days.

190
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,119
I knew something
like this would happen.

191
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
What are you doing?

192
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,440
You can't go back a phase!

193
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,919
You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

194
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,119
Why don't you do your phase two
strip club thing with us?

195
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,429
We can be guys!

196
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,390
No, you can't.

197
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,119
Let us be guys!
Maybe we want to be guys.

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,719
No, you don't. You'd be all
hairy and wouldn't live as long.

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,320
Would you just stop being
such a wuss and get those off?

200
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,320
And come with us
and watch naked girls dance!

201
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,520
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,039
Joey Tribbianni.
I'm here.

203
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,119
Calm down, we got time.
We're running late.

204
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,520
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating licorice.

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with--

206
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,679
What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

207
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,070
You.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,559
I could see why you would think that.
But you know who it is?

209
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
You?

210
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,390
No, no. It's Heston.

211
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,760
What?

212
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,159
He reeks like he went on a three-day
fishing trip, then ate licorice.

213
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,159
No way. He's the only one
with a shower in his dressing room.

214
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,039
Really? A shower?

215
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,119
Which room might that be?

216
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,200
The one with "Heston" on it.

217
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,320
Interesting.

218
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,119
I got some ones.
You want to put them in her panties?

219
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,520
No, thanks, Mom!

220
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,989
That.

221
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,159
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant.

222
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,070
Maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

223
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,869
It's not my baby.

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
very good.

225
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:03,719
Really good. I enjoyed it.
very exotic.

226
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,559
I just checked our messages
and Joshua didn't call.

227
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,960
You'd think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

228
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,039
You know what makes it worse?

229
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,750
Ross is all happy in vermont.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,520
Come on, look where you are!

231
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Another round.

232
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,799
virgin for me.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,159
Don't let me leave without
the name of that carpet guy.

234
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,719
Come on!

235
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,030
You know what?
I'll go home and call Kathy.

236
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,119
If it'll help.

237
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,119
That was a test.
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.

238
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,599
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.

239
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,520
Then I'll be so drunk,
I'll want to call Janice.

240
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,320
You should! How is she?

241
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,320
I think somebody needs
another lap dance.

242
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,919
Who's in there?

243
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,320
How you doing?

244
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,200
Who in the hell are you?

245
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:20,719
Would you believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas?

246
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,479
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

247
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,559
No, wait. You don't understand.

248
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
I'm an actor.

249
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,359
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

250
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,559
And I stink!

251
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,640
You're in this picture?

252
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,309
I'm a cop who won't work with you
because you're a loose cannon.

253
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,159
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

254
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,229
But I stink.

255
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,919
Joey, right?

256
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,599
Every actor, one time or another--

257
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,320
Every actor thinks he stinks.

258
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,830
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

259
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.

260
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,599
You don't understand.

261
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,320
Listen to me.

262
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,520
I don't know one actor
worth his salt...

263
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:18,349
... who, one time in his career,
didn't say, "God, I stink! "

264
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:22,880
I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

265
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,320
The important thing,
and you must remember...

266
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,359
... no matter how badly
you think you stink...

267
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,479
... you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower!

268
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,880
Do you understand me?

269
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,039
-Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
-Wait a minute!

270
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,119
Take your pants.

271
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,830
We did okay
at the strip club, right?

272
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,549
Great. Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress is quitting...

273
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,719
... to teach the third grade!

274
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,359
He still hasn't called.

275
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,359
Who, Josh?

276
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,630
It's Joshua.

277
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,200
-He doesn't like "Josh"?
-No, I don't.

278
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:07,030
I'm going to put my sweats back on.

279
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,839
You know what?
You were right.

280
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,839
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?

281
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,119
Because we're girls.

282
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,239
You know what girls are good at?

283
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,640
Stripping!

284
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
No, listening!

285
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,520
Sit.

286
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,359
Maybe it would really, really help
if you would just talk.

287
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,400
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

288
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,469
And you know, if you want to cry,
that's okay too.

289
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,119
I'm going to have
to ask you all to leave.

290
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,920
Forget it. We tried,
but phase three is a lost cause.

291
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,520
Those strippers were hot, and I
couldn't picture myself with them.

292
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,390
They really were pretty,
weren't they?

293
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,959
-I liked that fighter pilot one.
-Candy?

294
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,280
She was so spunky!

295
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,520
I think if I were going
to be with a woman...

296
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,510
... it'd be with someone
like Michelle.

297
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,719
She was just so petite.

298
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,430
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

299
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,359
She had the smoothest skin.

300
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,189
When I stuck that dollar in
her G-string and grazed her thigh--

301
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,109
Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!

302
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,520
I am totally picturing you
with all those women!

303
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,880
That's not phase three.

304
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,150
Well, I'm there too!

305
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,280
Are we all together in a group?

306
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,520
Stop it, you're killing me!

307
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,520
I think I moved on to phase four!

308
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,439
What is that?

309
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,520
I don't want a relationship ever!

310
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:53,719
I just want sex
with strippers and my friends!

311
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,760
Come on.

312
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,959
Let me see that smile.

313
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,229
I don't want to.

314
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:02,949
Please?

315
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,949
I wanted to go to the strip club!

316
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,439
You'll have plenty of chances.

317
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,119
There are thousands of women out there,
just waiting to screw me over.

318
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,319
Yeah, all right.

319
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,760
How was vermont?

320
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,839
Emily is...

321
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,869
... incredible. There are
no words to describe her.

322
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,239
The whole weekend was like a dream.

323
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,719
And you! Rach!

324
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,160
You were so right.

325
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,319
What?

326
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,680
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

327
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,000
... where we could really
be happy for each other.

328
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,920
I admit, I wasn't quite there.

329
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,959
The thought of you
and that Josh guy--

330
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,119
Joshua.

331
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,069
--Joshua guy at that club,
dancing, having a good time.

332
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,920
And the thought of it kind of....

333
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,959
You know? But now!

334
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,839
But now, I'm totally there.

335
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,150
I'm finally where you are.

336
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,959
Thank goodness!

337
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,079
And thank you for Emily.

338
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,920
No problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

339
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,719
I'm happy for you.

340
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,880
Happy for you.

341
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,920
Oh no, happy for you.

342
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,910
All right. Here's what we'll do.

343
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,310
You are going to take off
my clothes.

344
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,719
You two, go get the oils.

345
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,959
And you, just constantly scream...

346
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,510
... "Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king! "

347
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,119
I want to be with her.
I like her.

348
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,199
That's fine.
Go with your instincts!

349
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,719
What am I doing again?

350
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,560
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.

351
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,119
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

352
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,079
That's not Joshua.

353
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,719
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

354
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:57,920
I'm sorry you can't stay.

355
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,319
The rest of us
have a lot of work to do.

356
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,319
What are you doing?

357
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,319
All right, listen.
I got to wake up.
