1
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,720
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,930
Joey?

3
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:44,729
Did I wake you?

4
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,889
The One with
All the Wedding Dresses

6
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,839
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

7
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:41,089
So what do you do when
you're not working here?

8
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,680
-You don't need to fill these silences.
-Okay, thanks.

9
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,769
That's your fourth cup of coffee.

10
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,569
I'm exhausted because
Joey started snoring.

11
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:54,809
He's in a different room.
He's that loud?

12
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,209
You should hear me.

13
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,050
It's nothing to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

14
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,650
I'm not going to any clinic.

15
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,360
I don't have a problem.
You have the problem.

16
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,479
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

17
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,520
-They don't have those.
-Yeah, they do.

18
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,770
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

19
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,449
There, you just had your first class.

20
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,479
I used to date a light sleeper.

21
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,850
Whenever I snored,
he rolled me over--

22
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,679
Oh, yeah!

23
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:30,369
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

24
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,169
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

25
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:37,490
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

26
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,449
Hey, guys.

27
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, the Olympics!

28
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,080
Have you picked a date?

29
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:50,250
No. Not yet.

30
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,720
I still cannot believe
you're engaged.

31
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,320
Because it's so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

32
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,279
Thanks.
Has anyone seen Rach?

33
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,410
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.

34
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,839
I won't do them this time.
Even if they sit there until....

35
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,520
I'll do them when I get home.

36
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:15,600
Emily found this
wedding dress in London--

37
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,639
Already?

38
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,929
But it didn't fit.

39
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,960
There's a store here
with one left in her size.

40
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,410
But the groom can't see--

41
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,410
-I'll pick it up for you.
-Thanks.

42
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,649
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses....

43
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,250
Wah-pah!

44
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:34,449
What's wah-pah?

45
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,600
You know. Whipped.

46
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,089
Wah-pah!

47
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,639
That's not whipped.

48
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,570
Whipped is....

49
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,199
That's what I did.

50
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,169
You can't do anything!

51
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:10,520
Hey, Mon.
I was just doing these dishes.

52
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,449
Do you have a minute?

53
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,440
I was just about to
take a break anyway.

54
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,519
So listen...

55
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:24,250
... I know we haven't had
a chance to talk...

56
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:27,239
... since Emily and I
decided to get married.

57
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:30,049
And I was just wondering
how you were.

58
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,049
If you were getting married,
I would feel kind of....

59
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:39,450
You know?

60
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,640
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know...

61
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,529
... I'm okay.

62
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,839
I just wanted to check.

63
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,049
That's sweet. Thank you.

64
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,640
You're great.

65
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,250
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

66
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:02,000
You just hang in there.

67
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,049
"Hang in there"?

68
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,929
No, I didn't mean....

69
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,329
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

70
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:17,160
I thought you had
just been on four dates.

71
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:20,119
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

72
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:23,239
Oh no, it has become.

73
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,929
Oh no, those were four great dates.

74
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,440
I mean, and the connection!

75
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:34,850
Emotionally, mentally.
You know?

76
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,760
Physically.

77
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,480
-That's incredible.
-I know, isn't it?

78
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,079
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

79
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:47,369
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

80
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,209
I gotta get back to my dishes.

81
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,730
I gotta get to work.

82
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,410
You know what would
make me happy?

83
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,250
You know, what's that?

84
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,239
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

85
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,649
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

86
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,290
Why don't we all
have dinner Sunday night?

87
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,250
That would be great!

88
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,089
All right. It's a date!

89
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,250
"Hang in there. "
You hang in there.

90
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,679
-Did you say something?
-No, just singing.

91
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,720
Oh, my God!

92
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,570
Look at this one!

93
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,369
It's so beautiful.

94
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,049
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

95
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,290
May I help you ladies?

96
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.

97
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,359
What's the name?

98
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,450
-Emily Waltham.
-Yes, I have it right here.

99
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,049
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

100
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:20,040
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

101
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,690
I am, aren't l?

102
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:25,720
Miss Waltham?

103
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,929
We're closing.

104
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,519
All right.

105
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,079
And could I get my ring back?

106
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,720
All right, buddy.
Time to roll over.

107
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,850
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

108
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,130
And a pajama store!

109
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,440
Does she use the cups?

110
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,730
Yes, I believe she does.

111
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,929
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

112
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:24,730
Thank you.

113
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,850
Thank you very much.

114
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,640
Thank you for coming.

115
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,849
-Just a second.
-No, no! Let me in!

116
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,440
Can you hold on a minute?

117
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,320
No! You have to
let me in right now!

118
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:46,890
Are you alone?

119
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,880
All right.

120
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,919
This sucks.

121
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,289
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

122
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,849
I'm so tired.

123
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,320
It's six o'clock.

124
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,479
I hear you and Joshua are
going out with Ross and Emily.

125
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,729
I think that's really cool.

126
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,080
I think you're handling
that really well.

127
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,159
"Handling it"?

128
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,599
There's nothing to handle.

129
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,039
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

130
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:30,010
They're not going to
get married anyway.

131
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,559
They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

132
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,409
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

133
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,280
One of them will realize
what they've done...

134
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:41,719
... and call it off.

135
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:45,239
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

136
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,400
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

137
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,890
Why not?

138
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,479
Weddings are a great place
to meet women.

139
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,239
When I dance,
I look like this.

140
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,090
Hey, man.

141
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,289
What are you doing
four weeks from today?

142
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,690
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

143
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,169
I am...

144
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,130
... free.

145
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,000
Because we're getting
married in a month.

146
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,409
In a month?

147
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,520
You mean 30 days?

148
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,840
From now?

149
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,489
That's great!

150
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,520
She always wanted to get married
where her parents did...

151
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:37,090
... but it's getting torn down.

152
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,960
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

153
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,849
... and it just feels right.

154
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,640
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

155
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,640
This isn't mine.

156
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,039
What's up?

157
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:14,719
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

158
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,080
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.

159
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,890
See you and hug you.

160
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,289
See you....

161
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,679
Great!

162
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,450
Sit.

163
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,880
You okay?

164
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:35,210
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

165
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,760
Want to know why?

166
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:40,849
Do l?

167
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:43,760
Because I am really happy about us.

168
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,000
I think we are so
on the right track.

169
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,250
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

170
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,450
-You know?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

171
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,239
We're clicking.

172
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,849
If there was just
one little area where...

173
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,849
... I think we need to work on,
I would think...

174
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,400
... it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

175
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,969
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

176
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,770
You know, yeah, you're right.

177
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,570
We have our fun. Yeah?

178
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:19,320
I mean, like crazy!
You know?

179
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:21,609
All right.

180
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,679
This is going to sound, you know,
a little hasty.

181
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,650
But just go with me.

182
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:35,330
What if we got married?

183
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,289
Oh, I know. It's so totally like...

184
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:44,450
... "Whoa, can we do this?"
You know?

185
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,849
But it just feels right.
Don't you think it does?

186
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:50,650
I mean, it just feels right.
Don't you...?

187
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:55,770
Rachel...

188
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,450
... you're...

189
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,640
... a real...

190
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,599
... special lady.

191
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,929
But my divorce isn't final yet...

192
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,239
... and we've been on four dates.

193
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,169
So I'm thinking: No...

194
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,479
... but...

195
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:16,880
... thanks.

196
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,760
You idiot!

197
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,090
-Your name, please?
-Joey Tribbiani.

198
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:32,049
Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

199
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,960
Sir?

200
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,359
Yes, he did.

201
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,530
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

202
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,289
Check out that girl.
She's really hot.

203
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,640
Yeah, she is.

204
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,250
How you doing?

205
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,969
-What?
-You're coming on to the entire room.

206
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,200
-I'm Chandler.
-I'm Marjorie.

207
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,159
-Do you mind if I sit?
-Please.

208
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:14,809
So what are you in for?

209
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,409
I talk in my sleep.

210
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,640
What a coincidence!
I listen in my sleep.

211
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,840
So why don't you give me your number?

212
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,440
Are you ready?

213
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,130
I got it! Mine!

214
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,520
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

215
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,809
My turn, my turn!

216
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,250
Okay, ready?

217
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,239
That was a terrible throw!

218
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:57,010
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

219
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,559
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

220
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,489
Oh, my God!

221
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,090
We're really sad, aren't we?

222
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,130
Yeah, I think we are.

223
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,400
This isn't even my dress.

224
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:21,450
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late. "

225
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,929
-I'm changing out of this.
-Me, too.

226
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,369
In half an hour?

227
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,520
Me, too.

228
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,450
All right, now throw it
straight this time.

229
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm getting married!

230
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,049
I hate my regular clothes now.

231
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,369
I look down and I know...

232
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,239
... this won't be the most
special day of my life.

233
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,890
I mean, it was kind of
fun for a while...

234
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,039
... but didn't you feel kind of silly?

235
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,450
I guess.

236
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,650
Oh, my God!

237
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,640
You're such a cheater!

238
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,929
Hello, little ones.

239
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,049
-So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
-Yep!

240
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,000
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

241
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,809
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, you know, she picked me.

242
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,530
How'd that happen?

243
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,650
Because I'm cooler.

244
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,890
No, seriously.

245
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,489
She's the kind of girl....
Joey was unconscious.

246
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,479
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?

247
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:40,609
Oh, my God!

248
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:41,770
What is that?

249
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,440
They gave it to me
at the sleep clinic...

250
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,250
... and it's going to help me
not to snore.

251
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,280
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

252
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:54,090
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

253
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,130
I know I don't have to.

254
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:58,250
It tastes good.

255
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,640
Plus, you look cool.

256
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,650
I just called Joshua.

257
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,089
How'd it go?

258
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,800
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

259
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,449
... some crazy girl who's
dying to get married.

260
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,329
And I'm going through
a hard time.

261
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,410
What'd he say?

262
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,130
His answering machine
was very understanding.

263
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,880
I feel blue.

264
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,689
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

265
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,689
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

266
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,650
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

267
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,489
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

268
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,479
But as it turns out...

269
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:50,719
... I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

270
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,119
Yeah, maybe.

271
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,119
And I'm just trying to
figure out why.

272
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:57,239
Any luck?

273
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:02,479
You know how Ross and I have
always been on again, off again?

274
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,569
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

275
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,640
... we would be on again.

276
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,050
Again.

277
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,560
You know what?
I think we all did.

278
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,079
I got us reservations
for Sunday night.

279
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,959
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

280
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,130
Well, you'd better make it for three.

281
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:34,050
I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at three.

282
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,170
Three people.

283
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,520
Joshua's not going to be there.

284
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:41,770
What happened?

285
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,290
Well, I think he broke up with me.

286
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,400
No. Why?

287
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,329
Apparently, he scares easy.

288
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,800
Rachel, I'm sorry.

289
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,250
It's okay.

290
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,410
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

291
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,239
Come here.

292
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,449
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?

293
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,479
Are you okay?

294
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,329
I got my girls.

295
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:40,439
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

296
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,359
What?

297
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,689
I got to tell you...

298
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,689
... this really does put me
in a better mood.

299
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,839
I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

300
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,719
Maybe someday there will be.

301
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,489
Chandler's coming by to borrow
candles for his big date.

302
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:07,410
Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

303
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,520
The groom cannot see the bride.

304
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,530
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

305
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,770
Not after this!

306
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,489
Okay guys, just relax.

307
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,520
I do!

308
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,239
I got to go.

309
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,319
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

310
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:44,079
Food's here. Fair enough.

311
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,439
Fifteen-minute warning.

312
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,880
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
