00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,600
Thank you guys for having this over.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,300
Oh~yeah. This is fun couple's night.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,200
Yeah. I don't know why we don't hang out with married couples more often.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Well because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,400
You mean that Portuguese couple. Yeah. Like you wouldn't have done it.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,900
Hey you guys. I have great news.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Ross. We're kind of in the middle of dinner here.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Oh well..I already ate but...sure.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,500
Guess what happened at work today?

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,600
A dinosaur died a million years ago.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Try 65 million years ago and then try shee~~

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,500
Wow~

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah. Do you have idea what this means in academic circles, huh? I am gonna get laid.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,100
-Hi you guys.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,500
Ooh <tow ya>

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,700
No..No one want a second's, right?

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,900
No..I..I am good.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,300
Hey you guys never gonna believe it?

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,000
This headhunter called me I have a meeting tomorrow with Goochie.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
Goochie wants me!

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,000
I am a <fore->tenure.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,600
-Congratulations.
-You too. What are the odds!

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh~

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
Guess what?

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,500
I don't know who I am happiest for?

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I do. He's been working on that all day!

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,200
"So no one told you life was gonna be this way"

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,100
"Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA."

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,600
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear"

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,700
"When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year"

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,500
"I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour"

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,300
"I'll be there for you like I've been there before"

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,100
"I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too"

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Hey Mon, was it weird changing your name to Gather Bing?

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,100
-No..no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
-Oh

38
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,500
Where did you go to do it?

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Em..The..the ministry of names..bureau.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,400
You never did it!

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm sorry. Just the idea of being an official Bing.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,700
Hey I would have you known that..ah..who I'm kidding.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Let's call it kid Gather and that Bing die with me.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
-<?>
-Thanks

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Honey, would you want me to take your name?

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh~ It's up to you. It's your name. You got a liberty.

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hunigen.

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,800
Mrs. Hunigen.

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
What? Can you see I'm in the middle of something?

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,500
Oh I like it.

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Hey guys!

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Hey Joe.

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,800
we got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You wanna come with us?

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
No, thank you.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,900
You're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,600
Yeah. Come with us, you'll see it's close to the city.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,400
No, it's not close.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,400
You said it was in <S grow>.I can't even find out on the map.

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Joey, please come. You mean so much to us.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You know what, you're my friends. I wanna be supportive. I will come with you, <shut gun>?

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,300
Dammit.

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,400
-See you guys later.
-OK

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,400
-We'll pick you up at 11. So glad you're coming.
-All right

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Good for you. That was really mature.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
What? No. The only reason I am going to that stupid new house is that

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,500
I can point out everything that's wrong with it so they dont move.

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,600
I am gonna make them stay here.

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Your strength kind of grown up.

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,300
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't wanna do.

70
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,800
Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's..he is..

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
O..oh He..hey

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
We not talk about that now.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
All right. Pooh?

74
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Look. Monica and Chandler really love this house. You're not gonna talk them into staying here.

75
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,600
Hey hey. I can't convince people to do anything, you know.

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I bet I can even get Mike to do that thing. What is it?

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,100
I AM NOT gonna help you do that! Oh my..

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Hi. Em..I'm here to see Mr. Canbo with Goochie.

79
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,400
The reservation is probably under Goochie.

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
It..it's spelled like Gucky which can be confusing!

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Mr. Canbo is not here yet. Let me show you to his table.

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh my god. That's my boss. You have to set this somewhere else.

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry. This's always Mr. Canbo's table.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,800
But my boss can not see me. I'm interviewing for another job.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I know, with Gucky.

86
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,900
Rachel?

87
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,400
Hah, Monodates!

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
That's great.

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,100
Yeah it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough single mam career.

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,200
You've got to get out there.

91
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Well you got a..good energy.

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,900
Ah..oh

93
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,200

94
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200

So..your resume is quite impressive.

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,100
My resume..

102
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I wouldn't..I wouldn't call my own night dating profile a resume.

103
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,600
Dating profile. I'm talking about the work resume..

104
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,600
La la...

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Whatever happen to, just singing for no reason.

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Maybe people found it weird.

107
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,200
Maybe

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,200
So..why do you wanna leave Rof Lauren?

109
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,100
What? I..I don't.

110
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,600
You don't?

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
No. I lo..love it there.

112
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,000
If you don't wanna leave, why are we having this lunch?

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,500
--That is my boss--

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,400
What?

115
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,000
--That is my boss--

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's <hugo> boss?

117
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,900
This place is so depressing. I had to work here I'd kill myself.

118
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,000
You obviously haven't.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How can I help you?

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Em..I need to change my name please. I need to change it because I'm hiding from the law.

121
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,400
You're fine.

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
-Please fill out this form.
-OK

123
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
I just saw I don't know how it work exactly.

124
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,300
See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hunegen.

125
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,500
So is it supposed to be Buffay Hunegen or Hunegen Buffay?

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,400
It can be anything you want?

127
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,700
Wa.not anything? I mean.

128
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah..anything

129
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Oh..this could take a while.

130
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Get out of <> line.

131
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Hey.

132
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,900
-Hey Phoebs.
-Oh not any more.

133
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,500
I changed it today.

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh I'm sorry. Mrs. Hunegen.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Wrong again.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Apparently You can change it to anything you want so I thought..

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,500
here's an opportunity to be creative.

138
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
So Mit Princess Conswellis Bannanahammic.

139
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
That's we're gonna name the baby.

140
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,900
-Phoeby
-Not. Princess Conswellis.

141
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,400
-You seriously changed your name to that?
-Uh-huh.

142
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,500
Ok. So from now on we have to call you Princess Conswellis.

143
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I know. I'm gonna have my friends call me <Vetory>.

144
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Hey how did the interview go?

145
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Not good.

146
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You know, I always feel that way afternoon. I'll bet one better than you think.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Well, I didn't get the job at Goochie and got fired from Rof Laren.

148
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,700
That is bad interview.

149
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,800
What're you..what're you talking about? How this happen?

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
where I was having my interview and he heard everything.

152
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,500
So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna let me go

153
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,400
because I'm not a teamplayer.

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,300
And I say "Wait a minute. No. Yes I'm".

155
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,200
And then I have to sit there for 45 minutes

156
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
while he proved that in fact..was true.

157
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,500
Oh god. I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Hey, Wa..wo..W..what's this?

159
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
It's..it's a bottle of champagne!

160
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
Why is this here?

161
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,800
Ross?

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I guess it's here because I got TENURE!

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Congratulations.

164
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,300
This a single greatest day of my professional career.

165
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
Gunther, 6 glasses.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Six? You want me to drink?

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.

168
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,900
Ah..I'm gonna have a <loogy> in my coffee tomorrow.

169
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Ooh..It's really champagne. And it's vanilla.

170
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,200
I got tenure and I didn't win the lottery.

171
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Hey Rach. So..How did your thing go?

172
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh..good. Yeah..but I'm not gonna hear about that for a couple of days.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,100
Oh you know what, you're gonna get it. I..I can feel it.

174
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Can you?

175
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,600
Honey here's to Ross.

176
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
And..and to years of hard work finally paid off.

177
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,400
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
But also knowing it means A LOT.

179
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,800
But more importantly to full well-rounded lifes.

180
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,200
That center around work.

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
To ross.

182
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
You know the best about this is? I can't never be fired.

183
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,200
No seriously. I have job security for life, you know.

184
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,700
I mean I never have to worry.

185
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Oh..oh look at you. Look..how happy you're for me.

186
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,300
No, it's not that. I got fired today and I didn't get the other job.

187
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,100
Rachel I'm so sorry.

188
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Oh~

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,300
Great. I feel like an idiot.

190
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,300
-No, it's OK. You didn't know.
-Oh

191
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Little <heads up> would have been nice.

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,900
Thank you for let him see the house again.

193
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,800
And thank you for explaining 'U..' means.

194
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,200
I already forgot what you said. But thank you.

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Take as loog as you want. Just let me when you're through.

196
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,300
So glad you decided to come.

197
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,200
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. So happy for your guys.

198
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Although you know I hope you like fungus.

199
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,100
What?

200
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,700
Fungus. Yeah place is full of it.

201
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,500
No, it's not. We had an inspection and I didn't find anything.

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,400
OK

203
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,500
And I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.

204
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Maybe it's because you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole right here.

205
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Maybe.

206
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,100
So this is the living room huh? Oof, it's pretty dark.

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
-No it's not.
-Are you kidding. I think I just saw a bat at corner.

208
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,400
When you head was hanging out of the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

209
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe.

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,900
I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know,

211
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,400
or any other house for that matter.

212
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Oh Joey. We know you're having a hard time with this but we really..we love it here.

213
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,700
Fine. OK. If you love this house so much then you should live here, OK?

214
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,700
I just hope you get used to that weird hemming sound.

215
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Joey, we know that's you.

216
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,300
No. It's not.

217
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
-Hey
-Hey

218
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,800
Welcome back.

219
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
-I missed you.
-Oh Me too.

220
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,900
So what's new?

221
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,300
Well I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.

222
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,800
That's great. You changed your name?

223
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes I did. Mit Princess Conswellis Bannanahammic.

224
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
You're kidding, right?

225
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
Nope.

226
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,900
You really did that?

227
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
Yep.

228
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
You..you can't do that.

229
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Why? Why? It's fun. It's different. No one else has a name like it.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,900
All right. Then I'm gonna change my name.

231
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,600
Great. OK, what you're gonna change it to?

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,500
Crap Bag.

233
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Mike Crap Bag?

234
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,100
No. No mike. No. Just Crap Bag. First name Crap last name Bag.

235
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,500
You're not serious, right?

236
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah I'm serious. It's fun. It's different. No one else has a name like that.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
Uh-huh.

238
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,800
Well then great. If you love it, I love it.

239
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,100
I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Conswellis.

240
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,100
And I love Crap.

241
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Ou..

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,100
Who are you?

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house? Who are you?

244
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I am Merchanzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I hate my parents.

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I hate my friends.

247
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,700
Look, there's gotta be a way that we can't stop this from happening.

248
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,600
Like what?

249
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Oh..OK.

250
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,300
You come with me and you tell them that the house is haunted.

251
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,300
What are you eight?

252
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,700
Ok. Let's show your great idea.

253
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,700
I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.

254
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,400
It gotta be a way. I mean, you know, Monica and Chandler move out here

255
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,300
and now Phoebe is married to Mike.

256
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
That just leaves me and Ross and Rachel, you know what that mean?

257
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,900
I really don't.

258
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,000
What I can do? I feel like I'm losing my friends.

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,800
My parents say I may make new friends.

260
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh yeah, sure, easy for you. You're younger than me. I am sadden my ways.

261
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
This's what my mon always talking about: Whiners's winners.

262
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Look. You want your friends to be happy, right?

263
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Yeah..yeah. I guess yeah.

264
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Well moving here is gonna make them happy. Don't you want them to do it?

265
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah. Maybe.

266
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Then you gotta let them go.

267
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,300
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right.

268
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
How did you get to speak so smart?

269
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,600
I read a lot.

270
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Just what I thought we could be friends.

271
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Oh, here, Rach. Just heard it. I'm so sorry.

272
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Oh thank you.

273
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
Still don't know my name, do you?

274
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Now I don't have to.

275
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Ross, what is taking you so long?

276
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,300
I'm sorry. It's almost says if this wasn't built for quick get-away.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,900
Rachel?

278
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,800
Mark? Oh my god.

279
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,400
-How have you been?
-Fantastic!

280
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,000
-You remember Ross?
-Sure sure.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
What's with the chair?

282
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Uh..you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway so...

283
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Clever.

284
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,100
So..so how are you?

285
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,000
Ah..You're not catching me on my best day.

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Yeah box full of your desk stuff does exact <tippy> promotion.

287
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,300
No, but it's good, you know. I'm gonna take some time off..

288
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,100
some charity work.

289
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you sure? Because we may have something <I really need>to talk.

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,100
<Of school> charity work, what you got?

291
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,200
Why do we have a dinner and talk about it?

292
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,000
-Great
-Great

293
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
-I'll call you.
-Ok

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah..yeah I got tenure.

295
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,500
Oh my god.

296
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,000
So see, I told you some good would come along.

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,200
And he seemed really nice. I..I have met him before?

298
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Ross, that's Mark.

299
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,400
<>Bloomingdales, you were insanely jealous of him.

300
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,400
That is Mark. I hate that guy.

301
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,700
No..no. You can not go to dinner with him.

302
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,600
What? You don't want me to get a job?

303
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh yeah. I'm suer he is gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his sex rettery.

304
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,600
I am serious. I just don't trust that guy. OK?

305
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Ross, you know what? Ok, let's talk about later. There comes security.

306
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Oh I love this street. The trees, the big front yards.

307
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,400
That actual picket fences.

308
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Man, those two dogs are going at it!

309
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,900
Hey.

310
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,100
Hey, where have been?

311
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, Just..you know looking around. But you know what,

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
this house is great.

313
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,200
Really, what changed your mind?

314
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,200
The little girl who lives here maybe feel a lot better about the whole thing.

315
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here but she died like 30 years ago.

316
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
What?

317
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,000
Huh~I'm just messing with you.

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's not funny. You know I'm afraid of little girl ghost.

319
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Joey, now you're OK with the house, you wanna go see your room?

320
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,700
What? I get my own room.

321
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,700
You don't think we buy a house not have a Joey room, do you?

322
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Oh my god.

323
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Can I have an <equip room> and a sex wing?

324
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
No.

325
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

326
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,500
After you, Mrs. Banana Hunick.

327
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

328
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,800
-Oh, hey how are you?
-Ah, hi Oreeda.

329
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Oreeda is a massage client.

330
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
-Yeah.
-Oh

331
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Why don't you introduce me?

332
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,200
Oreeder, this my husband.

333
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,700
I want you to tell her my name.

334
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,000
Ok, I will.

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is..this is my husband..Crap Bag.

336
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,500
Crap Bag.

337
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.

338
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,300
OK. Execuse me.

339
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Ok, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be my Ha again?

340
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,700
Only if you would be Phoebe Buffay.

341
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,800
How about Buffay Henegen?

342
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Really?

343
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah, I'm Phoebe Buffay Hanigen Bannanahammic.

344
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,300
Do you even know what a bannanahammic is?

345
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,900
It's a funny word.

346
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,900
It's a speedo.

347
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, crap.

348
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,000
Hey, is Rachel here?

349
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,300
Nope.

350
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,200
She's still at dinner?

351
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
I guess. who's she with?

352
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,100
That guy Mark from Bloomingdales.

353
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
She think he's just been nice to her, but I know he really want to sleep with her.

354
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
It's 7 years ago. My time machine works!

355
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,600
We went into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her,

356
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,300
but I know he just <????> pants.

357
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,300
So why don't he want to sleep with her? I mean, she is single and he is cute.

358
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,700
Execuse me?

359
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Oh please. Yesterday on the subway you couldn't stop staring at that woman with a big breast the whole time.

360
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.

361
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh sorry.

362
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,300
Hi you guys.

363
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,900
Hi. So..how was dinner?

364
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh it was great. Mark is so sweet.

365
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Oh yeah yeah. I wonder why. What could that <s..> possibly want?

366
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh Ross. Come on.

367
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,400
He is happily married. His wife just had twins.

368
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Should we send something?

369
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,400
How did the job stuff go?

370
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,800
He offered me one.

371
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,700
-That's great!
-Congratulations

372
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,400
I know it's amazing. It's amazing.

373
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
It's so much better than what I had at Rof Lauren.

374
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,700
The money is Great.

375
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,200
Can we..can we just stop for a second.

376
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Who said something better would come along, huh?

377
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,800
You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.

378
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
You know what, this calls for a bottle of <Thiesr Finalist>.

379
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,700
The job is in Paris.

380
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,100
I mean the soap opera is a great <gig>,

381
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
but..am I missing opportunities?

382
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
You know I always thought of myself as a serious actor.

383
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,600
I mea..should I be trying to do more independent movies?

384
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,900
I don't know.

385
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,900
You know what, I'm gonna put you off my bear. Hold on.

386
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
