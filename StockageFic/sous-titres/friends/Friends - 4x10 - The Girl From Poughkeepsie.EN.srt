1
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,779
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,579
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,899
Fifteen?

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,979
Your personal best!

5
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:20,020
Where were you?

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,059
On a date.

7
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:23,819
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,819
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,020
No. Answer his.

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,020
We were at the back of the train.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,419
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

12
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:39,450
... if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,819
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,939
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,419
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie?

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,810
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

18
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,619
Done! I did it.

19
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,220
Who's stupid now?

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,540
The One with the
Girl From Poughkeepsie

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,849
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,019
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,139
That paper is two weeks old.

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,620
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

25
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:04,699
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

26
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,900
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,220
I hate being alone
this time of year.

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,500
Next it's valentine's Day...

29
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,580
... then my birthday, then bang!

30
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,419
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,020
I want somebody!

32
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,500
You know, I want a man!

33
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:35,179
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,460
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

35
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,490
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,009
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

37
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:53,220
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

38
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,660
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

39
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:00,419
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

40
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:05,100
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

41
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,889
No accountants.

42
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:12,419
And no one from "Iegal. "
I don't like boring jobs.

43
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,050
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,339
What's wrong, Mon?

45
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,850
Everybody at work still hates me.

46
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,179
I was making headway.

47
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:28,460
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

48
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,740
... and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,220
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch. "

50
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,419
What's the matter?

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,059
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

52
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,220
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,020
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

54
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,649
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

55
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,779
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

56
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,660
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

57
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,299
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,859
You know what you can do?

59
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,179
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

60
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:26,250
... who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

61
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,059
Then they would all know who was boss.

62
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

63
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,690
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

64
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,619
Good enough to get fired.

65
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:42,299
All right. You're hired!

66
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,489
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

67
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,059
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

68
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm not asking for me.

69
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,010
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

70
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm not gay.

71
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,140
I didn't think you were gay.

72
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,820
I do now.

73
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,980
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

74
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,649
I just got out of
a big relationship.

75
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,739
I'm not looking to get serious.

76
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,179
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

77
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,579
Is this "Hot Rachel" that
you took to the Christmas Party?

78
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,209
By the way, that is her full name.

79
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,459
Wow! I'm free for her.

80
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,019
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

81
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,940
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,220
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

83
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,779
I'll bring them
by your office at five.

84
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,660
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

85
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,609
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

86
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:05,609
I don't know what that is,
but let's!

87
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,140
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,339
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

89
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:28,299
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

90
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,260
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,619
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

92
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,660
Pheebs, that's great!

93
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,609
But you know,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

94
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,500
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

95
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,859
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

96
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,220
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

97
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,820
Maypole.

98
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,820
All good. Thanks.

99
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,019
Do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

100
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,410
Didn't your dad used to call you
"Pumpkin"?

101
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,059
But did he ever call you
"Budolph"?

102
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,019
Hello, children.

103
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,579
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

104
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,220
I showed them your picture.

105
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,299
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

106
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,220
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?

107
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,260
Wherever! I've got 20.

108
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,220
Will I like any of these guys?

109
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,260
You know, I'm going to...

110
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,820
... play the field a little bit more.

111
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:44,019
Guys are signing over
their 401Ks to me.

112
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,209
You work with robots?

113
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:58,059
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

114
00:07:58,299 --> 00:07:59,940
I like swimmers' bodies.

115
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,820
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

116
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,570
I like credit cards!

117
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,660
I'm not bad at this!

118
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,339
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.

119
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:14,820
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company....

120
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,980
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

121
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:22,619
No, the robots just work for them.

122
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:25,820
All right, I'm going to work.

123
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,260
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

124
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Yeah, lady. I do!

125
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:31,730
I got a problem!

126
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,979
I'll give you a problem!

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,179
What will you do?
Fire me?

128
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,739
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

129
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,619
See you later.

130
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,250
I should go.
I've got a date.

131
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,619
With who?

132
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,739
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

133
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,210
Not her.

134
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,659
This is someone else.

135
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,260
I can't decide between the two.

136
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,739
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

137
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,289
... really smart and a lot of fun.

138
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,340
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

139
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,570
She's just as pretty.

140
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,619
I guess she's smart.

141
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,940
She's not fun.

142
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,460
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,250
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

144
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,940
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

145
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,099
... if she was kidding,
was very funny.

146
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,130
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

147
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:47,059
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

148
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,020
Damn!

149
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,219
What happened to your fancy jacket?

150
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,020
They baked it.

151
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:02,489
I can't take this anymore.

152
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,299
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it.

153
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,219
What are you doing?

154
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:10,020
You're still on fire there.

155
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,419
I think you got it!

156
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,059
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

157
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,219
Like father, like son.

158
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,979
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

159
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,419
This could, maybe, get serious.

160
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:34,460
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

161
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,219
Well, you know, possibly.

162
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,739
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

163
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:50,250
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

164
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,659
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?

165
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,049
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl--

166
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,219
I see.

167
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:01,020
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

168
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,020
... he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

169
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,219
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

170
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:13,940
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

171
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,419
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

172
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,450
Hey, Dragon!

173
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,619
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

174
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,419
There's $300 in this one.

175
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,020
People get generous
around the holidays.

176
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:32,460
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

177
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,619
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

178
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:41,570
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish--

179
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,700
Why is nobody writing these?

180
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,210
We can remember them.

181
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,419
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

182
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:52,219
Sure, that too.

183
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,780
Forget the specials for a minute.
Here's the thing....

184
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,219
For the last two weeks I have...

185
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:05,820
... tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

186
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,419
Can't hear you!

187
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,099
Positive atmosphere.

188
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,820
But I've had it up to here.

189
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,299
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

190
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,020
... or the highway. All right?

191
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,619
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

192
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,419
Hey, new guy.

193
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:41,690
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

194
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,700
No, ma'am.

195
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,770
He has a name. It's Dragon.

196
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:53,340
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

197
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,820
We did the hat, right?

198
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,859
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.

199
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,380
I was going to do it.

200
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,049
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

201
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:11,500
... and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

202
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,010
... it's been a long time since I had...

203
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,940
... $327 plus $238!

204
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,820
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

205
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:25,419
And I got to pay rent!

206
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,380
How about you don't fire me.

207
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:32,140
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

208
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,539
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

209
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,049
What nice things?

210
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,609
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

211
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,770
Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica
Merry, merry--

212
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,900
You know what, Pheebs?

213
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,780
I'm not Jewish so....

214
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,260
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

215
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,460
... but he's not complaining.

216
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,820
Bad dream?

217
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,570
I wasn't sleeping.

218
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,179
What was Phoebe's song about?

219
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,099
It's the one with the cat.

220
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,539
I got to go.
I've got another date.

221
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,380
Did you pick one yet?

222
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,409
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

223
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:25,609
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

224
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,020
So I'm still torn.

225
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,179
You don't like the one from uptown.

226
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,059
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

227
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,059
Just end them both!

228
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,859
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

229
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,820
Then break up with uptown.

230
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,539
By the time you get home,
you're done!

231
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:45,659
You're right. Thank you.

232
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,820
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

233
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,739
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.

234
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,020
Patrick just ended things with me.

235
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,099
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

236
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,299
I did! I absolutely did!

237
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,219
You idiot!

238
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,619
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

239
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:26,539
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

240
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,659
Now you scared him away!

241
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,700
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

242
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,859
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

243
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,219
I know, I know!

244
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,380
Now I'm right back where I started.

245
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,059
This sucks!

246
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,219
Being alone sucks!

247
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,739
You'll meet somebody.

248
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,780
You're a great catch!

249
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,619
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

250
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,219
Really?

251
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,820
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

252
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,820
It doesn't matter.

253
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,219
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

254
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,169
Cute guys in little shorts?

255
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,609
Sure.

256
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

257
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,010
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

258
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,219
Have you ever been with a woman?

259
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,140
What is the matter with you?

260
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,820
There is no good time
to ask that question.

261
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:45,780
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

262
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,219
Ross?

263
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,020
Wake up!

264
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,219
I need more swordfish.

265
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,780
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.

266
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,819
You just did.

267
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,410
I don't know what to tell you.

268
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,020
Fine.

269
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,219
very funny.

270
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,579
Let me out, please.

271
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Come on, I'm cold!

272
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,060
And covered in marinara sauce!

273
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,579
Let me out!

274
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,810
You found that handle, did you?

275
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,540
-It's not funny.
-Well, that's not true.

276
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:53,819
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

277
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,979
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

278
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,780
If you want me
to quit this bad then--

279
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:02,819
Chef Geller?

280
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,459
You know that speech you made?

281
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,819
I got a problem with it!

282
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,500
-You do?
-You bet I do!

283
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,930
I just wasn't listening then,
that's all.

284
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,260
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

285
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,290
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

286
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,849
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

287
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,219
Get out!

288
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,500
All right.

289
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,260
Anybody else got a problem?

290
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,420
How about you, chuckles?

291
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,020
You think this is funny now?

292
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:48,900
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

293
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,540
No, it's really good.

294
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:55,380
Take those salads to table four.

295
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,300
And you, get the swordfish!

296
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,900
And you!

297
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,819
Get a haircut!

298
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:08,209
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

299
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,420
What?

300
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,819
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

301
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,410
Now that I see them, I win!

302
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,739
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

303
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,459
Are we really in Montreal?

304
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:37,979
Yes, we are.

305
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:39,660
So coffee?

306
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,219
Coffee sounds great.

307
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,010
Wait.

308
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,099
So you live in Montreal?

309
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,819
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

310
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,660
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

311
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,099
... before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

312
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,699
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

313
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,020
Enough!

314
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,819
Lean, lean, lean!

315
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:21,859
Went to the store
Sat on Santa 's lap

316
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:25,099
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

317
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,859
Said all you need is
To write them a song

318
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,859
Now you haven 't heard it yet
So don 't try to sing along

319
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,010
No, don 't sing along

320
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,300
Monica, Monica

321
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,619
Have a happy Hannukah

322
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:47,339
Saw Santa Claus

323
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,859
He said hello to Ross

324
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,739
And please tell Joey

325
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,140
Christmas will be snowy

326
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,459
And Rachel and Chandler

327
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,609
Happy holidays, everybody!
