1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:10,048
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

2
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:13,968
You did the windows!
l have been begging for months!

3
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:19,048
-And nagging works!
-No, l didn't actually do this.

4
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,848
Oh, no. Was l cleaning
in my sleep again?

5
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:24,481
No, it wasn't you.

6
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:28,242
-Well, then, who?
-l got a maid. Yay!

7
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:34,126
l hope you mean ''mistress,'' because
if some other woman was cleaning--

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,723
l know you don't like
to relinquish control.

9
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:41,249
''Relinquish'' is just a fancy word
for ''lose. ''

10
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:47,648
She's nice, and she mentioned that she
adored how you arranged the sponges.

11
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:49,885
Did she really say that?

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,648
Yes, l distinctly remember.
l thought it was a joke.

13
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,846
-Now, just give her a chance, okay?
-Fine, l can do it.

14
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:04,448
-What's the matter?
-Usually when l'm anxious, l clean.

15
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:07,364
The One With the Stain

16
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:48,892
Whose cell phone is that?
lt's so annoying.

17
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,846
l think it's coming from your bag.

18
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:56,452
l never get calls!

19
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:58,251
Hello?

20
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:04,369
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiancé.

21
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:08,009
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
How'd you get this number?

22
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:11,285
l have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it.

23
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:16,362
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

24
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,531
You should know
l broke up with Ursula.

25
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:22,372
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

26
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:25,849
-What did he do?
-Shh! l'm talking!

27
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:32,769
Anyway, l was wondering if you were
the sort of person who eats lunch?

28
00:02:32,973 --> 00:02:35,441
Are you asking me out?

29
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:39,971
Because it'd be weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

30
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:44,689
Yeah, okay. l'm sorry. Bye.

31
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:48,647
Wait! l said that so you'd think
l was a good person!

32
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:51,644
Fight for me!

33
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:55,448
l won't take ''no'' for an answer.

34
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,087
Not great, we can work on it.

35
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:01,444
<i>I can be at your apartment</i>
<i>in two hours.</i>

36
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,962
How do you know where l live?

37
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:06,641
l've got friends too.

38
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,047
Okay, bye.

39
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:11,213
Oh, my God, l'm going out with Eric!

40
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:15,884
This day is gonna be much better
than l thought it was gonna be.

41
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,852
Oh, Ross, l can't make lunch.

42
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,166
So apparently l'm available
for lunch.

43
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,887
l can't. l'm apartment hunting.

44
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:28,526
You're moving?

45
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:31,645
l can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

46
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:36,409
l don't want my child's first words
to be, ''How you doin'?''

47
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,164
Does Joey know you're moving?

48
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,171
We haven't discussed it,
but he'll be relieved.

49
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:47,089
He brought this girl over,
and l talked about morning sickness.

50
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,563
l showed her my pregnancy book.

51
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:53,243
-That's not really porn?
-Not so much.

52
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:59,329
l heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

53
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:05,244
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

54
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,851
How great would that be?
You living in my building?

55
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:13,927
l could take care of the baby,
come over whenever l want. . .

56
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,612
. . .with your permission.

57
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,647
That really would be great.
Well, can we see it?

58
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,283
Maybe we shouldn't.
lf she just died this morning.

59
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:26,690
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

60
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,648
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

61
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,366
Yes?

62
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,451
Hi. l'm Ross Geller.
l live in the building.

63
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:49,050
And l'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

64
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:55,245
l heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and l am so sorry for your loss.

65
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,603
-She didn't pass away.
-What?

66
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:02,250
-My mother's still alive.
-Oh, thank God!

67
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:08,645
lt looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's tough.

68
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:10,445
Are you close with her?

69
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:15,050
Of course. She and l would
talk all the time. . .

70
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:18,325
. . .in the laundry room.

71
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,047
You speak Dutch?

72
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,842
l would, but it's just too painful.

73
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,647
So she's really not dead.

74
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:38,050
No. She's hanging in there.

75
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:43,930
Could you tell me, is she hanging in
in a one-bedroom or a two?

76
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,246
This tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

77
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:54,490
Oh, well. . . .
l make it myself.

78
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:59,687
lt's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient--

79
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,851
You know what? We just met.

80
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:06,887
Okay. l'm gonna get the clothes
from the laundry room. . .

81
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,567
. . .then l'll clean behind the fridge.

82
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,367
l love her!

83
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,448
l'll be back in a minute.

84
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:18,130
Okay.

85
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:22,645
-See? l told you.
-She stole my jeans!

86
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,845
What?

87
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,052
l've been looking
for them all week!

88
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:33,644
So she stole your pants,
and then came back and wore them?

89
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:37,641
Don't you see?
lt's the perfect crime!

90
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:40,805
She must have been
planning this for years!

91
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,241
l'll prove it.

92
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:47,362
l dropped a pen in my lap, and it left
an ink stain on the crotch.

93
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:52,044
When she comes back, l will find it
and show you that stain!

94
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:59,650
ls it possible the company that sold
the jeans made more than one pair?

95
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,002
l guess.

96
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:07,049
Shouldn't we give her the benefit of
the doubt before we search her crotch?

97
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,687
Fine. l'm glad l didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

98
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:15,528
By the way,
what is your secret ingredient?

99
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:24,648
-Hi.
-Come in. l'm so glad you're here.

100
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:25,842
Yeah. Me too.

101
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:29,284
Not in the shaky, angry way
you are, though.

102
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,572
Sorry. l just saw Ursula.
l got the engagement ring back.

103
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,924
Just seeing her brought it all back.

104
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:40,370
All the lies, the way she used me.

105
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:44,686
l just-- l get so angry,
just looking at her--

106
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:52,242
-Face.
-Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:57,449
l'm sorry. lt's just,
when l look at you. . .

108
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,649
. . .l see her.

109
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:05,253
And when l see her,
l get a little bit angry.

110
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,608
-Maybe this is too weird.
-Wait.

111
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:14,250
There's only a problem
when l look at you.

112
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,242
l got it. l got it.

113
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:20,412
No, don't tear out your eyes!

114
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:25,084
-l was just gonna take out my lenses.
-Oh, yeah. Try that.

115
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,648
So, is that better?

116
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,844
Not really.

117
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:39,248
You're blurry, but you still
look like Ursula. You're ''Blursula. ''

118
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,845
Okay, wait. Maybe. . . .

119
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:49,242
lf l just don't look at you
for a while.

120
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:56,650
See? lt works. l'm not angry at
all anymore. This is a great date!

121
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,245
Look, Eric, turn around.

122
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:05,971
l like you, but it shouldn't be
this hard. lt's our first date.

123
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,444
lt's supposed to be
about excitement and. . .

124
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:14,966
. . . ''He touched my hand,
did he mean to?'' and first kisses. . . .

125
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,242
Second kisses. . . .

126
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:25,244
Thanks for the coffee, or:

127
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,647
Yeah, we're done.

128
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:49,047
Hey, Ross. You wanna go see
that new lMAX movie on tide pools?

129
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:51,244
-Really?
-No.

130
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,846
But l got Knicks tickets for us.

131
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,442
-Sweet!
-All right, let's go.

132
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,490
l have to stop by my place.

133
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:05,847
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

134
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,851
l have to see if this apartment
is available.

135
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,329
-You're switching apartments?
-lt's for Rachel.

136
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,491
-She has an apartment.
-She's gonna move.

137
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:17,604
-She is?
-Yeah.

138
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:21,169
You didn't expect her
to live there with the baby?

139
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,887
l didn't really think about it.

140
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:32,128
Hey, Gunther, you're an <i>ezel</i>!

141
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,443
Damn it!

142
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,567
-Nice jeans.
-Oh, thanks.

143
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:48,051
-l like your top.
-Oh. You're not getting it.

144
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:59,045
-What happened?
-Oh. l fell asleep!

145
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:02,611
l was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

146
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:07,489
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll work up your appetite.

147
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,451
All right.

148
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,449
Hello.

149
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,527
What's going on?

150
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:40,443
l'm sorry. l've never had a maid
before. ls this not okay?

151
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:52,804
-How was the game?
-lt was okay. l ate way too much.

152
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:59,369
Ross said you were looking
for a new place.

153
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:04,931
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
lf certain Dutch people would let go.

154
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,252
l was kind of hoping you'd stay.

155
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:13,049
Joey, l have to go.
There's no room for a baby.

156
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:17,650
No room? lt's a baby.
lt's, like, this big.

157
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:21,732
You could put it over here.

158
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,931
Or we could put it right here.
Cute, right?

159
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,449
Or over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

160
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,850
''Where's the baby?''
''Oh, it's right over. . . . ''

161
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:36,168
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

162
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,644
A baby changes things.
They cry all the time.

163
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:44,449
lmagine bringing home a girl,
trying to score with a screaming baby.

164
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:48,043
l could use a challenge.
lt's getting pretty easy.

165
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:51,848
lt's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but l can't.

166
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:55,045
lt would disrupt your entire life.

167
00:12:55,413 --> 00:13:00,441
lt's just--
l love living with you so much.

168
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:04,612
-l wish things didn't have to change.
-l know.

169
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,646
You know, l blame Ross for this.

170
00:13:08,893 --> 00:13:11,043
l do too, a little bit.

171
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,483
l'm gonna miss you.

172
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,201
You're the hottest roommate
l ever had.

173
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:26,528
Oh, no, l have to go.
l have a massage appointment.

174
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:30,487
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
l'll pay you.

175
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:33,844
No, l've gotten in trouble
for that before.

176
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:37,443
-See you later?
-Absolutely.

177
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,764
l love the way you kiss.

178
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:45,444
Really? That's the thing l'm worst at!
You'll see.

179
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:55,848
-Hey. l think Brenda needs a raise.
-How come?

180
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:58,726
Because l put my head
between her legs.

181
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,731
-To see her pants?
-They're my pants!

182
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,730
Did you see the stain?

183
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,972
No. l was getting into position,
and everything went dark.

184
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,888
She is not stealing from us.
Will you let this go?

185
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,851
Fine.

186
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:22,328
-She's wearing my bra!
-Oh, dear God!

187
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,172
My pink flowered bra!
l recognize the strap!

188
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:28,490
Yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

189
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:32,169
l'm leaving, and you're gonna look
at Brenda's bra.

190
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:35,046
Here's another plan. No.

191
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:38,370
l would, but she thinks
l'm attracted to her.

192
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:42,043
-Why?
-Did you not hear where my head was?

193
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,526
We're a team.
We're in this together.

194
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:49,442
l fear a jury will see it
the same way.

195
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:53,808
l catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

196
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:56,083
You see that?

197
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,766
Do you see this?

198
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,488
All right.
Okay. l get your point.

199
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,412
lf it's not her bra,
will you let her clean?

200
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:11,768
Yes. You'll know it's mine because on
the right, there's a noticeable rip.

201
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,647
You need new clothes.

202
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,124
-Hi. How is she?
-lt's not looking good.

203
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:31,404
Well, l brought her some <i>bloemen.</i>

204
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:37,051
Would you like to say goodbye?
l'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

205
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,450
Oh, l don't know that it would.

206
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:45,044
-Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
-All right, then.

207
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:55,645
-Hey!
-Welcome back.

208
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:01,524
-Shall we continue?
-l'm still tired from this afternoon.

209
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,883
-Why?
-The sex.

210
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,890
-What sex?
-Our sex.

211
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,367
We didn't have sex.

212
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:12,044
lf it wasn't with you, l had sex
with somebody that looked like--

213
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:22,242
-You had sex with Ursula?
-A little bit.

214
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:25,365
l thought she was you
and l kissed her and--

215
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:30,647
-You didn't notice different clothes?
-l was just so excited to see you.

216
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,964
-This is too weird.
-l don't wanna lose you.

217
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:41,961
lt's like l was saying to Ursula
when l was making love--

218
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:44,249
Yeah. lt's too weird.

219
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,201
So l guess this is it.

220
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,369
Yeah.

221
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,643
Maybe it's for the best.

222
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,522
-You smell just like her.
-Yeah, so do you.

223
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:19,606
-What are you doing?
-l'm leaning.

224
00:17:19,813 --> 00:17:22,247
This is where l lean.

225
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,766
Okay.

226
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,451
-Brenda, a bee!
-What?

227
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:35,051
lt flew into your blouse! Better
undo your buttons lest it sting you.

228
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:40,365
-l think l know what's going on here.
-You do?

229
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:44,452
Look, l know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian. . .

230
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,847
. . .but it's wrong. You're married.

231
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:52,170
-l totally understand.
-Okay, good.

232
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,967
Could l just see your bra?

233
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,408
-Where'd you get those jeans?
-You gave them to me.

234
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:08,242
-No, l didn't!
-All right, l took them.

235
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:12,002
l figured it was okay,
you've got an ink stain on it.

236
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:15,842
-Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
-What bra?

237
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:20,649
-The pink one with the flowers.
-You mean the one you're wearing?

238
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:25,731
l quit!

239
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,769
Sounds about right.

240
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:36,682
What is this?

241
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,322
This is just to give you an idea.

242
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:45,967
We can put screens so the baby has
privacy, and a mobile over the crib. . .

243
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:51,850
. . .and here's a baby monitor which,
for now, we can use as walkie-talkies.

244
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,929
You're so sweet!

245
00:18:56,173 --> 00:19:00,644
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

246
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:09,082
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

247
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,723
Why don't l hold on to him
so there's no confusion?

248
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:19,722
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
lt's gonna be loud.

249
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,401
-l'm loud.
-lt'll be up all night.

250
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:24,763
-l'm up all night.
-lt'll poop.

251
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,248
Hello!

252
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:30,250
What about all the women?

253
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:34,048
lf l'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand a baby. . .

254
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:37,290
. . .then maybe l don't wanna
be with that woman.

255
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:41,042
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

256
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,246
Joey, are you sure?

257
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:47,128
Yeah. Look, l know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay. . .

258
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:52,527
. . .but it'll also be really,
really great.

259
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:56,846
Please, Rachel,
l really want you to stay.

260
00:19:58,013 --> 00:20:02,450
l want me to stay too. Thank you.

261
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:08,928
-Look at this crib! lt's so cute!
-l know. l found it on the street.

262
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:13,046
Are you--? Really?
This is in such good condition.

263
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,448
Whoa! What's under the cover?

264
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,928
-l don't know.
-lt's moving.

265
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,283
lt's got a tail! Get it out!

266
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:22,051
Okay!

267
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:32,932
Well, the old lady died.
And how do l know?

268
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:37,046
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

269
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,212
But l don't care because
you got the apartment. Yes!

270
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:48,204
Yeah. l think l'm gonna stay here.

271
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,369
lsn't that great?
