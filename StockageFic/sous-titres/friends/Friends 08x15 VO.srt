1
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:05,133
-Oh! Hey, Rach!
-Hi.

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:08,014
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!

3
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,694
How's living at Ross'?

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:15,294
lt's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:20,734
Something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.

6
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:24,254
Oh, thank you.
l'll see you guys later.

7
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,217
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

8
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:36,570
l wish you'd get over her.
l hate seeing you like this.

9
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:41,292
ls there anything l can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,293
Thanks. Maybe later.

11
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,692
-Gunther, can l get a scone?
-Want anything?

12
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,971
l want a lot of things.

13
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,815
l wanna be with the woman l love!

14
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:54,893
l want her to love me back.

15
00:00:55,101 --> 00:01:00,573
And l want relief from the wrenching
pain of knowing that won't happen!

16
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,174
We have red bagels.

17
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,213
Okay.

18
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,532
The One With The Birthing Video

19
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,009
How does Mona feel about
Rachel moving in?

20
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:49,252
l'm on my way to tell her.

21
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,373
She's been away all week,
but she'll be cool.

22
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,179
She's been so supportive.

23
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:58,698
She even got the baby a T-shirt
that says ''Fossils are my friends. ''

24
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,849
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

25
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,939
So l'm gonna take off.

26
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:09,094
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Rachel wanted to see this tape.

27
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,935
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.

28
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,741
Could you take it to your apartment?

29
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,779
''Candy and Cookie''?

30
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,535
Candy's the mom,
Cookie's the daughter.

31
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:22,931
The father's name is also Cookie.

32
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:27,574
Why am l friends with these people?

33
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,538
l wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

34
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,254
Monica, grow up.

35
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:40,771
-What's behind your back?
-Something l want Phoebe's opinion on.

36
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,700
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.

37
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,574
Come on, l'm your older brother.
Ask me.

38
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,499
Okay, big brother.

39
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:53,855
Which one would make your best friend
want to do your little sister?

40
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:00,893
The red one.

41
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,295
Hey.

42
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:12,773
l know you're depressed,
so l brought someone to cheer you up.

43
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:16,457
Right outside is a real,
live, furry playmate.

44
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,698
l'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

45
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:26,338
Hey, a dog!

46
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,857
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

47
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:34,692
He's the happiest dog ever.
l borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

48
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:37,819
So you can keep him
till he cheers you up.

49
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:42,094
Thanks so much, Pheebs.
We are gonna have so much fun!

50
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:44,178
Oh, not that kind of fun.

51
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,371
Happy Valentine's!

52
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:59,737
l'm slipping into something a bit less
comfortable and a bit more slutty.

53
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,780
''Candy and Cookie''?

54
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:10,296
''Candy and Cookie''?!

55
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,776
Monica got me porn?

56
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,934
Girl-on-girl porn?!

57
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,130
She really must love me!

58
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:33,780
<i>-Yeah, just relax.</i>
-l love you, St. Valentine.

59
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,814
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

60
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,411
<i>Now push!</i>

61
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,897
<i>Oh, God, it hurts!</i>

62
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:53,332
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

63
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:57,490
<i>-Oh, make it stop!</i>
-l am trying!

64
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,931
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

65
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,975
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

66
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:11,095
Did l just throw this?

67
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:13,896
-Hi.
-Hi.

68
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:17,332
l accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

69
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,613
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.

70
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,052
l don't know his real name.
l call him Mozzarella.

71
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:30,096
You are so cute. l wish l could play,
but l've gotta go to work.

72
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:34,533
l hope l stop talking like this
before my meeting. Yes, l do.

73
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:38,299
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, l can't stop it.

74
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,972
Come here! Hey!

75
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:47,498
That's Rachel. She used to live here.

76
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:51,489
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

77
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:54,255
But we can't have her.

78
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,017
l really miss her.

79
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,130
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

80
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:04,050
Well, you used to be.

81
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,050
So, what do you think?

82
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:19,813
l've still got it.

83
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,420
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?

84
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:28,251
lt's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

85
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:31,731
Oh, the dilating!

86
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:37,576
ls this the video of the birth? lt's
Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?

87
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:45,934
l thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

88
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:51,458
lf you thought l was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day. . .

89
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,538
. . .you were right.

90
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,699
lt's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom. . .

91
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:02,092
. . .but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

92
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,700
lt got four stars.

93
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,216
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

94
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,500
-Anyway, you wanna take a look?
-Well. . . .

95
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:15,689
-l'm not really in a sexy mood.
-Hey, what's going on?

96
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,699
Remember the first time
you saw <i>Jaws...</i>

97
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:22,775
. . .how long it took
to go back in the water?

98
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,533
We can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

99
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:32,257
-You don't know. You didn't see it.
-Childbirth is beautiful.

100
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,895
Oh, beautiful? Really?

101
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,456
You think this is beautiful?

102
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:44,776
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

103
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:49,334
-See, honey, there's--
-Don't touch me!

104
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:54,221
-Hi!
-Hey!

105
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,337
-How was Atlantic City?
-Good.

106
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,970
l brought you back a present.

107
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:01,939
You didn't have to--

108
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,331
Saltwater taffy?!

109
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,978
Thanks.

110
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,974
lnterestingly, it isn't made
with seawater.

111
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:14,657
lt's actually made
with salted fresh water.

112
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:17,096
That's not interesting.

113
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,611
-l think it's interesting.
-Me too. l missed you!

114
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,698
-How was your week?
-Good.

115
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,174
-The baby started kicking.
-How exciting!

116
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:32,017
lt was amazing. The only thing is,
l wasn't there the first time.

117
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,134
-Oh, no.
-l was missing out on all this stuff.

118
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:41,176
-Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
-Yeah, right.

119
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,900
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.

120
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:49,020
''Have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward. ''

121
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,016
lmagine, l go away for a few days. . .

122
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:59,890
. . .and my boyfriend is living
with a woman he got pregnant.

123
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,933
So, what'd you tell him?

124
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:18,895
You didn't tell Mona
Rachel moved in?

125
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,577
She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

126
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:26,700
Plus, she got me taffy.

127
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,620
-Really? l've never had any.
-Ever?

128
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:34,497
My mom was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

129
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:36,654
Thank you.

130
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,293
Are you gonna tell her?

131
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,095
l will. l want to butter her up first.

132
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:46,619
l'm gonna take her to dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.

133
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,898
When she thinks
l'm the best boyfriend ever. . .

134
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:53,975
. . .l'll tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

135
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,891
lf l haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

136
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,729
So where are--?
What the crap is up with this stuff?

137
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:09,376
ls it gum? ls it food?
What's the deal?

138
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,930
Oh, it's nice.
May l try a pink one?

139
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:22,215
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross. . .

140
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,417
. . .it just isn't gonna happen.

141
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,734
lt'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

142
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:32,089
-Hey.
-Hey.

143
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:36,812
How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

144
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:39,299
You're subdued.

145
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:43,130
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.

146
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:47,130
-Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
-Sure.

147
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,178
Oh, me, right.

148
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:56,450
-He's miserable. What happened to him?
-Nothing.

149
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,930
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?

150
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,499
Rachel stuff.

151
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:07,260
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

152
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,816
He spends a day with you, and look!

153
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,379
He's breathing.

154
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,815
-l'll take him to Wendy's.
-He's fine.

155
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,090
Look.

156
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,620
Here's your ball!

157
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:22,978
Get your ball!
Get your ball!

158
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:27,298
God, what have l done to you?

159
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,011
l broke the dog, Pheebs!
l broke the dog!

160
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:37,220
l'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?

161
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,770
Oh, l've got big Valentine's plans.

162
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,094
l've got Chinese food on the way,
and your saltwater taffy.

163
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,375
lnterestingly, it isn't made
with seawater--

164
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:51,732
We actually watched
the documentary together.

165
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,939
Oh, my Chinese food.
l'll get my cash.

166
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,493
Mona?

167
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,209
What are--?
Hi! How are you?

168
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,856
l'm supposed to pick you up.

169
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,736
l made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!

170
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:20,299
-Oh! Hey, Mona!
-Hi, Rachel.

171
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,492
What's she doing here?

172
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,977
l have no idea.

173
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:29,098
l'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

174
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,094
What is she doing?

175
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,532
Lately she just likes
hanging out here.

176
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:37,932
-Why?
-l think she's lonely.

177
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:41,898
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?

178
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:45,292
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

179
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,772
And by emotional, l mean crazy!

180
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,101
That's just my Chinese food.

181
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:56,212
She has food delivered here?

182
00:12:56,421 --> 00:13:01,017
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

183
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:06,819
l'm gonna get in my sweats
and eat this in bed.

184
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,409
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

185
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:18,093
Open the champagne,
and l will be right back.

186
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:22,459
-l've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?

187
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,817
Please start drinking.

188
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,773
-l'm just gonna grab the phone.
-Rachel, wait.

189
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,500
l hope you don't take this
the wrong way.

190
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:40,938
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?

191
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,900
No.

192
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:46,889
Ross is too nice to say it,
but this is his apartment.

193
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:51,253
We need boundaries, so why don't
you go back to your place?

194
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,339
But, Mona, l live here.

195
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,010
Happy Valentine's Day!

196
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:08,492
Or, something to remember me by.

197
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:19,577
-How long has it been this time?
-Ninety seconds.

198
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:23,496
Ninety seconds is a long time
not to think about it.

199
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,301
Except all l did was think about it.

200
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,099
l know. lt haunts me.

201
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:33,893
Till now, the worst thing l'd seen was
my dad doing shots off the houseboy.

202
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:38,100
After this, l would gladly
make that my screen saver.

203
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:43,176
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.

204
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,770
l could do that.

205
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:53,377
Now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

206
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:09,570
-Oh, thank God!
-l know.

207
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,614
Come in!

208
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,773
Hi. l'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

209
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:18,570
l had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.

210
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:21,011
-Oh, my God.
-Poor Ross.

211
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:29,291
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,
but for this he closes the drapes.

212
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:33,698
You know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

213
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:34,930
lt's here.

214
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:39,100
We should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

215
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,699
You saw it? ls it scary?

216
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:45,291
lt's ironic how footage
of someone being born. . .

217
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,419
. . .can make you want to kill yourself.

218
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:52,975
Now l'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?

219
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,618
No, but l'll leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

220
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,897
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

221
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:07,489
She's right. Of course not.

222
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,771
Honey, get the tape.

223
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,375
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

224
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:25,538
Here we go.

225
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,379
Okay.

226
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,013
Oh, my.

227
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,531
<i>All right, baby. One more time.</i>

228
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:37,938
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

229
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:41,497
Why have l seen this thing
three times?

230
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,570
lt's beautiful.

231
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:50,174
-lt's horrible!
-l know, l know! l'm so sorry for you!

232
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:54,934
-You guys! You guys, look!
-What? Did her ass explode?

233
00:16:57,341 --> 00:17:00,333
No, the baby's out. Look.

234
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:05,934
Look at those little fingers and toes.

235
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,177
Look how happy the mom is now.

236
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:13,539
-Oh, Rach.
-Screw you! You don't have to do it!

237
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,219
-Hey.
-Hey!

238
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,851
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.

239
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,734
Oh, man, l'm sorry. Why?

240
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:30,253
Lately, l haven't exactly been
the perfect boyfriend.

241
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,981
l didn't tell her
l got Rachel pregnant.

242
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:38,090
l gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

243
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:41,697
Then l lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

244
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:46,651
ln a way, l judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

245
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:50,490
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

246
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:54,250
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

247
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,214
Joey without a date
on Valentine's Day?

248
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:00,612
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

249
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:04,251
-Sort of.
-Really?

250
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,254
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

251
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,892
Maybe l can help.

252
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:14,892
Whatever it is,
l am sure it has happened to me.

253
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:19,769
You know, actually,
once l got dumped during sex.

254
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:28,500
-So anyway, what is it?
-Forget about it. lt's no big deal.

255
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,096
-Come on, what is it?
-lt's nothing.

256
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:33,980
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

257
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,851
Okay. Sit down.

258
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,170
There's this woman that l like a lot.

259
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,457
But it can't happen.

260
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,094
She's not a Tribbiani?

261
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,770
No!

262
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:00,014
So is she someone from work?

263
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,490
Yes.

264
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:04,978
Well, does she like you?

265
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:09,096
Sometimes l think she could.

266
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,809
But l can't do anything about it.

267
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,090
Why not?

268
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,013
lt's complicated.

269
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,935
She was with this other guy.

270
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:21,251
Someone from work too.

271
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,131
l could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

272
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:31,975
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

273
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,934
-No, l don't think so.
-Okay.

274
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,853
ls he a good guy?

275
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,292
Yeah, he's the best.

276
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:43,095
-Then talk to him.
-l don't know.

277
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:46,373
lt's worth finding out,
if you like her.

278
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,139
l do, so much.

279
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:51,100
l can't stop thinking about her.
l can't--

280
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:54,617
You know what?
You have to go for it.

281
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:59,776
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

282
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:02,337
Here's your warm milk.

283
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:09,659
l'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

284
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:16,336
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

285
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,856
Let me know how it goes.

286
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,052
lt's Rachel.

287
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:33,898
<i>You're having a baby</i>
<i>and you need to prepare.</i>

288
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:38,777
<i>You're gonna make yourself watch</i>
<i>the whole thing. Just do it!</i>

289
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:45,297
<i>I came to the big city</i>
<i>to become a star.</i>

290
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:49,940
<i>-I'll do anything to make that happen.</i>
<i>-Anything?</i>

291
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:54,458
<i>Maybe it starts with</i>
<i>how she gets pregnant.</i>
