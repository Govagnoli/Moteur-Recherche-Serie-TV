1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,179
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,140
It was like torture.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,579
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,979
It keeps getting worse.

5
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:18,340
I'm in love with
my roommate's girlfriend.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,299
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,139
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

8
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:29,459
And now I have seen her naked.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,220
At least with her clothes on...

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,619
... I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,139
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

12
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,540
Smooth!

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,380
Could you see up his robe?

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,939
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:53,180
The One Where
Chandler Crosses the Line

16
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:55,490
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,540
-Here you go.
-I'll call you.

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,730
Great!

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,220
Hey, hey. Who was that?

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,620
Casey. We're going out tonight.

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,290
Going out? Wow!

22
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,589
It didn't work out
with Kathy? Bummer.

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,059
No, things are fine.

24
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:01,540
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

25
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,970
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,979
You're going out with Kathy!

27
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,570
Why are you upset?

28
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,139
Well, I'm upset...

29
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:15,380
... for you.

30
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,779
Sex with an endless line of women
must be unfulfilling.

31
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,339
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

32
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,940
Look, Joey.

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,339
Kathy's not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

34
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:32,729
But, Casey....

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,740
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

36
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,380
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

37
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,740
... and gets you.

38
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,419
You got all that
from the back of her head?

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,580
It's time to settle down.

40
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,500
Make a choice.
Pick a lane.

41
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,020
Who's Elaine?

42
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,220
Little Tony Tarzan

43
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,740
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,300
I don't know the next verse.

45
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,179
You could just go:

46
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:10,860
Greatest of ease

47
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,660
Then go right into it.

48
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,139
I like that.

49
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,979
How do you know about....

50
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,529
You know, I used to play.

51
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,660
That's right.
The keyboards?

52
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:29,380
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

53
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,740
That's when
I really found my sound.

54
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:38,699
Juice just came out of my nose,
but it was worth it.

55
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,179
Oh, my God!

56
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,940
I completely forgot about
your sound.

57
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,979
He'd lock himself in the basement.

58
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:51,899
No one was ever allowed to hear
"the sound. "

59
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,339
I want to hear "the sound. "

60
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:59,179
No, I mean,
I haven't played in so long.

61
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:02,580
Well, it's really personal stuff.

62
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,940
Play that funky music, white boy.

63
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,740
-Yeah, come on.
-No, you guys.

64
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,740
My keyboards are all the way--
Yeah, okay.

65
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,540
Okay, guys.

66
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,350
All right! Bring it on, you!

67
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,049
Here we go.

68
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,540
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

69
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,140
It's important that you understand...

70
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,619
... it's about communicating...

71
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,059
... very private emotions.

72
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:53,570
You know....

73
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,579
You should think of my work...

74
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,140
... as wordless sound poems.

75
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,179
-That's what--
-My God, play!

76
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,100
Well, you know, that was...

77
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,779
... terrific!

78
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,739
Really...

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,700
... bitchin' .

80
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,899
Wow! It was so wow!

81
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,290
Really?

82
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,179
Yeah! I mean, you should
play in public.

83
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,540
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's--

84
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,859
I want to play you another piece.

85
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,500
I left my helicopter sounds
on another disk. I'll be back.

86
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,940
This is so nice.
I mean, I am so....

87
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,140
God bless my dad
for soundproofing the basement.

88
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,940
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

89
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,660
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!

90
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,140
It was so moving.

91
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,700
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

92
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,540
You mean, music?

93
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,980
I know what you think.

94
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,739
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

95
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,220
Come in.

96
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,739
Oh, God! ls that Baywatch ?

97
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:07,140
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

98
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,369
So is Joey around?

99
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,579
No, he's not back yet.

100
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,019
Come in, have a seat.
Bow or stern?

101
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,260
I don't have a preference. You?

102
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,339
I like it in the stern.

103
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,459
Of the boat.

104
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,260
It's me. Casey and I
had a little car trouble.

105
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,179
-What happened?
-We broke down.

106
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,380
I have to get transmission fluid.

107
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,170
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

108
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,739
-Why can't you tell her?
-I think my time is about to--

109
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:48,700
I thought your time ran out.

110
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,299
Me too, but I guess I do have--

111
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,690
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

112
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,100
I guess it's just you and me, then.

113
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,940
Yeah, I think it is.

114
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,380
So what'd you do today?

115
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,140
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

116
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,100
-Looks great!
-And then it got canceled.

117
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,859
I could cut it.

118
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,339
Really?

119
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:23,179
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

120
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:24,739
Dog grooming?

121
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,540
Don't make my tail too poofy.

122
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,739
You have really great hair.

123
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:38,340
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

124
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,859
Joey also has great hair.

125
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,979
Yes, Joey has great hair.

126
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:52,460
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

127
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,979
What are you doing?

128
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,580
Checking if it's even.

129
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,340
Looks good.

130
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,940
The phone!
The phone's making sounds!

131
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,020
Hey, dude, it's me.

132
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,179
Hey, it's Joey!

133
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,940
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

134
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,619
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

135
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,940
-What?
-It fell out.

136
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,460
I just figured we hit a dog.

137
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,900
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.

138
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,940
It's Joey.

139
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:49,539
No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

140
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,539
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.

141
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,940
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

142
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,580
I should probably go.

143
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,940
I forgot my purse.

144
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,950
I really did.
I forgot my purse.

145
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,739
-This is bad! It's bad!
-Horrible!

146
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:37,820
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

147
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,809
The kiss was good.

148
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,619
-But that's bad!
-Here's what we do.

149
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,809
We forget it.

150
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:49,739
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

151
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,299
Can you really do that?

152
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,739
I have to. He's my best friend.

153
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,460
And you're seeing him.

154
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,539
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

155
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,179
But with you--

156
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,380
No, don't! Don't, see?

157
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,340
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

158
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:16,219
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

160
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,500
I think we have to.

161
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,739
Are you still out there?

162
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,820
Electrifying

163
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,179
Infinite time

164
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,539
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

165
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:04,619
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go!

166
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,820
Thank you very much!

167
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,140
Hey, aren't you up next?

168
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,580
-I'm not playing tonight.
-Why not?

169
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,619
I can't follow Ross.

170
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:36,580
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

171
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,979
... who had to
follow the Beatles. No.

172
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,900
Ross sucks.

173
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,380
The place has emptied because of him.

174
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,330
My God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

175
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:55,530
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time!

176
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,700
You suck too.

177
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,849
You're awful.

178
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,340
You guys!

179
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,140
You suck too!

180
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:26,739
Man! I can't believe
I locked myself out again!

181
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:28,940
Hang on, buddy.

182
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,940
My God! What happened?

183
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,900
-Did you do all this? Why?
-I sure did.

184
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,619
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

185
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,140
You're amazing.

186
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,539
No, this is amazing.

187
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,739
A Tv appears from nowhere!

188
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,419
The dream!

189
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,419
How did you afford all this?

190
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,539
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

191
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,380
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

192
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,140
I don't know.

193
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:06,489
No, you are.

194
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,010
You do this, you give me advice....

195
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:12,929
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

196
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,219
I'll do that.

197
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,580
With Casey?

198
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:19,020
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

199
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,580
-Or Casey.
-No, Kathy.

200
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,659
Could be Casey.

201
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:23,900
No, Kathy.

202
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,020
Consider Casey.

203
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,059
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

204
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:32,940
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

205
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:37,340
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

206
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:50,099
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

207
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,500
Thanks.

208
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:57,059
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

209
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,340
... and, you know, my talent.

210
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,539
Is that true?

211
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,260
Well, kind of, yeah.

212
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,130
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

213
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:12,739
... but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

214
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,780
See, but....

215
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,580
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

216
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,859
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

217
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:25,940
If it bothers you this much...

218
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,619
... then I won't play anymore.

219
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,380
No, don't do that.

220
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,539
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

221
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,580
Hey, Chandler.
Saw the new furniture. very nice.

222
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,260
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

223
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,049
I kissed Kathy.

224
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,580
Are you serious?

225
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,580
-Does Joey know?
-No.

226
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,380
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

227
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,500
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

228
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,539
Which we all appreciate.

229
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,179
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

230
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,809
... knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

231
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,849
Don't say that!
That's not true, is it?

232
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,580
Yeah, he loves you.

233
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:27,299
Then why didn't you
tell me to do that?

234
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,820
I said something to Phoebe.

235
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,590
And I thought it was
a really good idea.

236
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:35,659
-Yeah, I remember.
-Oh, my God!

237
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,940
What am I going to do?

238
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,780
You'll have to tell him.

239
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,460
Why do I have to?

240
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,289
-Because you do.
-Yeah, I know.

241
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:51,380
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

242
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,539
Sambuca Margarita?

243
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,659
It that a real thing?

244
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,939
Well, we only had sambuca,
so it is now.

245
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,060
Listen, Joe. I need to--

246
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,739
I need to talk to you.

247
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,939
What's up?

248
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,699
It's about Kathy.

249
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,939
I like her.

250
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,459
I like her a lot, actually.

251
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,300
You do?

252
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,180
Your timing couldn't be better.

253
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,140
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

254
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:35,939
-Yeah, she broke up with me.
-When?

255
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,260
Just now, after acting class.

256
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,099
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

257
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,339
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

258
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:51,660
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

259
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,339
Yes, but I don't have to.

260
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:57,150
No, it's okay.

261
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:03,339
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

262
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,739
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

263
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,380
You might have your work
cut out for you.

264
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:17,260
When I talked to her, I got
the feeling she's into some other guy.

265
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,099
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

266
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,939
I think I know who the other guy is.

267
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,339
Who?

268
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,380
It's me.

269
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,260
I'm the other guy.

270
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,140
What?

271
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,739
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

272
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,579
... and one thing led
to another, and....

273
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,089
And what?
Did you sleep with her?

274
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,859
No, I just kissed her.

275
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,060
What? That's even worse!

276
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:52,579
-How is that worse?
-It's the same!

277
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,979
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her!

278
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:58,140
Who cares?

279
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,300
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you!

280
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,699
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

281
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,540
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line!

282
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,219
It's a dot to you!

283
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,939
Yes, right! And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

284
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,500
Is that why you bought all this?

285
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,369
You know what?

286
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,930
I will not watch your Tv.

287
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:26,939
I won't listen to your stereo.

288
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,260
And there's a loaf in the new
breadmaker I won't eat. Know why?

289
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,339
Because--

290
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,020
It's all tainted with your betrayal!

291
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,219
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you, either.

292
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,219
And just so you know...

293
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,939
... I made that bread for you.

294
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,699
Oh, my God!
He's totally lost it.

295
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,180
This cannot get any worse.

296
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,339
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

297
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,540
Thank you. Thanks.

298
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,380
I lost it.

299
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,859
I won't play anymore.

300
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,979
Would you--
Can you finish my set?

301
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:43,219
After that? Yeah.

302
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,540
No, I mean, if I can help.

303
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,219
Like I could lose it.

304
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,619
I played bad on purpose, guys.

305
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:05,099
You were playing bad
this whole time.

306
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,699
Just that last song.
