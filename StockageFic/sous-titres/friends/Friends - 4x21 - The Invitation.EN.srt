1
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,679
All of a sudden,
so much is happening.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,270
I know.
Ross is getting married.

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:13,159
Phoebe's making people.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,110
-Everybody's doing stuff.
-We just sit here.

5
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:18,600
If I died,
people would know I was here...

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,309
... only by the ass print
on this chair!

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,479
We have to do something.
Something huge!

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,280
We could climb Mt. Everest.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,920
Not something stupid.
Something huge!

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,159
I saw an ad for this video.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,959
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that!

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,799
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,479
It's just steep!

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,680
We're going! It'd be nice
to leave an ass print on Everest.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,799
What's up?

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,720
-We're gonna climb Mt. Everest.
-Yeah, baby!

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,599
I looked into that.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,159
Yeah, but it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,959
And you would die.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,279
We could get that Everest video.

21
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,919
We could do that
without risking our lives at all.

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,720
While we're at the video store,
we could rent Die Hard!

23
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,519
I just remembered.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,160
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,559
So you'll stay here
and hang out with me?

26
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,199
But one of these days...

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,589
... we'll get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again!

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,709
The One with the lnvitation

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,029
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,669
So does your uncle Nathan
get an invite or not?

31
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,830
Oh, God!
Nobody likes him.

32
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,960
He's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,279
Invite him!

34
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,949
Did I do these neat enough?

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, they're fine.

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,669
We'll say that Ben addressed them.

37
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,029
You invited Rachel then?

38
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,750
Sure, why not?

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
Really?

40
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,160
I wouldn't be comfortable having
any of my old lovers there.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,320
Do you think
we shouldn't invite her?

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,199
You know I absolutely adore Rachel.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,070
It's just that I thought
it might be awkward for you.

44
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,679
But it's absolutely your decision.

45
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,479
-More tea?
-Sure.

46
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,869
Earl Grey?

47
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,960
Fine, invite whoever you want.

48
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,759
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,759
And I just want a million dollars!

50
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,279
Oh God, Monica. Thank God!

51
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:42,550
This is Rachel.
Another Lincoln High survivor.

52
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,990
This is Chandler.

53
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,320
Phoebe.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,589
Joey.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,520
-Do you remember Ross?
-Sure.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
Back in high school...

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,720
... I had a major crush on you.

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,039
I knew.

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,559
You did?

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,199
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

61
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,360
I did.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,199
Listen, do you think--

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,750
Try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor.

64
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,519
Would it be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

65
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,670
Maybe.

66
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,950
Okay, maybe I will.

67
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,079
See, I see...

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,440
... big passion in your future.

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,359
-Really?
-I do.

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,750
Ross, you're so great.

71
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,200
It's never gonna happen.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,760
I have a question.

73
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,160
Actually, it's not
so much a question.

74
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,750
It's more of a general wondering...

75
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,959
... ment.

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,359
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to....

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
That's right.

78
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,670
Look!

79
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,510
What?

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,390
Top of the world looking

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,559
Down on creation

82
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:28,920
And the only explanation I can find

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,750
Listen, missy! lf you want this cart,
you'll have to take me with it!

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,799
-Did you see that?
-You were incredible!

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,480
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

86
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,959
I could not have done this
without you.

87
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,160
More clothes in the dryer?

88
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm fine.

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

90
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,920
I was doing great with Julie
before I found out.

91
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:11,559
I was doing great too. It's not
easy for me to see you with Julie.

92
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:14,399
I don't need this right now.

93
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,279
It's too late.

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm with somebody else.
This ship has sailed!

95
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,880
All right, fine!
Go ahead and do that.

96
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,359
I don't need your stupid ship!

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,350
This is the first time I'm doing
something I care about.

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,989
I'm doing something
that I'm actually good at.

99
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,559
If you don't get that--

100
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:23,589
I get that, but I'm tired
of your answering machine.

101
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,160
I don't know what to do.

102
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:27,350
Neither do l!

103
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,910
Is this about Mark?

104
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,559
Oh, my God!

105
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,559
Okay, it's not.

106
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,359
I can't keep having this
same fight over and over again.

107
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,119
You're making this too hard!

108
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,390
I am?
What do you want me to do?

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,359
I don't know. Look, maybe
we should just take a break.

110
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,399
You're right. Let's cool off.

111
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,160
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

112
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,480
A break from us.

113
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,640
-Why are we rushing?
-The girlfriend I told you about.

114
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,760
She wants to get back
together with me.

115
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,869
I found it!

116
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,109
That's so great for you guys!

117
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,160
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.

118
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:26,720
-You got my message?
-You are right on time.

119
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,269
Can I be your girlfriend again?

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
You can very much.

121
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,400
I want you to leave.
Get out!

122
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,400
I want to talk about this.

123
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,719
All right, how was she?

124
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,599
Was she good?

125
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,760
Don't answer!

126
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,270
You wanted to talk about it.
How was she?

127
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,469
She was....

128
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,200
-She was not good, not good.
-Nothing compared to you.

129
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,000
She was different.

130
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,559
Good different?

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Nobody likes change.

132
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,559
Just stop!

133
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,400
The way you owned up to everything.

134
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,719
It's just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

135
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:23,950
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

136
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,159
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater. "

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,280
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

138
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,070
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective.

139
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,679
We were on a break!

140
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,479
You seem to really like her.

141
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,280
What do I do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

142
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,280
No commitment.

143
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,320
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

144
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,869
... asking to hear stories about you...

145
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,640
... Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

146
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,799
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

147
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,549
You think?

148
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,119
You've got 14 hours until
she has to be at the airport.

149
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,549
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

150
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
... with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

151
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,190
You're right.

152
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,479
This is so amazing!

153
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,799
My brother's getting married
and in London!

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
It's so romantic.

155
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,150
Hey, pretty smart!

156
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,349
Tissue paper.

157
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:58,960
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

158
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,469
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

159
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
Isn't this adorable?

160
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,950
Ross let Ben address mine.

161
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,760
Did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

162
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,760
Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

163
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,799
I'm so jealous you're all going.

164
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,080
I never knew you can't fly
in your third trimester.

165
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,349
I didn't, either.

166
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,159
I knew that.

167
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,150
So I didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

168
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,159
What's up?

169
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,760
Just hanging out.

170
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,760
What's this?
Ross' wedding invitation?

171
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,359
Maybe that's the one
we should have hidden.

172
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,080
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

173
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm happy for him.

174
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
I am. I really--

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,359
I'll work on it.

176
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,469
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,159
You're going to come, though,
aren't you?

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,919
I don't know.

179
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,599
This isn't one of those
"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

180
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,280
Because I already bought my ticket.

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,349
You know what would be real weird?
lf you weren't there.

182
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,559
-Just say you'll think about it.
-I'll think about it.

183
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,030
Who's this from?

184
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,039
That's Ross' .

185
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,559
Oh, my God!

186
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,869
He remembered.

187
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,229
Remembered what?

188
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,190
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

189
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,799
I saw this and told him
it was like one my grandmother had...

190
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,270
... when I was a little girl.

191
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,590
I can't believe he remembered!

192
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,280
This must've cost a fortune.

193
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,599
I can't believe he did this.

194
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,400
Remember when he fell in love
with Carol...

195
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:02,559
... and got her
that expensive crystal duck?

196
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,760
What did you just say?

197
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,390
Oh, my God!

198
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,640
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

199
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,719
Oh, my God!

200
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,640
-We were in school together.
-We haven't seen each other since.

201
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,469
I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

202
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,750
Julie!

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,679
Isn't that great?

204
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:42,359
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

205
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:47,549
That is so sweet!

206
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,789
No, you hang up.

207
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,559
No, you--

208
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,760
One, two, three.

209
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,119
You didn't hang up!

210
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,150
She didn't hang up either.

211
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,549
No, you hang up.

212
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,960
You!

213
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,919
Ross, hi.

214
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,309
It's Rachel.

215
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,919
I'm just calling to say
that everything's fine.

216
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,270
And I'm really happy for you...

217
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
... and your cat.

218
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,000
Obviously, I am over you.

219
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:38,200
I am over you.

220
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,229
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

221
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,599
I got a message from you.

222
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone!

223
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,349
Give me the phone!

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,799
You're over me?

225
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,359
Oh, God.

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,270
You're over me?

227
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,950
When were you...

228
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,760
... under me?

229
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,989
Basically...

230
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,150
... Iately, I've....

231
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,559
I've sort of had feelings for you.

232
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,640
I need to lie down.

233
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,359
He broke up with Julie!

234
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,960
Go hug her, for God's sakes!

235
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,549
Really?

236
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,989
It's always been you, Rach.

237
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,440
Oh, God.

238
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,909
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

239
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,159
That's okay.

240
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,159
You're worth the wait.

241
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,359
And I don't just mean tonight.

242
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,400
Oh, God!

243
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,760
Honey.

244
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,479
That's okay.

245
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,909
No, you just rolled over
the juice box.

246
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,239
Did you say anything to Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place?

247
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,080
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,150
Was I not supposed to?

249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
You ended it!

250
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,359
Because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

251
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,590
You still love me?

252
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,040
What does this mean?
Do you want to get back together?

253
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,199
Maybe.

254
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't know.

255
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,160
I just, I feel....

256
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:30,109
I can't believe I even thought of
getting back together. We're so over!

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,640
Fine by me!

258
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:38,199
And hey! Just so you know,
it's not that common.

259
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:41,910
It doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal.

260
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,560
I knew it!

261
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,560
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn 't she look pretty?

262
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,239
Oh, my God!

263
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,400
This is us getting ready
for the prom.

264
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,150
We don't have to watch this.

265
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,270
Yeah, we do!

266
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,560
Come on!

267
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,160
-Get a shot of Monica.
-How do you zoom out?

268
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,119
There she is!

269
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,520
Shut up!
The camera adds 10 pounds.

270
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,239
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

271
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,160
Dad, turn it off!

272
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,550
It is off.

273
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,239
Right, Ross?

274
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,800
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!

275
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,880
I can 't go to my prom without a date.
It's too late.

276
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,239
If you're not going,
then I don 't want to go either.

277
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,349
I have a wonderful idea.

278
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,709
You should take Rachel to the prom.

279
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,599
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

280
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,760
-I want to see!
-Fine, I'm not going to watch.

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,069
Come on, kid. Let's go.

282
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,800
Are you handsome!

283
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,560
Let's show them!

284
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,949
-Okay, Dad.
-Rachel, ready or not.

285
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:07,560
Here comes your knight in shining--

286
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,920
Oh, dear!

287
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,800
How do I turn this off?

288
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,000
I can't believe you did that.

289
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,479
See? He's her lobster!

290
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,750
You're really not going?

291
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,079
It's just going to be too hard.

292
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,589
You know, I mean...

293
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,560
... it's Ross.

294
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,709
How can I watch him get married?

295
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,119
It's just for the best.
You know? It is.

296
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:15,000
Plus somebody's got
to stay here with Phoebe.

297
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,880
She's going to be pretty big by then.

298
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,560
She'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

299
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,229
Drive her to the hospital
if she goes into labor.

300
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,680
You don't have a car.

301
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,750
And your license expired.

302
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,520
There's so much to do,
and I have so little time!

303
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,239
Check this out.

304
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,750
There's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

305
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,719
"It's almost as good as being there. "

306
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,479
It's better! You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

307
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,750
You could, but just the one time.

308
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,829
We could get videos
of the sights...

309
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,479
... get a vCR in our hotel room
and never have to go outside!

310
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,949
If we do that,
we've got to rent Die Hard.

311
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,640
I bet the British version is good!

312
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,599
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

313
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,550
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

314
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,640
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

315
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,150
London might have gotten started...

316
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,709
... because we needed to take advantage
of the show's popularity...

317
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,150
... and go do the show on
an exotic location...

318
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,670
... and have a good time.

319
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,319
There's so many people here
from all over the world.

320
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,109
Lately, the show's been about us
getting excited to go to London.

321
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,680
And then we realized in real life,
we're doing that same thing.

322
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,239
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check!

323
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,199
Are you ready yet?

324
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,709
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

325
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,310
Yeah!
London, baby!

326
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,520
It's all London, baby!

327
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,680
Here we go.

328
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,359
Ross is getting married...

329
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,310
... to this young woman named Emily.

330
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,949
And I set them up by accident.

331
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,160
Why don't we?

332
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,510
Why don't we what?

333
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,510
Get married.

334
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,760
I've started to...

335
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:01,479
... fall for this character, Emily,
played by Helen Baxendale.

336
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,040
And we decided to go all the way,
I guess, and get married.

337
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,599
Ross has asked me to marry him.
I say yes.

338
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,469
And so we arrange
a big wedding in London.

339
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,869
Things go a bit wrong.

340
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,989
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

341
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,239
You have to meet me in the middle.

342
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:21,270
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass!

343
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,920
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

344
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,189
That's it!

345
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,760
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

346
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,640
This is our wedding day!

347
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:34,160
From now on, everyone gets along.

348
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,550
And if I hear one more word...

349
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,349
... no grandchildren!
That's right!

350
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,829
Sorry, old boy.

351
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,719
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

352
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,550
We knew the show
was popular in England...

353
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,839
... and so it seemed like
a natural fit.

354
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,430
I knew how big the show was over here.
It was exciting to be welcomed.

355
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,949
Everywhere, walking down the street...

356
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:03,560
... bunches of kids watching.
So we've been signing autographs.

357
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,109
They're just big fans of the show,
I guess.

358
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,510
I watch it all the time
because my children love it.

359
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,160
They absolutely love it.

360
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,760
Tell my friend you like my hat.

361
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,199
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

362
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,199
Hi, Chandler!

363
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,160
We wanted it to
still feel like Friends...

364
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,119
... and so we shot a lot of it
in front of an audience.

365
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:29,349
And it seemed like
a really exciting opportunity...

366
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,119
... to shoot an American sitcom
in front of a British audience.

367
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,109
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

368
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,319
I'll be the on-camera guy.

369
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,030
All right. First stop...

370
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,310
... Westminster Abbey.

371
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,589
What is that?

372
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,119
That's London, baby!

373
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:54,160
We were really afraid, going over,
that either they'd be...

374
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,719
... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh....

375
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:58,520
They were great!

376
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,319
-Big laughers!
-They waited in line for hours!

377
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,910
-We traveled 329 miles.
-She's lying. It's more like 200.

378
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,910
The show's doing so well over here
that it just seems like...

379
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:13,310
... they're real, real receptive.

380
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,430
It's really wonderful and flattering
and overwhelming, truthfully.

381
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,030
We didn't have
a single bad audience.

382
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,430
Also, there was
a greater sense of "event. "

383
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,510
I think it energized everybody:
the actors, the writers....

384
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,239
We're just excited to be here.

385
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,869
Like, look back there.
Look how cool that is!

386
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,160
We missed Lisa.

387
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,869
That was probably the only
drawback I can think of.

388
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,119
I first thought, "How exciting!
I wonder if I'm going?"

389
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,239
It's awful that Lisa's not here.

390
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,949
We feel like
we have a limb missing.

391
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,400
Let's try some aversion therapy.

392
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,119
Look at the picture.

393
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:02,630
It's strange when one person's
not there. We miss her.

394
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,760
It's weird for all of us
to be here without her.

395
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,949
She's in the episode, on the phone
and things like that.

396
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
Hey, Pheebs!
It's Joey.

397
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,560
Hey, Joey!

398
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,920
I just saw someone that looks just
like you, on the subway.

399
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,589
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

400
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,520
That just cost me four bucks.

401
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,319
Part of me wishes I could go.

402
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,920
But I'm very happy to not get
on a plane for a lot of hours....

403
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,439
Sorry.
I'm not a good traveler.

404
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,119
The Waltham residence.

405
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,560
Is this Emily's parents' house?

406
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,680
This is the housekeeper.

407
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,719
And by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

408
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,680
First one identifies oneself...

409
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,079
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

410
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,160
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

411
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,119
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

412
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,119
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

413
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,280
It was also interesting because
we had shot about a third of it here.

414
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,550
And a bit of it
on the streets in London.

415
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,550
All right!

416
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,599
Westminster Abbey!

417
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,640
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

418
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,869
What do you think of the Abbey?

419
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,920
I think it's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

420
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,280
-To what?
-To "Put the camera away" !

421
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:33,310
Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. "

422
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,959
It was a really gratifying experience.

423
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:40,319
Pretty much everything we'd hoped
to get out of it, we got.

424
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,869
When you can go on location even
in Los Angeles that's exciting...

425
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,680
... much less have your whole crew...

426
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,270
...come out to "jolly old England. "
It's really, really exciting.

427
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,229
Just the idea of bringing
our entire "family" over here...

428
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:32,989
... is, like, wild.

429
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,040
Yeah!
London, baby!

430
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,030
It's amazing to me how many people
are excited about the show.

431
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,030
I knew how big the show was over here.
It plays a lot on television.

432
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,869
I saw it three times in one week.

433
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,239
They're very popular at home,
but I didn 't know they would be here.

434
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:52,040
It's got a massive following
in Britain...

435
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,670
... particularly among my generation.

436
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,310
It's quite sarcastic.
That's why it's popular.

437
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,829
We have great English character actors
who are working with us.

438
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,229
And an opportunity to interact
with the English crew.

439
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:08,069
We're about to be Ross' in-laws.

440
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,589
We're the Brits
that you love to hate.

441
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,469
We worked with
Sarah Ferguson this morning.

442
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,040
She was great and funny.

443
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,880
I was excited to be here today.

444
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,349
It's the first time I've ever done this
and I enjoyed it.

445
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,949
I am a great fan.
I think they are all marvelous.

446
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:27,949
Most British people tried to hate them
for being beautiful and funny.

447
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,469
I got a phone call:

448
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,680
"Small part, a few lines.
Do you want it?

449
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,280
Next to Jennifer Aniston. "

450
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,310
And I went, "Oh, wait a minute....
Oh, okay then. "

451
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,030
It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits
up the butt" episode, really.

452
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:46,439
You're gonna see a lot of comedy,
a lot of romance...

453
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,069
... and a lot of surprises.

454
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,040
And you get to see England.

455
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,839
Call the Queen Mum,
say you enjoy watching Friends...

456
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,790
... and that you know us, and she'll
have you over for tea like that.
