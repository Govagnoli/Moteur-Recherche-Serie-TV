00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:14,609
Cofounnded tlne club, was that
I was inn Iove with you.

173
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:18,567
If you tlninnk about it,
the ''I Hate RacheI Club''. ..

174
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:21,646
. ..was reaIIy
the ''I Love Raclnel CIub.''

175
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,885
But it was reaIIy

00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:28,365

Adanm Carter wouIdnn't go out witln nme.

191
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:31,451
Why BiIIy would just stay

192
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:35,652
Billy's gay nnow, so tlnat onne's

-Wlny didnn't you teII nme?

I saw you goinng at it
belninnd the card catalog.

219
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,847

. ..witln Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek

221
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,568
Inn lnigln school you nmade out

222
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:59,772
-Hey, she didnn't look 50!
-Did slne Iook 1 6?

223
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:03,972

00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:08,207
-Wow.
-Slne didnn't plnotograph well!

225
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:13,806
She wasnn't famiIiar witln the process,
lnavinng sat for oil painntinngs.

226
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:19,769
How did this happenn? Did she lure
you to ann earIy-bird dinnnner?

227
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:30,971
I was workinng late inn the library.
It was just tlne two of us.

228
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:34,961
She nneeded sonme lnelp

229
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:38,968
Annd onne tlninng led to annotlner.

230
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:44,971
If you must knnow,
Annita was very genntle annd tennder.

But tlnree of us wouId meet behinnd

248
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,212
Tlne eyes did still sparkle.
