1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,909
She's the star of the play,
and she's my girlfriend.

2
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:11,680
I get to have sex with the star
of the play!

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:15,279
-People can hear you.
-I know!

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,680
She looks great, doesn't she?

5
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,280
That is one good-looking man.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,869
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

7
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:40,520
So, you been doing this long?

8
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:44,880
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,479
That's nice.

10
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,360
Dude!

11
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,880
-Is that an expensive blouse?
-If you want it to be.

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,080
Here's your girlfriend's button.

13
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,360
The One with Rachel's Crush

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,669
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

15
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,040
Do you still have your
old dresses from high school?

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,069
I think I have some. Why?

17
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,319
Maternity clothes are so expensive.

18
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,720
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.
If you could just...

19
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,520
... throw your purses at it.

20
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,270
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

21
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,600
Are you out of a job?

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,279
They stuck me in Personal Shopping,
which is a huge step down.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,509
What is that?

24
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,720
Where you walk around with rich people
and tell them what to buy?

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,880
That sounds great!

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,869
We switched apartments. You can't eat
our food. That gravy train has ended.

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,880
There's gravy?

28
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,919
In the big apartment,
you deal with people coming over.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,869
That fridge has to be stocked.
That's your apartment now.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,080
-What are you doing?
-I left a donut up here.

31
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,039
How was Kathy's play?

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,240
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex
with a real good-looking guy.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,399
It was like somebody wrote down
my worst nightmare...

34
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,360
... and then charged me $32 to see it.

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,479
That's a good idea for a business.

36
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,470
I'm screwed.
They'll be hot and heavy on stage...

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,320
... then go to their parties,
and he'll try to undermine me.

38
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:34,919
He'll be like, "Where's
your boyfriend Chester?"

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,279
She'll go, "It's Chandler. "
He'll go, "Whatever! "

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,399
That is a good trick.

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,839
All right, look.
What am I going to do?

42
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,880
They're actors.
They're there to do a job.

43
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,320
It doesn't mean
they'll get together.

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,240
So it happened with
Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.

45
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,479
That doesn't mean it'll happen
with them.

46
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,479
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

47
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,639
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

48
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,119
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,509
They're not a couple.

50
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,399
I get the game now.

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,279
When they were doing it on stage,
was it like really hot?

52
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,000
So you're fine.

53
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:27,279
The rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off stage...

54
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,600
... then all the sexual tension is gone.

55
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,880
As long as it's hot on stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

56
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,549
When the heat goes away,
you're in trouble.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,519
You've been to my plays.
Have I ever had chemistry on stage?

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,480
You going to see
the play with me tonight?

59
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:57,720
I don't know how comfortable I am, going
to see how hot the sex is between them.

60
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,079
I know--

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,309
No, I'm there.

62
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,390
-Want some pancakes?
-You made pancakes?

63
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,880
Grab a plate.

64
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
Stay right there.

65
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,190
Getting closer.

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Don't worry...

67
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,920
... we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles and...

68
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:25,679
... jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm sure are the same thing.

69
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:30,480
We're watching the game here Saturday,
if people want to come over.

70
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,799
I wanted to have people over.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,880
Yeah? Who's playing?

72
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,839
The players.

73
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:43,480
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,480
It's a relief, is what it is,
is what it is.

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,750
Pheebs, your plate.

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,679
I'm quitting.

77
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,079
I just helped an old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm quitting.

79
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,799
I'm talking to my boss right now.

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

81
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,279
Call me when you get this message.

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,079
Mr. Waltham?
I need to talk to you.

83
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,839
A moment. I'm in the middle of a task.

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,269
And you have a customer.

85
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,320
I'm Joshua.

86
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,989
Rachel Greene.
What can I do for you?

87
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:34,920
I need a new wardrobe. My wife--
Well, my ex-wife--

88
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,679
I'm so sorry.

89
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,920
Anyway, she burned all my clothes.

90
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:48,829
I got away with this suit
and what turned out to be a skirt.

91
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,839
Well, at least that's a great suit.

92
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,429
It was no fun
at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

93
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:02,160
I need everything down to underwear.
If you're willing, I'm all yours.

94
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,440
You needed to speak to me?

95
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,279
No, no, that wasn't me.

96
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,760
Let's get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

97
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,429
Our selection of underwear.

98
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,109
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,679
-It's this way.
-This way? Sorry.

100
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,799
Right? There was
no chemistry between them.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,470
Before, they had heat.
Now there's none.

102
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,279
You know what this means.
Joey told us.

103
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,079
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
There was some sexual chemistry.

104
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,359
It was like cousins having sex.

105
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,519
Here she comes. Don't say a word.
Just be cool. Don't be you.

106
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,279
Hey, you guys!

107
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,070
Thank you so much for coming again.

108
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,040
-Did you like it?
-Absolutely.

109
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,880
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

110
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,029
It's a good play, isn't it?

111
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,519
I loved the play.
You were great.

112
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,480
And Nick, ditto.

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,679
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

114
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,440
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

115
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,280
It was obvious.
There was no chemistry between you.

116
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,549
You're accusing me of cheating,
and you're insulting my performance?

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,710
I can see how this could happen.
You're up there every night, kissing.

118
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,799
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

119
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,239
I'm playing a part.
How can you not trust me?

120
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,559
You can understand,
given how we started.

121
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,390
I can't believe you'd
throw that in my face.

122
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,520
I don't even see you denying this.

123
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,440
I'll tell you what.
Call me when you grow up.

124
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,679
Don't expect that to happen
any time soon!

125
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,119
I have the best job
in the entire world!

126
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:25,280
The most adorable guy came over,
and I got to dress him up all day!

127
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,799
Rachel has a new doll!

128
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,960
I wish he was. I'd get a Rachel
doll and bump them together...

129
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,280
... and make kissing noises.

130
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,280
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized! Joshua.

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,159
What do I smell?

132
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,479
I don't know. It smells good.

133
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,119
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.

134
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
Please have some.

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,919
I've been fiddling around,
making delicious treats.

136
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,469
The new Playboy.

137
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,400
Just something I picked up.

138
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:14,679
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever!

139
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,359
What?

140
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,080
Something Joshua said about
v-necks, but you had to be there.

141
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,679
How does Jason look in a v-neck?

142
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,479
-It's Joshua.
-Whatever.

143
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,760
Wait. Wait. This isn't take-out!

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,599
-Hate to eat and run.
-Please don't go!

145
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,000
I've got porn for you too.

146
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
I don't need it.

147
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,349
People are supposed
to hang out here.

148
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,320
Why? What's the big deal?

149
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,799
I'm the hostess.

150
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,719
Not those guys.
I'm always the hostess.

151
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,919
When I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

152
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,229
I served the best air.

153
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Why make a big thing out of everyone
hanging out in the big apartment?

154
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,080
They took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

155
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm done now. They've suffered enough.

156
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,479
You should have just
made them hang out here.

157
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,909
That's true.

158
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,840
This place will be 10 times
better than that place.

159
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,080
Are we going
to trash their place?

160
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,479
Steps!

161
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,640
Slut!

162
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,590
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy's sleeping with that guy!

163
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,440
-What?
-You were right?

164
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,080
I confronted her,
and she didn't deny it.

165
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,039
I don't live here!

166
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,000
Wait, are you sure?

167
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,919
I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

168
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,880
Then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's....

169
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,960
-Beefsteak Charlie's?
-Yes!

170
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,280
You and I
have always been....

171
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,559
-Do you need help?
-I got it.

172
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,679
I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

173
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:35,919
I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

174
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,510
-It's so frustrating.
-Ask him out.

175
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,119
Totally. That's such a turn-on.

176
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,679
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

177
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,070
That's the turn-on.

178
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,520
He just got a divorce.
He's probably nervous around women.

179
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Just make the first move.

180
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,640
-I've never asked a guy out.
-You've never asked a guy out?

181
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,830
No, have you?

182
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,960
Thousands of times!

183
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,320
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

184
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,760
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

185
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,479
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say...

186
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,309
... "Hey. How you doing?"

187
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,840
Oh, please!

188
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,919
How you doing?

189
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,070
I'm going to do that.
I'm going to call and ask him out.

190
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,960
I can do that. Ask him out.

191
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,080
"How you doing?"

192
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,880
It's Rachel Greene, from Bloomingdale's.

193
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,080
I was just wondering if you...

194
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,150
... Ieft your wallet
at the store today?

195
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,280
We found a wallet, and we--

196
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,190
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

197
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,159
Well, let's see.
This license belongs to...

198
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:08,239
... belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

199
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,000
Sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

200
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,960
-You've done that 1,000 times?
-I've never done that.

201
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,960
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.

202
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,400
You got to give him something
he can't say no to.

203
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,320
Invite him to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

204
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,479
-Really?
-Absolutely, and if not, can I go?

205
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,880
What the heck is that?

206
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,679
Did she call?

207
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,760
No. Sorry.

208
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Maybe I should call her.

209
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,549
Forget her, man. You don't need her.

210
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,150
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

211
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,119
Well, yeah, but you know,
what if I was wrong?

212
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,919
How might you be wrong?

213
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,159
What if she didn't actually
sleep with the guy?

214
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,840
Tell me she told you this.

215
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,080
She didn't have to.
I saw the play. There was no heat.

216
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,200
-Back me up.
-That's your basis?

217
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,080
That's not backing me up!

218
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,789
Look, you said,
with the offstage and the heat--

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,119
That was just a theory.
A lot of theories didn't pan out.

220
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:34,679
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

221
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,479
Oh, my God!

222
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,200
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with--"

223
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,080
"It's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets--"

224
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,320
"Who likes the Knicks?"

225
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,510
What do you think?

226
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,080
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

227
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
... I think you look great.

228
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,840
Oh, yeah, you look great.

229
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,919
This looks great.

230
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,710
So you like it?

231
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,080
I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'll wear it home.

232
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,080
-Great.
-Thank you so much for all your help.

233
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,679
Well, I guess this is it.

234
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,309
Thanks.

235
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,200
I'll see you in the spring
for the bathing suits.

236
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,469
You don't want to do that now?

237
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,119
That's okay.

238
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll see you around sometime.

239
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,679
Basketball!

240
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,440
Sorry?

241
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,320
I have two tickets
to the Knicks game tonight...

242
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,869
... just as a thank-you for this week.

243
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,599
That would be great!

244
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,799
-Really?
-That would be fantastic!

245
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,479
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!

246
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,040
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

247
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,469
Good morning.

248
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:24,479
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

249
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,319
I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

250
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,079
I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

251
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,439
I wish you'd called me.

252
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,280
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

253
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,760
I think this is a good thing.

254
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,349
We've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

255
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:45,270
I know for me, but--

256
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,199
Nick's pants?

257
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,839
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one!

258
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,160
-For next time, what do you say?
-"I have an extra ticket. "

259
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,439
"An extra ticket. "
Not "two tickets. "

260
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,229
The first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

261
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,119
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.

262
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,119
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.

263
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,479
Okay, it's ready.

264
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,750
Come on.

265
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,069
What's ready?

266
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,280
Just come.

267
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,280
Oh, my God!

268
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
This is beautiful!

269
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,670
Did you work for two days straight?

270
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,040
Pretty much.

271
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,560
What do you think of the floor?

272
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,719
I don't know.
Looks the same.

273
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,839
You used to have carpet.

274
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,680
I made snacks.

275
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,119
Please, just hang out.

276
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,079
I'm going to rest my eyes
for just a bit.

277
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,359
Do you want us to come back later?

278
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,479
No, no, no. Stay.
Just keep talking.

279
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,920
I'm always the hostess.

280
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,719
How'd it go?

281
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,079
-She wasn't sleeping with him.
-Good!

282
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,280
She is now.

283
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,479
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

284
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:38,670
You know a person, then they
turn around and sleep with Nick.

285
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,040
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

286
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,800
I hate him.
And I hate her.

287
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,589
I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault.

288
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,680
How? How is it your fault?

289
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,920
I should have called.

290
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,510
If I'd called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick.

291
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,199
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his man-nipples!

292
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,079
This is not your fault.

293
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,680
Your fight does not
justify her sleeping with someone.

294
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,280
Well, if she thought
they were on a break....

295
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,640
One of your customers left
his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

296
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,880
-Will you call him?
-Yes, I will. Absolutely.

297
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,199
Hello, Rachel.

298
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,280
Hi, Joshua.

299
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:56,079
-I left my wallet here on purpose.
-Really?

300
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,479
I just wanted to see you again.

301
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,479
Oh, I'm glad.

302
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,880
Rachel, I'd like to say
something to you.

303
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,079
How you doing?
