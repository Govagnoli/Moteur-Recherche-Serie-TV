1
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:10,329
<i>All right, it's a new day.</i>
<i>That stuff about Rachel?</i>

2
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:15,931
<i>You don 't feel that now. It was crazy.</i>
<i>You're fine. You're better than fine.</i>

3
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:21,167
<i>You are, as your friend Tony</i>
<i>would say, ''Great!''</i>

4
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:27,131
<i>Everything's normal.</i>
<i>She's just your friend, Rachel.</i>

5
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:32,766
<i>Your friend, Rachel.</i>
<i>Your friend. Rachel.</i>

6
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:39,523
-Hi, sweetie.
<i>-Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!</i>

7
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,204
The One Where Chandler Takes A Bath

8
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:24,683
Are you--? Are you high?

9
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:27,889
l had the most amazing bath.

10
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:31,324
-Really? l don't like baths.
-You like them with me.

11
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:35,486
Honey, it's not the bath l enjoy.
lt's the wet, naked lady.

12
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:40,052
-Baths are so relaxing.
-Really? What do you do?

13
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:44,007
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

14
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,528
How dirty do you think l am?

15
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:52,164
lf you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you'd love it.

16
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:54,409
lt'd take all your stress away.

17
00:01:54,613 --> 00:02:00,085
lt's 2:00 on Wednesday, l'm watching
<i>Road Rules.</i> How stressed am l?

18
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:05,927
Hey, Chandler.
l really need to talk to you.

19
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,366
ls this a cold pizza
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

20
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:15,283
-Well, neither.
-Oh, my God, what's up?

21
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:22,289
l don't know. lt's just. . . .
Lately, l've been feeling. . . .

22
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,288
Okay, here's what it is.

23
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,682
-l feel a lot better. Thanks.
-Wait a minute. Just come back.

24
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,961
You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

25
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:46,485
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

26
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:51,090
But that's different. There are rules
there too, know what l mean?

27
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,561
Do you?

28
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:59,964
lt was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place.

29
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:05,003
Yes, when Monica and l were
in London, we were both in London.

30
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,685
This is a bad idea.
Forget all about it.

31
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:12,010
This conversation between you and me.

32
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:14,644
lf that.

33
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:22,526
Ross, don't forget
that doctor's appointment.

34
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,162
-Right.
-To find out the sex of the baby?

35
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:29,327
We don't wanna know
as long as it's happy and healthy.

36
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,643
Yep, healthy. And cute.

37
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,526
-Smart. With an aptitude for science.
-Popular.

38
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:38,009
Are you two talking
about the same baby?

39
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:42,606
-Have you thought of names?
-l've come up with a bunch.

40
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,281
-Really? Me too.
-Me too.

41
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,091
Really?

42
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:52,003
lf it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

43
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:58,609
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

44
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,969
Rach, what were you thinking?

45
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:04,006
l was thinking if it's a girl. . .

46
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:08,411
. . .how about Sandrene? lt's French.

47
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:13,204
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

48
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:19,050
-Fine. What do you have?
-lt's for a boy.

49
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:22,006
l know it's a little out there, but. . .

50
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,371
. . .Darwin.

51
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:29,049
Our child will be beaten
in the schoolyard.

52
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,642
Yeah, by Sandrene.

53
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:34,566
You're saying that
because l said no to you.

54
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,923
l'm really, really not.

55
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:39,448
How about you each get five vetoes?

56
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:43,851
-That sounds fair.
-l don't think you'll need it.

57
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:47,369
lf it's a girl, Rain.

58
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:51,250
-Veto.
-Why?

59
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:54,724
Rain? ''Hi, my name is Rain.

60
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:59,808
l have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat. ''

61
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,003
l know her!

62
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:07,007
l bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

63
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:13,525
-Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
-Why do you hate our child?

64
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,203
-Fine, you go.
-Okay. James.

65
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:20,043
-But only if it's a girl.
-Veto.

66
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:22,682
l like Ruth. What about Ruth?

67
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:26,602
Oh, l'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

68
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:30,773
-How about Dayton?
-Veto. Stewart.

69
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,531
Veto. Sawyer.

70
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,963
-Veto. Helen.
-Veto.

71
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,411
ls it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

72
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:46,373
Boy, do l have a surprise for you.

73
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,370
Sex on the balcony?

74
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:52,452
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

75
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,763
-What?
-l drew you a bath.

76
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:59,603
l don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of sex on the balcony?

77
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,606
Try it for me.
l used all my best stuff.

78
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:07,927
l lit candles, l put on music.
l used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

79
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:13,167
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

80
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:19,287
-This does butch it up a bit.
-l swear, you will love it.

81
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:22,451
lf l do this,
can we discuss balcony sex?

82
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:23,881
Absolutely.

83
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,406
But l know how
that discussion's gonna go.

84
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:42,409
<i>All right, this isn 't so bad.</i>
<i>I like the flowery smell.</i>

85
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:46,802
<i>Which is okay,</i>
<i>because I've got my boat.</i>

86
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,291
-So?
-Oh, my God.

87
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:57,527
l told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe l can give you a facial.

88
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,691
l'm gonna need a bigger boat.

89
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:12,129
l don't think you had
an open mind about Ruth.

90
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,245
Little Ruthie Geller?
How cute is that?

91
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:20,322
Oh, my God, l can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

92
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:25,846
All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in the sex of the baby?

93
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:29,932
-No, we're not.
-You have it right there?

94
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:35,645
You know if it's a boy or a girl?
Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

95
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,128
But if you don't wanna know. . . .

96
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:42,122
-No, we wanna wait. Right?
-Right. Right.

97
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,722
Oh, l'll be right back.

98
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,567
l know it's really not my place. . .

99
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:52,322
. . .but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

100
00:07:56,773 --> 00:08:00,129
So, which of these babies
is the ugliest?

101
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,171
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

102
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,132
They're babies.
They're all beautiful.

103
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,212
-Third one from the left?
-Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

104
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:16,403
l think it knows l'm talking about it.
Don't you--? You're looking!

105
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,012
-l didn't!
-l saw you!

106
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:20,647
Fine, l did,
but l didn't see anything.

107
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:24,289
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

108
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:28,812
-But l didn't--
-Don't tell me! l don't wanna know!

109
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,363
l couldn't, because l don't know!

110
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:36,084
l swear l didn't see anything!
lt was just a momentary lapse.

111
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,405
Don't you have any self-control?

112
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:43,891
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

113
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,492
Hello?

114
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:52,527
Can you come in here?
There's something wrong.

115
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,685
You know what?
l think l'll wait out here.

116
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,091
l'm in the bathtub.

117
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,450
-What's wrong?
-l drew a bath, but l did it wrong.

118
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:11,091
The water's tepid, the salt didn't
dissolve and is now lodged places.

119
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:16,891
And the scents l used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?

120
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,693
-What?
-Bath salts.

121
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,572
They're starting to effervesce.

122
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:28,291
lt's different. lt's interesting.

123
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,133
Let's talk about something else.

124
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:35,491
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

125
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:39,888
l actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

126
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,489
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

127
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:47,606
-l had the same conversation.
-What was he talking about?

128
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:53,092
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since he was in <i>Macbeth.</i>

129
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:59,723
-That was a long night.
-What exactly did he say to you?

130
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,802
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

131
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:07,248
-Not to me.
-What'd he tell you?

132
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,411
He asked about you, me and London.

133
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:14,612
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

134
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:18,607
Okay. So you, me and London.

135
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:21,413
Looking at people differently.

136
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:25,168
Maybe he wants to do
what you and l did in London.

137
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,523
But what'd he mean by ''rules''?

138
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:31,448
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

139
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:35,527
-He's looking at her differently.
-Phoebe is his friend.

140
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,843
That'd be breaking the rules.

141
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:41,170
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

142
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:44,531
-You guys?
-Just a minute!

143
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:48,886
-That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
-You don't say anything.

144
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:54,491
Why would l? That two of our friends
could start a great love affair?

145
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:59,124
They'd have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

146
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:02,490
-l won't let you say anything.
-Stay here.

147
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,769
Oh, God!

148
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,444
l brought back your iron.

149
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:14,004
l thought l lost it.
l got a new one a month ago.

150
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:17,489
Oh, just as well. l broke this one.

151
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,645
-What?
-Nothing.

152
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,528
l really shouldn't say.
l'm really not supposed to.

153
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:30,967
Fine.

154
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:36,812
-lt's a humdinger.
-Too bad you can't tell me.

155
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,488
Somebody likes you!

156
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:45,888
-ls it Chandler?
-No!

157
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:50,132
-Then tell him to stop staring.
-lt's Joey.

158
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,806
Really? Joey? You don't say.

159
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:59,484
-Would you be interested?
-l don't know, l don't know.

160
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:04,683
You know, l mean, on the one hand,
''Mother, may l?''

161
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:08,290
But, you know, on the other hand. . . .

162
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:12,723
No. No, l can't. We're friends.

163
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:15,533
Oh, no. l don't wanna risk
what we have.

164
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:20,761
l guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

165
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:25,285
Sure. l mean, it's Joey.
l don't want him to get hurt.

166
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:30,090
Well, l must say, l am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

167
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:34,048
-Not Chandler. Just Joey.
-Sure.

168
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:46,483
You know what?
l'm coming around on the name Ruth.

169
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,327
l'd consider naming our child that.

170
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:54,250
Rach, l can't tell you
how much that means to me.

171
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,284
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

172
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:05,328
You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

173
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:09,088
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

174
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,052
You did see. You know it's a boy!

175
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,410
l didn't see anything.
l changed my mind.

176
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:18,366
l don't think so.
You're giving me Ruth. . .

177
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,685
. . .so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

178
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:27,565
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

179
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,968
l would-- Sequoia!

180
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:33,051
-Veto.
-Fine.

181
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:41,808
Unless you anticipated that
l would figure all this out. . .

182
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:45,244
. . .and you know that
it actually is a girl.

183
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,809
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

184
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:54,451
Well, l'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

185
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:59,847
-But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
-Not like this!

186
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,371
Hey. What's up?

187
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:09,566
-Joey, l know.
-What?

188
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,926
-l know.
-What?

189
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:19,572
-l know about your feelings.
-Oh, my God, you do?

190
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:24,767
l'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

191
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:29,962
l know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for them.

192
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,523
l mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

193
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,723
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

194
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:42,651
l know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

195
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,532
She's my pregnant friend
who's Ross' ex!

196
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:50,927
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.

197
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:56,530
What am l gonna do? l keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

198
00:14:56,733 --> 00:15:00,169
l made a list of everything
l don't like about her.

199
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,324
-You wanna hear it?
-Yeah.

200
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:10,527
''She made me switch to light mayo. ''
That's it! That's all l got!

201
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,726
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

202
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:20,772
-Joey, this is probably just a crush.
-You think?

203
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:25,052
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but it goes away.

204
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:29,565
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. lt's a crush!

205
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,532
l'm Joey. l don't get deep feelings.

206
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,531
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

207
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:40,722
l've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

208
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:45,723
-And l'm sure you've had them for us.
-Not really.

209
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:48,933
Throw me a bone here.

210
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,932
So l called the doctor.

211
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,486
-Now we both know the sex of the baby.
-What?

212
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:08,652
That's right.
The student has become the master.

213
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:14,565
-Ross, l swear. l don't know.
-Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

214
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,561
-A what?
-You really didn't know?

215
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,287
-We're having a girl?
-No.

216
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,285
-That's what you said.
-No.

217
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:27,446
-You said girl.
-Yes. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

218
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,928
l'm not! We're having a girl!

219
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:35,293
Sometimes l can't believe it's with
you, but still, we're having a girl!

220
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:40,283
l know! You know what?
l'm putting Ruth back on the table.

221
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:44,486
Yes, we'll have ourselves
a little baby Ruth.

222
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,328
-Permission to veto.
-Yes, please.

223
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,443
Do l smell essential oils?

224
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:03,487
l'm gonna take a bath.
l was gonna get a magazine.

225
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,286
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,048
Leaving my troubles behind?

227
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:29,091
You're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

228
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,803
lt's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

229
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,842
You can have the bath,
but l am taking your boat.

230
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,972
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

231
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,492
Hi, bubbles. Manly.

232
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,253
l thought l'd let you know
how it went.

233
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,968
-You told her?
-She pulled it out of me!

234
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:55,882
She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?

235
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,693
You were wrong. He doesn't like me.

236
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:03,683
How would you like it if l told you
that Lee Majors liked you. . .

237
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:07,892
. . .and you found out
that he didn't like you?

238
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:14,890
-l don't think l'd care.
-Really? Lee Majors is hot.

239
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:19,691
-Hello?
-We're in the bathroom!

240
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:24,523
-Why?
-Because it's a relaxing time!

241
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,688
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Oh, my God.

242
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:34,324
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

243
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,848
-lt's Rachel!
-You like Rachel?

244
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:41,729
lt's no big deal. Phoebe and l talked.
lt's a crush. lt'll go away.

245
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:45,084
Dude, you gotta rearrange
your bubbles.

246
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,883
Mazel tov.

247
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:53,688
Ross and l were looking for you.

248
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:58,006
What are we all doing in here?
Oh, my.

249
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:02,770
Honey, cover it up with the boat.

250
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:04,442
Hello?

251
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,407
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

252
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:16,044
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

253
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,572
-Did you tell them?
-l waited for you.

254
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:23,207
-Tell us what?
-We're having a girl.

255
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,689
Oh, wow! Really?

256
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,291
l'll get you later.

257
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:41,327
<i>All right. It's a new day.</i>
<i>And it's just a crush.</i>

258
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:44,133
<i>That's all. Just a little crush.</i>

259
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:48,002
<i>All that worrying I was doing?</i>
<i>That was crazy.</i>

260
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,690
<i>Like my friend the bird here</i>
<i>would say, ''It was cuckoo!''</i>

261
00:19:55,973 --> 00:20:00,285
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>
<i>It's just a crush.</i>

262
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:04,682
-Hi, sweetie.
<i>-I love you.</i>

263
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:15,403
lt's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

264
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:19,523
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

265
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,442
-l'm not touching you.
-You're not?

266
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:28,408
-lt's the salts.
-Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.

267
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,644
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
