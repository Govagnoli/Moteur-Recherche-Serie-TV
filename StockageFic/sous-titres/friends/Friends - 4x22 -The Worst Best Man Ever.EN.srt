1
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,989
That was the 10th time
I've peed here.

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,159
It's also the 10th time
you've told us.

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:15,399
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,399
It's easier having babies playing
"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!

5
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,680
I am so sick of being pregnant!

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,229
My only happiness
is from a cup of coffee...

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,000
... which is decaf
because I'm pregnant!

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,119
You want a cookie?

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,349
Thank you so much!

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,389
So, honey, how are those
mood swings coming?

11
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,000
I haven't had any yet.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,119
The One with the
Worst Best Man Ever

14
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,440
Here's the ring.

15
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:42,559
Yes, yes!
A thousand times, yes!

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,279
Any ideas for the bachelor party?

17
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,239
Before rings and bachelor parties...

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,199
... you have to decide
who your best man will be.

19
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,040
Oh, it's awkward.

20
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,080
I already asked Chandler.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,470
He got to do it
at your first wedding.

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,760
I figured you'd understand.
I've known him longer.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,789
I don't have any brothers.
I'll never be a best man.

24
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,639
You can be the best man
when I get married.

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll never get to be a best man!

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,919
Wait, wait.

27
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:21,960
So you'll be my best man twice,
and I won't be yours at all?

28
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,350
Of course, you can be my best man.

29
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,080
What about me?
You said I could.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,839
I'm not getting married!

31
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,039
It's a question
for science-fiction writers.

32
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,960
I can't believe it's not me.

33
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,350
How could it not be me?

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,589
I'm not even--

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,919
You know what?
That's it.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,759
From now on,
Joey will be my best man.

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,880
Shame about you, though.

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,839
-Stop it.
-What?

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,919
One of the babies is kicking.

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,479
That's a good thing.

41
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,960
It's not kicking me.
It's kicking another baby.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,919
Don't make me come in there!

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,039
Do you have a big bowl
I can borrow?

44
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,880
There's one under the cabinet.

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,990
Why do you need it?

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,800
We're having a party tomorrow night.

47
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,839
Are you planning on inviting us?

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,839
No. Later!

49
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,949
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,720
Hormones.

51
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,229
How come you're having a party
and we're not invited?

52
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,520
It's Ross' bachelor party.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,639
Are you bachelors?

54
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,440
Are you strippers?

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,440
Then you're not invited.

56
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,919
Then you're not invited
to our party either.

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,679
What party?

58
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,080
Phoebe's baby shower.

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,190
Baby shower? That so doesn't sound
like something I want to do.

60
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,240
I can't believe
I'm going to have a party.

61
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,869
That's so great.
A party!

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,679
I don't know why.

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,799
This is what I got going
for the party liquor-wise.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,429
-Get a lot of liquor.
-Great.

65
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:31,440
In terms of the invite list,
I got you, me and Chandler.

66
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:34,839
I'll invite Gunther because
we're talking pretty loud.

67
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,679
I'll be there.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,359
I know it's your party...

69
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:42,799
... but I'd like to limit
the number of museum geeks.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,839
Let's not invite any anthropologists.
Just the dinosaur dudes.

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,679
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.

72
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,799
Hey, what are you doing?

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.

74
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,399
Good luck trying
to top the last one.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,200
It won't be that difficult
since this one won't be...

76
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,440
... in the basement of a Pizza Hut.

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,070
I'm Ross, I'm Ross.
I'm too good for the Hut.

78
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,910
I gotta go pick up Ben.
Everything sounds great.

79
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,239
Keep it on the mellow side.
A few guys hanging out.

80
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,200
No strippers or anything.

81
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,200
You got it.

82
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,880
See you later.

83
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,149
Have fun planning your mellow party.

84
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,200
There will be strippers. He didn't
say anything about no strippers.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,000
He just said, "No strippers. "

86
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,720
I chose not to hear that.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,119
Look what I got, look what I got!

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,200
They make these for little people!

89
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,440
Little village People.

90
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,440
Look at this one.
This is my favorite.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
That is so sweet.

92
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,200
Phoebe will love dressing them.

93
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,480
Except she won't be the one
who gets to dress them.

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,440
She won't get to keep the babies.

95
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,679
My God, we are throwing
the most depressing baby shower!

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,519
Unless we give her all gifts
she can use after her pregnancy.

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
Like regular coffee.
Tequila!

98
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,959
And those leather pants
she's always wanted!

99
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,640
She'll love that!

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,359
What the hell is this?

101
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,079
You thought it'd make me feel better?

102
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,640
To give me something
I can't use for two months?

103
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,279
This sucks!

104
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,359
What's my next present?

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,670
We don't have anything.

106
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,589
Listen, about the stripper....

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,029
Good call!

108
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,670
A little announcement.

109
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,279
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,559
What's my last name?

111
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,320
Central Perk?

112
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,630
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,600
Hey, Gunther!
Don't forget your shirt.

114
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,839
What are those?

115
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,640
Little party favors.
Check it out.

116
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,600
Just want everybody to know the
position of my best man is still open.

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,799
So is the position of the bride.

118
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,470
Great.

119
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,160
Smooth, man.

120
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,790
You got some chili on your neck.

121
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,440
I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great!

122
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,799
See you guys Monday morning.

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,600
-Thanks, Joey.
-Don't forget your shirt.

124
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey, museum geeks!
Party's over.

125
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,399
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,839
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.

127
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,200
Boys, come on out.
Here you go.

128
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Look at the birdies!
Are those yours?

129
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,399
They let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?

130
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,159
And I got the duck
totally trained too.

131
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Stare at the wall.

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Hardly move.

133
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,239
Be white.

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,719
You are good at that.

135
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,919
I had fun tonight.

136
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,039
You throw one hell of a party.

137
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,000
It was great meeting you.

138
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,830
If any of my friends ever get married
or have a birthday or a Tuesday....

139
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,190
Yeah, that'd be great.

140
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,679
So, I guess, good night.

141
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,229
Unless you want to hang around.

142
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,200
I'll let you play with my duck.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,679
Stripper!

144
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,400
The stripper stole the ring!

145
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,190
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!

146
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,880
-What?
-The ring is gone!

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,039
Just give me a minute
to wake up for this.

148
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,400
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man!

149
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,599
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.

150
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,719
I wake up, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!

151
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
-You slept with her?
-Of course!

152
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,109
I wanted to apologize if I seemed
a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,039
Just the hormones.

154
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,479
-No, we--
-Hormones.

155
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,640
I wanted to say thank you.
It was so sweet.

156
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,880
You seem to be doing much better.

157
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,150
-How are things going?
-Good.

158
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,190
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,799
We were just talking about me
not going to Ross' wedding.

160
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:51,599
It just might be too hard,
given the history and all that.

161
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,590
This reminds me of the time
when I lived on the street.

162
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,880
This guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.

163
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,640
How is this like that?

164
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,640
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.

165
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,239
Because that was an actual problem.

166
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:13,840
And yours is just a bunch
of high-school crap...

167
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,599
... that nobody really gives!

168
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,599
I'm sorry. I just thought--

169
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,200
Here come the water works.

170
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,750
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,919
I called 911and they yelled at me,
This is an emergency!

172
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:45,799
Thanks again for the party.
The guys from work had a blast.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,789
One of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,960
Another one had never been
to a party before.

175
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,960
So that wedding ring.

176
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,000
Man, that is nice.

177
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,400
I might pick one of those
babies up for myself.

178
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,830
Where might one get one of those?

179
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,840
When my grandmother first came
to this country...

180
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,710
... that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

181
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,799
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

182
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,640
It's been in my family
for generations.

183
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,479
Every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

184
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,679
So you might say it's a magic ring.

185
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

186
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,630
My ring?
My wedding ring?

187
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,239
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

188
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,520
How could this happen?

189
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,719
It all started when you said,
"Joey, you be my best man! "

190
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,640
All right.
I'm going to call the cops.

191
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,039
I screwed up.
But you don't have to turn me in.

192
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,400
Not on you, on the stripper.

193
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,039
I already did that.

194
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,119
They said they'd look into it
after they solve all the murders.

195
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:13,750
-We'll call the company that sent her.
-I did that too.

196
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,840
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

197
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,039
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring. "

198
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,760
So there's nothing we can do?

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,719
How could this happen?

200
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,559
Look, Ross, I am so sorry.

201
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:36,630
What if we just called her...

202
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,719
... used a fake name
and had her come to my office?

203
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,270
That sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!

204
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,679
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

205
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,400
It's so good.

206
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,640
Thanks.

207
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,599
-Good.
-So glad you like it.

208
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,400
What?

209
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,200
She made the tea.

210
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,239
I think I just had a contraction.

211
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,359
-What?
-My God!

212
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,760
I felt one a few minutes ago.

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,719
That definitely was one.

214
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,799
You can't have the baby here.

215
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,200
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!

216
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,159
It's okay. I'll boil some water
and rip up some sheets.

217
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,159
It's probably false labor.

218
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:34,599
That can happen near the end.
Just get the book.

219
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,479
Get the book!

220
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,280
-The Bible?
-I don't know!

221
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,840
All right.
This is great.

222
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,679
You get behind the desk.

223
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,039
When she comes in,
she won't recognize you because--

224
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, why would she?

225
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,760
And then you buzz Ross and l.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,880
You be Mr. Gonzales,
and I'll be Mr. Wong.

227
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,599
Diverse.

228
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,880
Anybody call for security?

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,880
You be cool.

230
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,280
Which one is Gunther Central Perk?

231
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,520
Where's my ring?
My dead grandmother's wedding ring.

232
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,750
Way to be cool, man.

233
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,469
What?

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,280
There was a ring in a box.
After you left, it was gone.

235
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,479
You think I stole some ring?

236
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Just save yourself the time
and confess.

237
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,039
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

238
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,239
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.
I make $1,600 a week.

239
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,400
Any of you guys make that?

240
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Marry me.

241
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,840
It was in my room all night.
She didn't take it.

242
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,000
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it. Then who did?

243
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,440
We're trying to think.

244
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:31,239
I don't get how you know
it's false labor.

245
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,840
Do you see any babies?

246
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,719
How do you feel?

247
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,080
Okay, I guess.

248
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,440
I don't know.

249
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,760
I know it's going
to be over soon so....

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,440
But isn't that a good thing?

251
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,150
-You said you were sick of this.
-I know.

252
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,039
Usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...

253
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,429
... you get to do the mom thing.

254
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,000
But I'll be sitting around in my
leather pants, drinking tequila.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,150
Some moms do that.

256
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,280
That's even sadder.

257
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,439
Look, I know what I got myself into.

258
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,880
It's just that
now that they're in me...

259
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,880
... it's like I know them and....

260
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,349
It just won't be easy
when these babies have to go away.

261
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,040
I know, sweetie.

262
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,640
But it's not like
you won't have anything.

263
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,040
You'll have nieces and nephews.
That's even better.

264
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,520
No, really.

265
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,760
You won't be the one
worrying about saving for college.

266
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,229
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

267
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:49,160
Or putting them on Ritalin
when they just won't calm down.

268
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:55,949
You'll be the one they run away to.
The one they talk to about sex.

269
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,239
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

270
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,400
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

271
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,199
I am pretty cool.

272
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,239
And you know what else?
Are they going to love you!

273
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,199
They are going to love me.

274
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,680
Thanks, you guys. Again.

275
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, sweetie.

276
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,160
What?

277
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,390
Just kidding.

278
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,030
Oh, my God!

279
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,040
Got you again.
You're so easy!

280
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,599
If anything happens to him--

281
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,640
The vet said
it's a simple procedure.

282
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,760
Things can go wrong.
What if he doesn't make it?

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
He will, Joe.

284
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,079
But what if he doesn't?

285
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,989
He's such a good duck.

286
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,719
I'm so worried about him!

287
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,800
Somebody lose a ring?

288
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,390
Oh, my God!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

289
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,239
How's the duck?

290
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,280
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

291
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,199
Great.

292
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,119
Thanks for being so cool.

293
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,560
No, that's all right.

294
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,199
You made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

295
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,439
-It's not your fault.
-Yeah, it is.

296
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,319
You wouldn't have lost it.

297
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,800
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,800
-No, you should.
-Don't argue.

299
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,800
I get to choose my best man.

300
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,199
I want both you guys.

301
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,479
Really?

302
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,040
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

303
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,640
You two are my--

304
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm lucky to have just one good--

305
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,959
Thanks, man.

306
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,439
I got to go check something, okay?

307
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,310
-What a baby!
-Total wuss.
