1
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:07,090
Listen, l don't care
what the computer says.

2
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:10,489
We didn't take a bag
of Meshugga Nuts.

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:15,487
And we did not watch
<i>Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.</i>

4
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:21,288
-Were you in our room last night?
-No.

5
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:31,851
l was told the movie's name
wouldn't appear on the bill.

6
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,487
-Checking out of the bridal suite.
-Right, l'm no longer a bride.

7
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:42,482
l'll never be a bride again.
Now l'm just someone's wife.

8
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,847
And l'm the happiest guy
in the world.

9
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:51,807
-We have so much to look forward to.
-Yeah, right.

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,885
-The honeymoon.
-That's not till Thursday.

11
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:57,447
-Wedding pictures.
-lt takes weeks.

12
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:03,204
-Not the disposable cameras.
-l knew l married you for a reason!

13
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:07,281
l'll go get them developed,
and you can go home.

14
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:15,486
-What did you take a picture of?
-Nothing. lt was something.

15
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:19,090
Ross has the cameras.
ls he checked out yet?

16
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:22,284
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

17
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:26,610
-And he has a good 1 1 minutes left.
-So?

18
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:30,009
He never checks out a minute
before he has to.

19
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:36,321
Once we got a late checkout, he got
so excited, it was our best sex ever.

20
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:40,087
Until he screamed out ''Radisson''
at the end.

21
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:45,888
Okay, l'll get Ross, get the cameras
and get them developed.

22
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:49,925
Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!

23
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:54,527
-Here's your bill.
-Thanks.

24
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:58,328
Champagne, strawberries. . . .

25
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:04,488
Oh, my God! l can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

26
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah, that's sad.
Meshugga Nut?

27
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,283
The One with the Red Sweater

28
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,808
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this?

29
00:02:55,012 --> 00:03:00,291
-Why not? lt's included in the price.
-Yeah, but you don't need--

30
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:04,047
-What is this?
-Thread.

31
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:08,565
Score!
Where are the disposable cameras?

32
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,606
-What cameras?
-Last night l asked you to take them.

33
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:16,771
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, before we cut the cake, l said--

34
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:22,490
Yeah, you asked me for a favor. Then
my Uncle Murray gave you a check.

35
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:27,283
Then you said, ''Why is it called
a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?''

36
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:34,370
-Yeah, then you did that.
-So you don't have the cameras?

37
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,723
-No, sorry.
-They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!

38
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:41,129
They're here somewhere.
l'll help you look.

39
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,483
-Great.
-ln three minutes.

40
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:04,688
You're gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

41
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:12,966
They're calling out to me.
This guy even crawled into my lap.

42
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:17,529
He wouldn't mind if l opened one.
What do you think it is?

43
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:24,291
A mirror that when you look into it,
you see yourself as an old woman.

44
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,048
A tiny salt shaker!

45
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,927
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

46
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,329
Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.

47
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:39,884
Okay, l'll wait for Chandler
to open up the rest.

48
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:46,490
Although, you know, this is
part of a salt-and-pepper set.

49
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:49,764
lt's only half a present.
What do you think?

50
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:54,170
lt's okay to open one more if
it's a set. lt's probably this one.

51
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,283
Or this one!

52
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,525
-Got any morning sickness?
-The guys don't know, do they?

53
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:06,485
No. Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

54
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:10,249
Right. Chandler still thinks
l'm pregnant.

55
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:14,240
He hasn't asked me how l feel,
or offered to carry my bags.

56
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:18,081
l feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

57
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:21,686
After you, of course.

58
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:27,205
You'll only be pregnant a few more
hours. l'll tell the father today.

59
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:30,290
ls it that tall guy
from the first floor?

60
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:34,047
-No!
-What? l think he's cute.

61
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:37,403
-Then you have his baby.
-l'm trying.

62
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:44,522
lt's so weird. You're gonna tell
this guy today, and he has no idea.

63
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:49,328
You'll just knock on his door
and change his life forever.

64
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:53,161
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

65
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,886
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

66
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:02,122
-Yeah, l guess it's pretty big news.
-Pretty big? lt's huge!

67
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:05,529
God, this guy is walking
around thinking:

68
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:08,969
''l had sex with Rachel Green.
l rock! ''

69
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:12,244
Then, bam! He's a father,
everything's different.

70
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:16,411
Only if he wants it to be.
l won't ask for anything.

71
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:19,524
Okay, now he's walking
around thinking:

72
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:22,570
''Do l want to be a dad?''
Then, bam!

73
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:27,209
-What was that ''bam''?
-l don't know. He's hit by a bus.

74
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:35,686
Joey, what would you do if someone you
slept with told you she was pregnant?

75
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,882
Who called here?

76
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:49,084
Did she sound blond? Any accent?
l gotta make a call.

77
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:52,967
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

78
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,289
lt's not you!
You didn't get anyone pregnant.

79
00:06:56,492 --> 00:07:01,088
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

80
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:05,484
ls somebody pregnant?

81
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:07,850
Oh, yeah! That's me.

82
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:13,008
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

83
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:18,411
Yes, l am.
Oh, my God, l'm gonna have a baby!

84
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:22,282
-Wait, who's the father?
-You don't know him.

85
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:26,286
He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby.

86
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:34,207
Who is this guy? Because l'll track
him down and kick his ass!

87
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,690
-David Linn.
-David Linn!

88
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:44,880
-Who's David Linn?
-Some annoying guy from my gym.

89
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:53,169
-Chandler?
-Did you find the cameras?

90
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:58,002
-No. Did you?
-Yes, that's why l'm under the table.

91
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:03,050
l checked in the lost and found.
No one's turned them in.

92
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:07,928
Great. Those cameras were the only
thing that will cheer Monica up.

93
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,771
You just got married.
Why is she depressed?

94
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:16,763
l'm not going to ask that question.
l can't believe l screwed this up!

95
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,328
l'm sorry, man.

96
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:25,131
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

97
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,682
There's a band.
There'll be dressed-up people.

98
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,884
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

99
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:37,883
No, we buy more of these, throw our
tuxes on and take a few pictures.

100
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,652
We make sure not
to get people's faces.

101
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,444
Are you serious?

102
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:48,329
l'm thinking about your new bride.
Do you really want to let her down?

103
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:51,842
Marriage advice? Really?

104
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,926
This looks just like your wedding.

105
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:59,408
-Same flowers?
-l don't know. Monica picked them.

106
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,807
-The chairs?
-Those too.

107
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:03,684
-The place settings?
-Her.

108
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:06,804
-What did you do?
-l took care of the cameras.

109
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,889
Gift shop?

110
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:17,443
-Did you do it yet?
-Not yet.

111
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:21,201
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

112
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,681
ls it Gunther?

113
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:29,204
-lt's not Gunther!
-Thank God. That hair on a baby?

114
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:36,125
The father is not here. l haven't
told him, and l don't think l can now.

115
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:37,361
Why not?

116
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:43,249
l was walking and thinking, ''l'm gonna
tell the father. '' And then, bam!

117
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:45,889
Bus?

118
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:51,726
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this is.

119
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,883
-But it is huge.
-l know.

120
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,851
But l was thinking
how huge it is for me.

121
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:59,572
l didn't think about the father.

122
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:04,323
You're thinking about it too much.
Tell him and get it over with.

123
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:08,405
lt's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless.

124
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:11,166
Oh, mother of--!

125
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,489
See?

126
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:24,446
-Are we opening presents?
-No. l shouldn't be opening these.

127
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:29,448
Joey, l am out of control!
You have to do me a favor.

128
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:34,891
No matter what l say,
do not let me open another present.

129
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,208
Give me one more.

130
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:46,926
Good, you're here. Pheebs?
Listen. . . .

131
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:50,483
Sit down,
l got something l want to say.

132
00:10:57,252 --> 00:11:02,485
lt's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

133
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:08,483
l always felt that you
and l have a special bond.

134
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:13,485
So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

135
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:18,891
Oh, my God!

136
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,727
Oh, yeah, l'll marry you.

137
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:28,564
-You can't marry him!
-Your day's over, it's my turn.

138
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,084
-Why can't she marry me?
-l can and l will.

139
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:38,930
She's not pregnant.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant.

140
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,487
Oh, my God!

141
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,292
He'd notice
when you didn't have a baby!

142
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,887
lt's Joey!

143
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:55,450
l can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?
Who's the father?

144
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:57,683
We don't know.

145
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:02,728
-l wonder if it's that dude.
-There's a dude?

146
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,251
Who is it?

147
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:10,681
A month ago this guy spent the night.
l didn't see who it was, but. . . .

148
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,282
Was that story over?

149
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,162
The guy left this.

150
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:27,883
Oh, my God!
l know who the father is.

151
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:34,881
People have got
to finish their stories.

152
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:43,802
-Could you take a picture of us?
-Of course.

153
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:52,884
-Would you take one of us?
-Yeah, sure.

154
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,851
Click.

155
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,331
-lt didn't click.
-l heard it.

156
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,848
-There was no flash.
-You won't take our picture?

157
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,890
Yeah, l'll take your picture.

158
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:11,884
-Your finger was covering the lens.
-Who are you, Ansel Adams? Scram!

159
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:19,729
l feel really bad about how
l freaked you out before. . .

160
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,366
. . .so l asked the father
to come here.

161
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:26,406
What? Wait a minute.
How do you know who it is?

162
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:29,843
l may play the fool at times. . .

163
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:35,285
. . .but l'm more than a pretty blond
with an ass that won't quit.

164
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:39,248
l believe this belongs to the father.

165
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:44,287
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

166
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:50,004
You can turn around,
or go in and rip the Band-Aid off.

167
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:53,644
-Let's rip.
-Are you sure?

168
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:56,127
-Phoebe!
-Sorry.

169
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,410
Hey, Rach.

170
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:11,286
Go on-stage. l'll get a picture
of you doing the speech.

171
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:32,165
Will the owner of a 1 995 LeSabre
see the front desk?

172
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:35,369
Your car is about to be towed.

173
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,686
That's my car!

174
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:43,205
-A '95 LeSabre?
-Yes.

175
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,047
-A green LeSabre?
-Yes!

176
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:52,367
-l'm sorry, l meant blue.
-Yes, green-blue.

177
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,844
Well, go. Go move it!

178
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:03,206
Ready for the last picture?
Get ready to run.

179
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:11,889
Congratulations on your wedding.

180
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,204
What's this about?

181
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:21,926
Rachel has something to tell you.

182
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:26,051
And l believe that
this is your red sweater.

183
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:30,171
No, this is my red sweater.

184
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,283
Oh, no.

185
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:40,081
Could l get anyone a coffee?

186
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:43,688
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

187
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,444
What's going on?

188
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:50,725
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

189
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:55,363
But you wear that sweater a lot.
ls it some kind of dare?

190
00:15:56,492 --> 00:16:00,280
l'm actually glad Phoebe called.

191
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:10,680
l was immature, but l've grown up.
l think we should get back together.

192
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:12,928
lt's not the right time.

193
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:17,728
lt is the right time.
l'm ready for more.

194
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:20,127
Let's give it another try.

195
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:23,686
l'm having a baby.

196
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,090
-You can go.
-Thank you.

197
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:41,688
l don't know how
any of these got opened!

198
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:46,246
-You opened them all?
-l know, l am a terrible person.

199
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:49,245
Chandler won't trust me ever again.

200
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:53,604
-You got my parents' gift.
-What is that?

201
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,724
l think it does something
to salami.

202
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,247
-How'd it go?
-What did Tag say?

203
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:05,524
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

204
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:09,890
l do, and l'm so happy for you.

205
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:15,562
Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

206
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:23,210
-Will you ever tell whoever it is?
-l will, just not tonight.

207
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:27,081
No matter what he says,
you're not gonna be alone.

208
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:28,606
l'm not?

209
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,485
No. Listen. . . .

210
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:38,412
lt's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

211
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:43,692
l've always felt like
you and l have a special bond.

212
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:46,241
-Rachel, will you marry me?
-What?

213
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:52,370
-Pheebs, give me the ring back.
-No!

214
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:58,408
Joey, you're so sweet, honey,
but l'm not looking for a husband.

215
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,282
l understand.

216
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:08,890
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to go and lie down.

217
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:17,288
l can't say that didn't hurt.

218
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:22,523
-But l'll take you back, Joey.
-About that, l--

219
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:26,088
-Oh, a Salami Buddy!
-There you go!

220
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:28,690
-We're back!
-Great.

221
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:32,891
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

222
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:36,529
-lt's picture time.
-You're gonna love these.

223
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:41,528
Here's a picture of Ross.
And that's me.

224
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:45,287
And that's me and Ross.

225
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:49,925
And here's our first kiss
as a married couple.

226
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,851
That is a great picture.

227
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:58,285
And interesting, because l found
the cameras in one of our bags.

228
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:03,126
Didn't see that coming.

229
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:06,284
Okay, this isn't our first kiss. . .

230
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:10,371
. . .but it is my first kiss
with this lady.

231
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:17,092
Which l'm sure you'll remember,
so there's no need. . . .

232
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:22,889
-l'll take these to get developed now.
-Good idea.

233
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:30,285
You opened the presents?
We were gonna do that together.

234
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,922
You kissed another woman?

235
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,090
-Call it even?
-Okay.

236
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:46,327
-l'll put these in water.
-You stole those from that wedding?

237
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,364
No, the hotel lobby.

238
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:54,687
They think they can charge me for
some dirty movie and a bag of nuts!

239
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,687
Hey, my sweater!

240
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:05,688
l've been looking for this
for a month.

241
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,724
Oh, my God!

242
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:19,965
Oh, my God!

243
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:31,128
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. Long time no see.

244
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:34,762
-Like your sweater.
-Right back at you.

245
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:42,046
-lt's crazy about Rachel.
-Well, she's one crazy lady.

246
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:47,886
-So whose is it?
-l don't know, some ltalian guy.

247
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:52,487
Come on, read your own label.
See you later.

248
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:55,007
He is so weird.
