1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,199
What is it?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,239
I can't find anything to eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,119
Being pregnant is no piece of cake.
Oh, cake!

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:18,799
Honey, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
What is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,120
Pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

7
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,279
It's me. Listen, there's
something in here I want to eat.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,599
What smells so good?

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,000
Is it the shampoo?
It's guava.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,000
Wait.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Is it my bologna sandwich?

12
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:53,400
I can't believe it! The baby
wants bologna. I can't eat meat.

13
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:54,840
Wait!

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,599
Maybe it's the pickle!

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,479
The One with the Fake Party

16
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,790
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

17
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,919
What are you writing?

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,239
Joshua's coming in, and since
I don't have the guts to ask him out...

19
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,800
... I'll sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,639
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

21
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,000
... never go out of style. "

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,000
What did you throw away?

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,919
-Hi, guys.
-What have you been up to?

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
We went to see a collection of
victorian doorknobs at the museum.

25
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,720
Without me?

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,830
My uncle dragged us there,
but it turned out to be interesting.

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,919
They were so ornate and beautiful.
Look at that.

28
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:30,399
I don't know about England, but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

29
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,039
I got it from the gift shop.

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,080
They have really lax security.

31
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,080
It's a joke.

32
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,399
I've got to be off.
See you.

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,199
You're having a good time.

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,399
She is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

35
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,190
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!

36
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,279
I even signed up
for helicopter classes.

37
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,559
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,839
In two days?
You must be bummed.

39
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,000
She's got to go back,
but I've been prepared for this.

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,789
We knew we had two weeks together
and then that's it.

41
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,600
That's what all
my relationships are like.

42
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:23,440
But in Ross' case,
they both know two weeks is it.

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, I know. I know!

44
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,119
The baby is totally craving meat.

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,800
I made it a soy burger, so that
it'd think it was getting meat.

46
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,800
And I got nauseous.

47
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,119
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,160
But you got that
cool pregnant-lady glow.

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,479
You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

51
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:05,800
-Here's that trench coat you wanted.
-Great.

52
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,199
It's comfortable.

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,199
You could really
flash somebody in this.

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,519
Don't put your hands in the pockets
until you are out of the store.

55
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,549
Why not?

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,399
Well, because...

57
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,790
... we get a lot of--

58
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,679
They ruin it for everybody.

59
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,079
I know.

60
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,670
I wore that sweater
on a date last night.

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,640
It was the first date
since the divorce.

62
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,399
Congratulations.
So do you love her?

63
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,000
She's nice,
but it made me realize...

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,959
... I'm just not ready to be dating.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,399
That's interesting.

66
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,440
-What was that?
-Just an anti-theft device.

67
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,679
Then what's this?

68
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,799
You need that too, because
a thief could just tear this up.

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,600
We have to have a party in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

70
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,910
What's going on?

71
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:19,000
We have to have
a bon voyage party for Emily.

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,399
But it's actually for Joshua.

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,600
He said he's not ready to date.

74
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,600
So I had to invite him to a party.

75
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:32,589
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,480
As much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

77
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,200
... Emily and I won't be here.
She'll come by to say goodbye.

78
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,320
I've got a special evening planned.
Sorry. No party.

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,679
Surprise!

80
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,799
Surprise!

81
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,920
No one's thrown me
a surprise party before.

82
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,799
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

83
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,640
You're so sweet.

84
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,760
And I'm so surprised.

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
You didn't know?

86
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,839
Why are you here
if Joshua's over there?

87
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,549
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,519
Quick! Say something funny.

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,799
Like what?

90
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,679
What's so funny?

91
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,630
"Like what?"

92
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,000
Now that's a thinker.

93
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:48,040
This playing-hard-to-get thing
is not working.

94
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,399
Hand me those cherries.

95
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,510
-Care for a cherry?
-No, thanks.

96
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,600
I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,630
You okay?

98
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,040
All right?

99
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,510
We should probably get going soon.

100
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,239
But the party's just getting started.

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,230
We have to be at The Four Seasons
for drinks in 15 minutes.

102
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,200
Then The Plaza for dinner.

103
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,959
Why did you plan a party
at the same time?

104
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,519
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

105
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,000
It's usually, "Surprise! "
Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye! "

106
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,190
But I'm having such a great time.

107
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,190
Your sister told me that
you dressed up like old ladies...

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,799
... and hosted make-believe
tea parties.

109
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,989
Monica said that, did she?

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,040
Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

111
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,799
A little salami.

112
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,880
What goes on top of the salami?

113
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,279
Pastrami.

114
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,000
You're a genius.

115
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,399
Give me a hand with the zipper.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Up!

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,390
-You changed?
-I just needed my lucky dress.

118
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,159
-Lucky means more cleavage?
-It does for me.

119
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,840
Look at him!
He's so cute.

120
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,840
I just want to grab him and kiss him.

121
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,640
How could I kiss him
without him knowing I like him?

122
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,799
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

123
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,799
-This scene in Footloose--
-Flashdance.

124
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,390
-With that plumber girl?
-A welder.

125
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,559
Were you, like, in the movie?

126
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,400
She takes off her bra under the shirt
and pulls it out the sleeve.

127
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:26,200
very sexy. And classy.

128
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,469
-Or you could use mistletoe.
-It's not Christmas.

129
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,440
-Spin the bottle.
-He's not 11.

130
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you.
It was so thoughtful of you.

131
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,390
You're leaving?

132
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,190
-We have something we have to get to.
-I'll take off too.

133
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,119
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

134
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,880
We've got the whole
big thing planned.

135
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:54,520
What big thing?

136
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,229
Spin-The-Bottle works like this:
I spin.

137
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,159
Lands on Gunther,
so I'd kiss Gunther.

138
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,760
Who wants to go first?

139
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,109
I'll go.

140
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,679
Welcome to America.

141
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,080
Oh, my God!

142
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,799
Two in a row!
Use your tongues now.

143
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,599
All right.

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,080
What are the odds?

145
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,400
That's enough!

146
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,400
Let's let someone else play.

147
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,400
If you didn't want to play,
why'd you come?

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,799
Okay, my turn!

149
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,840
Look at that!

150
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,239
Oh, my God.

151
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,559
The baby just kicked!

152
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:07,599
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,200
Everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

154
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,919
It was a bug.

155
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,159
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

156
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,669
I'll never eat meat.
It's cold-blooded murder.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,200
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!

158
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,400
What are you doing?

159
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,599
I can't help it!

160
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,679
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.

161
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,669
When you date, you don't want to cheat
unless it's with someone really hot.

162
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,679
Totally.

163
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,919
This is the same kind of deal.

164
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,190
If you do something wrong...

165
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,280
... do it right.

166
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,599
Feel better?

167
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Yeah, but at what cost?

168
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,320
Six months, three meals a day?

169
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,280
I am going to eat like,
you know, millions of cows.

170
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,520
What if I even things out
for you, meat-wise?

171
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,400
I eat a lot of meat, right?

172
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,989
But suppose, until the baby's born,
I laid off it.

173
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,510
No extra animals would die.
You'd be eating my animals.

174
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,880
I can't believe you'd do that for me.

175
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,679
Absolutely!
I could be a vegetarian.

176
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,400
There's no meat in beer, right?

177
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,960
We can still make dinner
if we skip the appetizers.

178
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,599
We can't go now.
Rachel is going to put on a skit.

179
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:08,200
Oh, my God!
Have you lost your mind?

180
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,520
I am finally thinking clearly.

181
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
My lucky dress wasn't working.

182
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,710
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

183
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,799
Wait, I can't let--

184
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,190
Actually, I want to see what happens.

185
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,679
Nice costume.

186
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,440
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

187
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,960
Ready.

188
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Give me an "E" !

189
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,400
Give me an "M" !

190
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,000
Give me an "I" !

191
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
Give me an "L" !

192
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,390
Give me a "Y" !

193
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,400
What do you get?

194
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,440
That's me as a cheerleader!

195
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,960
I loosened a tooth.
It's no big deal. I have a dentist.

196
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,590
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

197
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,080
What do I do now?

198
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,359
I think you're done.

199
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,159
Time to take off the bra.

200
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,200
That was really great.

201
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,919
But I got to take off.

202
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,000
Take the bra off.

203
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,919
Let's go get your coat.

204
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,799
Rachel's my girlfriend.

205
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,440
So this was really fun.

206
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah, it was real fun.

207
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,080
You know, this bra...

208
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,989
... is really bothering me.

209
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,960
This used to be my bedroom.

210
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,799
A lot of memories in here.
Lot of memories.

211
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,359
If these walls could talk,
they'd say:

212
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,599
"Want to hear some memories?"

213
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,239
Need a hand?

214
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,400
I got this all under control.

215
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,789
You really don't seem like you do.

216
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,750
God! Forget it!

217
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,880
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

218
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,400
What was supposed to happen?

219
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,200
Can you not look at me?

220
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,640
I thought that
if I could get you here...

221
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,320
... I could seduce you.

222
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't wear suits to work.

223
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,590
And I bought six of them from you.

224
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,359
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

225
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,760
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

226
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Because I like you.

227
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,520
You like me?

228
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,719
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

229
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

230
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,080
But you like me?

231
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,799
I can't believe this. All this time,
I liked you and you liked me!

232
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,030
No "but. "

233
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,559
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "I like you and you like me. "

234
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,599
-However--
-No, that's a fancy "but. "

235
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,799
My marriage, like, just ended.

236
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,119
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

237
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,040
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.

238
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,719
There you are.
I was looking for you.

239
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,839
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

240
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,400
It's okay.

241
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,199
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

242
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,680
It's too late to do
the stuff I had planned.

243
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.

244
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:49,640
If it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

245
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,310
Helps a little.

246
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,079
Is there room there
for a pathetic loser?

247
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,000
Have a seat.

248
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm so sorry.

249
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,510
It's okay.

250
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:11,560
It was just a two-week thing anyway.

251
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,040
I just didn't want it
to end this way.

252
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,599
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

253
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,199
What do you mean?

254
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,560
You seem to really like her.

255
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,599
I really do.

256
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,359
What am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

257
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,319
No commitment.

258
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,040
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

259
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,589
... asking to hear stories about you...

260
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,319
... Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

261
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,479
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

262
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,680
You think?

263
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,319
You've got 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

264
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,709
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

265
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:04,000
... with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

266
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,000
You're right.

267
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,800
What photo album was it?

268
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,239
It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

269
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,829
Oh, my God!
Those weren't albino kids.

270
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,000
That was computer camp!

271
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,189
You're a pathetic loser, right?

272
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,079
Sit!

273
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,800
Oh, my God. Joshua.

274
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,160
All those things I said
about not being ready--

275
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,750
-They're not true?
-They're all true.

276
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,439
But....

277
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,160
I love that "but" .

278
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,079
Do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

279
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,400
Every time.

280
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:41,000
-What do you got there?
-Pastrami.

281
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,869
-You know what goes good with that?
-Corned beef.

282
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,599
I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

283
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,599
How about that smoked turkey?

284
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,359
Oh, mama!

285
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,400
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.

286
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,000
If a cow died of natural causes,
I could have one of those, right?

287
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Not if I get there first.
