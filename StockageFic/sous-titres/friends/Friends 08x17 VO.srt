1
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,970
Joey? Are you in there?

2
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:10,681
-That's Rachel.
-You have to talk to her.

3
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:14,488
l can't. Not after the other night.
lt's too weird.

4
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,609
Don't tell her l'm here.

5
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,004
Don't eat that!

6
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:22,522
-Hey!
-Hey, Rachel.

7
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,172
ls Joey here?

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,369
-l don't see him. You?
-No.

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,889
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

10
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:33,651
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

11
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:37,529
-What's up?
-l haven't seen him since he said. . .

12
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:39,285
. . .how he, you know. . . .

13
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,013
l don't know,
l think he's avoiding me.

14
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,846
Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,891
-We were playing a game.
-Was Chandler naked?

16
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:54,130
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

17
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:57,765
-Sure!
-What? No! No!

18
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:03,208
All right, listen. lf you see Joey,
will you just tell him that. . .?

19
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,125
Tell him l miss him.

20
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:14,131
-Okay. Did you hear that?
-Yeah. That naked bagel game?

21
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:20,128
Dude, l don't know. That's a pretty
small hole.

22
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:24,161
-You've gotta talk to her.
-l can't.

23
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,406
You guys don't know what it's like
to get shot down.

24
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:30,768
l don't know what that's like?

25
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:35,643
Until l was 25, l thought the response
to ''l love you'' was ''Oh, crap. ''

26
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,087
No rejection?

27
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,325
l got shot down at fat camp.

28
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:44,530
Boy, kids are mean
when they're hungry.

29
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,765
So, what do l do?

30
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:51,045
lt's Rachel.
You're gonna never talk to her again?

31
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:55,206
lt's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

32
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:58,046
Yeah, okay.

33
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,843
l forgot this was on your--

34
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,288
We didn't play it!

35
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:06,283
The One With the Tea Leaves

36
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:44,489
l'll look at your tea leaves
and tell your fortune.

37
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:48,051
-You read tea leaves?
-l've done it for years.

38
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:51,330
l actually stopped
because l was so accurate.

39
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,848
And one of the great joys
of life. . .

40
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:57,005
. . .is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

41
00:02:57,173 --> 00:03:00,006
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

42
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:03,725
-Okay. l'm done. Read mine.
-Okay.

43
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:07,042
l see a ladder.

44
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:10,922
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

45
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:17,371
l'm the head chef.
l can't get promoted.

46
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:19,971
Who's next?

47
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,691
l'm done. Do mine.

48
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,252
Okay.

49
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,652
Oh! Okay, l see a circle.

50
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:31,403
Which can either mean
you're having a baby. . .

51
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:34,246
. . .or you'll make
a scientific discovery!

52
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,770
Well, l have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

53
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:43,047
-What does yours say, Pheebs?
-All right.

54
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,529
Wow! Yay!

55
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,732
Oh, l'm gonna meet a guy!
And really soon!

56
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,168
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.

57
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,042
Probably not the guy
l had a dream about last night.

58
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,804
Has anyone seen my shirt?

59
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:05,488
lt's a button-down, like
a faded salmon color?

60
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,848
You mean your pink shirt?

61
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,610
Faded salmon color?

62
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:13,207
No, l haven't seen your pink shirt.

63
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:16,885
l must have left it at Mona's.
l knew it!

64
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:20,329
l'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

65
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:24,367
That's my favorite shirt.
l love it.

66
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,444
Ask Mona to give it back.

67
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,365
l don't know. l could.

68
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,969
We didn't really end things
on good terms.

69
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:36,092
lf l went, l'd be ignoring the
one thing she asked me to do. . .

70
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,926
. . .jump up my own ass and die.

71
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:44,881
Oh, wait a second, you guys?

72
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:48,091
l've been seeing that guy
everywhere l go.

73
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:51,609
We take the same bus,
go to the same bookstore.

74
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,411
Maybe he's the tea guy.

75
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:57,967
Did you see that?

76
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,682
He totally checked you out!
And he is so cute!

77
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:09,046
Mine is a picture of the Village
People. What's that mean?

78
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,366
Hi.

79
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,171
Hey.

80
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:30,127
-Hi.
-Hi.

81
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,692
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!

82
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,613
l thought Joey and l
would be okay. . .

83
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:52,241
. . .but we don't know
how to be together.

84
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:56,002
-lt's tough, but things will improve.
-How do you know?

85
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,528
What if it gets worse and worse. . .

86
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:02,322
. . .to the point where we
can't be in the same room?

87
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,643
l'm not great at the advice.

88
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:08,123
Can l interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

89
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,368
Some cheese?

90
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:18,091
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

91
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,007
lf l can't find the right case,
l use the nearest one.

92
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,769
-Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
-The James Taylor case.

93
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:28,572
-Where is that CD?
-l'll save you time.

94
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:32,203
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

95
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:37,530
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

96
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:41,163
We'll just have to put the CDs
in their right cases.

97
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,451
lf we do that, we should
come up with some kind of order.

98
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,969
We have to talk this through.

99
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:53,969
Oh, my God, you have such
problems! l feel so terrible for you!

100
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,642
All right. Okay, l'm sorry.

101
00:06:56,813 --> 00:07:00,010
You're both focusing on
this uncomfortable thing.

102
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,050
Change the subject.

103
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:05,206
Get him talking about something else.

104
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:06,931
Yeah, that makes sense.

105
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,244
Maybe you need his advice
on a work problem. . . .

106
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,291
-l could do that.
-Good.

107
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,602
The <i>Miami Vice</i> soundtrack?
Really?

108
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,930
They were just giving those away
at the store.

109
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:22,046
ln exchange for money.

110
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,925
Hey.

111
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,927
l really don't know what to tell you.

112
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:37,530
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

113
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,889
-What?
-Yeah, Joey, she's. . . .

114
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:45,683
Rachel's got this big work problem.
lt is a head-scratcher.

115
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:50,608
Know what? lf we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.

116
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,370
So you have a big work problem?

117
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,563
Yeah. lt's, uh. . . .

118
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,883
Yeah, it's, uh. . . .

119
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,648
You know, it's nothing.

120
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,052
Okay.

121
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,132
So l think l'm gonna take off.

122
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:20,684
No, wait, Joey, it is.
lt's something. lt's. . . .

123
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,366
lt's my boss.

124
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:25,481
-Yeah?
-Yeah. And, uh. . . .

125
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:28,924
And my baby.

126
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:34,572
My boss wants to buy my baby.

127
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:39,529
What? Oh, my God!

128
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,765
l know, l told you,
it's a really big problem!

129
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:46,568
-He wants to buy your baby?
-Can you believe that?

130
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:49,372
-That's crazy.
-That's what l told him!

131
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:53,082
-How did this even happen?
-Well, l'll tell you.

132
00:08:55,933 --> 00:09:00,802
See, my boss and his wife,
they can't have children, so. . . .

133
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,249
And then when we were
at the Christmas party. . .

134
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:08,850
. . .he got drunk and said to me,
''Rachel, l want to buy your baby. ''

135
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:13,292
When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby. . .

136
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,206
. . .l figured it was
about maternity leave.

137
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:19,365
Oh. Yeah.

138
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:32,732
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

139
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:42,886
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, it's you. l see you everywhere.

140
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:45,006
l'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

141
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:48,927
Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
l'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

142
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,766
-We've seen each other a lot lately.
-Yes.

143
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:56,609
Maybe we'll see each other at
dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00?

144
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:59,606
Well, maybe we will.

145
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,606
Mona?

146
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:36,893
Okay, if l were a salmon shirt,
where would l be?

147
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:46,206
l am so sorry l spilled wine
all over your shirt.

148
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,409
-lt's okay.
-No, it's still wet.

149
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:52,930
Let me get it out before it sets.
l have something you could wear.

150
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,365
Here.

151
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,689
l don't know if l want to wear
a woman's shirt.

152
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,088
-That's a man's shirt.
-Awfully pink.

153
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,050
<i>It's not pink!</i>

154
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,847
Honey, we are so meant
to be together.

155
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:18,246
-We both have the <i>Annie</i> soundtrack.
-Honey, both yours.

156
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:22,245
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

157
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,643
-The work problem?
-lt was perfect.

158
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:26,963
lt felt like he was my friend.

159
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:31,888
-What problem did you say you have?
-Oh, that's not important.

160
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:35,887
The point is,
l think everything's gonna be okay.

161
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,086
May l help you?

162
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:42,723
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

163
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:55,122
lsn't it funny how we kept meeting?
lt's as if someone wants us together.

164
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,608
Someone does. Me.

165
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,926
Witty banter. Well done. Good.

166
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:05,132
-Tell me a little bit about yourself.
-Okay. l'm a masseuse.

167
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:09,809
-And l used to work at this place--
-Do you like to party?

168
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,769
l like parties.

169
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,322
You're wild, aren't you?

170
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:22,209
-Yeah, l guess. A little.
-Ain't no thing. l'm wild too.

171
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:27,643
So anyway. . .

172
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:31,927
. . .l've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, l guess. . .

173
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,165
. . .for, well, since l was 1 4.

174
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,642
l'm sorry. l'm staring.

175
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:41,726
lt's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

176
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:42,928
Oh, stop it.

177
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,482
And your breasts!

178
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:49,812
Okay.

179
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,726
Look, you're coming on
a little strong.

180
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,691
l'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

181
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:58,242
The universe wants us
to be together.

182
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:02,372
Why don't we start over?
You can tell me about yourself.

183
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,364
-All right.
-Okay.

184
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,366
l write erotic novels. . .

185
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,012
. . .for children.

186
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:14,041
-What?
-They're wildly unpopular.

187
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,684
Oh, my God!

188
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:19,572
Also, you might like to know
l have a Ph.D.

189
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,486
-Wow! You do?
-Yep. A pretty huge--

190
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,006
All right.

191
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:41,284
-Hey.
-Joey, honey, listen.

192
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,889
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
lt meant a lot.

193
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,203
Not a problem.
Just so you know. . .

194
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:51,685
. . .that guy won't be bothering
you about that baby thing anymore.

195
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,092
-What?
-Let's just say l took care of it.

196
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,003
Let's say more.

197
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,322
Don't worry.

198
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,211
l told him, very nicely:

199
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:06,082
''You don't go buying people's babies!
So back off! ''

200
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:08,403
-What?
-What?

201
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:09,642
No, no, no!

202
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:12,885
He doesn't want to buy my baby!
l made that up!

203
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,203
What? Why?

204
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,411
So we would have something
to talk about!

205
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:21,212
And you couldn't think
of anything else?

206
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,809
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

207
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:29,205
You yelled at my boss!
l'll lose my job! What am l gonna do?

208
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:32,092
You could always sell your baby.

209
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:37,047
l can't believe you brought
my boss into it! l'll be fired!

210
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:40,046
-You lied to me!
-Well, she told me to!

211
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:44,490
Chandler has two copies of <i>Annie</i>!

212
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:23,922
Oh, my God!

213
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:27,889
-Ross!
-Hello!

214
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,172
What are you doing?

215
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:36,010
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

216
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,682
Morning. You wanted to see me?

217
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,606
Please, come in. Have a seat.

218
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,725
-Look, Mr. Zelner--
-lt's best l speak first.

219
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,042
Yeah.

220
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:58,563
Lee from human resources is here
as a witness to our conversation.

221
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:00,166
Oh, God.

222
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:07,043
lf l in any way implied
that l wanted to buy your baby. . .

223
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,324
. . .l am sorry. Okay?

224
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:14,929
Last week, when l asked you
when your due date was. . .

225
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:20,247
. . .l certainly did not mean that
l felt that l was ''due'' your baby.

226
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,443
l want to be very clear. . .

227
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:27,810
. . .that l understand
that it's your baby. . .

228
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,683
. . .and it is not mine to purchase.

229
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,723
Well, as long as we are clear
about that.

230
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:51,802
There it is.

231
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:54,248
-Not your regular cleaners.
-l know.

232
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,485
That creep goes there.
l had to find a new one.

233
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:02,283
l have to find a new bank,
adult bookstore, grocery store--

234
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:06,492
-What?
-A new grocery store.

235
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,889
The universe said l'd meet a nice guy.
l got that?

236
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:13,772
When l get up there,
l'm gonna kick some ass.

237
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,972
You'll meet someone. lf l can meet
a great guy, so can you.

238
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,887
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

239
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,052
-You didn't have to come in.
-You kidding?

240
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,968
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

241
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:37,411
l'm gonna be over here watching
the dance of the clean shirts.

242
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,487
Excuse me.
l think you dropped. . . .

243
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,044
-Wow!
-What?

244
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,727
Sorry.
You're just so incredibly beautiful.

245
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:53,852
Well, l'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

246
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:57,323
Don't think l'm crazy,
but l was meant to pick this up.

247
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,247
-Do you believe in that kind of thing?
-A little.

248
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,444
Now you're talking.

249
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:08,132
-Want to go for coffee?
-l'd love to. Let me tell my friend.

250
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:11,569
An ink stain!
Can l watch how you get this out?

251
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:14,724
She must have left.

252
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,645
-So? What happened?
-lt's all gonna be okay.

253
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:26,648
They're so happy l'm not suing, l got
an extra month paid maternity leave.

254
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:30,892
So long as l understand the money
should not be construed. . .

255
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:34,250
. . .as a down payment on this
or any other child.

256
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,132
Ralph Lauren is going
out of their way. . .

257
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:40,603
. . .to show they're not
in the baby-buying business.

258
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:44,449
-Give us a minute?
-Kicking me out of my living room?

259
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,570
Yeah.

260
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,771
l'll be in there.

261
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:57,332
l'm sorry l lied to you.
l was just trying to make things--

262
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,768
l know. l know.

263
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:02,167
lt kind of worked.

264
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,770
l don't know about you,
but l haven't thought about our thing.

265
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,605
Yeah, you're right.

266
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:12,968
Yeah. lt's kind of been
like ''us'' again, a little bit.

267
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,250
-Yeah, l know. l've missed that.
-Me too.

268
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:19,849
l haven't thought about
how l put myself out there. . .

269
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:23,642
. . .and said that stuff.
How you didn't feel the same. . .

270
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:27,647
. . .and how it was really awkward.

271
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:37,930
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

272
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:47,488

Hi, listen.
Come here. Come. . . .

275
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:03,843
l'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

276
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:10,689
Listen, you don't have to apologize.
l understand why you were there.

277
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:14,005
-You do?
-Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

278
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,768
To be honest,
l still have feelings for you.

279
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,572
l wish we could work out,
but we can't.

280
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:25,682
lt's too complicated with you and
Rachel and the baby. l just. . . .

281
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:28,845
lt just wasn't meant to be.

282
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,045
Oh, God. You're right.

283
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:36,247
Ross, we have to be strong.

284
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,528
Okay, l'm gonna go.

285
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:46,084
