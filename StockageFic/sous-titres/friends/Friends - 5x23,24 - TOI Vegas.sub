{133}{170}Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
{171}{279}Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
{280}{429}No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
{430}{484}Okay!
{485}{556}Sucker!
{557}{581}Hello?
{582}{629}- Hey Joey!|- Hey Pheebs!
{630}{676}Listen, uh can you do me a favor?
{677}{753}I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
{754}{787}Sure! Where is it?
{788}{876}Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
{877}{932}Ohh! So you're 5639?!
{933}{988}That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
{989}{1009}Hey!
{1010}{1074}- Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?|- Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
{1075}{1131}No! Because he didn't believe in my movie!
{1132}{1234}Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
{1235}{1362}Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
{1363}{1393}Who was that?
{1394}{1443}Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know,
{1444}{1507}he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
{1521}{1568}Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week!
{1569}{1661}If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
{1662}{1707}Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
{1708}{1766}Yeah!
{1780}{1865}- Hey!|- Don't come out here!
{1870}{1953}No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
{1954}{2043}I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
{2044}{2092}Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
{2093}{2221}Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
{2222}{2308}Would you mind doing a picture with us?
{2309}{2340}Uh, what was that?
{2341}{2401}Uh, Entertainment Tonight.
{2402}{2534}Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
{3757}{3878}Monica! I'm sorry I'm late!
{3925}{3972}Monica?
{3988}{4042}Phoebe?
{4043}{4110}Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
{4111}{4173}It's okay.
{4174}{4247}What the hell took you so long?
{4248}{4335}Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
{4336}{4370}- Which Richard?|- The Richard.
{4371}{4457}Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
{4458}{4553}Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
{4554}{4628}Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense.
{4629}{4649}So how was it?
{4650}{4679}It was, it was really nice.
{4680}{4753}We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
{4754}{4829}That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
{4830}{4903}- Really?|- But again, Simmons.
{4904}{4925}Go on.
{4926}{5013}The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great,
{5014}{5057}but I didn't feel anything at all!
{5058}{5117}Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
{5118}{5158}Because it would totally freak him out
{5159}{5225}and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
{5226}{5303}Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
{5304}{5386}Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
{5397}{5413}What?
{5414}{5494}On a totally different bet.
{5514}{5558}Hey!
{5559}{5624}- It's almost our anniversary!|- I know.
{5625}{5701}Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
{5702}{5801}Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
{5802}{5824}Huh.
{5825}{5877}- I got you a present!|- Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
{5878}{5991}- I know, but you have to open it today! |- Okay.
{6241}{6283}Okay! There you go!
{6284}{6360}It's two tickets to Vegas!
{6361}{6424}- Wow!|- For this weekend!
{6425}{6452}Oh gosh, it would be perfect,
{6453}{6551}we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane.
{6552}{6661}We can call it out plane-aversary.
{6662}{6716}Do we have to?
{6717}{6742}No.
{6743}{6812}Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
{6813}{6862}Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble.
{6863}{6932}Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him!
{6933}{7071}Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary!
{7072}{7157}A-Nevadaversary!
{7158}{7227}Yeah, I think we should see other people.
{7228}{7255}- But we can go, right?|- Yes.
{7256}{7295}- Okay!|- It's a great idea.
{7296}{7378}Okay, I'm gonna go too!
{7402}{7464}Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
{7465}{7533}Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
{7534}{7552}Ditch you?
{7553}{7597}- Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!|- Uh-huh, great story!
{7598}{7686}I'm going!
{7687}{7714}- Hi!|- Hey!
{7715}{7769}Hey, you guys, listen,
{7770}{7882}this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
{7883}{7941}Including me!!
{7942}{7972}You wanna go?!
{7973}{8022}Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
{8023}{8157}Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
{8158}{8245}Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
{8246}{8358}Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
{8359}{8455}Art lover!
{8511}{8553}What'd you say?
{8554}{8616}I said art lover.
{8617}{8649}Is that supposed to be an insult?
{8650}{8715}I don't know, I'm very tired.
{8716}{8779}So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
{8780}{8829}- That sounds great.|- Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
{8830}{8929}Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
{8930}{9041}Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
{9042}{9133}No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
{9134}{9191}Naked alone time.
{9192}{9294}No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn¡¯t mean I wanna walk around naked.
{9295}{9342}I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
{9343}{9448}Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
{9619}{9733}So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
{9734}{9806}So far it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
{9807}{9928}Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
{9929}{9967}Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
{9968}{10107}Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0!
{10108}{10162}I'll be right back.
{10213}{10265}Happy plane-aversary.
{10266}{10332}Aww! I love you!
{10333}{10361}Can I give you a present now?
{10362}{10420}- Okay!|- Okay!
{10514}{10561}Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
{10562}{10663}I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
{10664}{10778}How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
{10779}{10832}Oh that's okay. Don¡¯t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
{10833}{10894}Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
{10895}{11036}Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
{11064}{11108}What-what Richard thing?
{11109}{11190}Oh no.
{11191}{11219}What Richard thing?
{11220}{11330}Simmons! Go with Simmons!
{11396}{11440}Okay, I umm,
{11441}{11489}I ran into Richard yesterday
{11490}{11579}and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
{11580}{11632}The only reason I didn't tell you is
{11633}{11721}because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
{11722}{11818}I'm not mad.
{11819}{11862}- Really?!|- Oh yeah! Yeah,
{11863}{11998}so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
{11999}{12113}It's no big deal.
{12114}{12213}Great!
{12237}{12325}Okay, London 1¡¦
{12523}{12570}Oh!
{13058}{13133}Look what happened!
{13144}{13211}<font color="pink">Huh, check me out!

{13554}{13583}<font color="pink">naked,
{13584}{13663}<font color="pink">and carefully.
{13883}{14005}<font color="orange">Oh my God! That's Rachel naked!
{14006}{14081}<font color="orange">I can't look at that! I am looking at this.
{14082}{14193}<font color="orange">Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes
{14194}{14308}<font color="orange">Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
{14309}{14354}<font color="orange">She knows I'm home.
{14355}{14425}<font color="orange">She knows I can see her.
{14426}{14519}<font color="orange">What kind of game is she playing?
{14520}{14628}<font color="orange">I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
{14629}{14793}<font color="orange">Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly!
{14794}{14859}<font color="orange">Or, am I?
{14908}{14963}<font color="yellow">Love to love ya baby! Ow!
{15010}{15076}<font color="yellow">Love to love ya baby! Ow!
{15253}{15327}<font color="yellow">Love to love ya, baby! Ow!
{15340}{15405}Darnit!
{15616}{15669}Hey.
{15769}{15832}May I come in?
{15833}{15886}Uh, yeah, if you want to.
{15887}{15975}Do you want me to?
{15976}{16095}- Yeah, sure?|- So do I.
{16165}{16204}Okay Rach,
{16205}{16255}before anything happens
{16256}{16327}I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
{16328}{16395}This is just about tonight.
{16396}{16522}I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us."
{16523}{16657}Okay? I just want this to be
{16658}{16801}about what it is!
{16802}{16887}And um, what-what is that Ross?
{16888}{16976}The physical act of love.
{16977}{17023}What?! Are you crazy?
{17024}{17091}Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-
{17092}{17210}your nakedness?
{17211}{17359}Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
{17360}{17448}You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
{17449}{17491}Noo!! No!
{17492}{17684}You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
{17685}{17759}No! No!
{17760}{17885}No!
{17886}{17963}No-no-no-no.
{17972}{18098}Ohh wow! I¡¯m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
{18099}{18160}Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
{18161}{18216}Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
{18217}{18258}- Thank you.|- Yes.
{18259}{18297}All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
{18298}{18311}Okay.
{18312}{18344}Oh wait! One more thing umm,
{18345}{18469}do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
{19006}{19081}Hey you guys wait!
{19082}{19138}This place is so much better than London! Okay?
{19139}{19204}This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon
{19205}{19269}99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
{19270}{19309}Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
{19310}{19390}For 99 cents, I'd eat you.
{19391}{19507}Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want,
{19508}{19564}including Joey! Look!
{19565}{19620}Oh! Look! Hi!
{19621}{19657}Oh my God.
{19658}{19728}Hey! Joey!
{19729}{19826}- Hey! Hey!! Wow! |- Hi!
{19827}{19898}Love your condoms my man.
{19899}{19960}What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
{19961}{20011}Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
{20012}{20097}Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.
{20098}{20150}Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator.
{20151}{20187}Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.
{20188}{20302}Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
{20303}{20340}Who are you talking to?
{20341}{20411}They uh director.
{20412}{20480}Uhh, her.
{20522}{20598}All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
{20599}{20634}Why?! What happened?!
{20635}{20677}Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money,
{20678}{20747}so I'm working here 'til it starts up again,
{20748}{20784}if it ever does.
{20785}{20830}I'm so sorry.
{20831}{20882}Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
{20883}{20961}No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
{20962}{20997}I knew you were not okay with that.
{20998}{21066}So you're a gladiator! Wow!
{21067}{21109}Yeah, what-what's going on?
{21110}{21160}Monica had lunch with Richard.
{21161}{21216}Dawson?!
{21217}{21243}Noo!
{21244}{21311}But that would've been so cool!
{21312}{21349}No! Her boyfriend Richard!
{21350}{21397}It meant nothing! Okay?
{21398}{21455}After all this time, how can you not trust me?
{21456}{21591}When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
{21592}{21621}You're right.
{21622}{21675}I'm sorry. I should've told you.
{21676}{21710}Thanks.
{21711}{21814}- Aww, there we go.|- I love Vegas!
{21815}{21977}I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
{21978}{22003}Next time?
{22004}{22065}Ooh, so close.
{22066}{22142}There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
{22143}{22206}I can not see him?
{22207}{22239}I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
{22240}{22311}That's so funny, because I think I just did!
{22312}{22379}Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
{22380}{22431}- Fine with me!|- Fine! Happy Anniversary!
{22432}{22547}Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
{22548}{22582}- No it is not!|- What are you talking¡¦
{22583}{22685}Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
{22790}{22833}Okay umm, Ross?
{22834}{22944}I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater.
{22945}{23111}Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
{23112}{23187}Yep! That's hilarious!
{23188}{23237}I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
{23238}{23314}Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
{23315}{23359}No, not really.
{23360}{23412}I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
{23413}{23461}Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
{23462}{23603}Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
{23604}{23659}What?! You totally get embarrassed!
{23660}{23773}No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
{23774}{23858}- Is that so?|- Yeah.
{23859}{23961}Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?!
{23962}{24132}I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
{24156}{24260}Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
{24261}{24281}Really?
{24282}{24321}Yeah, sure! Sure!
{24322}{24389}They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it!
{24390}{24445}They would use it to get the mud off their shoe.
{24446}{24527}And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right¡¦
{24528}{24578}Joey, I uh!
{24579}{24649}I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
{24650}{24698}All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then.
{24699}{24741}Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
{24742}{24759}Whoa!
{24760}{24854}Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.
{24855}{24896}Can you believe that? $5,000!
{24897}{24958}Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym,
{24959}{25002}y'know build up my upper body
{25003}{25089}and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
{25090}{25113}Wait a minute!
{25114}{25160}Why don't I do what that guy did?
{25161}{25233}I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000!
{25234}{25322}And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
{25323}{25357}Good luck!
{25358}{25420}Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
{25421}{25469}I see.
{25662}{25702}Thank you.
{25703}{25785}I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
{25786}{25874}Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal!
{25875}{25961}It's only Chandler.
{25962}{26072}I am so sorry.
{26073}{26151}This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument.
{26152}{26200}I don't even wanna see Richard again.
{26201}{26247}So go fix it!
{26248}{26319}Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room!
{26320}{26377}Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
{26378}{26412}Y'know what? You're right Phoebe.
{26413}{26489}- You're right. Thank you! |- Sure!
{26490}{26602}Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
{26827}{26864}Anybody lose this?
{26865}{26941}Comin' out. Place your bet.
{26942}{27036}Dice are out.
{27037}{27123}Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
{27295}{27338}So uh,
{27339}{27441}I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
{27442}{27571}Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
{27746}{27777}Ross! What are you¡¦
{27778}{27906}I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
{27997}{28022}Hey!
{28023}{28137}Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
{28328}{28362}What the? What¡¦
{28363}{28382}Hi!
{28383}{28403}Miss? May I help you?
{28404}{28460}Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants?
{28461}{28591}Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
{28677}{28708}Can I change a hundred?
{28709}{28765}Changing one hundred!
{28766}{28862}Good luck sir.
{28863}{28949}Let's ride.
{29016}{29053}13ÀÔ´Ï´Ù
{29054}{29105}Hit me!

{32103}{32186}Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?

{59172}{59280}- Are you gonna play?|- No-no, I don't really have any money.
{59281}{59381}Not yet, anyway¡¦
{59382}{59476}You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
{59768}{59795}Hello.
{59796}{59899}My name is Regina Phalange.
{59900}{59971}I'm a businesswoman in town on business.
{59972}{60010}Would you like to see my card?
{60011}{60067}Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts?
{60068}{60149}I must've left it in conference room B.
{60150}{60170}14.
{60171}{60210}Hit me!
{60211}{60375}Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands!
{60376}{60517}They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
{60518}{60576}Stop it!
{60577}{60698}Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
{60699}{60775}Please stop it!
{60776}{60970}Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
{60971}{61135}If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it to you!
{61136}{61192}Didn't I just throw you out of here?
{61193}{61324}No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
{61325}{61368}Come on, lady!
{61369}{61410}Please, please take him too.
{61411}{61525}Me?! Oh come on, man!
{61526}{61577}You can't do this! Come on!
{61578}{61668}I'm your hand twin!!
{61754}{61810}Hello! One marriage please!
{61811}{61854}Yep, we wanna get married!
{61855}{61926}Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.
{61927}{62009}All right.
{62175}{62204}What are you doing?
{62205}{62271}Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
{62272}{62378}No, only because that's the graduation song.
{62432}{62542}Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
{62543}{62612}Are you sure you wanna do this?
{62718}{62777}Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
