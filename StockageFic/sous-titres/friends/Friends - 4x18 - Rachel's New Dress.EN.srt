1
00:00:05,949 --> 00:00:07,710
It is true what they say:

2
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:09,590
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,709
I'm so pregnant that
my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

4
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:20,379
So I'm going to play my songs
on this drum.

5
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,389
It sounds really cool!

6
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,750
Listen, listen.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,670
Smelly cat, smelly cat

8
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:33,150
What are they feeding you?

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,099
That sounds great!

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,549
I know! And I've only
been playing for an hour.

11
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,060
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you a big favor.

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,830
Don't tell me you want to keep
more stuff in my uterus.

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,029
Okay. Now, see.

14
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,779
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

15
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:07,580
And Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,430
... Frank Jr., Jr.

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,589
Wouldn't that be Frank Ill?

18
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,550
Don't get me started.

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,190
Anyway, since there
are three babies...

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,790
... and we both got
to put our names in...

21
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,349
... we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

22
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,150
That's so nice!

23
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:30,699
Cougar.

24
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,910
Think about it.

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,989
The One with Rachel's New Dress

26
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,300
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

27
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,270
I left a bra drying in there.

28
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:30,110
Will your son think it's yours
and be traumatized?

29
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:33,949
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

30
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,190
It's time to go.

31
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,860
See, that clock's a little fast.

32
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,309
We still have 17 minutes.

33
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:45,270
What can we do in 17 minutes...

34
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:46,789
... twice?

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
Well, that's ambitious.

36
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,910
You can ignore that.

37
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,309
That's your son.

38
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,350
Believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

39
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:00,949
I'll be right there.

40
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,029
This is Carol and Susan.

41
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,190
-It's so nice to finally meet you.
-You too.

42
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:18,750
-Susan will be in London next week.
-I've never been there.

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,710
-I'll show you around.
-Great!

44
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:24,070
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?

45
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,110
There's tons of terrific stuff.

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,149
I'll go with you.

47
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,589
Look at you two bonding.

48
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,429
Making us late for the airport.

49
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,190
Are you all right?

50
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,589
It's just us getting along
is difficult for him...

51
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,949
... because he doesn't like me.

52
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,070
Come on. That's....

53
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,460
It's true.

54
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:53,149
Do we have a baby name yet?

55
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,550
No. It's so hard!

56
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,979
I went through this book
and found nothing.

57
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,539
I want a name that's
really strong and confident.

58
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:02,589
You know? Like...

59
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,699
... Exxon!

60
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,350
It certainly worked
for that valdez kid.

61
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,229
You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

62
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:18,790
I'm not sure about Hulk,
but I like a name starting with "The" .

63
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,380
You want a good name,
go with Joey.

64
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,390
Joey's your pal, your buddy.

65
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,750
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!

66
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:31,429
If you're going to name him Joey,
you should name him Chandler.

67
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,350
Chandler's funny, sophisticated,
and very lovable...

68
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,750
... once you get to know him.

69
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,989
Joey's lovable too.

70
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,670
But with Joey, if you need him,
he'll be there.

71
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,750
Chandler will be there too.
He might be a little late...

72
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,790
... but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you cold soda...

73
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,070
... if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

74
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,750
What do you say?

75
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,190
I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

76
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:05,549
Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

77
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,190
All right, I don't--

78
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,579
Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.

79
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,149
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I wanted to name my kid that.

80
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:27,950
If you hoped to sleep with Joshua,
which one would you wear?

81
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,940
It creeps me out choosing
other people's sex clothes.

82
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,190
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

83
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:38,269
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair colored.

84
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,910
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

85
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,750
What am I making him, by the way?

86
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,269
A frisée salad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

87
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,220
... wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

88
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,510
I thought I was making him
filet mignon.

89
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,540
You decided to make salmon
because you had some left over.

90
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,790
Then you realized if you bitched,
then you would stop cooking...

91
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,149
... and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

92
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,149
I really get crabby when I cook.

93
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,350
So Emily called last night.

94
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,950
And now you're giving me the message?

95
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:27,549
Turns out that Emily is
just crazy about Susan.

96
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,549
They're going
to the theater together.

97
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,950
They're going to dinner.

98
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,299
They're going horseback riding!

99
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,459
God, Susan is so fun!

100
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:44,549
Look, this is just
a little too familiar.

101
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,790
For six months
before Carol and I split up...

102
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:51,989
... all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart.

103
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,149
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great. "

104
00:06:57,109 --> 00:07:00,149
You think something could happen
between Emily and Susan?

105
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,149
Hey, they're going
to the gym together!

106
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,190
Two women...

107
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,950
... stretching!

108
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:13,149
They take a steam, things get playful.
Didn't you see Personal Best ?

109
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,149
No, but I'm gonna!

110
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,579
Hi! You're crazy.

111
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,390
Emily is straight.

112
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,910
How do you know?
We thought Carol was straight.

113
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,750
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

114
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,579
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down!

115
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,630
No, I meant for the baby.

116
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,549
What's wrong with Ross?

117
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:47,989
Something like this would never
happen to The Hulk, you know.

118
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,549
That's not true.

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,540
In The lncredible Hulk, number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found....

120
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:58,709
You know....

121
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,350
Never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

122
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm definitely going to go
with either Joey or Chandler.

123
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,350
You gotta pick Joey!

124
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,980
Name one famous person
named Chandler.

125
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:14,390
Raymond Chandler.

126
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,739
Someone you didn't make up.

127
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:20,670
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for...

128
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,230
... Joey Buttafucco.

129
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

130
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,190
How about a compromise then?
What if it's...

131
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:32,150
... Chan-no-ey?

132
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,750
Joey? Think about it.
He'll never be President.

133
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:38,349
There will never be a President Joey.

134
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,070
I didn't want to bring this up.

135
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,190
Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life!

136
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,150
It's not a name!
It's barely even a word.

137
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:50,270
It's like chandelier
but it's not!

138
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:56,750
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

139
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,710
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

140
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,510
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

141
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,549
So I guess it's Joey then.

142
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:25,429
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

143
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,549
Please! Cooking soothes me.

144
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,750
So dig in!

145
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:37,950
It all looks so good.

146
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,989
Oh, my God.

147
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,549
I know.
My God, this rice is so--

148
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,549
I am so good!

149
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,750
Behind you.

150
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,669
They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

151
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,380
Is there some way
that they could not be here?

152
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,349
Farm birds really
kind of freak me out!

153
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,750
Here we go.

154
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,950
There you go!

155
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:24,150
Hey! How'd you do that?

156
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,750
All gone.

157
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,390
So, farm birds, huh?

158
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,669
It's my only weird thing, I swear.

159
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:37,590
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.

160
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,340
Can I serve you a little--

161
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,739
What?

162
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,940
Nothing.

163
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,150
It's just that I know
that they're still out there.

164
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,789
They're across the hall.
That's two doors away.

165
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,710
It'll take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

166
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,349
That's not funny.

167
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,789
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

168
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,739
We could pack this stuff up
and go to your apartment.

169
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,950
They're working on it.
It's a mess.

170
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,989
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

171
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,750
They're out of town.

172
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,179
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view.

173
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,030
It'd be very romantic.

174
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,750
-What do you say?
-Yeah, that works.

175
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,349
They can smell the fear.

176
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:42,940
How's Ben?

177
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,150
I asked if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

178
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,669
I asked if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

179
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:51,549
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

180
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,469
So he's sweeping.

181
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,700
Any word from Susan?

182
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,070
She said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

183
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,789
By the by, did it
ever occur to you that...

184
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,950
... maybe they might be having
a little too much fun?

185
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,380
What's too much fun?

186
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,900
The kind of fun you and Susan had
when we were married.

187
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,190
Oh, my God!
You are so paranoid.

188
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:23,750
Am l?

189
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,219
Am l?

190
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,909
Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

191
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,549
Carol, so were we.

192
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,590
Just imagine for a moment...

193
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,390
... that Susan meets someone,
and they hit it off.

194
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,909
They're coming back from the theater,
and they stop at a pub for drinks.

195
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,309
They're laughing.

196
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,710
Someone innocently
touches someone else.

197
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,989
There's electricity.

198
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,950
It's new. It's exciting.

199
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,580
Are you saying there isn't
the slightest possibility...

200
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,549
... of something happening?

201
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,390
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God!

202
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,940
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it!

203
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,549
None of the other kids believed me,
but I swear that duck pushed me.

204
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,150
This place is fabulous!

205
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,109
This is the downstairs living room.

206
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:21,950
There's two living rooms?

207
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,590
Growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

208
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:30,150
It would have been,
but my parents just moved here.

209
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,549
You should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

210
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,349
Want to make out?

211
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,380
Why don't I put the food
in the fridge...

212
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,989
... and we can eat it later?

213
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,109
That sounds like a plan.

214
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,070
Is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

215
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,590
Just down the hall
and second door to your left.

216
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,510
-Hi, darling.
-What are you doing here?

217
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,340
-We cut the trip short.
-France sucks!

218
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,099
This may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

219
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,270
Say no more.

220
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,669
We'll grab some food, go upstairs
and be out of your hair.

221
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,549
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to ltaly?

222
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,750
Yep. Sucks!

223
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,630
Hi, you!

224
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:45,030
Oh, my God!

225
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:48,190
I know. I can do more than cook.

226
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,549
I like her. She seems smart.

227
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,140
Rachel, my parents.

228
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,349
So nice to meet you.

229
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:14,590
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

230
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,750
What, this? Oh, no.
That's not what it is.

231
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,190
Okay, I work in fashion.

232
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,820
And this is a real dress, actually.

233
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,739
They're wearing it in Milan.

234
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,950
Part of my job is to wear the clothes
and see how people respond.

235
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,619
Then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's.

236
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,549
Obviously, in this case...

237
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,260
... I am going to report back:

238
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,549
"U. S. A. not ready. "

239
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:49,270
Maybe in L. A.

240
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,340
There you go!

241
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:53,309
Have you kids eaten yet?

242
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,030
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.

243
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,789
Why don't we all
get something to eat?

244
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,710
No use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

245
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,150
So we'll go eat.

246
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,950
You'll wear that.

247
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,549
We'll be eating and,
of course, you'll be wearing that.

248
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:20,979
I am sorry about what I said.

249
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:24,150
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name!

250
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:25,909
It's not bad.

251
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,340
Yes, it is!

252
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:31,150
From now on, I have no first name.

253
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,140
You're just Bing?

254
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,750
I have no name.

255
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,619
So what are we supposed to call you?

256
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:45,150
Okay, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

257
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,349
... Clint.

258
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,549
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint. "

259
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,950
What name am I
cool enough to pull off?

260
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,869
Gene.

261
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,700
It's Clint.

262
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,349
It's Clint!

263
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,380
Bye, Gene.

264
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,949
It's Clint!

265
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,550
What's up with Gene?

266
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,550
You wore your nightie to dinner?

267
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,380
The best part was when the waiter
spilled water down my back.

268
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,349
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

269
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,339
It's all right.
I got nice boobs.

270
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:33,989
I just picked up
a message from Emily.

271
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,390
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

272
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,390
So?

273
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,550
Poetry?

274
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,750
Susan's gay.

275
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,150
They're being gay together!

276
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,140
Emily's straight.

277
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,229
Oh, wake up!

278
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,540
Carol really messed you up.

279
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,060
Excuse me?

280
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,189
She turned you into
this untrusting, crazy, jealous...

281
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,380
... sycophant!

282
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:09,750
So I don't know what "sycophant" means,
but the rest is right.

283
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,900
What are you talking about?
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

284
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,750
She's right.

285
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:22,619
When we were together, you got upset
about Mark, and there was nothing.

286
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,099
This makes sense.

287
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,709
It does not!

288
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:28,510
In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

289
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,550
... even though all your girlfriends
cheated on you.

290
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,150
So up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

291
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,949
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam! Paranoid City!

292
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,550
Absolutely!

293
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,020
This is so fun!

294
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,939
This is not fun!

295
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,579
All we're trying to say is...

296
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,150
... don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

297
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,430
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

298
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,589
I still think I was right
about that Mark thing.

299
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,150
Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

300
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,949
Drumroll.

301
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,150
All right.

302
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,670
Help!

303
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,949
Am I a Mark or a John?

304
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,349
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

305
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:33,349
But you might make a good Barney.

306
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,349
Look, I am serious.

307
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,750
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going
to the courthouse.

308
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,510
You're going through with this?

309
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,150
This name has held me back
my entire life.

310
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,060
It's why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

311
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,910
So tomorrow, I'll either be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

312
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,349
You've got problems because of you,
not your name!

313
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,949
This has got to stop!
Chandler is a great name.

314
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,550
In fact....

315
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:09,060
I'm sorry, I know you wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

316
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,670
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.

317
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:16,510
Really?

318
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,630
But you have to keep the name too.

319
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:20,949
Okay, thanks!

320
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:22,750
You want to hug it out?

321
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,550
I'm going to go tell
Frank and Alice right now!

322
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,709
Bye, Pheebs!

323
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,229
-Nice luggage.
-I was going to say.

324
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,430
I missed you too.

325
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,939
-Thanks, I had a great time.
-So did l.

326
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:09,550
No tongue.

327
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,619
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

328
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,569
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

329
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,660
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

330
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:02,170
London might have gotten started...

331
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,729
... because we needed to take advantage
of the show's popularity...

332
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,170
... and go do the show on
an exotic location...

333
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,689
... and have a good time.

334
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,339
There's so many people here
from all over the world.

335
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,130
Lately, the show's been about us
getting excited to go to London.

336
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:21,699
And then we realized in real life,
we're doing that same thing.

337
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,260
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check!

338
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,219
Are you ready yet?

339
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,729
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

340
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,329
Yeah!
London, baby!

341
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:36,540
It's all London, baby!

342
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:37,699
Here we go.

343
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,380
Ross is getting married...

344
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:43,329
... to this young woman named Emily.

345
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,969
And I set them up by accident.

346
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:49,180
Why don't we?

347
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,530
Why don't we what?

348
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,530
Get married.

349
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:57,780
I've started to...

350
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:01,500
... fall for this character, Emily,
played by Helen Baxendale.

351
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:06,060
And we decided to go all the way,
I guess, and get married.

352
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,619
Ross has asked me to marry him.
I say yes.

353
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:11,489
And so we arrange
a big wedding in London.

354
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:12,890
Things go a bit wrong.

355
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:16,010
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

356
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:18,260
You have to meet me in the middle.

357
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:21,290
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass!

358
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,939
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

359
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,209
That's it!

360
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,780
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

361
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,660
This is our wedding day!

362
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:34,180
From now on, everyone gets along.

363
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,569
And if I hear one more word...

364
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,369
... no grandchildren!
That's right!

365
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,849
Sorry, old boy.

366
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,739
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

367
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,569
We knew the show
was popular in England...

368
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,859
... and so it seemed like
a natural fit.

369
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,449
I knew how big the show was over here.
It was exciting to be welcomed.

370
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,969
Everywhere, walking down the street...

371
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:03,579
... bunches of kids watching.
So we've been signing autographs.

372
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:06,130
They're just big fans of the show,
I guess.

373
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,530
I watch it all the time
because my children love it.

374
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,180
They absolutely love it.

375
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:15,780
Tell my friend you like my hat.

376
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,219
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

377
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,219
Hi, Chandler!

378
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,180
We wanted it to
still feel like Friends...

379
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,140
... and so we shot a lot of it
in front of an audience.

380
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,369
And it seemed like
a really exciting opportunity...

381
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:34,140
... to shoot an American sitcom
in front of a British audience.

382
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:38,130
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

383
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,339
I'll be the on-camera guy.

384
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,050
All right. First stop...

385
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,329
... Westminster Abbey.

386
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:47,609
What is that?

387
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,140
That's London, baby!

388
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:54,180
We were really afraid, going over,
that either they'd be...

389
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,739
... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh....

390
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,540
They were great!

391
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,339
-Big laughers!
-They waited in line for hours!

392
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,930
-We traveled 329 miles.
-She's lying. It's more like 200.

393
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,930
The show's doing so well over here
that it just seems like...

394
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,329
... they're real, real receptive.

395
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:18,449
It's really wonderful and flattering
and overwhelming, truthfully.

396
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:21,050
We didn't have
a single bad audience.

397
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,449
Also, there was
a greater sense of "event. "

398
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:28,530
I think it energized everybody:
the actors, the writers....

399
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,260
We're just excited to be here.

400
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,890
Like, look back there.
Look how cool that is!

401
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,180
We missed Lisa.

402
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,890
That was probably the only
drawback I can think of.

403
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,140
I first thought, "How exciting!
I wonder if I'm going?"

404
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,260
It's awful that Lisa's not here.

405
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,969
We feel like
we have a limb missing.

406
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,420
Let's try some aversion therapy.

407
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,140
Look at the picture.

408
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,650
It's strange when one person's
not there. We miss her.

409
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,780
It's weird for all of us
to be here without her.

410
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:08,969
She's in the episode, on the phone
and things like that.

411
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,420
Hey, Pheebs!
It's Joey.

412
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,579
Hey, Joey!

413
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:16,939
I just saw someone that looks just
like you, on the subway.

414
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,609
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

415
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,540
That just cost me four bucks.

416
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,339
Part of me wishes I could go.

417
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:30,939
But I'm very happy to not get
on a plane for a lot of hours....

418
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,459
Sorry.
I'm not a good traveler.

419
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,140
The Waltham residence.

420
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,579
Is this Emily's parents' house?

421
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,699
This is the housekeeper.

422
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,739
And by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

423
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:47,699
First one identifies oneself...

424
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,099
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

425
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,180
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

426
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,140
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

427
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,140
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

428
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,300
It was also interesting because
we had shot about a third of it here.

429
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:08,569
And a bit of it
on the streets in London.

430
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:10,569
All right!

431
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:12,619
Westminster Abbey!

432
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,660
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

433
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:21,890
What do you think of the Abbey?

434
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,939
I think it's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

435
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,300
-To what?
-To "Put the camera away" !

436
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,329
Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. "

437
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,979
It was a really gratifying experience.

438
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:40,339
Pretty much everything we'd hoped
to get out of it, we got.

439
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,890
When you can go on location even
in Los Angeles that's exciting...

440
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,699
... much less have your whole crew...

441
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,290
...come out to "jolly old England. "
It's really, really exciting.

442
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,250
Just the idea of bringing
our entire "family" over here...

443
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,010
... is, like, wild.

444
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,060
Yeah!
London, baby!

445
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,050
It's amazing to me how many people
are excited about the show.

446
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,050
I knew how big the show was over here.
It plays a lot on television.

447
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,890
I saw it three times in one week.

448
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:49,260
They're very popular at home,
but I didn 't know they would be here.

449
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,060
It's got a massive following
in Britain...

450
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,689
... particularly among my generation.

451
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:58,329
It's quite sarcastic.
That's why it's popular.

452
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,849
We have great English character actors
who are working with us.

453
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,250
And an opportunity to interact
with the English crew.

454
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,089
We're about to be Ross' in-laws.

455
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,609
We're the Brits
that you love to hate.

456
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,489
We worked with
Sarah Ferguson this morning.

457
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:15,060
She was great and funny.

458
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,900
I was excited to be here today.

459
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,369
It's the first time I've ever done this
and I enjoyed it.

460
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:23,969
I am a great fan.
I think they are all marvelous.

461
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:27,969
Most British people tried to hate them
for being beautiful and funny.

462
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:29,489
I got a phone call:

463
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,699
"Small part, a few lines.
Do you want it?

464
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,300
Next to Jennifer Aniston. "

465
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,329
And I went, "Oh, wait a minute....
Oh, okay then. "

466
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,050
It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits
up the butt" episode, really.

467
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,459
You're gonna see a lot of comedy,
a lot of romance...

468
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:49,089
... and a lot of surprises.

469
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,060
And you get to see England.

470
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,859
Call the Queen Mum,
say you enjoy watching Friends...

471
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,810
... and that you know us, and she'll
have you over for tea like that.
