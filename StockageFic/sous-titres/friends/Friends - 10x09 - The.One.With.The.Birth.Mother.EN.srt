1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,300
Hey

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,700
We're here to say goodbye
we are after Ohio

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,600
Oh My, you adoption interview

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,600
yep, We gonna meet the lady
who could be carring our baby

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,000
I can't beleive it
when you guys come back

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,400
you gonna have a baby
it's so weird

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,100
and, It's so incorrect

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,800
She is only a couple months pregnant
and she liked our application

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
But, who knows if she's gonna like us

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
Oh come on, she is gonna love you guys

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,400
Oh, thank you. but we're really
trying not to get our hopes up

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
and the locket is still in norway

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeah, I mean this girl can decide against adoption

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
or she'd like an other couple better

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
What you are gonna name the baby

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,000
I can develop a condition which I talk and talk
and no one hears a word

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,700
But, just think okay, what if every thinggoes right

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,400
What if this woman does pick you guys

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,500
Oh my God, she's gonna pick us

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
So we're standing from the noching our hopes up

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I know that things could still go wrong,
but if they don't

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,400
If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler! a baby

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes...Oh my God, it's gonna work
we're gonna make it work

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm gonna be a momy, and you're gonna be a daddy

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,100
Well, I'll see you suckers, I'm gonna get me a baby

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:23,900
Ohh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,400
So no one told you life was gonna be this way
(clapclapclapclapclap)

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,500
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D. O. A

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,800
It's like you're always stuck in second gear

30
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,500
When it hasn't been your day,
your week, your month, or even your year

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,300
But...I'll be there for you

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:57,300

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,000

The more the better, all right
just don't order a gardin soud and then eat my food

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,700

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,100
Ohh, thank God, you're here

99
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500

last night having dinner

100
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
and she reaches over, and takes a few of his fries

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Ohh no.

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,600
You, you know about that, that the plate thing
Oh yeah, yeah

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,100
Joey doesn't share food
I mean just the last week we were having breakfest

104
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,600
and, and he he had a couple of grabes on his plate
you wouldn't let her have a grabe

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Oh no, not me.
Emma

106
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Joey dosn't share food

107
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,900
Well, I still think that is stupid reason not to call someone again

108
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,300
You are calling her, okay
and if you need to, then just get an extra

109

135
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200

136
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,400
please, just wear what I suggest
she is gonna gets nut for you

137
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,600
so you're saying, if I wear these pants
I might be getting into hers

138
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Why the men keep talking to me like this

139
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,100
So the fact that I'm a docter and my wife is reverent
that's important to you

140
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,700
Yeah, I read some great applications
but then I thaught

141
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,500
you're better than a minister to rise a child
Amen

142
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Plus I thaught that the baby will be in good hands
with a doctor

143
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,500
Good hands
healing hands

144
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,300
reverent, can I ask?
the bible said any thing about adoption

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:43,300
It says do it
and be hold she did adopt onto them a baby

146
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:51,700
and it was good
waww Yeah waw

147
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,300
I was wondering, you both has such a serious jobs
would you have time to take care of a baby

148
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,400
and your flak
I don't know my flak, my flak is good

149
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,900
my flak, pretty much takes care of him self
by this point

150
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,800
Good flak, flak, flak, flak

151
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,600
But being a doctor that must take a lot of time

152
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,100
Not, from me it doesn't

153
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,700
So, everything is going in here
we're great, I think I may have asked all my questions

154
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,300
Good, do you have any questions for her
Yeah actually

155
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,000
So you had a file that you liked
and gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,200
hop, yeah. our system insures totlal anonymety
we're very proud of it

157
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,000
You should be
ou're really on top of the stuff

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
well, then if there is nothing else
the two of us should talk

159
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,700
Yeah actually
I don't think we have to You don't

160
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,100
yeah, when I read about you two
I was pretty sure I wanted you

161
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,500
But, I thaught we should meet face to face
I've made my desicion

162
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,900
I choose them
my God this is great, it's so great

163
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,700
did you hear that
yeah I did

164
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:09,500
Hey, thank you.
thank you so much

165
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,000
you're so going to heaven

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
this stuff, yeah

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,700
I'm not sure about some of the brose I got
Oh, really. you wanna try some of them on for me

168
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Ok
wait, are we Joey's imagination

169
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Oh no, I took one of Ross's bag, by mistake
and one of mine is missing

170
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:43,300
oh well Ross probably has it
you can get him from him later

171
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,500
So, what do you think?

172
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,400
I think we aren't wearing the same shirt anymore

173
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,700
Yeah, rachel pick it up for me
she told me to trust her and you know what

174
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm glad I did. I take quiet few heads
on my way over here

175
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,900
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that

176
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,800
Ohh, I see. somebody is afraid
of a little competition with the ladies

177
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,000
I think someone is the ladies

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,600
You're just jaleous
because you couldn' pull this off, yeah

179
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,100
now if you'll excuse me
I have a date

180
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:35,000
See
all eyes on me

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,300
We're not signing those papers
why not

182
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,100
It's wrong
they made a mistake, they think that we are somebody else

183
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,800
God works, in mesterious ways

184
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
you're gonna stop

185
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,300
but she liked us
she likes dr. chandler and reverent Monica

186
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,800
If you think about it
I'm kind of like a reverent

187
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean, as a chief, I serve God
By feeding the hangry and poor

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,900
your veal top is 19. 95

189
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,800
Chandler, I think we had been given an opportunity
I mean the mistake is already been made

190
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,400
They are writing up the papers, right now
but we are not the one she chose

191
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,400
how can you feel okay about this

192
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:28,400
because, we may not be who she thinks we are
but no one could ever love that baby more than us

193
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,900
I know I mean who know, how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby

194
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,200
What if, no one ever picks us
Oh honey

195
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,300
Please, we are so close

196
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,100
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman
is giving away her child

197
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:59,700
she deserves to know who it's going to

198
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Okay, you're right

199
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:12,400
so, we'll tell the truth, then who knows
may be she'll like us for us

200
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,900
may be she will
akh! why couldn't be a reverent

201
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:26,900

253
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,600

you have every reason to be upset
we did lie

263
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,000
but only because, we've been waiting
and tryin to have the baby for so long

264
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,100
and we don't know how long it's gonna be

270
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,900
