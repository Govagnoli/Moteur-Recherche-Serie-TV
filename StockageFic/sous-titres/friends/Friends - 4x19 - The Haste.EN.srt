1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,760
Morning's here

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,189
The morning's here

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,360
Sunshine is here

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,479
The sky is clear

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,870
The morning's here

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,760
The morning's here

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,360
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,159
Oh, come on!

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,000
Morning's here!

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,470
I hate this apartment!

11
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:50,919
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,680
I hate that singing guy!

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,439
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,599
Morning's here

15
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,950
Stop it!

16
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,709
I will kill you.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,680
I hate that my room is so small.

18
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,480
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
You don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

20
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:21,430
I am tired of your bellyaching.

21
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:24,639
I've worked hard to make this
a nice place for us.

22
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,000
I know.
I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm sorry, okay?

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,389
It's a great apartment!

25
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,400
Shut up!
This place is a hole!

26
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,919
The One with All the Haste

27
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,230
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,759
I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I know, I know.
Who am l? David Bowie?

30
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,190
He does that?

31
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,960
I don't know. Whatever.

32
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:40,440
I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

33
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,080
Oh, I know.

34
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,520
You know what?

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,399
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

36
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,919
When I'm with you, I'm like...

37
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,800
... this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,039
I mean, I love you too.
A lot.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,309
But that guy!

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,750
I love that guy!

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,720
I love both of you.

42
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,759
I wish I didn't have to go.

43
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,759
Then don't.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,520
Stay here.
Don't go so soon to London.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,199
Just one more day.

46
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,279
Please don't do this to me again.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,960
I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,119
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,559
I wish I could.

50
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,559
Oh, no. Don't start packing.

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,789
Come on!

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,759
I don't think you understand packing.

53
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,350
I don't want to leave it till last.
Last time, I left my knickers here.

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,360
Yeah, I know.
I tried them on.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
You didn't!

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,880
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy. "

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
Excuse me?

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,880
Your pants.

59
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,960
Oh yeah! You like them?

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,639
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

61
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,149
These are so comfortable.

62
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,399
Pheebs, those are Santa pants.

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,640
Santa pants.

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Santa Claus' pants.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,829
No. They're maternity pants.

66
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,279
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,160
These names are good,
and these are bad.

68
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,239
So, how are the elves?

69
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:52,040
I don't know.
How are the... you know?

70
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,160
Your clothes aren't funny.

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,359
What should I wear to a Knicks game?

72
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,239
A T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

73
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,440
You have tickets?

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,679
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,950
Apparently, they're good seats.

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

77
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,239
Do you guys want these?

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,760
Yeah, we do!

79
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,510
Well, you got them!

80
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,750
Just give us our apartment back.

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,640
Oh, I didn't see that coming.

82
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Are you serious?

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,190
Come on.
We know what these are worth.

84
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,359
Do you think we're stupid?

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,799
Not stupid.
You're meaner than I thought.

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,510
What do you say?

87
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,119
Forget it. I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

88
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,359
Your "bachelor pad"?

89
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,720
Have you even had a girl here?

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,959
No.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,799
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning.

92
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,600
Yeah, you do!

93
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,799
Come on!

94
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,200
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

95
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,760
Good one.

96
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,480
Come on.
Season tickets!

97
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,750
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

98
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm not giving up the apartment.

99
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:28,600
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

100
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,359
... to the No. 1salesman
every year. My dad never won.

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,670
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

102
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,190
Hey guys!

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,269
Oh, my God!

104
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,880
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

105
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,269
Oh, yeah.
Emily convinced me to do it.

106
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,600
You do know that Wham broke up?

107
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,640
I like it. Emily likes it.
That's what counts.

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,679
So, how are you guys doing?

109
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,160
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,559
Where's Emily?

111
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,799
She's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,390
Didn't she, like, just get here?

113
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,790
Easy, tiger.

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,200
I just hate this so much.

115
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,160
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

116
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:27,070
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off. "

117
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,679
-So what'll you do?
-There's nothing to do.

118
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,640
She lives there.
I live here.

119
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,989
She'd have to move here.

120
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,000
She should move here.

121
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,750
What?

122
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,470
-I can ask her to live with me.
-Are you serious?

123
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,839
-I mean, why not?
-You've only known her six weeks!

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,790
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

125
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,880
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like....

126
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,399
She brings out this great side of me.

127
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,190
I mean, I love her, you know?

128
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,279
And I love the milk!

129
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,239
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

130
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,559
Joey, you say things now.

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,679
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

132
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,070
She's great!

133
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,880
But this is too soon.
You'll only scare her.

134
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,119
I don't want to do that.

135
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,320
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

136
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,959
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

137
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,959
I'm not going to do it.

138
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,479
-Thanks guys.
-No problem.

139
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,400
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

140
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,989
It's too hard. Too hard!

141
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,950
All right.
Last chance for the tickets.

142
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,599
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

143
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,679
No, thank you.

144
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,080
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

145
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,400
I want those seats. But we can't live
in the small apartment...

147
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,440
... after living here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon ?

148
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,280
Ever read Sports Illustrated ?

149
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,000
No, I didn't read yours!

150
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,880
We can go to the game tonight!

151
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,229
The only way I'll consider this is...

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,830
... if they offer more
than just season seats.

153
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,840
It's the Knicks!

154
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,359
Screw the Knicks!

155
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,880
I didn't mean that.
I just meant that...

156
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,960
... the apartment is worth
so much more.

157
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,919
And the Knicks rule.

158
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,440
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,640
So? Are you going to do it?

160
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,960
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

161
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,070
All right, look.

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,280
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

163
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,469
Done!

164
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:05,400
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

165
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,789
We could get nothing.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,229
Or everything.

167
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,799
I like that.

168
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,349
What do you say?

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,280
Just do it!

170
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,960
Oh! I'm convinced!

171
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

172
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,549
Because you're my best friend.

173
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:28,119
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

174
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,590
I'm in.

175
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,440
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,679
We should let Phoebe decide...

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,760
... because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

178
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,830
I have a game!

179
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,789
-This is great!
-What's the game?

180
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,960
It doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

181
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
No, it doesn't have a name.

182
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:01,150
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

183
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,440
-They're green?
-Good! Five points!

184
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,559
Same question.

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
-They're tall.
-Three points!

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,719
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
That's not even a game.

188
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Shut up. We're winning!

189
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,599
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

190
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,440
High card wins.
What do you say?

191
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,789
-Let's do it!
-Oh, I have cards!

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah. Here.

193
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,400
No, these are the trick deck.

194
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,000
Here, yes.

195
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,760
Okay, you guys pick first.

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,710
-Four.
-That's a low one!

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
You look.
I can't do it.

198
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
What makes you think I can?

199
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,150
Ace!

200
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,799
Why are you hugging?

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,479
We won our apartment back!

202
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,840
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

203
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,640
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

204
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,349
I don't know.

205
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,960
Look it!

206
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,559
Come on, pick again!

207
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,440
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

208
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,599
I know queen is high!

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,359
Not as high as....

210
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,239
It worked! King!

211
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,719
We pick again!
We pick again!

212
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,359
-Why?
-I don't know.

213
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,599
Tickets, please.

214
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,830
Courtside, baby!

215
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,559
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

216
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,559
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

217
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,590
No, they didn't.

218
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,520
Packed while you were gone.

219
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,989
I left knickers under your pillow.

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,359
Move in with me?

221
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,039
What?

222
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:40,799
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,559
... but just think.
Think how great it would be.

224
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,599
I don't know.

225
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,000
Leaving London....

226
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,119
My whole family lives there....

227
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,039
-My job.
-You'll get a job here.

228
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:02,119
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

229
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,159
That could be you.

230
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,590
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

231
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,630
You come to England.

232
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,719
I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

233
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,710
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

234
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,590
I don't think so.

235
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,440
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

236
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,950
... and we were getting married.

237
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,070
What?

238
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,760
Right. I shouldn't have said "married. "
Please don't go freaky on me.

239
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,190
I didn't mean it.
I take it back.

240
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,630
No. Don't.

241
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,919
Why don't we?

242
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,239
Why don't we what?

243
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,159
Get married.

244
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,559
You are mad!

245
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,390
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

246
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,599
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

247
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,229
-We've known each other six weeks!
-I know.

248
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,960
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

249
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,159
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

250
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,520
... and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

251
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,359
I mean, this....

252
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,320
This makes sense for us.

253
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,000
Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in vermont.

254
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,119
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Me!

255
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,280
This feels right.

256
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,070
Doesn't it?

257
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,039
My parents will be really mad.

258
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,840
Are you saying, "Yes"?
ls that "Yes"?

259
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,559
Yes.

260
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,960
-We're getting married!
-Oh, my God!

261
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,960
We're getting married!

262
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,559
Come here, come here.

263
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,960
Emily, will you marry me?

264
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,200
It's a bit small.

265
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,239
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

266
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,599
It was.

267
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,359
Those were, like,
the best seats ever!

268
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,000
Should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

269
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,320
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

270
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,039
Oh, God!

271
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,760
Hey, you want a beer?

272
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,590
I know!

273
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,910
Open up! Open up! Open up!

274
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,239
We'll discuss it in the morning.

275
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
What the hell is going on?

276
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,079
We took our apartment back!

277
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,160
I had nothing to do with it.

278
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,800
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

279
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,280
We are switching back right now.

280
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,439
No, we're not.
We're not leaving!

281
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
You'll have to.
You both have jobs.

282
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,199
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.

283
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,199
Right, Joe?

284
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,880
I don't know.

285
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,760
What?

286
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,560
I don't want to move again, with....

287
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,239
This is our apartment
and they stole--

288
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,160
You stole!

289
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,640
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

290
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,550
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

291
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,869
All right.

292
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:22,520
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

293
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,599
No more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

294
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,959
-Let us keep the apartment and--
-As a thank you...

295
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,959
... Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

296
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,439
-Totally worth it!
-That was one good minute!

297
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,630
Good night.

298
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,839
-Men are such idiots.
-I know.

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,439
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

300
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,760
If you had just done that
after the last contest...

301
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,160
... no one would have
had to move at all.

302
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,359
Let's pretend that's not true.

303
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,000
Scarf's done.

304
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,040
Come on, come on!

305
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,189
What's going on?

306
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,959
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

307
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,280
Emily and l, we decided...

308
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,760
... to get married.

309
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,030
What?

310
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,750
Oh, are you pregnant too?

311
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,959
When did--
How did you--

312
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,160
We just decided to go for it.

313
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,640
We know it's a bit hasty...

314
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,589
... but it just feels so right.

315
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,239
I was just telling the guys--

316
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:02,359
Yeah, I heard.

317
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,959
I think it's great!

318
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,239
I'm so happy for you!

319
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:14,239
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!

320
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,959
I can't believe
you're getting married!

321
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,800
Monica and Rachel made out.

322
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,959
Morning's here

323
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,599
The morning's here

324
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,310
Sunshine is here

325
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,920
The sky is clear

326
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,520
The morning's here

327
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,560
-Hey, you're back!
-Hey, get into gear

328
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,839
Breakfast is near

329
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,910
The dark of night has disappeared

330
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,589
I'll see you tomorrow morning!
