1
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,409
-Guys, guess what?
-What?

2
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:08,406
We're having a Halloween party!

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:09,722
-Good!
-Great!

4
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:13,932
-You have to wear a costume.
-l can't make it.

5
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:15,811
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:20,808
l'll be there. l have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

7
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:24,363
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

8
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:27,366
Not two years in a row.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,564
-l'll come, but l'm not dressing up.
-You have to.

10
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:37,285
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

11
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,172
You're an actor.

12
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:42,769
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

13
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,242
-l will.
-The girl from the wedding?

14
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:50,612
lf she needs costume ideas,
she could be a bikini model. . .

15
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:54,209
. . .or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

16
00:00:54,453 --> 00:01:00,210
Or Leatherface from <i>Texas Chainsaw</i>
<i>Massacre.</i> No! Slutty Leatherface.

17
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:04,404
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?

18
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:07,406
That's right, he was hitting on her.

19
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:12,169
And l got her. l guess
the better man won.

20
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:15,371
Please don't take her from me.

21
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,489
The One With the Halloween Party

22
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:57,605
Ursula!

23
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,287
Wait. lt's me, Phoebe.

24
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,764
l thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

25
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:05,122
Wait a second!

26
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:07,329
So, what's new with you?

27
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:11,124
Nothing.
l'm getting married next week.

28
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:12,806
What?

29
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:16,090
lt'll be a small ceremony.
Just family.

30
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,527
His.

31
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:20,606
Okay.

32
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:22,332
l'm happy for you.

33
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:27,290
Wait. lf you want to come,
l guess that'd be okay.

34
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:28,602
-Really?
-Sure.

35
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,367
You could be my sister for the day.

36
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:34,605
Yeah, okay.

37
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:39,404
My friends are having a party tonight,
so you could come.

38
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,769
Maybe l could meet the guy.

39
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:44,811
Well, l'm supposed to work tonight.

40
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:48,602
l'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

41
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:52,812
-lt's a costume party.
-So that's why you're. . . .

42
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:54,972
No.

43
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:57,363
But thanks.

44
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:06,206
-You're supposed to wear a costume.
-l am.

45
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,765
l am a woman who spent money
on a dress she wants to wear. . .

46
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,409
. . .because soon she won't
fit into it.

47
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,805
l'm Catwoman, who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

48
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,607
-Trick or treat!
-Can l give out candy?

49
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:27,563
l want to be with kids. Since l got
pregnant, l have maternal instincts.

50
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,571
-Trick or treat!
-Just a minute!

51
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,050
Look at you guys!

52
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:42,605
-Wow! You are a very scary witch.
-Thank you.

53
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:46,562
-And you are a very funny clown.
-Thank you.

54
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,092
And you. . .

55
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,689
. . .are so in style right now.

56
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:57,007
l work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line
has got this equestrian theme.

57
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:01,963
-Did you see the cover of <i>Vogue</i>--?
-Could l just have the candy?

58
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,165
Sure.

59
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,804
Catwoman. So we meet again.

60
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:18,884
So we do, Supergirl.

61
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:21,962
lt's me, Phoebe.

62
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,771
Monica, can l talk to you
for a second?

63
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,249
l appreciate the costume.

64
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,609
You did this to him?

65
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,411
l thought he'd love it.

66
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:44,569
-He loves <i>The Velveteen Rabbit.</i>
-That rabbit was brown and white.

67
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:46,968
lt was pink, or no bunny at all.

68
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:50,967
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

69
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:57,968
-You didn't dress up either?
-Yes, l did. l'm Chandler.

70
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,408
Dude, what happened?

71
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:06,245
How is that me?

72
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:09,648
l'm Chandler.

73
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,207
That is so you!

74
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:17,765
-When have l ever done that?
-When have l ever done that?

75
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:23,169
Trick or treat.

76
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,967
-You're the prettiest ballerina ever.
-Thank you.

77
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,648
That deserves another candy.

78
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,764
Thank you.

79
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,369
l have to say,
that earns ''two-two'' pieces of candy.

80
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:45,041
l love you!

81
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,362
Honey, here, take it all.

82
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,089
Monica? We need more candy.

83
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,807
-There's only been four kids.
-l know.

84
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:02,602
But one said she loved me,
so l gave her everything.

85
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,650
No wonder you're pregnant.

86
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:16,449
-What are you supposed to be?
-Remember the satellite, Sputnik?

87
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:21,252
Well, l'm a potato. Or a ''spud'' . . .

88
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,372
. . .and these are my antenna.

89
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:27,565
So Sputnik becomes. . .?

90
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:35,161
Spud-nik!

91
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:39,963
Wow! l don't have
the worst costume anymore.

92
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:44,570
All right! Ross came as doodie.

93
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:49,723
-No, l'm not doodie.
-No, space-doodie.

94
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:59,802
Hey, sweetie.

95
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:04,603
-Aren't you gonna kiss me?
-Okay.

96
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:08,209
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

97
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,489
-Ursula?
-Ursula's fiancé?

98
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:15,807
You're the sister. l just slapped
my future sister-in-law's ass.

99
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:19,284
ls your mother here?
l could slap her on the butt.

100
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:23,367
-My mother killed herself.
-See, and l knew that.

101
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,205
Now l'm sweating.

102
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:32,322
l'm sweating. Now l'm saying look
at me, l'm even sweatier. l should go.

103
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,165
No. We'll start over.

104
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:37,126
-Hi, l'm Phoebe.
-Eric.

105
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,810
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Sweat's burning my eyes.

106
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,372
-Thank you.
-There.

107
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:46,173
-What are you?
-There's no name for it.

108
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,370
l get nervous, and l sweat like crazy.

109
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:55,124
-No, l meant your costume.
-l'm a solar system.

110
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,409
My second graders helped.

111
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:00,406
-l love the second grade.
-Really?

112
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:06,165
lt's much better than first grade,
and definitely better than third.

113
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:09,763
With all the politics
and the mind games.

114
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:14,969
-So, what do you do?
-l'm a masseuse, by day.

115
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,410
-You don't have to stay with me.
-l'm having fun.

116
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:24,601
-l'm excited for you and Ursula.
-l feel very lucky. She's great.

117
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:29,369
-She's the most beautiful woman ever.
-Thank you.

118
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,609
-Hey, Joey?
-Yeah?

119
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:40,562
-You read comic books, right?
-Exclusively.

120
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,169
Who would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

121
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,483
-Catwoman, hands down.
-Yeah.

122
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:49,964
Between you and Phoebe?
l'd give Phoebe the edge.

123
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,885
-What? Really?
-You kidding?

124
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:57,412
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

125
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:00,213
She's not right behind me, is she?

126
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,011
-No, you're fine.
-Okay.

127
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:05,006
-Could l take Rachel?
-l'm not sure.

128
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,608
What? Come on, l am tough!

129
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:10,447
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

130
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:13,969
Relax. Why are you so serious?
lt doesn't matter.

131
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:18,849
Really? What if l told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

132
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,129
l would say, ''Woman, please. ''

133
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,242
Ursula's fiancé is really sweet.

134
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,007
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

135
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:35,601
Normally, l don't like sweaty guys.
But l could just mop him up.

136
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,889
-Oh, my God, Phoebe?
-What?

137
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:42,968
-You're getting a crush on him.
-No, l'm not, you are!

138
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:45,966
Here comes the temper.

139
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:49,648
Trick or treat.

140
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:54,212
Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went for more.

141
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:59,208
And l've been giving out money,
but l'm out of that too.

142
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:01,683
-Can l write you a check?
-Okay.

143
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:06,563
-Okay. What's your name?
-Lelani Mayolanofavich.

144
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:12,162
Okay, l'm just gonna write this out
to ''cash. ''

145
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:15,369
-Hi.
-Hi, Mona.

146
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:22,169
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was
hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.

147
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,371
Actually, l'm just a nurse.

148
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:30,565
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but l'm maxed out.

149
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:33,492
-You made it.
-Wait.

150
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,851
-You're a potato?
-Well, l'm a spud. . .?

151
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:42,211
-And the antenna-- You're Spud-nik!
-Yes!

152
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,169
Marry her.

153
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:50,691
Here's a good one. Who'd win
a fight between Ross and Chandler?

154
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:53,249
l can't. Chandler's my husband.

155
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,768
-So Ross?
-Yeah.

156
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:59,211
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hello, handsome.

157
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:00,568
Oh, God.

158
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,490
Look at you two.
When did you guys meet?

159
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:07,405
-Two weeks ago.
-That's it?

160
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:11,802
l know. lt sounds crazy,
and l'm not impulsive, but. . .

161
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:15,932
-. . .we have so much in common.
-Oh, really?

162
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:18,368
We're both teachers.

163
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:24,371
-And we were both in the Peace Corps.
-Peace Corps, really?

164
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:31,769
When we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and never met.

165
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:36,967
Yeah. lt wasn't a town when l got
there, but it was a town when l left.

166
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:40,851
-Shall we get me really drunk?
-Sure.

167
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:48,369
Howdy, doodie.

168
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,452
That's funny, yeah.

169
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:55,243
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

170
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:59,728
Relax, man. You're looking
a little ''flushed. ''

171
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:07,963
-Our question might get answered.
-What question?

172
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:11,569
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,
you or Ross?

173
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,563
-There's no question.
-So you think Ross too?

174
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,608
-You picked Ross?
-Ross is strong.

175
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:25,369
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

176
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:30,410
-l can't believe you didn't pick me.
-She's right. l am stronger.

177
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,803
l would destroy you.

178
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:37,569
Really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

179
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:41,053
l'll prove it like a theorem!

180
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,323
All right! Stop it!

181
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,568
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

182
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:50,209
People came to see a fight,
let's give them one!

183
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:56,365
-You guys could arm-wrestle.
-Listen to the slutty nurse.

184
00:12:56,973 --> 00:13:01,285
-You're going down.
-Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!

185
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:05,367
Seriously, guys, the trash talk
is embarrassing.

186
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,770
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much.

187
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:18,731
-You are so sweet.
-Really?

188
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:23,569
You are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

189
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,562
-Got to go.
-Trick or treat.

190
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:30,403
Hi! Wow! There you go.

191
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:35,166
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

192
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:38,206
We were, but now we've got candy.

193
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:41,367
l'd rather have the money.

194
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:45,253
That's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

195
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:46,767
This isn't fair.

196
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:50,164
ls it fair that you put on a cape
and get stuff?

197
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,369
Shut up!

198
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:53,968
You shut up!

199
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:59,766
-You can't tell me to shut up.
-l think l just did.

200
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,282
And here it comes again. Shut up!

201
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,567
No, l got it. l'm good. l got it.

202
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:11,408
Wait, l had one more thing to say.
Right. Shut up.

203
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:14,131
You're a mean old woman.

204
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,091
Wait! Shut-- Don't cry!

205
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,244
Let me get my checkbook!

206
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:23,362
You don't have to do this. The
strength inside you means the most.

207
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:27,725
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

208
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:30,612
That's the strength l want in a man.

209
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:33,925
That means nothing to me. Come on!

210
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,532
-Hi, liar.
-Hey.

211
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:43,922
He's marrying you because he thinks
the things you were saying were true.

212
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,607
-They could be true.
-But they're not.

213
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,045
lt's a fine line.

214
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,612
-Why are you lying?
-l don't know.

215
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:57,973
He did this stuff, l said l did it
too. He got so excited, it was fun.

216
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:03,610
lt's a disgusting habit,
and l want you to quit now!

217
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:06,283
She's helped so many people quit.

218
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,732
We'd better get going.

219
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:11,726
-You have a church group meeting.
-Right.

220
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:19,369
-lt was nice meeting you.
-You too.

221
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:23,367
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

222
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:27,566
Come on! Bunny versus Doodie.
We're waiting!

223
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:32,610
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

224
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:35,969
Wait. What does the winner get?

225
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,084
-Pride.
-And dignity.

226
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,801
Okay, if you say so.

227
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,964
All right, ready, set, go!

228
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,568
-Come on!
-Come on!

229
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:57,766
-Wow, they're both really strong.
-Or equally weak.

230
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:01,609
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

231
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:12,047
-So you getting tired?
-No. l could do this all day.

232
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,568
Yeah. Me too.

233
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:20,407
-Getting a little tired, though.
-God, l'm exhausted.

234
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:25,602
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

235
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:30,646
She's talking to Joey!
You've got to let me win!

236
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:33,532
Let me win.
My wife thinks l'm a wimp.

237
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:39,166
At least you have a wife.
l get divorces and knock people up.

238
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:43,412
And l'm dressed as doodie.

239
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:49,771
-You're Spud-nik.
-Come on, who we kidding? l'm doodie.

240
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,763
Please? She's watching.

241
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,764
-Fine.
-Thanks.

242
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,166
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah!

243
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:02,931
My hero!

244
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:05,368
You're a weird lady.

245
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:11,281
Ursula said she left her purse.

246
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:15,042
What a relief. lt has the numbers
for her prayer chain.

247
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,284
l'm sure it does.

248
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,372
Guess l'll see you at the wedding.

249
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:25,244
l don't think l'm gonna make it
to the wedding.

250
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:29,008
-l wish you all the luck in the world.
-We'll be okay.

251
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:33,365
lt's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

252
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:38,962
-l can't let you do this. She's lying.
-What?

253
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:43,172
She is lying. And l bet
l could prove it. Excuse me.

254
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,485
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

255
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:51,932
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

256
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:56,883
Here's the name tag from
where she works as a waitress.

257
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,283
Not a teacher, a waitress.

258
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:02,001
Here, she always lies about this.

259
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:06,769
-How old did she say she was?
-She told me she was 25.

260
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,481
l almost don't want to show you.

261
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,611
Just remember, l'm a minute younger.

262
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,362
l am so stupid.

263
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:19,763
Of course she's not a teacher.

264
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:25,206
There's no such thing as a ''Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies. ''

265
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,403
No, you're not stupid.

266
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:32,363
l'm not smart.

267
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:39,924
l just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

268
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,970
-To be romantic.
-Good.

269
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:47,884
You should be impulsive and romantic.
You did it with the wrong person.

270
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:54,002
-What?
-lt's weird, two people look so alike.

271
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:55,891
And so different.

272
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,971
Eric! Let's go!

273
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:05,771
-Better go deal with it.
-Yeah, you should.

274
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:13,970
Hurry up! l gotta pray!

275
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:28,202
l had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

276
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:29,488
That's not bad.

277
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:33,567
l also had to go to a few houses
as his girlfriend.

278
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,723
l am awful with children.

279
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:41,205
You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

280
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:44,763
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

281
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:47,407
-That's all it is?
-Absolutely.

282
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:54,001
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

283
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:57,211
They get crazy during the summer too.

284
00:19:57,453 --> 00:20:00,763
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

285
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,965
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that.

286
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,973
Look, l'm sorry you lost.

287
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:14,763
l got a secret for you.
l let him win.

288
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:18,007
Was that a secret, or a lie?

289
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,209
-No, l let him-- Ross?
-Yeah?

290
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,445
Would you tell her
l let you win, please?

291
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:27,170
Chandler ''let me win. ''

292
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:33,411
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

293
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:36,611
l am strong. l'll show you.

294
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,206
Chandler, please.

295
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,250
What's the matter? Scared?

296
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,972
Let's go, big bunny!

297
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:47,768
One, two, three. Go!

298
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,965
l'm gonna kill myself!
