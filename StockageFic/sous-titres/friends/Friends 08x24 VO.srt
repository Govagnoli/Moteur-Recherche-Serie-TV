00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:03,532
<i>Previously on</i> Friends:

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,763
l've been at this for 1 7 hours.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,043
-How many centimeters am l dilated?
-Three.

4
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:11,529
Just three? l'm dilated three!

5
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:15,770
-We talk about having babies someday.
-We're gonna try?

6
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:19,170
-Right here?
-No, not here.

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,449
Maybe here.

8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:25,168
Your grandma's engagement ring,
l want you to give it to Rachel.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,483
-Mom, no.
-This isn't some girl. . .

10
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,692
. . .you picked up in a bar
and humped.

11
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:35,128
l take it you're just visiting someone?

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,449
-Wanna visit someone else?
-l would like that.

13
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,525
-That's him.
-Great. Go get him!

14
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,405
Maybe you could go in first.

15
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:46,242
l'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
l have a few routine questions.

16
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:49,843
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

17
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:55,167
Oh, my God!

18
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:08,645
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
room right next to hers?

19
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:12,807
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

20
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,810
Well, let me think about that.
While l remove my pants!

21
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:23,011
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

22
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:35,452
Does that sound like Janice?

23
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:38,446
lf it's not, then there's two of them.

24
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:42,202
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!

25
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:44,887
The One Where Rachel has a Baby - Part ll

26
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:21,682
Hey.

27
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:22,842
-Hey.
-Hi.

28
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:26,085
l can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you?

29
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:32,089
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

30
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,090
Weirdest thing. Did l hear--?

31
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,648
Mother of God, it's true!

32
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:43,967
Chandler Bing!

33
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,122
Janice.

34
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:50,771
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

35
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:54,403
Oh, this should be easy.
l have a very wide pelvis.

36
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,928
You remember, Chandler.

37
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,329
l didn't know you were pregnant.

38
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:06,123
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

39
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,450
lt's you.

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,843
This is yours.

41
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,605
What?

42
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:18,642
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

43
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:24,486
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

44
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,802
Okay, l have one.
lf you had to, which would you eat?

45
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:34,205
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

46
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:39,690
l'd have to say the talking gorilla.

47
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:44,449
'Cause at least l could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

48
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:48,409
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.

49
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,723
Wow. What is it? l'm sorry.

50
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:53,771
l'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

51
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,606
Oh. l'll get it.

52
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:02,443
l usually get to know a girl better
before l let her spoon me.

53
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:05,764
Relax. lt's not like we're forking.

54
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:17,291
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies. . .

55
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,808
. . .and l have had no babies.

56
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,692
Why doesn't she want to come out?

57
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:25,731
l think you made such a nice
home for her. . .

58
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:30,011
. . .the last nine months,
that she just doesn't want to leave.

59
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:35,924
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

60
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:40,050
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.

61
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,721
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

62
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:45,128
Do something! Get me drugs. . .

63
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:49,172
. . .or you light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out!

64
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,923
l think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

65
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,082
What?

66
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,451
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.

67
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:03,003
Oh, my God. Okay.

68
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,405
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

69
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:17,968
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

70
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:23,165
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

71
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:27,762
l'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here. . .

72
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,811
. . .asking me all these weird questions.

73
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:35,006
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here?

74
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,562
Rachel's having her baby!

75
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,848
That's him! You know him?

76
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:45,968
Okay. Okay. l-- Okay.

77
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:50,012
l sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

78
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:53,961
lf it, you know, if it helps,
you came off great.

79
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,682
A lot better than l'm coming off
right now.

80
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:01,812
l don't believe this. You had him
pretend he was a fake doctor?

81
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,449
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

82
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:12,130
-You tried making me think l was crazy?
-That was wrong. l'm so sorry.

83
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:16,411
lt's just that l liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

84
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,722
l don't think so.

85
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:22,689
lf l may? You told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

86
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:27,688
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

87
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:31,129
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

88
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,565
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.

89
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:42,447
Her twin sister used to do porn.

90
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:46,572
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.

91
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:53,011
We don't know each other,
so it'd be easy to forget this. . .

92
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:57,172
. . .but there's something between us.
l don't know about you. . .

93
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,887
. . .but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

94
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:05,604
-lt doesn't happen to me, either.
-Me, neither!

95
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,970
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.

96
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,811
Five, four. . . .

97
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,208
Three, two, one! Oh!

98
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:20,090
The next contraction will be
in 20 seconds.

99
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,051
-l can't push anymore!
-You're doing great.

100
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:26,290
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,729
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

102
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,685
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.

103
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:34,363
-l see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

104
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:37,565
-Don't say ''Oh, my God! '' What?!
-What is that?

105
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,167
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

106
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,372
-l thought she had two heads.
-Oh, God!

107
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,727
Will she be okay?

108
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:47,292
-She'll be fine.
-Yeah.

109
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:50,530
She's in a difficult position,
so push hard.

110
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,963
-Okay.
-Go. Come on. Go! Go!

111
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,970
You'll have to push harder.

112
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:59,530
-l'm sorry, l can't! l can't!
-Yes, you can. l know you can do this.

113
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:03,891
l can't do it.
Please, you do it for me!

114
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:10,362
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

115
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,690
Good.

116
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,407
Keep pushing!

117
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:18,970
Are you okay?

118
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:23,562
You have no idea how much this hurts.

119
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:28,649
Keep going! Keep going!

120
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:30,132
Here we go!

121
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:33,205
She's upside down, but she's coming!

122
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,922
-Oh, God!
-Oh! Oh, my God!

123
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:38,926
Oh, my God, she's here.

124
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,803
Oh, she's perfect.

125
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:48,803
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

126
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:56,766
-Where'd she go?
-They're just wrapping her up.

127
00:08:56,973 --> 00:09:01,012
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

128
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,690
Here she is.

129
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,562
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

130
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,410
l know. Oh.

131
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:32,811
She's looking at me. Hi. l know you.

132
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:36,405
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.

133
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:40,009
Fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Greene.

134
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,683
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

135
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:02,809
Hello, Baby Girl.

136
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:10,448
-Can we come in?
-Oh, come on in.

137
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:14,208
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.

138
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:15,852
Here.

139
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:20,929
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

140
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:25,883
Oh, l'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

141
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:30,448
lt's incredible. l mean,
one minute she's inside you. . .

142
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:33,685
. . .and then 47 hours later,
here she is.

143
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:41,690
She looks so real.

144
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,966
You know what l mean.

145
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,443
-Okay, my turn. My turn.
-Aunt Phoebe.

146
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,492
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

147
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:55,566
Oh, l could squeeze your little head.

148
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:59,048
l won't.

149
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:04,003
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. l just can't stop crying.

150
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:07,882
The doctor said it's normal,
plus you're sleep-deprived.

151
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,123
You guys are all sleep-deprived.

152
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:15,168
l don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

153
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,171
Oh, God.

154
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:21,764
-What's the matter now?
-l was reliving it.

155
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:25,605
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?

156
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:30,847
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
l thought that was so original.

157
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:34,366
Actually, we've narrowed it
down to two.

158
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:40,250
And you know what? l love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.

159
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:45,931
Wow, okay. Everyone?

160
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:50,006
This is lsabella.

161
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:53,927
-Hi, lsabella!
-Hi.

162
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:57,562
What?

163
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:00,446
That's not her name.

164
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,969
l'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an lsabella.

165
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,482
-What was the other one?
-Delilah.

166
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:11,289
Oh, great! At least she
sounds like a biblical whore.

167
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,646
So, l guess we're back to Baby Girl.

168
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:20,402
What will we do?

169
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,212
-You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.

170
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:26,092
You know what your
kids' names will be.

171
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:30,485
-You do?
-l had them picked out since l was 1 4.

172
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:35,448
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

173
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:43,453
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. lf it's a boy, it's Daniel.

174
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:46,884
-And if it's a girl?
-l don't want to say.

175
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:50,972
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

176
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,522
Okay. lt's Emma.

177
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,645
Emma.

178
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,166
See, l don't want it.

179
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:10,285
-Take it.
-What?

180
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:12,445
She's clearly an Emma.

181
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:15,810
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

182
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:19,409
Yeah. But l love you more.

183
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:25,524
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So l'm screwed.

184
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:36,370
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

185
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,609
Oh.

186
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,889
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

187
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,692
He's a keeper.

188
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:55,610
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, l'm fine.

189
00:13:56,613 --> 00:14:02,370
l really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.

190
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:05,047
l'm not doing it alone. l have Ross.

191
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:10,486
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?

192
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:14,768
Well, then he gets a divorce.
lt's Ross.

193
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,687
l'm telling you. Listen to Janice.

194
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:25,769
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

195
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,208
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what l thought.

196
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:34,446
l'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father. . .

197
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:36,888
. . .and little Miss New Boobs.

198
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,729
Really?

199
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,403
l hate to be the one to say it. . .

200
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:47,408
. . .but, honey, you two are on your own.

201
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,286
Well, that's, you know, that's. . . .

202
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:55,571
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

203
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,365
Maybe we won't be alone.

204
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:03,288
Because lately things have been
happening between me and Ross.

205
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:08,004
And right before l went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

206
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:13,850
So it might be the beginning
of something.

207
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:17,041
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, hi.

208
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:21,486
Who's this little guy?

209
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:25,891
-Aaron, your future son-in-law.
-Oh, no, no.

210
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,486
-l'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.

211
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,085
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

212
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,006
You know what l was thinking about?

213
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:47,931
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?

214
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,892
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

215
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:54,692
But we, we gotta be careful.

216
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:59,085
We-- You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

217
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,490
Right.

218
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:08,962
-We don't want to go down that road.
-No. That's why l brought it up.

219
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:16,002
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. l'm sorry.

220
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:20,086
l was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

221
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,525
And so it begins.

222
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:31,922
She in there?

223
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,450
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

224
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:40,209
-Look at Emma.
-l can't decide who she looks like.

225
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:44,605
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! lt's all Rachel.

226
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:53,442
l'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

227
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:57,410
No, l know.
Because you're not in that place.

228
00:16:57,573 --> 00:17:00,645
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

229
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,362
lt's complicated, okay?

230
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:09,325
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.

231
00:17:09,493 --> 00:17:11,802
There's no right answer.

232
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:18,009
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.

233
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:21,051
And now we have a baby.

234
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:27,883
lt's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

235
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,490
l could never do that to Emma.

236
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:38,683
l mean, she came into this world
thinking everything-- Now me.

237
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:42,448
What, do they put something
in the water here?

238
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:46,409
lt's just, Rachel and l,
we're doing really well now.

239
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:50,248
l know. lf you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

240
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:53,211
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.

241
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,812
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 1 5.

242
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,050
Hey.

243
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,649
l saw a woman breastfeeding
twins at the same time.

244
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:15,452
lt is like a freak show up here.

245
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,930
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

246
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,685
What is it? Hey?

247
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:24,005
-Really, it's nothing. l'm. . . .
-Rach, come on. What?

248
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:29,608
l've just been thinking about how
my baby and l are gonna be all alone.

249
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,732
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?

250
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:38,883
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

251
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,090
Okay, how long
was l watching that woman?

252
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:45,207
l'm just saying that, you know. . .

253
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:48,405
. . .someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody. . .

254
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:51,326
. . .and he's gonna have his own life.

255
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:52,767
Right?

256
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:55,649
Yeah, l guess so.

257
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:02,723
l just never thought l'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

258
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,565
That's pretty dumb, huh?

259
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:07,765
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

260
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:11,926
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

261
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:16,644
Okay? l promise l
won't let that happen.

262
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:23,251
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would l do without you?

263
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,849
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

264
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,291
Could you grab me my other box
of tissues?

265
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:36,923
-They're under Ross' coat.
-Sure.

266
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:47,926
Oh, my God!

267
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,329
Joey?

268
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,767
Oh, my God.

269
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,843
Okay.

270
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:38,011
-That was amazing.
-l know.

271
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:45,490
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

272
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:49,805
We may have started our family.
ln nine months we could be here. . .

273
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:52,123
. . .having our own baby.

274
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,649
And if not, we got to do it
on a bucket.
