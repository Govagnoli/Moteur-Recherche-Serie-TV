1
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:06,927
ls it okay if l bring someone
to your parents' anniversary?

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:08,122
-Sure.
-Yeah.

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:11,450
-Who's the guy?
-Parker, we met at the cleaners.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:15,648
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

5
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:19,124
Who said that?

6
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:24,208
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

7
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:29,971
He treats me like a queen. Except
when he treats me like a naughty girl.

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,886
Would it be okay if l give the toast?

9
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:36,892
Even after what happened
at their 20th?

10
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:41,450
-l'd really like to.
-Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

11
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:46,807
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:52,451
-This year, l'm gonna make them cry.
-You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

13
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:57,568
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone
cries and pats him on the back.

14
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:02,284
And they all come up to me and say,
''God, your brother. ''

15
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,685
You know what they're gonna say
this year? ''God, you. ''

16
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,006
Well, at least one
person will be crying.

17
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:15,246
l'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

18
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:19,366
-Really? You can do that?
-Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

19
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:32,163
Well, l can't do it
with you guys watching me!

20
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:34,644
The One in Massapequa

21
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:14,204
-What are you doing?
-l'm working on my toast.

22
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:17,769
Or as l like to call it:
''Sob-fest 2002. ''

23
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,003
-Hey, check this out.
-lt's a dog.

24
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:23,681
lt's a dead dog.

25
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,726
Chi-Chi. She died
when l was in high school.

26
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:30,642
-You're talking about a dead pet?
-lt's good stuff, huh?

27
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,411
Joey? You got a present
for my parents?

28
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:42,209
ln honor of their 35th anniversary,
l had a star named after them.

29
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:48,369
-That is so cool.
-And l got <i>Kama Sutra for the Elderly.</i>

30
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,772
-Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
-Sure.

31
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:58,242
What do you need? We got lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt--

32
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:01,971
And l think my testicles
may be in here too.

33
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:09,889
Chi-Chi! Oh, l loved this dog.

34
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:14,484
Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

35
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:20,482
-What?
-You're the 200-pounder that rode her!

36
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:27,368
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is--

37
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:32,368
No, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel. . .

38
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:36,168
. . .and l'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

39
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:40,043
Chandler, l'm kidding!
Already you're my favorite.

40
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,963
-Tell me a little about yourselves.
-Actually, we should get going.

41
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,212
Classic Ross!

42
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:54,089
Rachel, look how you glow! May l?

43
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,530
l think you already are.

44
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:00,043
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

45
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:05,686
ls there anything more miraculous--
A picture of a dog! Whose is this?

46
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:10,251
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

47
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:16,289
Well, at least you were lucky to have
him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

48
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:21,604
-So where's the party?
-lt's in Massapequa.

49
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:27,291
Massapequa, it sounds magical. ls it
steeped in Native American history?

50
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:30,883
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

51
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,693
l got my notes. You got the presents?

52
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:37,767
-l've got the car keys.
-We're driving? Aces.

53
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,406
-So he seems like a nice guy.
-Yeah, l like him a lot.

54
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:49,363
-You want to hang back and take a cab?
-Okay, otherwise l'm not going.

55
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,764
-Hey, Mom.
-This is such a great party!

56
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:05,883
Thirty-five years. lmpressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?

57
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,969
-Jack?
-Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

58
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:14,563
lt's a good question, Dad.
lt's a good question.

59
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,411
-Congratulations, you two.
-Thank you, we're so excited.

60
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:24,162
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

61
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:28,762
-Can we talk to you for just a moment?
-Yeah.

62
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:31,931
lt's just a little thing.

63
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:37,765
While we think it's marvelous you're
having this baby out of wedlock. . .

64
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,086
. . .our friends are less open-minded.

65
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,767
-We told them you're married.
-What?

66
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,362
Thanks for going along with this.

67
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:51,645
-We have to pretend that we're married?
-l had to shave my ears.

68
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,081
You can do this.

69
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:56,809
-Can you believe that?
-l know.

70
00:05:57,053 --> 00:06:01,205
lf you do the ears, you may as well
take a pass at the nose.

71
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:04,564
l don't want to have to lie
about being married.

72
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:08,527
l don't either. But it's their party,
and it's one night.

73
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,201
We don't have to lie.
We won't talk.

74
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,610
lf it comes up,
we'll smile, we'll nod along. . . .

75
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:15,802
-Ross?
-Rachel?

76
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:19,164
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

77
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:24,083
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

78
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:29,731
-Here's something to start you out.
-How's marriage treating you?

79
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,370
-Unbelievable. lt's great!
-l love marriage.

80
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:34,926
We'll see you later.

81
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,249
-Hey!
-Hi!

82
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,965
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

83
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:46,372
l have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C. . .

84
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:51,411
. . .l feel so lucky. Think of the good
times that happened here.

85
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:56,488
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

86
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,412
None will compare with tonight.
l don't want to forget it.

87
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:06,641
lt's like l want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

88
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:10,371
l don't think the flash went off.

89
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,087
-l'm gonna find the men's room.
-Me too.

90
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:22,601
There is someone with a tranquilizer
gun and a net looking for that man.

91
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:27,523
l have to go too, but l don't
want him complimenting my thing.

92
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,452
Glad we weren't in the car.
Did he let up?

93
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:34,771
He called the Long lsland
Expressway a ''concrete miracle. ''

94
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:38,091
This room. This night.

95
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:44,010
That waiter! His shoes!
l must take a mental picture!

96
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:45,766
Sorry.

97
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:52,563
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

98
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:56,169
That depends, how much did you hear?

99
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:00,762
He's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

100
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,811
-lt's so much.
-Well, so what? l like him.

101
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:08,006
Do l make fun of the people you date?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

102
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:12,405
No, because friends don't do that.
Do you want my opinion?

103
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:18,808
Your collective dating record reads
like a who's who of human crap!

104
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:23,404
-l feel terrible.
-l know.

105
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,284
What was wrong with Mona?

106
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,573
-Open it, open it, open it.
-Yeah, baby!

107
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:38,522
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

108
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:44,569
-We were surprised we weren't invited.
-No, it was a small wedding.

109
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,284
But it was beautiful.
lt was small, but kind of spectacular.

110
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:54,089
-Where did you have it?
-On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

111
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:59,327
And Stevie Wonder sang ''lsn't She
Lovely'' as l walked down the aisle.

112
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:03,367
-Stevie's a family friend.
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.

113
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:07,242
-l'd love to see pictures.
-Yeah, so would l.

114
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:12,766
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

115
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,442
Would you excuse us for a second?

116
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:25,162
-What are you doing?
-What? This may be my only wedding.

117
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:29,608
-And l want it to be amazing.
-Okay.

118
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:34,005
-Maybe l rode in on a Harley.
-Ross, it has to be realistic.

119
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:42,812
Say, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

120
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:48,485
-No, l'm fine. l'm great. l'm with you.
-And l'm with you. What a great time!

121
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,766
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

122
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:57,971
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

123
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:01,690
Oysters! Let me feed you.
That's not necessary.

124
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,326
-Please?
-l don't eat--

125
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:06,764
-l won't quit until you try one.
-Okay, fine.

126
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,245
-Good.
-What're they like? l've never had one.

127
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,403
-Try one.
-They look too weird.

128
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:24,169
-What are you doing?
-Going over my toast.

129
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:29,322
l can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

130
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:33,965
lf you want to, l could just
hold them down and you could just. . . .

131
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:39,882
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

132
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:43,403
-Blind?
-Not at first, but it's intricate work.

133
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:47,726
They said even though they lost
their sight, it was worth it.

134
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:51,364
-l bet you looked beautiful.
-Well, l don't know.

135
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:56,368
But there were some people that said
l looked like a floating angel.

136
00:10:56,773 --> 00:11:01,210
-How did you propose?
-Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

137
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,292
Well, actually, l took her
to the planetarium.

138
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:10,168
That's where we had our first date.

139
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:14,930
l had the room filled with lilies,
her favorite flower.

140
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:19,168
-That is so sweet!
-l want to hear the rest!

141
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:25,363
Then Fred Astaire singing,
''The Way You Look Tonight'' came on. . .

142
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:28,406
. . .the lights came down,
l got on one knee. . .

143
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:32,805
. . .and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

144
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,567
''Will you marry me?''

145
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:40,332
And the ring was the size of my fist.

146
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:44,770
Hey, Phoebe? Look. . .

147
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:49,768
. . .l want to apologize. Okay?
We were being jerks.

148
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:53,892
-Parker's nice, l'd like to know him.
-You better do it now.

149
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,448
-Why?
-Because l'm gonna kill him.

150
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:01,169
-What?
-He's too excited about everything.

151
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:05,571
l'm all for living, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

152
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,685
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

153
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,730
l'm having the worst time.

154
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:14,886
There was a line for the buffet,
and when l got to the plates. . .

155
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:18,165
. . .l slipped on a giant booger.

156
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:23,205
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

157
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,766
lt could've been.
l didn't look at it.

158
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,801
l wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out.

159
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:34,807
l thought he was a great guy.
l was so excited about him.

160
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:38,289
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

161
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,763
There's nothing wrong with him.

162
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,884
-You think?
-Yeah, know what?

163
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:46,688
-We were all just being too negative.
-You're right.

164
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,768
He's just embracing life. We could
all stand to be more like Parker.

165
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:55,403
You know what? l'm like him!
l'm a positive person!

166
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:58,725
-Actually, you have an edge.
-What's that?

167
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:03,412
-Oh, it's Parker!
-Look, the Bunny Hop!

168
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,211
-Oh, l love it!
-You do?

169
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:09,929
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on!

170
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:14,367
Okay, it's time for the toast.

171
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:19,129
l know normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year l'll do it.

172
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:23,843
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

173
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:26,006
Okay.

174
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:30,405
Mom, Dad, when l got married. . .

175
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:36,444
. . .the thing that made me sure l could
do it was the example you two set.

176
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:40,568
For that, and other things,
l want to thank you.

177
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:44,561
l know l probably don't
say it enough. . .

178
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:46,969
. . .but l love you.

179
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:03,727
When l look around, l'm saddened by the
thought of those who could not be here.

180
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:09,173
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

181
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,205
But she can't. . .

182
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:13,011
. . .because she's dead.

183
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:19,451
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

184
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:24,291
l mean, look how cute she is. . .was.

185
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:29,241
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

186
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:34,322
Remember she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

187
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:39,765
Wow!

188
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:46,284
Does anybody remember when. . .

189
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:51,846
. . .Debra Winger had to say goodbye to
her children in <i>Terms of Endearment</i>?

190
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:54,686
Didn't see that?

191
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:58,007
No movie fans?!

192
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,769
You want to hear something sad?

193
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:06,086
l was watching a <i>60 Minutes</i>
piece on orphans in Romania. . .

194
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:11,168
. . .who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

195
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,570
You people are made of stone!

196
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,970
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

197
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,409
Thank you, Monica.
That was interesting.

198
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:37,169
-Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
-Why don't l remember this dog?

199
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:42,485
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

200
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:46,402
Oh, no, Mom.
lt's just Monica this year.

201
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:50,851
You're not saying anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

202
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,971
No, of course.

203
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:01,966
Everybody? l just wanted to say. . .

204
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:05,250
. . .on behalf of my new bride, Rachel. . .

205
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:12,167
. . .and myself, that if. . .

206
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:18,086
. . .if in 35 years, we're half
as happy as you guys are. . .

207
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:22,372
. . .we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

208
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,730
Oh, Ross.

209
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,090
l just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

210
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:42,167
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

211
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:47,962
Can l get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

212
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:52,292
l must say, this apartment,
it's. . .there are no words.

213
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:55,007
-Thank God.
-lt's a haven.

214
00:16:55,253 --> 00:17:00,327
-A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.
-Yeah, l know, l know. Gotcha.

215
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:06,688
Listen, why don't we just sit and
relax, just be with each other quietly.

216
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,170
That sounds great.

217
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:13,687
This is the most comfortable couch
l've ever sat on.

218
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,686
Let's try something.
Let's play a game.

219
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,566
-l love games.
-Shocking.

220
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:23,363
Let's play the game of. . .

221
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:27,363
. . .who can stay quiet the longest.

222
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,492
Or Jenga.

223
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:36,768
Let's play this one first, and
remember, whoever talks first loses.

224
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:44,365
-l lose, now Jenga.
-Oh, my God.

225
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,405
-ls something wrong?
-You know the word ''wrong''?

226
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:51,087
Everything isn't perfect or magical?

227
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,882
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of fairies?

228
00:17:55,133 --> 00:18:01,368
-They were just brake lights, Parker!
-Excuse me for seeing good in traffic.

229
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,205
You don't have to put
a good spin on everything!

230
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:09,964
-l'm sorry. l'm a positive person.
-No, l'm a positive person.

231
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:14,172
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

232
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,889
At Disneyland, getting laid!

233
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:22,726
You want me to be negative?
You want me to be less happy?

234
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,889
Much less happy.

235
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:29,041
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
''l better be going. ''

236
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,810
So long!

237
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:38,122
Don't let the ''best door in the world''
hit you in the ass on your way out.

238
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:46,370
lsn't this the most incredible fight
you've had in your life?

239
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:54,849
We could've gone from the ceremony to
the reception with you in the sidecar.

240
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,850
lt just isn't feasible.

241
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:02,411
But a dove placing the ring on your
finger would've been no problem.

242
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:08,807
-lt was fun being married to you.
-Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.

243
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,689
-Okay, Ross, can l ask you something?
-Yeah.

244
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:18,370
-That proposal at the planetarium?
-l know, l know. lt was stupid.

245
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:24,250
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

246
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:29,282
lt was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

247
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:32,613
l thought of it
when we were going out.

248
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:37,369
That's how l imagined
l would ask you to marry me.

249
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,766
Wow.

250
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:44,965
Well, that would've been
very hard to say no to.

251
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:53,046
lt's a good thing l didn't do it, it
sounds like a very expensive wedding.

252
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:02,562
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

253
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:09,532
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
to protect your hair?

254
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,930
-l will think about it.
-That's all l'm asking.

255
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,768
Okay, that's it. l give up.

256
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:22,443
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you give the speech.

257
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:26,248
You know, l don't understand
why they didn't cry.

258
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:29,411
-Come on.
-That stuff you said about true love?

259
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:33,965
You were right. We did learn
a lot from Mom and Dad.

260
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:37,762
That picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

261
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:44,168
And what you said about Nana? Yeah,
she really would've wanted to be there.

262
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,968
And you know what?

263
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,049
l think she was.

264
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:54,968
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it?
