1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:10,646
Wait. Before we go in, l just
want you to know that l love you.

2
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:13,571
l had a great time on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:17,162
l can't wait
to spend our life together.

4
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:20,484
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

5
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,283
You're back!

6
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:27,445
Come on in!

7
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:31,930
How was the honeymoon?

8
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:36,330
So much fun. The best part is,
we met this great couple.

9
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:40,889
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:44,210
They're cool.
lt was their honeymoon too.

11
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:46,329
They live here in the city.

12
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,649
Can we go call them?
ls it too soon to call?

13
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:53,811
We're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:58,722
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

15
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:02,209
lt's different.
Greg and Jenny are married.

16
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:05,882
Greg and Jenny?
''Hi, Greg. l'm Chandler. ''

17
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:10,085
''Hi, Monica. This is Jenny. ''
''Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg. ''

18
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,964
-They're great. lf you just--
-You know what?

19
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:17,448
Give us our souvenirs
and get out of here.

20
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:22,082
-We didn't get a chance to--
-You're kidding!

21
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:26,287
-We didn't get anything for anyone.
-Nice necklace.

22
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,326
That you can have.

23
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:32,843
The One With the Videotape

24
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:11,449
-Welcome home.
-How was the honeymoon?

25
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,564
Great! How about you?
You're having a baby!

26
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,685
-Look, l have a sonogram picture.
-Good.

27
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:23,207
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

28
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:30,051
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?
When? How many times?

29
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:33,961
Monica, that's not right.
Start with where.

30
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,929
lt happened about six weeks ago.

31
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:45,246
l got home and Ross was there.
He'd been hanging out with Joey.

32
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:48,125
You're welcome, buddy.

33
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,087
Yeah, thanks.

34
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:58,481
l had a lot of work,
and Ross offered to help.

35
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,286
We had wine, we got to talking.

36
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:05,280
Next thing you know,
Ross comes on to me.

37
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:09,092
That's a little misleading.

38
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:12,369
-What is?
-The lie you just told.

39
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:17,082
-That you came on to me?
-There's the one!

40
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:20,887
-But you did. Let's be honest.
-Yes, let's.

41
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,883
lt's not important.

42
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:29,847
What's important is, we're having
a baby, not who came on to who.

43
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:32,088
''Whom. ''

44
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,687
That's right.

45
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:41,322
-You kissed me first.
-You were begging for it!

46
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,881
You were sending me signals!

47
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:49,490
l was sending signals? Anyone think
that l'd send Ross begging signals?

48
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,081
Please, show of hands.

49
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:58,324
lt doesn't matter what people believe!
lt happened.

50
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:03,692
Maybe l need to be more careful.
Am l sending these signals now?

51
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:08,289
-You know what? Just drop it.
-Show me how l begged you.

52
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:12,047
l can show you!
l have it on videotape.

53
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,882
lt's an expression.

54
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:29,049
l can't believe
he taped them having sex.

55
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:33,211
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

56
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:36,325
Such a rookie mistake.

57
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:40,081
-Know who has a great camera?
-Greg and Jenny?

58
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:43,206
-l want to call them.
-Let's call.

59
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:46,563
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

60
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,247
8th Street Deli?

61
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:58,331
Hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

62
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:01,530
-Sorry, wrong number.
-Here you go, babe.

63
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:06,844
Hello?
lt's the deli again!

64
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:09,805
All right, l'll have a sandwich.

65
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:12,890
l don't think this number's right.

66
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:19,281
-What?
-You got fake-numbered.

67
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:24,285
-What? People don't do that.
-Oh, l think we do.

68
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,490
-Why would they do that?
-l don't know.

69
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:31,691
You were a delight.
You asked those great questions.

70
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:36,642
And you were never funnier.
Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

71
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,320
You still got me and Phoebe.

72
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:43,320
Excuse me, l don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

73
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:48,242
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

74
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:50,363
l wonder why, pervert.

75
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,928
Okay, l am not a pervert.

76
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,283
That's, like, the pervert motto.

77
00:05:56,492 --> 00:06:01,885
You raise your hand, put your left
hand down your pants and repeat that.

78
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:04,966
Filming Rachel was not planned.

79
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:08,289
Here's what happened.
Joey can back me up.

80
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:13,282
A month and a half ago, remember
l came to you with a problem?

81
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:16,492
The personal thing?

82
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:21,520
-What personal thing?
-About sex?

83
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:26,283
That l hadn't had sex in months?

84
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,330
Yeah, l knew what
you were talking about.

85
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:43,247
l'd like to talk about something
l'm uncomfortable talking about.

86
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:45,090
Sure.

87
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:49,805
How about you showering
with your mom?

88
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:55,086
l actually had a topic in mind.

89
00:06:57,452 --> 00:07:02,651
l'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

90
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:05,525
-For, like, months?
-Five, to be. . .

91
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,649
. . .lying. Six.

92
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:10,242
Six months? That's rough.

93
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:15,651
lt's not all bad. l'm learning to
appreciate the small things, like. . .

94
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:20,243
. . .the sound of a bird
and the color of the sky.

95
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:24,081
The sky's blue, Ross.
And l had sex yesterday.

96
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:28,691
Please help me.
l have a date tonight.

97
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:32,009
lt has to go well.
l'm scared for my health.

98
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:36,851
l got something.
lt's this story that l came up with.

99
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:40,681
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it is putty.

100
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,405
Tell it to me.

101
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:47,322
Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

102
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,325
Remember, it is just the story.

103
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:55,003
l'll try to control myself.

104
00:07:57,332 --> 00:08:01,245
Years ago, l was backpacking
across Western Europe--

105
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:06,651
-You were backpacking across Europe?
-Have a nice six more months.

106
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:12,085
l'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and. . .?

107
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:18,971
l was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

108
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:25,689
l was at the end of this path,
and there was a lake.

109
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:29,811
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

110
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,488
lt was dead silent.
Gorgeous.

111
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:39,409
And across the lake l saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

112
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,450
But she was crying.

113
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:45,531
Why?

114
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,323
This is great wine.

115
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:56,767
lt's from France.

116
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,602
ln Europe.

117
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:03,286
Western Europe.

118
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:10,846
A few years ago l was backpacking
across Western Europe.

119
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:14,681
-Really?
-Wait, it gets better.

120
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,161
Yeah, l was in Barcelona.

121
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:23,081
l studied for a year in Barcelona.

122
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:28,771
-Anyway, so l was hiking--
-l love hiking!

123
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,883
Oh, that's great!

124
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:37,009
l was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo--

125
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:41,205
-l think it's ''Tibidabo. ''
-Do you want to tell the story?

126
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:46,842
How'd your date go?

127
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:50,886
Great. l'm across the street
having sex right now.

128
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:56,208
-Your story sucks.
-Then you didn't tell it right.

129
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:59,643
-Show me how you did it.
-No, l don't want to.

130
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:04,972
-How long since you seen a girl naked?
-l was backpacking. . . .

131
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:10,200
-l'm not feeling it.
-l was outside Barcelona, hiking--

132
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:15,850
-Ross, l'm not hot. Are you hot?
-lt's been six months. l'm always hot.

133
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:19,931
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

134
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:23,005
l gotta go, l got a date.
But try this.

135
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,766
Do what l do before an audition.

136
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:30,563
Use my camera to record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

137
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,285
l'll try that.

138
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:38,522
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.
Just hit record. Good luck.

139
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:44,881
lf you ever have any problem with the
ladies, you know l'll help you out.

140
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,886
That means a lot to me, man.

141
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:14,925
Can l get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

142
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:19,842
Ross, thank God you're here.
You have to help me.

143
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,725
Were you talking to yourself?

144
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:26,521
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, l was.

145
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:30,560
<i>When she came in,</i>
<i>I totally forgot about the camera.</i>

146
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:34,287
lt kept rolling
and recorded everything.

147
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:38,969
Yeah, we're gonna need
to see that tape.

148
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:43,481
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

149
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:46,565
lt's not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

150
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,888
Thank you.

151
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:54,525
-No.
-You're right.

152
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:59,847
-Joey, no.
-Loud and clear.

153
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:09,130
l don't get why
they'd give us a fake number.

154
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:15,129
lf they knew what they were doing,
they didn't give you real names.

155
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:20,326
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but not fake names.

156
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:24,281
Hi. Ken Adams.
Nice to meet you.

157
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:27,492
Regina Phalange.

158
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,846
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-l know.

159
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:36,082
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

160
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:40,567
You said they were funny.
Joke, joke, joke!

161
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:43,366
Joke, joke, blah-blah.

162
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,964
-lt was your questions.
-What about them?

163
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:56,087
The sheer volume.
lt was like flying with the Riddler.

164
00:12:57,372 --> 00:13:01,160
-Was that another joke?
-Was that another question?

165
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,490
ls Ross still here?

166
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:10,089
No, but he told us what happened.
lt was an honest mistake.

167
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:14,922
How would you like it if l had sex
with you and l taped it?

168
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:17,282
Oh, forget it.

169
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:23,846
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

170
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,961
lt was an accident, okay?

171
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:30,283
l feel bad.
l swear, l didn't even watch it.

172
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:33,131
Anyway, here.

173
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:37,285
You might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

174
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,488
Thank you.

175
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,402
What?

176
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:53,281
-You don't want to see this, do you?
-Hell, yeah!

177
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,686
l am not gonna show you this.

178
00:13:56,932 --> 00:14:00,720
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

179
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:02,923
Forget it.

180
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:08,724
We'll think of another way to put the
''who came on to who'' thing to rest.

181
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,770
Come on now, think!

182
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:16,605
lt's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants.

183
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:21,124
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

184
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:25,001
-l want to see it.
-What?

185
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:27,282
You don't want us to see this.

186
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:33,608
You so badly don't want us to see it
that it makes me want to see it.

187
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:38,485
Are we watching the tape or not?

188
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:44,610
-lt's for your sake.
-l don't believe you.

189
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:48,282
l think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

190
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:53,286
-Rachel, please?
-Oh, a little preview.

191
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:59,880
Fine. l want the record to show
that l tried to take the high road.

192
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:05,365
Because in about five minutes,
l'm gonna be saying. . . .

193
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:12,643
Okay, here we go.

194
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:18,127
l'm so happy.

195
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,851
<i>Thank God you're here. Help me.</i>
<i>Were you talking to yourself?</i>

196
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,931
-There l am.
-You're gonna get pregnant.

197
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,210
<i>I screwed up so bad.</i>

198
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:37,486
<i>I told Monica that I'd send</i>
<i>those wedding invitations weeks ago.</i>

199
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:39,085
<i>You didn 't do it?</i>

200
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:44,366
<i>I put them in my desk at work,</i>
<i>and forgot about them until today.</i>

201
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:52,161
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it
to the wedding. l'm fine.

202
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:56,690
-Kind of hurting my hand though.
-l know.

203
00:15:56,892 --> 00:16:02,091
<i>I can 't believe it, especially after</i>
<i>Monica went on and on about it.</i>

204
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:06,530
<i>''Here are the invitations, Rachel.</i>
<i>Be very careful, Rachel.</i>

205
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:11,323
<i>Please no drinking liquids</i>
<i>around the invitations, Rachel. ''</i>

206
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:23,881
Did you do it on our invitations?

207
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:29,283
Not on the ones we sent out.

208
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:34,682
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

209
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:45,082
<i>It seems like yesterday</i>
<i>they just got engaged.</i>

210
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:47,084
<i>I know.</i>

211
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:52,282
<i>Remember the night they got engaged?</i>
<i>How you and I almost--</i>

212
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:56,121
<i>Oh, I remember how we almost.</i>

213
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:59,404
<i>You think we would've</i>
<i>gone through with it?</i>

214
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,291
<i>You think we would have done it?</i>

215
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:08,370
<i>I know I wanted to.</i>
<i>I just wasn 't sure if you did.</i>

216
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,291
<i>Oh, I wanted to.</i>

217
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:16,084
<i>So we both wanted to.</i>

218
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:19,087
<i>Interesting.</i>

219
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:27,483
<i>Anyway, it probably worked out</i>
<i>for the best.</i>

220
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,804
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

221
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:36,611
-ln about 1 0 seconds, he kisses me.
-ln about 5 seconds, you'll see why.

222
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:45,449
<i>Did I ever tell you about the time</i>
<i>I backpacked through Western Europe?</i>

223
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:54,805
Get ready to see some begging.

224
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,167
-Oh, you came on to Ross!
-What?

225
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:01,840
Now l'm so happy.

226
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:06,008
-What?
-You used the Europe story!

227
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:10,683
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

228
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:16,726
-How do you know about that story?
-How do you know about that story?

229
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,203
My friend lrene heard it
from some guy.

230
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,962
Some guy!

231
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:29,884
No, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

232
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,410
Ken Adams!

233
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:46,321
So, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

234
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:52,130
About that, the ''who came on to who''
thing really doesn't matter.

235
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,205
lt would have happened either way.

236
00:18:55,412 --> 00:19:00,281
lf you hadn't initiated it,
l know l would have.

237
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:05,091
-lt was an amazing night.
-lt was. lt was amazing.

238
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:10,524
You think it looked amazing?

239
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:16,082
l don't know.
l honestly didn't watch it.

240
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:17,924
Yeah, me neither.

241
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:20,282
Yet.

242
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:29,163
-That may be weird.
-Yeah, it would be really weird.

243
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,890
-Good luck.
-Good luck to you.

244
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:47,001
-Mind if l mute?
-Oh, please.

245
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:52,043
-There go the clothes.
-You are undressing awfully quickly.

246
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:55,289
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

247
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:07,404
-We look pretty good.
-l was gonna say.

248
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:10,485
-Nice tan.
-Thank you.

249
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:13,883
l'd just gone to
the beach that weekend.

250
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:21,128
-Have you been working out?
-l have been working out.

251
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:26,082
This is so much better
than l ever--

252
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:34,370
Oh, that's not pretty.

253
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:39,082
-Make it stop. Make it stop.
-Oh, no!

254
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:47,010
Hello, Greg?
This is Monica from the plane.

255
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,921
Listen, the number that
you gave me, 8-5-3--

256
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:54,010
Jenny's been giving out
their old number!

257
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,807
Jenny! That is so Jenny!

258
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:01,931
How would you like to
get together next Saturday?

259
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:04,168
Okay, how about Sunday?

260
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,727
Okay, the week after that?

261
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,644
The week after that?

262
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:14,809
You know what? We are interesting,
funny people with good questions.

263
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:18,647
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that--

264
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,490
January 1 5?

265
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:23,200
We'll see you then!
