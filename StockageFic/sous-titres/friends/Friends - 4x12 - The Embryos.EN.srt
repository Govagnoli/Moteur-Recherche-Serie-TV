1
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:16,010
What the hell is that?

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,610
What the hell is that?
ls that you?

3
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:31,409
-You're really not a morning person.
-Just back off!

4
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,250
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,450
What is that noise?

6
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,930
You!

7
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,250
It's the chick.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,610
She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,049
What kind of changes?

10
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,209
The vet seems to think...

11
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:58,610
... she's becoming a rooster.

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,130
We're getting a second opinion.

13
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,930
The One with the Embryos

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,239
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

15
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,010
Why are you shopping
at eight in the morning?

16
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,690
I've been up since six...

17
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,410
... thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

18
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,169
You should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

19
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,529
Especially not with these
knives and cookbooks around.

20
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,369
I'm going to the doctor
and see if I'm ready...

21
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,690
... to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

22
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,570
How will they know?

23
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:22,970
They'll just see if my
endometrial layer is thick.

24
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
I can check that for you.

25
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,690
Okay, think "thick" .

26
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,610
Good luck!

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,050
Wish me luck.

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,729
Good luck.

29
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:37,130
-I'm still right.
-That is so not true.

30
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,410
What?

31
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,889
I know it's her laundry day...

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,610
... and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

33
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,809
I can check that for you.

34
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,279
You two think you know
me and Rachel...

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,130
... better than we know you.

36
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,009
Well, we do.

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,330
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,410
What's that about?

39
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,970
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...

40
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,889
... you'll find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

41
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,410
You're good.

42
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,410
These are not.

43
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:20,210
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

44
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:23,289
Ross, how many items
left in that bag?

45
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,410
Five.

46
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,210
Okay, ten bucks says we can
name every item in that bag.

47
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,289
How many guesses?

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,369
Six.

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,089
Challenge extended.

50
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,410
-Deal!
-Challenge accepted.

51
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,089
All right, we'll start with...

52
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,850
... apples.

53
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,889
We'll be starting with apples.

54
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,809
Stop that now.

55
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,610
Yes.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,089
Okay. Tortilla chips.

57
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,729
-Yogurt.
-Diet soda.

58
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,449
-Orange juice.
-There's no orange juice! We win!

59
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,649
They have another guess.

60
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,410
Well, we won that one.

61
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,490
Okay. The last thing is--

62
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,089
Not for another two weeks.

63
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,049
I got it.

64
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,440
Scotch...

65
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,649
... tape.

66
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,399
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

67
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,489
We used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

68
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,200
Oh, man!

69
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,929
All right! Ten bucks.
Fork it over.

70
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,010
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

71
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,809
Give me it!

72
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,570
You don't know us better.
I want a rematch.

73
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,929
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real personal questions.

74
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,529
And the winner gets $100.

75
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,010
Serious?

76
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,450
Are you scared?

77
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,839
No.

78
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,250
Who makes up the questions?

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,609
Ross will do it.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,410
Sure, Ross will do it.

81
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,529
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

82
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,450
Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

83
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,890
No, I want to play.

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,010
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

85
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,609
I knew it!
I felt really thick this morning.

86
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,799
Okay, so what's now?
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

87
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,250
It'll take a little while
to prepare the embryos.

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,279
-Embryos? As in more than one?
-Five, actually.

89
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,529
Where am I giving birth...

90
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:47,410
... in a hospital or
a big box under the stairs?

91
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:52,130
Doing five gives you a 25%%% chance
that at least one will attach.

92
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,089
That's it? 25%%% ?

93
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,929
That means that it's, like,
75%%% chance of no baby at all?

94
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,250
I was thinking,
what are the odds...

95
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,890
... if you stuff 200 of them in there?

96
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,640
Sweetie, now...

97
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,609
... she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

98
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:15,929
Don't worry. I'll do this as many
times as it takes to get it right.

99
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:19,529
The thing is, we kind of
only have one shot.

100
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:23,609
It costs $16,000 each time you do this.

101
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,130
We're kind of using all the money
we have to do it this one time.

102
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,410
Okay, that's a lot of
pressure on me and my uterus.

103
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,609
Maybe there's something I can do
to make sure I get pregnant.

104
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,130
No, I'm sorry.

105
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,799
Wow, you guys really
don't know anything.

106
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,809
Why don't she get drunk? It worked
for a bunch of girls in my high school.

107
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,410
Do you realize that
any minute now...

108
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,049
... Phoebe could be pregnant?

109
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,250
I know, I know.

110
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,209
It's such a huge,
life-altering thing.

111
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,809
The test is ready.

112
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:16,410
Okay. Each team will
answer 10 questions.

113
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,329
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

114
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,890
The categories are
"Fears And Pet Peeves" ...

115
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,730
... "Ancient History" ...

116
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,450
... "Literature" ...

117
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,850
... and "It's All Relative. "

118
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,290
Now...

119
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,250
... the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

120
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,809
Somebody call it this time.

121
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,410
Tails!

122
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,209
It's heads.

123
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,359
Gentlemen, pick your category.

124
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,410
"Fears And Pet Peeves. "

125
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:01,290
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

126
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,329
-Animals dressed as humans.
-Correct.

127
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,130
Ladies?

128
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,250
Same category.

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,410
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

130
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,410
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!

131
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:20,730
Correct.

132
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,609
The lrish jig guy?

133
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,809
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body!

134
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:32,570
Gentlemen, your pick.

135
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,130
"It's All Relative. "

136
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,479
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died.

137
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,690
You both went to her funeral.

138
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,210
Name that grandmother. "

139
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:45,409
Nana?

140
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,609
She has a real name.

141
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:49,250
Althea!

142
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,679
-What?
-I took a shot!

143
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,849
With Althea?

144
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,409
-Althea is correct.
-Nice shooting!

145
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,119
"Literature. "

146
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,210
"Every week the TV Guide comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

147
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,369
What name appears
on the address label?"

148
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,409
Chandler gets it!
It's Chandler Bing!

149
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:15,049
I'm afraid the TV Guide
comes to "Chanandler Bong. "

150
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,409
I knew that!

151
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,489
Rachel, use your head!

152
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,489
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.

153
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,010
Hello, teeny embryos.

154
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,609
I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!

155
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,010
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

156
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,049
We're doing this
for Frank and Alice...

157
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,599
... who you know.
You've been there.

158
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,250
They want you so much.

159
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,000
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

160
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:01,690
And I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

161
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,010
... until you're ready
to have them take you home.

162
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,450
Next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

163
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,809
That's what's supposed to happen.

164
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,809
Ready?

165
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,409
Good luck!

166
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,650
The score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

167
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,400
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick a category.

168
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,210
"It's All Relative! "

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,890
-You don't have to shout everything.
-I'm sorry!

170
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,250
"What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

171
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,289
... Las vegas all-male burlesque?"

172
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,400
Viva Las Gaygas!

173
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,409
Unfortunately, that is correct.

174
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,809
All right. We have a tie.

175
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,799
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

176
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,809
The Lightning Round!

177
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,450
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

178
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,450
You guys are dead!

179
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,960
I am so good at Lightning Rounds!

180
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,210
I majored in Lightning Rounds,
all right?

181
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,559
We'll destroy you.

182
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,729
Want to bet?

183
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,450
I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

184
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,729
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

185
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,690
One hundred and fifty dollars.

186
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:36,929
Say 200?

187
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,409
Two hundred dollars!

188
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,010
You're doing it again.

189
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,809
Excuse me.

190
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,210
-I don't want to lose $200.
-We won't.

191
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,210
Three hundred?

192
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,570
I'm spicing it up!

193
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,010
So play for some pepper!
Stop spending my money.

194
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,409
I got it!

195
00:11:56,659 --> 00:12:00,010
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

196
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,890
That's interesting!

197
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,090
No way! That rooster's family.

198
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,090
The duck too!

199
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,210
The duck doesn't make noise!

200
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,530
He gets the other one all riled up!

201
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,609
-We are not--
-All right, hold on!

202
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,640
If you win...

203
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,609
... we give up the bird.

204
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,010
But if we win...

205
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,809
... we get your apartment.

206
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:28,489
Deal!

207
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,650
Betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

208
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,849
I have not missed one question
the whole game. I own this game!

209
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,039
Look at my hand.

210
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,409
You have the answers written there?

211
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:47,690
No. Steady as a rock.
Now are you with me?

212
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,409
All right, let's do it!

213
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,409
All right.
Gentlemen, you're up first.

214
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,159
You have 30 seconds.

215
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,210
The Lightning Round begins--

216
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,809
Stop it!

217
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,650
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

218
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:08,609
-Big Fat Goalie.
-Correct!

219
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,489
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie. "

220
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,049
Dangerous Liaisons.

221
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,770
-"Her actual favorite is...?"
-Weekend at Bernie's.

222
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,890
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

223
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,890
No!

224
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:32,280
Her ear!

225
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,369
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

226
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,760
-Everyday use.
-Fancy.

227
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,330
-Guest.
-Fancy guest.

228
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,330
Two seconds.

229
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:44,369
Eleven?

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,609
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct!

231
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,489
All right.

232
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,849
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up!

233
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,409
Thirty seconds on the clock.

234
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:05,080
Five correct questions
wins the game.

235
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,729
The Lightning Round begins now.
"Joey's favorite food?"

236
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,330
-Sandwiches!
-Correct.

237
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,919
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

238
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,359
-14?
-No, 19.

239
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,609
Thanks, man.

240
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,650
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

241
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,250
-His name was... "
-Maurice!

242
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,609
-"His profession was...?"
-Space cowboy!

243
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,609
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,809
It has something to do with numbers!

245
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,130
-And processing!
-He carries a briefcase.

246
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,609
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

247
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,929
Something to do
with transponding.

248
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,409
He's a transponster!

249
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,330
That's not even a word!

250
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,320
I can get this! I can get this!

251
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,809
-I call Monica's room.
-You can't just call Monica's room.

252
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,849
Sure I can.
Standard Shotgun Rules.

253
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,400
I'm in sight of the room
and I called it.

254
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,809
Damn!

255
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,010
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

256
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,210
Guess the color of my tonsils.
I bet the apartment!

257
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,849
I would never bet this place.
It's too nice.

258
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,440
Are they in there?

259
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,369
Yeah, I'm implanted.

260
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,809
How do you feel?

261
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,489
Well, freaked.

262
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,650
It turns out the odds
are really sucky.

263
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,409
And this is
Frank and Alice's only shot.

264
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,969
They are literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

265
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,119
But I bet it works.

266
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,409
Really? How much?

267
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,859
I'm going to take
a pregnancy test now.

268
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,890
Wow! You can tell this soon?

269
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,250
The doctor says it takes a few days.

270
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,409
But my body's always been a little
faster than Western medicine.

271
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:13,369
I can't believe you guys think
you're moving in here.

272
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,609
Well, believe it, baby!

273
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:18,570
Well, I'm not moving.

274
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,609
What?

275
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,010
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

276
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,250
You can't ignore the bet.
It's a bet!

277
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,210
Bet on a bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet.

278
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,450
We have to move.

279
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,809
We would have made them
get rid of the birds.

280
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:42,650
I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

281
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,010
... this is all your fault.

282
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:47,049
What?

283
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,799
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that TV Guide every week!

284
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,010
I knew it!

285
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,090
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.

286
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:58,409
Cool! Girl roommate.

287
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,849
Well?

288
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,609
Nope, not knocked up yet.

289
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,010
It's only been a couple hours.

290
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,849
Meanwhile, I'll do
whatever I can to help this.

291
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,410
I'm just going to, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

292
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,170
Good. I'm going
to let gravity do its jobs.

293
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,329
Can you give me a hand?

294
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,890
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!

295
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,729
This is my apartment and I like it!

296
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:37,050
This is a girl's apartment!

297
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,410
That is a boy's apartment!
It's dirty and it smells!

298
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,410
This is pretty!
It's so pretty!

299
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,770
And look, it's purple!

300
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,250
I tell you, you with your
steady hand, I am not moving.

301
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,410
And now I have got the steady hand.

302
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,170
-I'll take care of it.
-That's right.

303
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,170
You do what the hand says!

304
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,969
-How'd it go?
-I lost our mattresses.

305
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:21,569
Are you in there, little fetus?
ln nine months will you come greet us?

306
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,410
I will buy you some Adidas

307
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,369
We were just at the drugstore
so we got you a little present.

308
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,650
It's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

309
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,890
Don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

310
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,209
You feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

311
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,329
All right. I will.

312
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,040
Remember that
it's still really early.

313
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,969
If it says I'm not pregnant,
that doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.

314
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,849
Just so I don't go completely nuts...

315
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,770
... try not to put
all your hopes on this.

316
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,890
Great.

317
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:28,689
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

318
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,050
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

319
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,640
That is not true!
She forced me!

320
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,290
You got the question wrong.

321
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,689
It was a stupid, unfair question!

322
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,449
Don't blame the questions!

323
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,810
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

324
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,579
-Stop calling it your apartment!
-It is!

325
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,689
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!

326
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:04,010
My sister's going to have my baby!

327
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,209
Okay, but this can't
be good for the baby.

328
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,569
I can't find garbage bags.

329
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,810
I think I saw some in here.

330
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,010
What is it?

331
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,400
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

332
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:45,569
I can't believe we're living here!

333
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,160
What is it?

334
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,810
Did you see the size of the closets?

335
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,810
I can't believe we live here!

336
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,930
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

337
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,890
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

338
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,969
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

339
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,479
London might have gotten started...

340
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:06,050
... because we needed to take advantage
of the show's popularity...

341
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,479
... and go do the show on
an exotic location...

342
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,010
... and have a good time.

343
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,650
There's so many people here
from all over the world.

344
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,439
Lately, the show's been about us
getting excited to go to London.

345
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,010
And then we realized in real life,
we're doing that same thing.

346
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:25,569
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check!

347
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,530
Are you ready yet?

348
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:31,040
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

349
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,640
Yeah!
London, baby!

350
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,849
It's all London, baby!

351
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,010
Here we go.

352
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,689
Ross is getting married...

353
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,640
... to this young woman named Emily.

354
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,280
And I set them up by accident.

355
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,489
Why don't we?

356
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:50,839
Why don't we what?

357
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,849
Get married.

358
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,089
I've started to...

359
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,810
... fall for this character, Emily,
played by Helen Baxendale.

360
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,369
And we decided to go all the way,
I guess, and get married.

361
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:07,930
Ross has asked me to marry him.
I say yes.

362
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,810
And so we arrange
a big wedding in London.

363
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,209
Things go a bit wrong.

364
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,329
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

365
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,569
You have to meet me in the middle.

366
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,609
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass!

367
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,250
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

368
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:26,520
That's it!

369
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:29,089
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

370
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:30,969
This is our wedding day!

371
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,489
From now on, everyone gets along.

372
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:35,880
And if I hear one more word...

373
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:38,689
... no grandchildren!
That's right!

374
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,160
Sorry, old boy.

375
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:47,050
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

376
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,880
We knew the show
was popular in England...

377
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,170
... and so it seemed like
a natural fit.

378
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:56,760
I knew how big the show was over here.
It was exciting to be welcomed.

379
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:59,280
Everywhere, walking down the street...

380
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,890
... bunches of kids watching.
So we've been signing autographs.

381
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,439
They're just big fans of the show,
I guess.

382
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,839
I watch it all the time
because my children love it.

383
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,489
They absolutely love it.

384
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,089
Tell my friend you like my hat.

385
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,530
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

386
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:19,530
Hi, Chandler!

387
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,489
We wanted it to
still feel like Friends...

388
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:25,449
... and so we shot a lot of it
in front of an audience.

389
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:28,689
And it seemed like
a really exciting opportunity...

390
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:33,449
... to shoot an American sitcom
in front of a British audience.

391
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:37,439
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

392
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,650
I'll be the on-camera guy.

393
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:42,369
All right. First stop...

394
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,640
... Westminster Abbey.

395
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,920
What is that?

396
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,449
That's London, baby!

397
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,489
We were really afraid, going over,
that either they'd be...

398
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,050
... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh....

399
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,849
They were great!

400
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,650
-Big laughers!
-They waited in line for hours!

401
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:05,239
-We traveled 329 miles.
-She's lying. It's more like 200.

402
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:09,250
The show's doing so well over here
that it just seems like...

403
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,650
... they're real, real receptive.

404
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,760
It's really wonderful and flattering
and overwhelming, truthfully.

405
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,359
We didn't have
a single bad audience.

406
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,760
Also, there was
a greater sense of "event. "

407
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,849
I think it energized everybody:
the actors, the writers....

408
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,569
We're just excited to be here.

409
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,199
Like, look back there.
Look how cool that is!

410
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,489
We missed Lisa.

411
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:38,199
That was probably the only
drawback I can think of.

412
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,449
I first thought, "How exciting!
I wonder if I'm going?"

413
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,569
It's awful that Lisa's not here.

414
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,290
We feel like
we have a limb missing.

415
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,729
Let's try some aversion therapy.

416
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,449
Look at the picture.

417
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,959
It's strange when one person's
not there. We miss her.

418
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,089
It's weird for all of us
to be here without her.

419
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,290
She's in the episode, on the phone
and things like that.

420
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:10,729
Hey, Pheebs!
It's Joey.

421
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,890
Hey, Joey!

422
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,250
I just saw someone that looks just
like you, on the subway.

423
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:20,920
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

424
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,849
That just cost me four bucks.

425
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:25,650
Part of me wishes I could go.

426
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,250
But I'm very happy to not get
on a plane for a lot of hours....

427
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:32,770
Sorry.
I'm not a good traveler.

428
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,449
The Waltham residence.

429
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,890
Is this Emily's parents' house?

430
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,010
This is the housekeeper.

431
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:44,050
And by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

432
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,010
First one identifies oneself...

433
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:51,410
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

434
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:55,489
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

435
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:58,449
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

436
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,449
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

437
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,609
It was also interesting because
we had shot about a third of it here.

438
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,880
And a bit of it
on the streets in London.

439
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,890
All right!

440
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,930
Westminster Abbey!

441
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,969
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

442
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,199
What do you think of the Abbey?

443
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,250
I think it's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

444
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:28,609
-To what?
-To "Put the camera away" !

445
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:32,650
Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. "

446
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:35,290
It was a really gratifying experience.

447
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,650
Pretty much everything we'd hoped
to get out of it, we got.

448
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,209
When you can go on location even
in Los Angeles that's exciting...

449
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:21,010
... much less have your whole crew...

450
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:24,599
...come out to "jolly old England. "
It's really, really exciting.

451
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:29,560
Just the idea of bringing
our entire "family" over here...

452
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,329
... is, like, wild.

453
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:34,369
Yeah!
London, baby!

454
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:38,359
It's amazing to me how many people
are excited about the show.

455
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:42,369
I knew how big the show was over here.
It plays a lot on television.

456
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,199
I saw it three times in one week.

457
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:48,569
They're very popular at home,
but I didn 't know they would be here.

458
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,369
It's got a massive following
in Britain...

459
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,000
... particularly among my generation.

460
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,640
It's quite sarcastic.
That's why it's popular.

461
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,160
We have great English character actors
who are working with us.

462
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,560
And an opportunity to interact
with the English crew.

463
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,410
We're about to be Ross' in-laws.

464
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,920
We're the Brits
that you love to hate.

465
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,810
We worked with
Sarah Ferguson this morning.

466
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,369
She was great and funny.

467
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:16,209
I was excited to be here today.

468
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:19,680
It's the first time I've ever done this
and I enjoyed it.

469
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,280
I am a great fan.
I think they are all marvelous.

470
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,290
Most British people tried to hate them
for being beautiful and funny.

471
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,810
I got a phone call:

472
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,010
"Small part, a few lines.
Do you want it?

473
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:32,609
Next to Jennifer Aniston. "

474
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:36,640
And I went, "Oh, wait a minute....
Oh, okay then. "

475
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:41,369
It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits
up the butt" episode, really.

476
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:45,770
You're gonna see a lot of comedy,
a lot of romance...

477
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,400
... and a lot of surprises.

478
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,369
And you get to see England.

479
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,170
Call the Queen Mum,
say you enjoy watching Friends...

480
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,130
... and that you know us, and she'll
have you over for tea like that.
