1
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,920
Oh, man!

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:14,250
-What's that?
-Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,479
What in the name of hell?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,370
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,889
Is this porn?

6
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:31,799
I must have hit something
on the remote.

7
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,529
Do we pay for this?

8
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,959
We didn't even pay our cable bill.

9
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:39,369
Maybe this is how they punish us.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,119
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

11
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:46,490
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,569
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,250
Joey pressed something on the remote
and it just came on.

14
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:01,770
It happened to me once.
It was like finding money.

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,690
Finding money
with naked people on it!

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,809
But I made the mistake
of turning off the Tv.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,279
I never got it back again.

18
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,519
And I'm sad.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,769
Why would he turn off the Tv?

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,919
The One with the Free Porn

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,239
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

22
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,960
Do we really have to watch this
while we eat?

23
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:18,050
We don't know
what could make this go away.

24
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:22,440
So no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the Tv.

25
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,649
And no one touches the air
around the Tv.

26
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,360
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

27
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,970
I'm at least going to mute it.

28
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,199
We still have porn.

29
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:48,160
What are you doing?
That's too heavy. Give it here.

30
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,639
Oh, God.

31
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm too pregnant for lugging
around a stupid massage table.

32
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,320
I need a job with a smaller table.

33
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,369
Or a job without a table.

34
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,360
You mean, like a doctor?

35
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,449
You're blocking the porn!

36
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:15,970
That reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

37
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,160
Emily just went to the airport.

38
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:26,800
Why didn't you take her?

39
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,800
Her uncle had planned to do it.

40
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,889
We said our goodbyes this morning.

41
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,449
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,369
Hey, cheer up.
You'll see her again, right?

43
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,199
I don't know.

44
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:48,570
When I brought it up, she said...

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,970
... "This is so fantastic.
Why talk about the future?

46
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,410
-Let's enjoy--"
-Don't do the accent.

47
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,970
You've got to see her again.

48
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,440
-Why do you care?
-Because!

49
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,399
You could live out my fantasy.

50
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,919
You had fantasies about Emily?

51
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:10,250
You know, the fantasy.

52
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,720
Meet a foreigner, fall madly in love
and spend your lives together.

53
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,130
Is that why you hung out
with that Ukrainian kid in school?

54
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,359
Yeah, plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

55
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:27,890
Do you love her?

56
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,329
We said it would
only be two weeks.

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,730
You love her.

58
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,760
What is love, really?

59
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,000
I knew you loved her!

60
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,369
You go to the airport and tell her.

61
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,359
You'll probably catch her at the gate.

62
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,290
You'll call her name
and yell "I love you! "

63
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,679
She'll say "I love you too! "

64
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,970
Then you will have
the most amazing kiss.

65
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,369
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

66
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:59,329
I am a good kisser.

67
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:04,049
Then you two can sneak
into the cockpit.

68
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,570
Things will start to heat up.

69
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,239
And then a stewardess comes in....

70
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,760
I've been watching too much porn.

71
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,410
-Is that the heartbeat?
-That's it.

72
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:22,640
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,640
This is so cool!

74
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,809
Have we talked about multiple births?

75
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,399
Let's take care of this one. If I
get pregnant again, I have your card.

76
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:39,290
No, I'm getting
three separate heartbeats.

77
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:42,890
You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

78
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,160
Doctors are wrong all the time.

79
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,450
Are you sure that there are three?

80
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,079
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.

81
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,959
So in a few months, I'll have three
babies walking around inside me?

82
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,369
It'll be like one of those log rides
when they come shooting out.

83
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:13,920
Giving birth to three
is like giving birth to one.

84
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,239
What do you know?

85
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,929
How'd it go at the doctor's?

86
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,410
You know how, when you're
walking down the street...

87
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,209
... and you see three people in a row.

88
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,410
And you say "Oh, that's nice. "

89
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,890
Good news!
You'll have three babies.

90
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,850
Three babies?

91
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,809
I've finally got my band!

92
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,959
We'll have a big family!
I always wanted a big family.

93
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:04,769
I'm so glad you're happy!
I was afraid you'd be freaked.

94
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,480
Why would we be freaked?

95
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,880
Because it's harder to raise them
and the added expense.

96
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,640
Right.

97
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,239
No, back to happy.
Back to happy!

98
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,450
It's going to be fine...

99
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,170
... because I teach home ec.

100
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,209
I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

101
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,970
It'll be like my very own
little sweatshop.

102
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,720
I was thinking, ever since
you said we'd have triplets.

103
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,290
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

104
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,000
No, you can't quit college.

105
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,480
You're in college?

106
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,399
Refrigerator college.

107
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,970
When we found out
we were having a baby...

108
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,369
... I figured I should have
a career, you know?

109
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,410
And I love refrigerators.

110
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,890
You can't give up on your dream!

111
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,760
No, it's okay.
We're going to have three kids.

112
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,970
And that's a different kind of dream.

113
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,929
Three kids and no money.

114
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,160
This is the boarding call
for flight 009.

115
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,000
What are you doing here?

116
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,969
I had to see you
before you took off.

117
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,039
You are so sweet.

118
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,640
That's a big candy bar.

119
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,609
I had the most amazing time with you.

120
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:52,049
Me too.

121
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,169
This is the final boarding call
for flight 009.

122
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,969
Well, that's me.

123
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,159
Here, have this.

124
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:11,159
I'm only allowed
one piece of carry-on.

125
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:19,280
Listen, I have to tell you something.

126
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:21,369
I've been thinking.

127
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,359
I'm just going to say it, okay?

128
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,359
I think...

129
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,559
... I love you.

130
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,809
Thank you.

131
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,760
It's no problem.

132
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,690
What is that song?

133
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:04,000
It's the theme
from Good Will Humping.

134
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:10,280
You know who doesn't like
dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.

135
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,169
Yeah, right.

136
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,770
He said he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

137
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,369
Did he also say that
the dialogue was corny?

138
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,849
And that he found it funny, not sexy?

139
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,719
Yeah, he likes porn.

140
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,169
Where you going?

141
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,770
To find out if he really
thinks models are too skinny.

142
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:39,719
How'd it go?

143
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,000
Frank has to quit college...

144
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,609
... because his super-fertile
sister's having three babies.

145
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:50,489
I need to make money fast.
I wanted to talk to you about an idea.

146
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,530
You work for a big company.

147
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:53,799
Insider trading.

148
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,849
What information can you give me?

149
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,400
They don't talk to us
about that stuff.

150
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,640
But I can get you free White-Out.

151
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,799
-Did you do what I said?
-I did.

152
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:09,960
What'd she say?

153
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,559
"Thank you. "

154
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,929
You're totally welcome.
What'd she say?

155
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,770
She said, "Thank you. "

156
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:22,200
I said, "I love you. "

157
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,330
And she said, "Thank you. "

158
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,489
Did you say you love her?

159
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,369
What were you trying
to get her to do?

160
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,239
What do I do?

161
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,609
You play hard-to-get.

162
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:40,840
She already lives in London.

163
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,359
So you go to Tokyo.

164
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,929
Forget it.

165
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,840
You told her you love her.
It's over.

166
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,000
It is not over!
You're over!

167
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,729
What?

168
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,400
You know.

169
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:05,250
Good one.

170
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,359
It's not over. She'll call
and tell you she loves you.

171
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,609
Her feelings were so strong
that it scared her.

172
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:18,159
Go home and wait for her call.
She could call from the plane.

173
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,520
But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over!

174
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,400
Unless, eventually, I call her
to see what's going on...

175
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,530
... and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

176
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,520
Then it's over!

177
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,570
Way to be strong!

178
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,650
Can we watch cartoons on your Tv?

179
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,090
We need a porn break.

180
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,119
We spent two hours watching
ln and Out and ln Again.

181
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,809
Why don't you turn it off?

182
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,570
Then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

183
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,320
Good, you're here!

184
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,799
What you got there?

185
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,760
This? I'm glad you asked.

186
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,559
Don't you hate to cut a tin can
with an ordinary steak knife?

187
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,719
I know what you're thinking.

188
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,690
Pregnant woman slays four?

189
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,489
Did they make you pay
for those knives?

190
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:32,530
You sure?

191
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:38,320
You won't make enough money
by selling knives.

192
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,479
I just need enough money
for the second part of my plan.

193
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:43,770
What's that?

194
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,760
My Saturn dealership.

195
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,609
How was your flight?

196
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:05,049
It was dreadful.

197
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:09,520
It was terrible how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

198
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,049
No, that's all right.

199
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,599
I'm just glad you called.

200
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:19,289
Ross, there's something
that I've got to tell you.

201
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,330
There's someone else.

202
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,640
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

203
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,960
She doesn't know who she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.

204
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,359
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
There can't be another guy.

205
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,000
Of course, there's another guy!

206
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,130
This is even more perfect.

207
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,440
You have to prove your love!

208
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:55,409
I'm not proving anything.
I'm done listening to you.

209
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,799
If I hadn't let you talk me
into this...

210
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,609
... I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

211
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,289
You did that?

212
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,760
I missed and hit the door.

213
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,880
But it opened really hard.

214
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:13,489
You have to go to London.
You have to go fight for her.

215
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,210
That makes sense.

216
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,409
You said you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

217
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,929
Then she told you about another guy.
Go to London. Scare her!

218
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,960
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

219
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,010
I made fun of his accent.

220
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,719
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight.

221
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,359
You want that to happen with Emily?

222
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,969
Go fight for her!
Go to London.

223
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,159
That could be you and Emily.

224
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,359
That but nicer.

225
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,159
Go to London!

226
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,049
Really?

227
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,640
Surprise her.
Don't let her go without a fight.

228
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,570
All right. I'm going to do it.

229
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,090
I'm going to London,
and I'll fight for her.

230
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,890
Okay. Good luck!

231
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:11,159
Can you pick me up one
of those Toblerone bars at the airport?

232
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:22,010
I did it!
I figured out a way to make money.

233
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,039
I'll open a massage place.
Frank will help me.

234
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:29,359
We'll work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

235
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,080
But how can you afford it?

236
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:36,599
We were walking down the street,
and we saw your van.

237
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:39,080
-And we realized--
-I'm telling it!

238
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:45,080
People need transportation,
and they need massages to relax.

239
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,719
We can combine the two.
I give massages and Frank drives.

240
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:53,570
I'll bolt a table in the van,
and you know what I've got?

241
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,559
A place that no one
will get out of alive?

242
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:02,770
Think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

243
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,449
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!

244
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,800
The name was my favorite part!

245
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,079
I came up with it.

246
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,369
You did not!

247
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,209
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

248
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,599
Oh, my god! Are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

249
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,729
No, she hasn't come home yet.

250
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:34,410
She hasn't been home all night.
She must be with the other guy.

251
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,369
I'm the stupid moron
who spent the night here.

252
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,199
When is the next flight out?

253
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,410
About four hours.

254
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,280
Stay there for a while.
If she doesn 't show up, come home.

255
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,439
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

256
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,800
Ask him if he likes it
better than Relaxi-Cab.

257
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:55,890
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

258
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,170
That is better.

259
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,560
Are we in London?

260
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:10,599
Why are you here?
You can't be here.

261
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,729
I've come to talk to Ross.

262
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:17,439
What?

263
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,800
Nothing.

264
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,729
I was going to call him--

265
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,800
You came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

266
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,170
I was right!
I'm right, right?

267
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:31,650
I'd rather talk to him.

268
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,760
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

269
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,609
I need to talk to him.
Do you know where he is?

270
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,250
Ross, are you there?

271
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,959
I don 't know if you hear this,
but I'll talk anyway.

272
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,199
I'm in the States
with your sister and friends.

273
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,569
It's all over with Colin.

274
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,810
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you--

275
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,439
Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want.

276
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,959
I came here to tell you
that I love you.

277
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,170
I love you too!

278
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,800
I'll call you right now
from the phone booth.

279
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,770
You can't hear me.

280
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,770
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.

281
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:35,199
I suppose I've given
my neighbors a good laugh.

282
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:39,569
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. None of your business.

283
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,810
There's not much chance
you did hear that.

284
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,609
There's the call waiting...

285
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:48,839
... so I should go.

286
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,800
Ross, I love you.

287
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,969
Thank you.

288
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,560
There was this really hot teller
at the bank.

289
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,689
And she didn't ask me
to do it with her in the vault.

290
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,000
Same thing happened to me.

291
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,719
Pizza delivery girl comes over,
gives me the pizza and leaves!

292
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:34,089
No "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

293
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,130
Nothing!

294
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,969
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

295
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,569
I think you're right.

296
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:45,250
Ready?

297
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:47,650
One, two, three.

298
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,770
That's kind of nice.

299
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:56,569
That's kind of a relief.

300
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,479
You want to see
if we still have it?

301
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,640
-Free porn!
-We have free porn!
