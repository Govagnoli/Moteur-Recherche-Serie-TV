1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,050
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. 

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,020
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,490
Rach, he just saw us.

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,930
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,160
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,430
Dude, chill! 

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,240
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, 

8
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,940
but we didn't plan it, okay? 

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,270
And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,710
Yeah, you started it! 

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,810
I've got to chill.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,080
We probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened,

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,320
but...

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,790
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,460
Yeah, but it did happen,

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,590
so...

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,000
Ross ?

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,510
Ross ?

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,220
Can we just close the door?

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,520
Ross, say something. 

25
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,220
Anything.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,430
So you two are...?

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Yeah.

28
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,200
And have you... ed?

29
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,570
No !

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,870
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you...?

31
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,870
Probably. No !

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,980
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. 

33
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,020
You have every right to go nuts.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,680
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,890
No, but you know what I mean.

36
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,500
If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. 

37
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,970
I'm fine!

38
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,600
Really?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,600
Absolutely. 

40
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,140
I'm fine! 

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,970
Totally fine. 

42
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,410
I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, 

43
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,110
I'm fine. 

44
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,720
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,860
to see you guys kissing.

46
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,490
I mean, at first I was like...

47
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,330
But now that I've had time to absorb it.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Lovin' this.

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,410
- Ross...
- It's all working out! 

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,540
Me & Charlie, and you two. 

51
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,480
You know what we should do?

52
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,550
Calm ourselves?

53
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,120
No.

54
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,420
We should all have dinner. 

55
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,990
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. 

56
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,120
I'll cook!

57
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,730
Don't you think that will be a little weird?

58
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,090
Weird? What's weird? 

59
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,900
The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, 

60
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,270
because I'm making fajitas! 

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,280
I do like fajitas.

62
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,080
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. 

63
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,750
There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption...

64
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,420
There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.

65
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,090
There's a hair in my coffee.

66
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,290
Hey guys!

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,830
Have you seen Frank Jr, 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,670
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of 3 hot blonde 19-year olds.

69
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,170
That's sweet. 

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
Drink your hair.

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,640
What's all this stuff?

72
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,250
They're brochures from different adoption agencies.

73
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,850
Oh, babies! 

74
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,320
This one is so cute, get this one!

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,620
That's not really how it works.

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:51,950
How does it work?

77
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,090
I don't know!

78
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,130
If you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. 

79
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,230
They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

80
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,630
Thanks, that would be great. 

81
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,570
Honey, wouldn't that be great?

82
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,070
Alright. Remember what we talked about. 

83
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,110
When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.

84
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,710
That's not what we talked about!

85
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,450
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,360
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!

87
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,960
Which one is which again?

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,370
That's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. 

89
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,200
And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, 

90
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,840
and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

91
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,410
"Willing to adopt triplets?" 

92
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,480
No !

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,120
Can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, 

94
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,490
but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,620
What would we be doing?

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,260
I'd take you out for a romantic night. 

97
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,200
Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...

98
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,840
Feel me up?

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,740
In a carriage!

100
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,510
So.. Dreading this?

101
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,510
Oh, you bet.

102
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,980
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?

103
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,990
Actually... It's stuff you left at my apartment.

104
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,790
Oh, thanks.

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,230
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.

106
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,900
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
I thought I heard voices! 

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,140
You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

109
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. 

110
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,890
Come, please come in. 

111
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,460
We brought you some wine.

112
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,700
That is so thoughtful. 

113
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,000
She's a keeper. 

114
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,300
- And what did you bring me? 
- Actually, that's...

115
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,370
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD.

116
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,180
I can use all these things!

117
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,880
- Gosh, Ross, you seem a little...
- What? Fine? Because I am! 

118
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,720
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? 

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,420
You see? Who else is fine?

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,630
Okay, listen. Why don't you try to relax? 

121
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,690
Maybe have a drink.

122
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,060
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,070
Oh, god. So adorable. 

124
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,680
Look at them sleeping there like angels.

125
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,680
I really cherish these moments, 'cause 

126
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,220
before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.

127
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,160
They may be a handful, but they're so cute.

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,730
The last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing...

129
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,330
I haven't slept in four years!

130
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,270
That's a long time.

131
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,470
You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. 

132
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,870
There's just so many of them. 

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,110
Two I can handle. 

134
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,540
Two's great. 

135
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,410
You just hold one in each hand, 

136
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,180
but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. 

137
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,120
I've got no more hands to protect my area! 

138
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,690
There's three of them, Phoebe, three!

139
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,290
I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.

140
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,730
Sometimes I think that...

141
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,430
Oh, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.

142
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,500
What?

143
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,240
No, I can't.

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? 

145
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,610
Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!

146
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,820
Oh, no! I would never do that. 

147
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,250
I just was thinking that...

148
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,320
maybe you could take one.

149
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,620
What?! 

150
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,390
You can't separate them! That's terrible. 

151
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,400
Which one?

152
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,840
Thank you so much for seeing us. 

153
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,300
Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.

154
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh, please, we're happy to help.

155
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,540
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.

156
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,510
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

157
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,090
I mean, you have a lovely home.

158
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,590
We appreciate anything you can tell us.

159
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,230
Actually, I think this might help.

160
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,630
It's pretty much all the information you need.

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,070
Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, 

162
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,670
and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.

163
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,840
Thank you. 

164
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,840
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

165
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,920
I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. 

166
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,650
Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.

167
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:23,920
That's great. 

168
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,450
Can I see the book?

169
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,990
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?

170
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,160
It's just so pretty and white.

171
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,760
The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.

172
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,200
I would have told him to do it too.

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,570
Can I adopt you?

174
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,440
Hey, you must be Owen.

175
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm Chandler. 

176
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,310
- I was in the scouts too.
- You were?

177
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,680
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.

178
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,480
You know how to use a compass?

179
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,090
I have a badge in it.

180
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,690
You do? That's fantastic!

181
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,890
You wanna see it?

182
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,430
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.

183
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,430
What?!

184
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,970
What?

185
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,310
I'm adopted?

186
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,680
I got nothing.

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,750
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, 

188
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,660
but the second batch is good.

189
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,230
Maybe the next batch, we could all get some.

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.

191
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,510
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?

192
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,210
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! 

193
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,680
I'm just.. proud of us. 

194
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,780
There's no weirdness, no tension.

195
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,450
No awareness.

196
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,860
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. 

197
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,690
Let's take a trip. 

198
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,060
Okay, where do you think we can go?

199
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,430
My fajitas!

200
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,840
Look, Charlie, 

201
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,780
I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble 

202
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,240
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. 

203
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,980
You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.

204
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,080
Oh, this is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.

205
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,890
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?

206
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,530
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!

207
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!

208
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,840
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!

209
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,240
Okay, this is crazy. 

210
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,050
Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?

211
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,980
No, of course we're not.

212
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,980
- Insane.
- I know.

213
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,550
Alice would never go for it, right?

214
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,520
I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.

215
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,360
For argument's sake, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?

216
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,470
Franck Jr Jr ?

217
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. 

218
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,110
He's really funny. 

219
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,940
Like, the other day he made up this joke.

220
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,950
What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? 

221
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,680
A talking frog! 

222
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,820
Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.

223
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,930
Alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?

224
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,200
Oh, no. Not Leslie. 

225
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,430
She's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.

226
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,400
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.

227
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,770
Oh, no, you can't have Chandler.

228
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,480
No. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. 

229
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,750
She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..

230
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,350
I think we just ran out of kids.

231
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,250
Oh, I think you're right. 

232
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,660
Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. 

233
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,970
They drive me crazy, but they're my babies.

234
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. 

235
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,680
You know, I'll help out more. I can babysit any time you want. 

236
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,040
You name the day, and I'll be there.

237
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,950
- How about tomorrow?
- That's not good. 

238
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,720
But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. 

239
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,890
You and Alice just take the whole day together.

240
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,120
You'd do that for us?

241
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,090
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.

242
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,030
Look at them! 

243
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,540
I love you so much. 

244
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,770
Oh crap, don't wake up!

245
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,840
Where are Bill and Colleen?

246
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,910
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. 

247
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,580
Can you believe how nice they are?

248
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,450
We have to leave!

249
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,790
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?

250
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,390
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, 

251
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,030
and he didn't know he was adopted. 

252
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
And there's a slight chance I may have told him.

253
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,960
Oh my god, where's my purse? 

254
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,530
No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. 

255
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,530
Get that binder, and let's go!

256
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,240
Some little snacks for everybody. 

257
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,210
Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.

258
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,950
I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

259
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,220
But kids are so intuitive. 

260
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,150
Don't you think on some level he already knows?

261
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,790
I'm adopted?!

262
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,150
See? Intuitive!

263
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,090
What? Where did you hear that?

264
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,360
He told me! 

265
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,030
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

266
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,630
Which technically now you should give back!

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,940
You told him he's adopted?

268
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,810
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. 

269
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,950
Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. 

270
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,910
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted, 

271
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,680
and he also thinks that Santa is real."

272
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
He isn't?!

273
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,790
We have to get out of here, baby!

274
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,590
Everyone? I would like to make a toast 

275
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,960
to Rachel and Joey.

276
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,800
and...

277
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,070
to love. 

278
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,580
Ah Love ! L.O.V.E !

279
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,150
"L" is for life. And what is life without love?

280
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,450
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?

281
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,560
"O" is for "oh, wow!" 

282
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:21,900
The "V" is for this very surprising turn of events, 

283
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,340
which I'm still fine with by the way. 

284
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,680
"E"...

285
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,590
is for how extremely normal I find it. 

286
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,390
That you two are together. 

287
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,100
And now one day you might get married 

288
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,600
and have children of your own.

289
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,210
Dude, are you okay?

290
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,580
Totally.

291
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,550
Ross, you don't seem okay.

292
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,550
I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. 

293
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,560
I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.

294
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,130
Wait, Ross. 

295
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,430
I have to take off.

296
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,100
I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, 

297
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,900
but this has been lovely.

298
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,840
Wasn't it? 

299
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,210
And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.

300
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,310
You're on fire! 

301
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,180
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

302
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,290
Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so...

303
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,560
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.

304
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,430
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! 

305
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,840
Hey, that rhymed!

306
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,080
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.

307
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,180
Of course. God, I'm so stupid. 

308
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,520
You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.

309
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,560
No, it's just that it's getting late...

310
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,290
Hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.

311
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,240
I don't even know what that's for.

312
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,380
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here 

313
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,750
and make sure he's okay.

314
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,050
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

315
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,350
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.

316
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,190
You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.

317
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,030
It doesn't look good, does it?

318
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,920
Morning. Here you go.

319
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,720
Thanks. 

320
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,820
Did you stay here all night?

321
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,690
So you took off my pants and shoes?

322
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,000
No. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. 

323
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,540
Look, Ross, about Rachel and I. 

324
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,940
You don't have to worry about that. Because nothing is gonna happen.

325
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,150
What do you mean?

326
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,850
She and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..

327
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,220
What are you talking about? I'm fine!

328
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,930
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine.

329
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,430
You're... You're Ross and Rachel.

330
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,440
Except we're not. 

331
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,080
We haven't been a couple in like...

332
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,280
six years. 

333
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,350
Oh my god, is that right? 

334
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,120
Has it been that long?

335
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,260
That's what I hear, yeah.

336
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,260
This is crazy. I mean, six years? 

337
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,260
And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? 

338
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,500
Can I ask you something? 

339
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,270
Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?

340
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,640
Come on, I mean, you know me...

341
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm crazy about her.

342
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,760
And she feels the same way?

343
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,240
I think so.

344
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,740
Then, maybe it's time we all moved on.

345
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,250
Yeah, but, Ross, you're not okay with it.

346
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,680
No, but I wanna be. 

347
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,290
I will be. 

348
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,320
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? 

349
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,890
Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? 

350
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,530
I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?

351
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,200
No, that was just for me. 

352
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,340
Are you sure about this?

353
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,710
Yeah, I'm sure.

354
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:12,090
And we're okay?

355
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,300
Hey, Phoebs

356
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,100
We just wanna give you a heads-up. 

357
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,600
Bill and Colleen hate us.

358
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,170
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.

359
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,940
What?

360
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,380
Still, he had to find out sometime.

361
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,010
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?

362
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,850
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
