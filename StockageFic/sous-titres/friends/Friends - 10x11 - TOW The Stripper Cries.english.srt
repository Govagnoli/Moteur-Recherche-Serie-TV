1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,800
- Hey guys...
- Wait, wait, let me tell them.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,200
Jeoy is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,000
Really? Which one?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,700
Fish, sea weed, a sunk ship.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,700
Thingd you find in the ocean...
You are gonna be on PYRAMID!

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,700
- Except for Match game!
- Or Win or Lose Draw.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,700
What did I marry into?

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,800
Do you guys wanna come down tommorow,
watch me tape the show?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
We can't. We'll throw Phoebe a bachelorette party.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah, sorry, boys. This ride's closing.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,200
Oh, and Chandler and I have the stupid
college alone night thing.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,100
I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,000
Seriously?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeahuh!?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Ross and I always wanna be Donny and Marie.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,900
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,600
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Oh, that's right. I blocked that out.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
- I'm a little bit country.
- And I'm a little bit Rock & Roll.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm leaving you.

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Friends*1011 THE STRIPPER CRIES

English Subtitle: Öì³¤Õ÷ cz_z@sina.com

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
So we have to see all these people again.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh my god, look, that is Jeffrey Claric.

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,700
Who?

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,500
He was roommates with John Rusolf.

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,100
He went out with Andria Tembrino.

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,100
She dumped him for Michael Sklauf.

29
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,000
Did I go to this school?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Hey there's Missey Golberg, you gotta remember her.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Sure, nice.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Dude, you married to my sister.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
You're right. By saying nice, I'm virtually licking her.

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think should I ask her out?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Are you asking permission to break the pact?

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Yes, please.

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,000
Hey.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Check out the flyers for the band.

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,700
I made them on a Macintosh in the computer room.

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,200
Awesome! The name really stands out.

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Thanks to a little sth called Helvetic ball 24 point.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian Student Union.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,200
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Missey.

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,300
You know, our band is playing on Friday.

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, you should come and check us out.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,500
We call it "Way, No Way".

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,400
- No way.
- Way!

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,600
Great, I'll be there.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,800
- She's gone.
- I know it.

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
I said it first, bro.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Well, I thought it first, homes.

54
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,400
Look, if you date...

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,200
Wait, what are we doing?

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,500
What we have is too important to mess up with some girl...
I mean, we can get laid any time we want.

57
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,400
Totally.

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
I had sex in high school.

59
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Me, too. I'm good at it.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,600
Alright, I say we make a pact,
neither of us will go out with Missey Golberg.

61
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,300
You got it.

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,700
Alright, so that's Missey Golberg, Phoebe Kate and Molly Ringwalt, neither of us can go out with 'em

63
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,300
Those are the pact.

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, and Shina Easten, we probably couldn't get her anyway.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Well, not you.

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Alright, here I go.

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Hey, remember how scary you used to be
going up to girls in college?

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
- Your hands are shaking.
- I know, I can't stop sweating.

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,400
5, 4, 3, applause.

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Welcome, it is Soup Opra Week here on PYRAMID.

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's meet our contestants.
First, Jean Lester, is a database specialist.

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
He's gonna be playing with
"Days of Our Lives" star, Joey Tribbiani.

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,700
Sir, I know it can be intimidating for regular people
to be around celebrities.

76
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,700
But, relax, I'm just like you. Only better looking and richer.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,900
...should be playing wih the star of "General Hospital", Lesley Charlson.

78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,000
Welcome, everybody. Good luck to all of you!

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's play PYRAMID, alright?

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,300
We flipped the coin before the show.

81
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
Jean, you won the toss, so you're gonna start.

82
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,600
- Which category would you like?
- I'll take "You Cross The Line".

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,500
"You Cross The Line".

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Joey, discribe for Jean these things that have lines.

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,500
Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Ready? Go.

87
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Uh, Ok, it's a store like a supermarket... Oh!

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
I see what I did, ok?

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Uh, I'm writing in my...

90
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Diary.

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
No, more like a notebook. Oh, dammit.

92
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Oh, if I'm building a house,
the plan isn't called the schmooprint.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,500
Can't do that either?

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,300
In high school, I once had sex with a girl
right in the middle of the...

95
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,400
Cafeteria.

96
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,500
Yeah, but that's not what they are looking for.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
You did so much for this.

98
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,200
Oh, you like it?

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,500
Oh my god, it's also elegant.

100
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,800
When is the dirty stuff starting?

101
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,500
What?

102
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,500
You know, the strippers and the guys dancing,
and you know, PPs flying about.

103
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Phoebs, I, I... There isn't gonna be any flying about.

104
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,700
We actually thought we're a little too mature for
stuff like that.

105
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,300
Ok.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
I see what you're doing, that's fine.

107
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,900
This is all there is, just tea, ok.

108
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Mmh, raunchy.

109
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Seriously, Phoebs, this is not gonna be that kind of a party.

110
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,200
Really? So this is my big sent off in a married life?

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Rachel, this is the only bachelorette party
I'm ever gonna have.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,100
I've got a big wattle of wines in my purse.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Really? I mean, really it's just tea?

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,700
Nooo.

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,000
Phoebe, of course there's more.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,700
I mean... Let me just go talk to Monica
and get us ETA on the PPs.

117
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Now, Jean, I must remind you,
you need all 6 of these to stay in the game, alright?

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,500
Discribe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,500
I bet they're just giving us the points.

120
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,100
Give me 20 seconds on the clock. Ready? Go.

121
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
You put this thing in your coffee.

122
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,200
A spoon, your hands, your face.

123
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,200
- It's white.
- Paper, snow, a ghost!

124
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
It's heavier than milk.

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,500
Uh, rock, a dog, the earth.

126
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,600
Pass.

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,700
You put this on sandwich.

128
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,300
Salami, anchovies, jam.

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,300
- It's white.
- Paper, snow, a ghost!

130
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,300
- It's made from eggs.
- Chickens?

131
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
Pass.

132
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,600
- You put this on a hamburg.
- Ketchup.

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,700
- Yes. Stop
- Brioche.

134
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,300
Oh, time's up.

135
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Joey, you are... almost on a roll there.

136
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Jean, you're gonna have a chance to go to
the winner circle in the second half.

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:45,600
But right now, Henriada, you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for $10000 right after this.

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Don't go away.

139
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
And we're out.

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Oh, so we didn't win. But it's fun to play the game, right?

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
I got a kid starting college, I've got surgery on my knee.

142
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,500
You just lost me 10-grand.

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,100
Wow.

144
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm so sorry, ok. I promise we'll do better next time.

145
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, I will. Because I won't be playing with you.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,100
You know, some of those are pretty hard.

147
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,400
Like why would there be a ghost in my frige?

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,300
So, Saturday night.

149
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,300
- I'd love to.
- Great.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,300
So, how come it took you so long to ask me out?

151
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,200
Oh, well, it's gonna sound kinda silly, but...

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,700
Do you remember my roommate, Chandler Bing?

153
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Sure, he was in your "Band".

154
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,700
It's been 16 years, but the air quotes still hurt.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
- Sorry.
- That's ok.

156
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Uhm, anyway, he and I both really liked you a lot,

157
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,100
but we didn't wanna anything to jeopardise our friendship,

158
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,400
so we knida made a pact
that neither of us could ask you out.

159
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,600
Really?

160
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,900
Yeah. Why?

161
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,400
Well, Chandler and I used to make out... a lot.

162
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,100
You did?

163
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Yeah, we'd go to the science lab after hours.

164
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
And on my turf?

165
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,900
Hey, where is this guy? It's been over an hour.

166
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,900
He's coming from Jersey,
he said he would get here as fast as he could.

167
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Who is it?

168
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
It's the police.

169
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Oh, the police!

170
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,400
That's right, it's officer Good Body.

171
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Woo, that's a lotta stairs.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,300
Woo, boy!

174
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,900
You should warn people there's no elevator.

175
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.

176
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
- Are you gonna be ok, officer...?
- Good Body.

177
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,000
If you say so.

178
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:27,200
So, where is the young lady
who I'm supposed to take downtown?

179
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,600
Oh, God.

180
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,900
Alright, somebody show me where to plug in my box
and we'll get this party started.

181
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
Rachel?

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,700
Yeah?

183
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,200
Uhm, are you kidding?

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Alright, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper
so we went to the phone book, we got the first name we could find.

185
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,600
How old is your phone book?

186
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Oh my god, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment.

187
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Oh god, no. I don't want to see him take his clothes off.

188
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,500
Are you talking about me?

189
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,400
Oh, no!

190
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean, obviously we wanna see you take your clothes off.

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
You big piece of eye candy.

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,800
Ok, ok. Ladies, can I have your attention, please.

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Did some one call for the long arm of the law?

194
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,900
I should warn you I have a concealed weapon.

195
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,800
I hope you're familiar with this state's Pino code.

196
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,900
Ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasant.

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Wow, wow, she cringed.

198
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
This is how I look when I'm turned on.

199
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
You were talking about me before.

200
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Look, I don't need this.

201
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm out of here, where's my hat?

202
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,600
Look, I've been in this business for a long time.

203
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Shocking.

204
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Now, if you just pay me my $300, I'll be on my way.

205
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,500
$300, are you kidding?

206
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,700
No, no, it's ok. Let me get my checkbook.

207
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
No, you're not getting to pay him. He didn't do anything.

208
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,200
Didn't do anything?

209
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,000
I took a bus all the way from Holbolken,

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,600
I climbed, I don't know, like a billion stairs,

211
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,600
it's not like I can take them to the time.

212
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,500
I don't care, we're not paying you $300 for this.

213
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,800
Well look, it's not my fault that you're too uptight
to appreciate the male form and all its glory.

214
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh yeah, ok. I'm uptight, yeah,

215
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:31,000
that's why I don't wanna watch a middleaged guy
dancing around in what I can only assume as
a child's Halloween costume.

216
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,800
I may have borrowed this from my nephew,

217
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,600
but let me assure you what's underneath is all man.

218
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?

219
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, you're mean.

220
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Oh, look, officer...

221
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,700
Oh dammit, ahh.

222
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Big surprise, the hunk of beef has felings.

223
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,800
Applause.

224
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,200
Ok, Henriada, you picked Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill.

225
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,900
My friend Rachel has a kid,
I totally know nursery rhymes.

226
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,200
Joey, discribe these things
associated with the US Congress.

227
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,500
Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please.

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,900
Ready? Go.

229
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,900
(Legislature)

230
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ahh... Pass.

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,300
(Rotunda)

232
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,500
Pass.

233
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,800
(Filibuster)

234
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,400
Pass.

235
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
(Addendum)

236
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
Ok, the little thing that hangs on the back of your throat.

237
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,500
Uvula.

238
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,200
Oh, then pass.

239
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
(Joint Session)

240
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,300
Ok, Henriada, you didn't get all the points you needed,
so that means Jean,

241
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,800
you are going to the winner circle to try for $10000

242
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,900
and you are gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,000
You made out with Missey Golberg?
How could you do that after you promised me?

244
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,800
Excuse me.

245
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,400
That didn't make it sound gay at all.

246
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
You broke the pact.

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,700
Ross, it was 16 years ago.

248
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,100
That doesn't matter.
We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.

249
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,900
I believed the foundation of our friendship was
unfortunate hair.

250
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Alright, look, if we're really gonna do this,
it's not like you never broke one of our pacts.

251
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,000
I didn't.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
Oh really?

253
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,500
No.

254
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,200
Oh really?

255
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,900
No!

256
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,200
Agerin Turner!

257
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,600
Yes?

258
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Hey.

259
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,200
I never did anything with Agerin Turner.

260
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,700
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.

261
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

262
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,200
Really? Remeber that big party? Freshman year,
a week before Christmas vacation?

263
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,300
I do. You had some visitors.

264
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,600
I can't believe we are at a real college party.

265
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,200
I have to pee so bad.

266
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,500
This is so awesome.

267
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
College guys are so cute.

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Hey, you have a boy friend.

269
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,800
I know!

270
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,900
But if some guy looks like Corey Ham
wants to kiss me tonight, I'm gonna so let him.

271
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Hey, look, it's Chandler.

272
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,600
You know, that stupid friend of Ross', said I was fat.

273
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,500
You know, I've already lost 4 pounds.

274
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,800
You could so totally tell.

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,000
I know!

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's see maybe he knows where Ross is.

277
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
Hey, how is it going?

278
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,500
- Aren't you...
- Yeah, Rachel.

279
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,200
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.

280
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Right.

281
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,700
So how are you doing?

282
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,300
Bitcher.

283
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Hi, Monica.

284
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,900
Hi, Chandler. I mean, nice to see you... not.

285
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Ok.

286
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
I'll see if I can find Ross.

287
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,100
Oh my god, Rach, bean bag chairs.

288
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.

289
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,300
Listen, Agerin, you can't tell Chandler about this.

290
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Oh, believe me, Ross.
I won't be telling anybody about this.

291
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Cool.

292
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,500
I didn't know you knew about that.

293
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,200
Well, I did. And I hurt.

294
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,900
That's why I wrote the song
"Betrayed in the common room".

295
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
Man, I'm sorry.

296
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,400
Look, it's a long time ago.

297
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,900
So, I made out with Agerin and you made out with Missey.

298
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Well, I guess we're even.

299
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,400
We are even, right?

300
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Just one more thing,

301
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
I was so pissed at you that night
that I wanted to get back at you,

302
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,500
so I thought who does Ross like more than anybody.

303
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
What did you do to my mom?

304
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Not her.

305
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,300
I am sooo drunk.

306
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,300
That's weird, I had the same of beer as you do
and I don't deel anything at all.

307
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,700
So, you girls are having fun?

308
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,200
For your information, ass much.

309
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I lost 4 pounds, maybe 5 with all the dancing.

310
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,000
Somebody ordered a pizza?

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Oh, that's me.

312
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm so not gonna do good on my SATs tomorrow.

313
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,600
Well, maybe you can go to school here next year,
we can totally hang out.

314
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,300
Oh yeah, there's a plan.
Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now.

315
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Wow, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.

316
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Oh, what a lying...(mouthing Oh My God)

317
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,200
So, where are you applying to?

318
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Well, you know, I kinda think it's really important
that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sorta...

319
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,800
Hey!

320
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,500
I'm in college, I'm in a band.

321
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, ok.

322
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,000
What's the matter, you never saw
a fifty-year-old stripper cry before?

323
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
You know what, it's fine, we'll pay you.

324
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,800
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?

325
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I should've hung up that break away jockstrap years ago.

326
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,900
What am I gonna do?

327
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I mean, this has been my life for 32 years.

328
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.

329
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh wait, there's got to be sth else that you can do.

330
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,200
I mean, what skills do you have?

331
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,900
I don't know.

332
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,900
I can make my packs dance.

333
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,100
I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks.

334
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,000
I can go to that special place inside me
where I feel no shame.

335
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,400
So maybe sth in the office.

336
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Or you could teach stripping.

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know? Share you gift, pass the torch.

338
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,200
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
I can do it outta my apartment.

339
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,900
I don't think my mom would mind.

340
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,600
There you go. You think you're gonna be ok?

341
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Yeah, yeah, this is so weird.

342
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,900
You never know when it's gonna be your last dance.

343
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,900
And I don't even get a chance to finish it.

344
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Finish it.

345
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,500
What?

346
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,400
Your last dance, do it for us.

347
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,700
Really?

348
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, yeah, he deserves to do the thing he loves
one last time.

349
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,900
Ok. Alright, get ready, ladies.

350
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Oh, this is so hot!

351
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh, no, don't stop.

352
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Have to.

353
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,300
Welcome to the winner circles.
Joey, Jean, you guys are ready?

354
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300
- Yeah.
- Sure.

355
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,800
Ok, give me 60 seconds on the clock, please.

356
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,300
Ready? Go.

357
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,500
Oak, maple, elm, birch...

358
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Uhh, I don't know, types of trees.

359
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,600
(Spanish Words)

360
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't know any Spanish words.

361
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,400
A match, a candle...

362
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
Things that go "tze" when you put them out.

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,400
A torch, a bonfire... uh, your pee.

364
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,500
Things that burn.

365
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,300
I'd like to go for a walk.

366
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,000
Scratch my belly.

367
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Dude, dude, I think you're loosing it.

368
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,100
Uh, I have fur, I like to bark.

369
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,800
Oh, What A Dog Says.

370
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,400

371
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Cindy Crawford , Christie Brinkly,
Hidey Clumn, Claudia shiffer.

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,400
Christie Tirlinton, Kate Marse...

373
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,000
Girls Chandler could never get.

374
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
- Supermodels!
- Where?!

375
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Hey. Where's Rachel?

376
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.

377
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,300
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?

378
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
What? When was this?

379
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,300
1987. The weekend you guys visited me at school.

380
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
Oh my god, that's wild.

381
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,200
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago,
so it doesn't matter.

382
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,900
- Well, it matters to me.
- Why?

383
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,700
Because the night you kissed Rachel was the night
I kissed Rachel for the very first time.

384
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,500
You kissed her that night, too?

385
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,600
Two guys at one night?

386
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,500
I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.

387
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Seriously, where did this happen?

388
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Ok. After you told me she was passed out in our room,
I went in there to make sure she was alright.

389
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
She was lying on my bed and all buried in people's coats.

390
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,500
Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead,
but it was so dark I accidently got her lips,

391
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
I started to pull away
but then I felt her start to kiss me back.

392
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,900
It was only for a second but it was amazing.

393
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,200
And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.

394
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,600
- Uh, wait, what bed you say she was on?
- Mine.

395
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,800
- I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
- No, she was definitely on my bed.

396
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,700
Why would I kiss a girl and put her on your bed?

397
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,500
Well, then who was on my bed?

398
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Oh, oh, oh!

399
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,300
No, no, no!

400
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,800
Yes!

401
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,700
You were under the pile of coats.

402
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,700
I was the pile of coats.

403
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,500
Oh my god!

404
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,500
You were my midnight mystery kisser?!

405
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,700
You were my first kiss with Rachel?!

406
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,700
You were my first kiss ever?!

407
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,900
What did I marry into?

408
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,900
Oh, crap!
