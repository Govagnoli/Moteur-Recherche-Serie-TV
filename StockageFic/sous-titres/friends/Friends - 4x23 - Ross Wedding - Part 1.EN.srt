1
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,619
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,329
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,930
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,739
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,540
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:24,940
-Who are you saying "check" to?
-Myself.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,530
For remembering to pack a thing.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,340
You do a good thing,
you get a "check. "

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,659
Mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,139
My mom used to put her head
in the oven.

11
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:40,450
Actually, only the one time.
But it's pretty weird.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,540
Are you ready yet?

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,139
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

14
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,970
It's all London, baby!

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,259
Here we go.

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,930
Got your passport?

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,939
Third drawer of my dresser.
You don't want to lose that!

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,930
There it is!

19
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,779
The One With Ross' Wedding - Part I

20
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,330
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

21
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,730
The vacuum's in my closet
on the left side.

22
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,180
Garbage bags are next
to the refrigerator.

23
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,889
Rachel's gonna be here.
Can't I just ask her?

24
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,260
Yeah, okay. Give that a try!

25
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,779
-Let's do it.
-Cheerio!

26
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,290
London, baby!

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,539
That's not gonna get annoying.

28
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:10,850
London, baby!

29
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,729
You know what?
I was wrong.

30
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,220
We're all here.
Let's get going!

31
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,380
I want to go over and hug you...

32
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:22,369
... and wish you luck,
but I can't get up.

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,729
-I'll come hug you.
-Great, can you bring me the paper?

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,860
-Have a great wedding.
-Thanks.

35
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,570
Chandler, I want to hug you too!

36
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:35,300
You might as well bring my book
from your apartment.

37
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,729
-So we're off.
-Have fun!

38
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,850
-I can't believe you won't be there.
-I know.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,529
Come. Why don't you come?

40
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:54,169
To London. Please?
It would mean so much to me.

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,500
I gotta work. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,419
Why can't you take
a couple of days off?

43
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:01,369
Because I can't.
I told you.

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,729
This is my wedding.

45
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,289
Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go!

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,770
Fine, you'll watch it
on video when we get back.

47
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,330
Here you go, Phoebe!
Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!

48
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,139
You!

49
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,369
Let's go!

50
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,020
Bye, Pheebs!

51
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,729
London, baby!

52
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,649
Oh, God!

53
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,130
Do you need a hug?

54
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,539
You don't have to bring me anything.

55
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,729
Chandler, do something!

56
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,929
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,169
I'll be the on-camera guy.

58
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,809
All right. First stop...

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,139
... Westminster Abbey.

60
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,220
What is that?

61
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,300
That's London, baby!

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,410
All right, the hotel's here.

63
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:17,660
Wait.

64
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,049
We want to go--

65
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,140
I know.

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,730
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,940
If you see a little version
of me in there, kill it!

68
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:36,100
I got it.

69
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,130
Here we go!

70
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,940
We're not gonna have to walk this way
the entire time, are we?

71
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,339
Man, you made me lose it!

72
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,570
That was all before 10:00.

73
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,970
The caterer rang. It'll be Chicken
Kiev, not Tarragon.

74
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,500
Then the florist said
there are no tulips.

75
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,059
And the cellist has
carpal tunnel syndrome--

76
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,130
Emily, honey. Okay?

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,410
Well, up yours too!

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,769
-No! That's "time out. "
-Sorry.

79
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,769
Sweetie, relax.
Everything will be great, okay?

80
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,739
Come on, come on.

81
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,140
Chicken Kiev?

82
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,929
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

83
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,339
Salmon would be
more elegant than chicken.

84
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,329
And you wouldn't worry
about the salmonella.

85
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,820
I can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

86
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,380
It's beautiful.
Her parents got married here.

87
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,489
I can't believe
they're tearing it down.

88
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,660
It's really the most lovely building.
It's over--

89
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,130
Oh, my God!

90
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,739
It's nice.

91
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,899
Oh, my God!

92
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,980
What are we going to do?

93
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,260
Everything's gonna be all right.

94
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,690
How's it gonna be all right?

95
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,329
I see that.

96
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,540
I talked to a guy,
and I found out what happened.

97
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,179
They tore it down early.

98
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,739
All right!

99
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,059
Westminster Abbey.

100
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,649
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

101
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,649
What do you think of the Abbey?

102
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,529
It's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

103
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,769
-To what?
-To "Put the Camera Away" !

104
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,329
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

105
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,290
-Don't get up. What do you need?
-Nothing.

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,929
Come on. I'm here
to take care of you.

107
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,329
Okay, I have a wedgie.

108
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,299
That is all you.

109
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,850
What do you want for lunch?

110
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,140
I don't know.

111
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,220
I guess we have to eat.

112
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,739
Yeah, I do.

113
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,250
What's the matter?

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,059
I'm bummed the way
I left things with Ross.

115
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:25,179
I wish I didn't lie about work.
He seemed so mad at me.

116
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,929
Don't be so hard on yourself.
If I was still in love with some--

117
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,739
Still in love with?

118
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,420
I'm not in love with Ross.

119
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,089
Good!

120
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,859
Yeah, me neither.

121
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:44,369
I'm not at the wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

122
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,529
... and that would be uncomfortable.

123
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,779
Not because I'm in love with him.
I like Ross as much as anyone.

124
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,459
Clearly, I have feelings for him,
but they don't mean love.

125
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,850
I mean, do I still have
loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!

126
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,369
I have continuing feelings of love.

127
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:06,339
But that doesn't mean
I'm still in love with him.

128
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:10,859
I have sexual feelings for him,
but I do love him.

129
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,130
Oh, my God!

130
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,140
Why didn't you tell me?

131
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,929
-We thought you knew!
-We?

132
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,170
We all know.
We talk about it all the time.

133
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,380
You all know?
Does Ross know?

134
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,140
No! Ross doesn't know anything.

135
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,330
And you didn't tell me!

136
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,780
We thought you knew.
It's so obvious!

137
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,770
It would be like telling Monica:

138
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,489
"Hey, you like things clean. "

139
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,140
What are you in the market for?
Scarves, souvenir post cards....

140
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,210
Check this out!

141
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,419
That's the stuff!
What do you think?

142
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,849
I won't need that
"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

143
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,250
Well, I like it. Here you go.

144
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,010
You're not really buying that.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

145
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,369
Oh, I embarrass you?

146
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:11,609
How can I answer when
I'm pretending I don't know you?

147
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,250
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.

148
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,140
Really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

149
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,530
They're all tourists.

150
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:25,580
If you insist on wearing that
in public...

151
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,940
... you're gonna spend the afternoon
all by yourself.

152
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,130
If you make me choose between
you and the hat, I choose the hat.

153
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,940
-Good choice.
-Thanks.

154
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,739
That's it! I'm out of here.
I won't be embarrassed anymore.

155
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,690
I spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

156
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,969
He thinks we can find a new hall.

157
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,570
-We don't have to.
-You found a place?

158
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,969
No, but Monica and I were talking...

159
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:09,210
... and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

160
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:12,330
... she suggested we put
the wedding off for a bit.

161
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,690
She said what?

162
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,940
If I won't be happy with somewhere
we'd find in a day...

163
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,929
... we should postpone it.

164
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,140
Postpone it.

165
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,859
Do you think Monica realizes
how much our parents spent on this?

166
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:36,179
Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny, little brain comprehends...

167
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,650
... that people took time
out of their lives...

168
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,809
... to fly thousands of miles
to be here?

169
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:46,929
This isn't right.

170
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,330
I realize that
people are gonna be disappointed.

171
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,619
But I'm sure they'll come back.

172
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,130
I can't ask people to do that.
Would you?

173
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,859
Don't you point your pants at me!

174
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,969
We have no choice.

175
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:05,179
Anywhere half-decent
will have been booked.

176
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,770
Don't you understand?
This is our wedding!

177
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:12,450
Postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.

178
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,570
-You're saying it's now or never?
-I'm saying it's now.

179
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,979
-Or?
-There's no "or" in mine!

180
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,049
What is wrong with these pants?

181
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,929
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.

182
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,210
If you don't understand
how important this is to me...

183
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,140
... perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,969
Emily, no! Wait, stop!
Emily, please--

185
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,299
Did shopping help you
feel any better?

186
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,169
Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.

187
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,900
I can help you get over him.

188
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,289
You can?

189
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,780
I need you to bring me
photos of Ross...

190
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,530
... and a small piece of chocolate...

191
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,580
... and a glass of tepid water.

192
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,780
Is this where you throw stuff...

193
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:07,130
... in a bag with graveyard dirt
and hang it from a north-facing tree?

194
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,770
Only if you have the hiccups too.

195
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,650
The chocolate and water are for me.
I didn't feel like getting up.

196
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,130
I'll show you a picture of Ross.

197
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,979
And you remember all
the bad things about him.

198
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,289
-Focus on his flaws.
-I can do that.

199
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,729
I did that
while we were going out.

200
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,330
Before we start, I want to say,
for the record, I love Ross.

201
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,340
He's such a great guy.

202
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,130
Close your eyes.

203
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,330
Imagine that you're with Ross.

204
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,489
Imagine that you're kissing him.

205
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:51,130
You're running your hands
all over his body.

206
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,890
You run your hands
through his hair but--

207
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:57,330
Gross!
It's some kind of grease.

208
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,729
I don't know.

209
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,570
His hair never bothered me that much.

210
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,460
It was more crunchy
than it was greasy.

211
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,179
This will be harder than I thought.

212
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,570
Let's try some aversion therapy.

213
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:18,929
Look at the picture.

214
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,539
How do you feel now?

215
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,690
Well, I like you less.

216
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:51,820
Sorry.

217
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,659
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

218
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,090
That wasn't cool.

219
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,210
If it makes you feel any better,
I've had a really lousy day.

220
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,650
Me too.

221
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,450
-Yeah?
-No!

222
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,780
I had the best day ever!

223
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,140
Dude, check this out!

224
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,979
Tell my friend you like my hat.

225
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:21,940
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

226
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,169
Hi, Chandler.

227
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,049
That's--

228
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,460
That's Fergie, baby!

229
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:33,130
Joey says you don 't like his hat,
but I think it's kind of dashing.

230
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,289
When did you--?
How?

231
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,380
I was trying to get
to Buckingham Palace.

232
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,500
So I'm in my map and--

233
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,940
I understand you had
a talk with Emily.

234
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,570
Yes, I did.

235
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,539
And you are welcome.

236
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,570
Am l?

237
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,820
Was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

238
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,330
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Wait up!

239
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,780
Since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

240
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,299
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't want the wedding at all?

241
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,210
She said that?

242
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,260
Why?

243
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,169
I don't know. I said it was stupid
to put off the wedding...

244
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,729
... and she, like, flipped out.

245
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:25,409
Oh, my God!
You're even dumber than I am.

246
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,929
Excuse me?

247
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,140
How long have you been planning
this wedding?

248
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,650
I don't know. A month?

249
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:35,929
Emily's probably been planning it
since she was 5.

250
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,659
Ever since the first time she hung
a pillowcase from her head.

251
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,140
That's what we did.

252
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,419
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

253
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,929
In the perfect place.

254
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,140
With the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake.

255
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,099
With the little people on top.

256
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,780
But the most important part...

257
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,380
... is that we had the perfect guy...

258
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:13,530
... who understood just how important
all that stuff was.

259
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,340
I had no idea.

260
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:22,369
That pillowcase thing, I thought
you were doing The Flying Nun.

261
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,369
Sometimes we were.

262
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,539
Come on.

263
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,770
Help me figure out what to do.

264
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,340
Pretty intense, huh?

265
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,729
I hope Ross didn't think we left
because we were uncomfortable here.

266
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,250
I hope he did.

267
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:02,969
Pheebs, it's Joey.

268
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,530
Hey, Joey!

269
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,140
I saw someone that looks just
like you on the subway.

270
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,530
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

271
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,339
That just cost me 4 bucks.

272
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,449
I called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

273
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,020
They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.

274
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:27,170
So do you miss me?

275
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,099
Kind of, but I've been
having too much fun.

276
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,650
You're not homesick yet?

277
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,939
I don't think so.

278
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,579
Well, the seven of us miss you.

279
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,260
-Who's seven?
-Me, Rachel...

280
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,729
... the birds, the babies.

281
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:47,130
The babies miss me?

282
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:49,810
Pizza guy's here!

283
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,060
You ordered pizza without me?

284
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,500
But we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

285
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,300
Two pizzas?

286
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,500
-Gotta go! Talk to you later.
-Wait!

287
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,530
Where did you get it from?

288
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,380
And they're always glad you came

289
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,060
You want to be where you can see

290
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,449
Your troubles are all the same

291
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:28,770
You want to be
Where everybody knows your name

292
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:35,369
Why have you brought me here?

293
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:36,729
You'll see.

294
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:38,780
This wedding won't happen.

295
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,569
Ross.

296
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:46,130
But imagine a lot more lights...

297
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,849
... and fewer bricks...

298
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,530
... and flowers and candles.

299
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:54,250
And the musicians can go over here.

300
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,810
The chairs can face this way and--

301
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,099
You go.

302
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,250
But if you don't love this,
we'll do it any other place or time.

303
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,060
Really, it's fine.

304
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,859
Whatever you want.

305
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,930
It's perfect.

306
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,489
And, I don't know, if it rains--

307
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,209
Then we'll get wet.

308
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,699
I don't even have a date.

309
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,780
Do you remember
where the duck food is?

310
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,619
In the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

311
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,739
Because I'm going to London.

312
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:34,780
What? What do you mean?

313
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,089
I have to tell Ross I love him.

314
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,180
Take care and don't have
the babies till I get back.

315
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,489
You can't go.
Ross loves Emily.

316
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,339
I know, but I have
to tell him how I feel.

317
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:50,890
He deserves all the information
to make an informed decision.

318
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,930
You're going
because you hope he'll say:

319
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,939
"I love you too.
Forget the British chippy. "

320
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,260
You think he will?

321
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,089
No, because he's in love
with the British chippy!

322
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,170
You're just gonna mess with his head
and ruin his wedding.

323
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,089
It's too late!
You missed your chance.

324
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,939
I'm sorry.
This must be hard.

325
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,329
But it's over.

326
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,930
No, it's not over
until someone says, "I do. "

327
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,260
I do! I do!

328
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:37,130
Like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter!
