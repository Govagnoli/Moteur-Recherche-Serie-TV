1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:04,269
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:07,433
First cookie? She has cookies all the time.

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:10,250
I've never given her a cookie.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,074
Have you?

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:14,320
No.

6
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:19,282
And for the record I've also never given her frosting from a can.

7
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:22,763
Hey, Rach. The adoption agency needs letters of recommendation

8
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:24,811
and we were wondering if you'd write one for us.

9
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,376
Of course! I'll be honored / Thanks

10
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,080
Thank you.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,068
I think there's been an oversight.

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,377
Joey, we would have asked you.
We just thought you wouldn't be interested

13
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:42,901
Yeah, it's just that we don't think of you as
really being so much with the words

14
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:46,433
What? Wait- hey. Hey Ho Hey

15
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:50,136
Clearly we were wrong.

16
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:52,997
Look, I've got a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, okay?

17
00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:57,940
I know how much you want to have a baby
and I would love to help you get one.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,111
- You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it
- Thank you

19
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:05,977
Alright, let me see how I'm going to start.

20
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:11,327
Dear baby adoption decider people

21
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:15,253
So excited about your letter.

22
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,086
Hey

23
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,409
Hi Phoebe.

24
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,206
Wow, don't you look nice.

25
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:23,430
Yes, I do.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,681
Today's, uh, Mike and my one year anniversary.

27
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,578
Oh, what's it the anniversary of?

28
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:30,357
Your first, uh, date? Your first kiss?

29
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,762
First time you had sex?

30
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:35,124
Yeah!

31
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:37,495
So you must be going somewhere fancy to celebrate.

32
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:39,562
Uh- huh. Um, uh, Knicks game.

33
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:42,626
Uh...aren't you a little over- dressed?

34
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:45,071
Hey, you know what?
I've never had a one year anniversary before

35
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,954
so no matter where we go, I'm wearig something fancy pants

36
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,038
and I'm going to put on my finest jewelry and

37
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:53,638
we're going to have sex in a public restroom

38
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,017
You guys do that?

39
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:58,517
Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom.

40
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:02,531
That's where people make number 2.

42
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:56,038
Hey / Hi

43
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:03,186
So you know, I have a little time
if you, uh, you want to....

44
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:04,482
Oh

45
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:08,313
Oh, I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers

46
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,350
Ah, fine. It's fine.

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,696
I'll just shower by myself.

48
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:19,300
B, B, B, B, B.

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,690
Oh, Ross you gave a B to a pottery barn catalog.

50
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,514
Well, it had some good ideas. Take off your shirt.

51
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:26,996
Damn it.

52
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:30,102
Rachel! Open up! It's your sister.

53
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:32,418
I have to talk to you.

54
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,830
Hi, Amy.

55
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,241
You're not Rachel.

56
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,130
Still sharp as a tack!

57
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,868
Um, Charlie, this is Rachel's sister, Amy.

58
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:47,014
Amy, this is Charlie.

59
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,637
Hi, nice to meet you/ Hi

60
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:51,792
And you are?

61
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,612
Ross.

62
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,429
I grew up on your block?

63
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:01,079
Um

64
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,581
We had thanksgiving together last year?

65
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:07,256
I had a baby with your sister?

66
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:13,700
Did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

67
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,327
Yes, yes you did.

68
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:25,199
Hi, Rachel. Here's your sister, Amy.

69
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,004
She thinks I need peck implants

70
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,898
Amy, hi.

71
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,110
You remember Joey?

72
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,631
Yeah, sure. The days of our lives guy.

73
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,407
That's right.

74
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:39,713
You were not good.

75
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,361
Always nice to meet a fan.

76
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,230
So now what are you doing here?

77
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,115
Well, I have huge news

78
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:49,595
Sorry. Hold on. Let me just check on the baby

79
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:52,074
Wait! This is important. Can't Ella wait?

80
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:55,892
Uh, her name is Emma.

81
00:04:55,892 --> 00:05:00,315
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

82
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:04,295
What do I know?
I just sell middle eastern food from a cart.

83
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:08,596
Hey, your English is getting better.

84
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,893
Oh my God. / I know

85
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:16,395
She may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.

86
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:17,686
What you...what you're working on?

87
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:19,983
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

88
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:23,526
I want it to sound smart
but I don't know any big words or any of those so...

89
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,569
Why don't you use your thesaurus?

90
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,701
What did I just say?

91
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,492
Watch

92
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:34,330
Here you, uh, you hightlight the word you want to change

93
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,065
go into tools and the thesaurus generates....gives,

94
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,805
gives a whole list of choices.

95
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:45,395
You can pick the word that sounds smartest,

96
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,071
Oh my God, that's great!

97
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,096
I'm smart.

98
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,486
No, no, I am

99
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:53,457
brainy, bright, clever! I love this thing!

100
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:59,042
Look out, ladies! Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!

101
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,240
So beautiful

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,465
Oh, I know. Isn't she?

103
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,910
No, I was talking about your bedding.

104
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,198
Alright. What's your news, Amy?

105
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,099
Oh.

106
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,735
Well,

107
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:17,813
I'm getting married.

108
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:20,167
Wow! Oh my God!

109
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,207
To who?

110
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:24,517
This guy...

111
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,223
He has a killer apartment

112
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,602
and....?

113
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:36,263
And it's on 5th and the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

114
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,960
No, what's...what's he like?

115
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,209
Oh, he's okay.

116
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,965
Do you remember my old boyfriend, Mark? / Yeah.

117
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:48,795
It's his Dad.

118
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,616
Ha! Well, so he's got to be...

119
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:53,626
Old? Yeah.

120
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:59,186
But he travels a lot so he's hardly ever there.

121
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:04,193
Pretty, I've got to tell you it sounds a little bit
like you like the apartment more than you like...

122
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:05,992
Myron.

123
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,741
Um, yeah, I told you he was old.

124
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,787
Ugh, sit down. Sit down.

125
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:15,633
Oh honey, you know. I once also almost married somebody
that I didn't love.

126
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,235
Do you remember Barry?

127
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,261
Remember him?

128
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:23,696
God, we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.

129
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:27,447
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

130
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:33,215
Um, so but anyway, listen. Not marrying Barry was
the best decision that I ever, ever made.

131
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:35,182
Honey, Amy, you, you deserve true love

132
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:37,452
Your, your soul mate is out there somewhere

133
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:42,719
Someone that is your age that is smart that is fun

134
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:47,125
and that, that you care about.

135
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,309
You're right. You're right

136
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,020
I'm going to do it /Okay

137
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,892
I'm going to marry Myron and keep looking for Mr. Right.

138
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:57,172
Okay

139
00:07:57,172 --> 00:08:01,327
Okay. Let's keep talking

140
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,562
Excuse me. Anniversary.

141
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:14,914
Excuse me. Anniversary.

142
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:17,182
Um, yeah.

143
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:22,185
Sir, could you, could you move your Nachos.
They're on my seat.

144
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:26,214
It's my anniversary.

145
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,735
Here we are.

146
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,770
Can't believe it's been a whole year.

147
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,346
I know.

148
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,259
This has been the best year....

149
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,698
This has been the best year of my life / Me too.

150
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,506
I've never thought I'd love someone this much

151
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:46,492
I feel the same way

152
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,479
You're so generous and kind

153
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:53,660
and you're amazing in bed!

154
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:57,861
It's our anniversary.

155
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:03,072
Knicks fans. Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboards.

156
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:07,207
Someone has a special question to ask.

157
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,110
Oh, how lame!

158
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,160
Oh, it's so tacky and impersonal.

159
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,820
Really?

160
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,695
Oh, it's the worst way to propose.

161
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,966
Excuse me.

162
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,954
Hey. Here's my recommendation, here.

163
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:33,083
And I think you would be very, very happy.

164
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:38,092
It's the longest I've ever spent on a computer
without looking at porn.

165
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,948
I don't, uh, understand.

166
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,976
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for you.

167
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,982
It doesn't make any sense.

168
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,958
Of course it does. It's smart.

169
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:53,228
I used the thesaurus

170
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,754
On every word?

171
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,141
Yup

172
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,671
Alright. What was this sentence originally?

173
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,957
Oh."They're warm, nice people with big hearts."

174
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:16,395
And that became "They're humid, preposessing
homo- sapience with full- sized aortic pumps."

175
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:17,283
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:21,512
And hey, I really mean it, dude.

177
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,785
Hey, Joey. I don't think we can use this.

178
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:24,965
Why not?

179
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:31,086
Well, because you signed it,"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani"

180
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:37,662
Honey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart
and just be yourself?

181
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:40,578
You know what? You don't need the thesaurus.
Just right from here.

182
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:44,449
Your full- sized aortic pump.

183
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:48,955
Amy, hi.

184
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,456
I took your advice. I left Myron.

185
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:54,519
Oh, good for you! / I know!

186
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,555
I'm Erin Brockovich!

187
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,403
Yes, you are!

188
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:04,548
Oh, I'm so pround of you / Oh, thank you.

189
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:08,575
So can I stay with you?

190
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:14,460
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

191
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:18,901
Ah...look who's back.

192
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:19,690
Why do you have bags?

193
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,900
Rachel, why does she have bags?

194
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,574
I'm staying with you guys.

195
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:24,236
What?

196
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:28,850
We're going to be roomies. Come on.

197
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:36,791
Slept out here?

198
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:42,652
Well, Amy kept kicking me in her sleep
yelling "Myron, get off"

199
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:44,683
But, uh, we're getting rid of her, right?

200
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,237
Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.

201
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,228
Joey, I can't do that!

202
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:49,172
Oh, come on!

203
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:51,409
Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said

204
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:55,973
" Whoa, whoa, whoa.
The moment on the lips, forever on the hips"

205
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:59,189
I don't need that kind of talk in my house.

206
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:01,345
Joey. Look, I know that she's difficult.

207
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:05,107
But I think it's really good that she's here.

208
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:09,890
Cause we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?

209
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,767
No, it's just...Look, you know, when I first moved to the city,
I was a lot like her.

210
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:18,556
I was spoiled, self- centered
and you guys really took care of me.

211
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:22,257
Yeah, Monica made us.

212
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:23,299
Well, whatever.

213
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:24,872
I really appreciate it cause

214
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:29,498
I don't think I would be the person that I am today
if it wasn't for you guys

215
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,000
So you know, I want to help Amy for you guys helped me

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,380
And I know it's going to take patience but that's okay

217
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:39,607
Good morning / Yeah

218
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,714
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today.

219
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:44,577
That's why I hung it on the door.

220
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:48,274
Oh, sweetie. You can't pull this off.

221
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,370
Amy, you know what?

222
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,816
I was thinking that, um, maybe now would be a good time
for us to sit down

223
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,195
and, uh, you know talk about your future.

224
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,334
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm going to go get my eyebrow shaped

225
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:05,577
I am not happy

226
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,953
Oh, sure you want to eat that?

227
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:14,877
I'm curvy and I like it!

228
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,081
Hi / Hi

229
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:22,816
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

230
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:25,076
I doubt that. Tell her about ours last year.

231
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:27,914
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a 500 dollar watch

232
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:32,687
and he wrote me a rap song.

233
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,920
Seriously?

234
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,753
Word

235
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:38,789
Well, mine was worse than that

236
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,276
Well, what happened?

237
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:44,175
We were at the game and this guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing

238
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,634
Oh, that is so tacky.

239
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:47,227
Well, that's what I said.

240
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:51,852
But it turns out Mike was planning on proposing to me
that same way last night.

241
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:54,235
Oh my God! Mike was going to propose?

242
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:55,136
Phoebe, that's huge

243
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:56,250
Well, do you want to marry him?

244
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,866
Ah, yeah! I really do!

245
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:01,164
Yes but after I dumped on the way
he was going to propose to me

246
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,265
I don't think he's ever going to ask again.

247
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,690
I mean I said no on Barbados and now this?

248
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,584
She's right. If I were a guy and...

249
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:17,510
Did I just say "If I were a guy"?

250
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,327
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you.

251
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,378
Maybe you can propose to him.

252
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,514
Oh, I don't know.

253
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:25,004
I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate?

254
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:28,009
I proposed to Chandler.

255
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:33,125
Alright. Moving on.

256
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:37,244
- Well, I don't think it was desperate. I think it was amazing.
- Thank you

257
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,402
Well, do you think I should propose?

258
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,394
I think it could be kind of great.

259
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:47,221
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling. There's nothing like it!

260
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,436
Okay. okay.

261
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:50,739
So how should I do it?

262
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,334
How about at a game on the big screen?

263
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:57,981
Huh! How about at a foot locker?

264
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:58,872
What?

265
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:02,124
What? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to.

266
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:04,049
Plus, he'd never suspect it.

267
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:05,992
Yeah, that does make sense.

268
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,268
Okay. Now would, would you two like that?

269
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:09,857
Sounds good to me.

270
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:13,544
But what would a guy think?

271
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,612
Uh, nana's on the phone.

272
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:21,452
Well, it's interesting since she died seven years ago

273
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,290
She did?

274
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,007
Who got her condo on Boca?

275
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,907
Hello

276
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,359
It's our nanny

277
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,767
Hi

278
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,285
Oh God. I hope you feel better.

279
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,678
Okay. Bye.

280
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,633
That's Molly. She's sick

281
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:40,695
Can you watch Emma today?

282
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,806
I can't. I have back to back classes.

283
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,191
Did Molly say what she had?

284
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:45,999
Because my throat's been hurting

285
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:49,809
Menstral cramps

286
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:53,426
I don't think that's what this is

287
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:54,927
Can any of you watch Emma?

288
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,348
No, sorry sweetie

289
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,970
No. I've got work and then I'm proposing.

290
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,956
Shoot. What are we going to do?

291
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:04,043
Oh, I can do it

292
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,220
Well, actually.

293
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,837
Can I talk to you for a sec? / Yeah.

294
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:12,294
Um, I do not want her baby- sitting our child

295
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:13,050
Why not?

296
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,276
Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

297
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,934
Ella's a nice name.

298
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:19,502
Fine. We'll call the next one Ella.

299
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,566
What? The next one? / Okay.

300
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,995
I don't want her watching our baby.

301
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:29,229
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person.

302
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:31,265
This is a huge breakthrough for her

303
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:36,086
She just offered to do something for another human being

304
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:37,248
Honey, I, I don't know

305
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:42,462
Ross, I'm telling you. She's giving up
getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, alright?

306
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:47,038
Do you understand how important that is in our world?

307
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:51,200
Ah...Listen. I couldn't help but overhear

308
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,141
cause I was trying to

309
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,321
Listen, let me do this.

310
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:57,698
I really want to help you guys out and, and

311
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:01,751
plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me.

312
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,162
Absolutely

313
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,831
Oh, great

314
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:09,481
So how much does it pay?

315
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,675
Hey, Joe. How's the second draft of the letter coming?

316
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,589
Great. I'm finished

317
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,563
In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency

318
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,027
You dropped it off? / Yeah

319
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,792
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?

320
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,907
No can't do, amigo.

321
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:34,489
No, I didn't use a computer.
I felt more personal to hand- write it.

322
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:36,014
You hand- wrote it?

323
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:40,544
Yeah and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all!

324
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:42,053
See you later

325
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,811
Oh my God! Oh my God!

326
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,999
That letter's going to go in our file.

327
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,946
We're never going to get a kid

328
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:51,130
No, we're going to, we're going to be one of those old couples
that collects orchids or

329
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,842
has a lot of birds.

330
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:55,685
It's okay. It's okay. You know what?

331
00:17:55,685 --> 00:18:00,976
I will just call the agency and tell them
to throw out the letter / Okay. Good

332
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:08,147
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.
Somebody just dropped off a hand- written recommendation letter and

333
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,174
Ah ha.

334
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,953
Ah ha

335
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,062
Okay

336
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:18,241
Thank you. Good bye

337
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,242
Oh, we're screwed, aren't we.

338
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:24,426
You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store

339
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,199
They loved it / What?

340
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:31,212
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child
write the recommendation letter

341
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,184
They thought Joey was a child?

342
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:38,617
She guessed 8, 9 based on his drawings.

343
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,670
Hi.

344
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,212
Hey, what did you guys do today?

345
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,943
Ella wanted to go out.

346
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:47,992
So we went shopping and got some sushi

347
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:51,020
That sounds like fun / Yeah, not really

348
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,255
Babies are dull

349
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:55,381
Hey

350
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:57,255
Hi, how's my girl?

351
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,380
Oh, I'm fine

352
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,580
And I got you a present for letting me stay with you

353
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,606
Ready? / Yup

354
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:09,799
Ta- da

355
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,190
You piereced her ears?

356
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,191
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

357
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:22,093
You pierced her ears?

358
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,193
How could you do this without telling me?

359
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:28,973
Well, if I had told you,
then it wouldn't have been a surprise. Now would it?

360
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,167
I think she looks cute

361
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:34,390
but I am wrong

362
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,268
Oh my God. Oh my God. Here comes Ross.

363
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,071
He is going to flip out

364
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:42,736
Why? Did something happen to his falafel cart?

365
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:43,886
Hi Guys / Hey Ross

366
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,900
Ross / Hi Emma

367
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,268
Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low?

368
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:53,601
- She can barely see
- I don't really want her to see

369
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:55,061
Why, why not?

370
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,528
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world

371
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:58,792
Like war

372
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,785
or that that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

373
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:05,265
It was in a milk carton but it, it looked like meat.

374
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:07,430
Come here, come here. HA!

375
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,629
There she is. Hi

376
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,550
What?

377
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,215
Nothing

378
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,775
Hi

379
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,364
What?

380
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:35,000
Please tell me those are clip- ons.

381
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,887
Oh, they're real

382
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,440
Did she do this to her?

383
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,786
I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her

384
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:44,057
I know. I know and you were right, Ross. Okay?

385
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:47,513
You are so irresponsible.
I am never letting you baby- sit ever again

386
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,748
Hey, you know what? This kid needs me, okay?

387
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,275
She needs to have a cool fun aunt.

388
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:56,100
I'm a cool fun aunt / Okay

389
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:02,965
Hey, Monica can be cool and fun
and organize indoor projects.

390
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:07,077
I can't believe this. All I wanted to do is help you
try to figure out what to do with your life

391
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:08,706
And this is how you repay me?

392
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,250
Well, I don't need you to help me

393
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,305
because I already know what I'm going to do with my life

394
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,945
Oh, yeah? Since when?

395
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:16,273
Since today

396
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:18,479
I am going to be...

397
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:22,473
a baby- stylist

398
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,265
What?

399
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:26,804
That's not a thing!

400
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:28,569
Well, it should be.

401
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:31,514
I'm going to help babies learn how to accesorize,

402
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:33,042
what colors to wear,

403
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,847
what clothes are slimmin'

404
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:36,617
Babies don't care if they're slim!

405
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:39,613
Enter Amy

406
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:42,342
Amy, I just, I just, I just want to....

407
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,911
What? What are you going to do?

408
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:48,999
No more falafel for you!

409
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:01,508
Great game, huh?

410
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:04,138
Uh- huh. Uh- huh

411
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:06,343
Why do you keep looking at the screen?

412
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:09,535
I'm not. I'm praying

413
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:11,754
Please let the Knicks win

414
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:14,942
Thank you, Thor

415
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,623
Where're you, where're you going?

416
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:18,048
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

417
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:21,468
Well, I think you should wait / Why?

418
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:22,928
Well, if you don't, if you don't hold it in,

419
00:22:22,928 --> 00:22:26,620
you don't, you don't get all the nutrients

420
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,815
Knicks fans. Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard

421
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:36,624
Someone has a special question to ask

422
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:41,093
Mike Hanigan, will you marry me?

423
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,795
Get a load of this

424
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,186
She's proposing to him

425
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:49,018
Guess we know who wears the pants in that family

426
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:51,285
That's not very enlightened

427
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:55,487
Hey, hey

428
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:59,722
Boo us? Boo you!

429
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,732
Hello

430
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,516
Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani

431
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,847
Oh, hi.

432
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,873
I'm glad you liked my letter

433
00:23:16,268 --> 00:23:20,982
No, my mommy and daddy aren't home right now

434
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,791
Okay. Bye bye.

435
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,211
She was nice

436
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:31,710
Joey, get Amy's bags. She is moving out!

437
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,056
Oohoo!

438
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:35,363
You're kicking me out?

439
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:38,072
You put holes in my baby's ears.

440
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:41,065
Yeah, well, at least now people will know she's a girl!

441
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:45,857
I can't believe I have even tried to help you!

442
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,653
You are so beyond help

443
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:48,436
You know what?

444
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:51,507
Ever since I've got here, you have been nothing but negative

445
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:52,461
Excuse me?

446
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:56,081
You didn't want me to marry
the old guy with the great apartment

447
00:23:56,081 --> 00:24:01,294
Then I tried to help your daughter de- emphasize her flaws

448
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:03,296
And suddenly I'm the bad guy?

449
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:04,544
Joey, where are those bags?

450
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:08,191
She has a lot of crap!

451
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:08,770
You know what?

452
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,494
When I moved in here, I thought this is going to be so great.

453
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:14,538
Just us sisters back together again like when we were kids

454
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,050
except without that stupid Jill.

455
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,157
Oh, who has gotten fat by the way?

456
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:24,207
Seriously? / Um- hmm

457
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,188
Mom says she gained like 15 pounds

458
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:27,045
Hips or thighs?

459
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:30,672
Ass and face / Oh!

460
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:31,990
Oh my God!

461
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,347
I thought she was on Atkins

462
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:38,344
She was. Carbs found her

463
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:41,337
See?

464
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:42,954
This is what I wanted.

465
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:47,666
Two sisters talking about real stuff

466
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,516
Oh, I can't give you that

467
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,607
You can / Yeah

468
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:55,978
I just, I keep trying to make you a better person

469
00:24:55,978 --> 00:25:00,973
but you're, you're already
a pretty perfect version of what you are

470
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:03,455
Thank you

471
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:07,609
I've got to admit Emma does look cute

472
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,109
Did you just say Emma?

473
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,679
Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

474
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:20,301
That woman at the game didn't know
what she was talking about

475
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:24,403
Mike, obviously you have balls

476
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,228
Please let's just forget the whole thing.

477
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,279
I would love it

478
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,121
Consider it forgotten / Thank you

479
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,952
But just so you know

480
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:38,067
however and whenever you decide to propose,
I promise I'll say yes

481
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:42,486
Whether, whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game or in skywriting

482
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:49,894
or you know like some lame guy in a cheesy movie,
" Hide it in the cake"

483
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:56,572
It's in the cake, isn't it?

484
00:25:56,572 --> 00:26:00,800
Where else would lame Mr. Noballs hide it?

485
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,888
What's the matter with me?

486
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:03,445
Why do I keep ruining this?

487
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,671
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

488
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,889
No, it's my fault

489
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,687
I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and

490
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,438
all I want to do is tell you that I love you

491
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:15,078
and I, I want to spend the rest of my life with you and

492
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:18,991
I'm going to do this now

493
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:21,754
Oh my God!

494
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:26,061
Phoebe, I.../ Wait, wait.

495
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,536
Oh, no.

496
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,406
Great? / Uh- huh

497
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:47,135
Phoebe, I love you

498
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:49,696
There's no one else in the world I would ask to marry me

499
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:53,132
Three times

500
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:55,758
But I want to take care of you,

501
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:58,509
have babies with you

502
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:01,540
and grow old with you

503
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:06,816
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

504
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,976
Yes

505
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,304
I love you

506
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:17,628
I love you more

507
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:19,601
Not possible

508
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:31,874
She's going to be Mrs. Noballs

509
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:44,556
So how's the baby styling business going?

510
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:46,552
Not that great. It's...

511
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:51,550
it's almost as if people don't want to hear
that their babies are ugly

512
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,587
That's shocking

513
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:56,063
Oh, it's Ross

514
00:27:56,063 --> 00:27:59,566
Hey, Ross

515
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:03,691
Hello, Ross

516
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:05,491
He's rude
