{4699}{4781}Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right?
{4782}{4899}And then, she disappears・ But I find out where she lives
{4900}{4986}and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right?
{4987}{5140}And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
{5141}{5202}Ohh-oh, chilling!

{7673}{7750}Great! Problem solved!
{7751}{7875}But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
{7876}{7944}Well, back to square one.
{7945}{8017}Oh, I know a way that you can decide!
{8018}{8098}All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
{8099}{8136}Yes!
{8137}{8208}Good, but wait.
{8209}{8282}Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax.

{10317}{10382}- All right, I'm outta here!|- I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
{10383}{10434}- Hi Rachel! I'm Dr. Miller. |- Hey!

{10684}{10709}Okay.
{10710}{10794}Put your chin here.
{10795}{10843}Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
{10844}{10895}What?!
{10896}{11000}A small puff of air, now come on!
{11012}{11057}- Here we go.|- All right.

{11369}{11397}I'm sorry.
{11398}{11463}Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
{11464}{11516}- That's okay.|- Okay.
{11517}{11602}- Okay. Okay!|- 1・2!
{11603}{11646}I'm sorry.
{11647}{11701}Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
{11702}{11792}Great!!
{11793}{11857}It was very, very nice to meet you sir
{11858}{11925}Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
{11926}{12040}Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye.
{12041}{12094}I want you to take these drops three times a day
{12095}{12120}and you'll be as good as new.
{12121}{12194}Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
{12195}{12260}Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
{12261}{12301}- Great!|- And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
{12302}{12373}Okay, just give me the damn drops!
{12391}{12453}Dr. Miller?
{12454}{12530}P, E, C, F, D
{12531}{12628}Very good Monica!
{12629}{12709}- You know where they are.|- I sure do!
{12780}{12846}And you don't get one!
{12938}{13048}Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
{13049}{13125}- They're still in my coat.|- Damn!
{13126}{13171}- Hey!|- Hey! You ready to go?
{13172}{13215}Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there?
{13216}{13316}Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
{13317}{13337}What?
{13338}{13416}I love you.
{13417}{13489}Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
{13490}{13590}Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
{13591}{13671}Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
{13672}{13726}Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know?
{13727}{13840}So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
{13841}{13923}I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right?
{13924}{13976}I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
{13977}{14004}Oh yeah!
{14005}{14062}For every dollar Shutter Speed makes,
{14063}{14152}one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
{14153}{14224}So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
{14225}{14313}Did you not hear the plot of the movie?
{14314}{14395}"She's been dead for ten years."
{14396}{14469}I'm gonna be a millionaire!
{14470}{14505}- Hey!|- Hey!
{14506}{14553}- I just wanna say good-bye to you guys
{14554}{14633}and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh?
{14634}{14691}Twenty bucks on black 15.
{14692}{14761}- You got it!|- All right!
{14762}{14802}- All right, bye-bye now!|- Bye!
{14803}{14831}- Bye you guys!|- Bye-bye!
{14832}{14896}- I wanna say good-bye at the car!|- Okay!

{14959}{15117}Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
{15118}{15162}See ya!
{15163}{15260}Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!

{17900}{17939}Yeah. Okay.
{17940}{17989}Ross's treat!
{17990}{18032}- Where do you wanna eat?|- I don't know.
{18033}{18099}Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide!
{18100}{18182}All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay?
{18183}{18241}So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
{18242}{18319}Okay!
{18320}{18370}- Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?|- Too dry.

{18798}{18843}I don't believe this!
{18844}{18925}Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.

{18964}{18999}I'm the lead in a movie!
{19000}{19069}They're not even paying ya!
{19070}{19108}This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
{19109}{19145}Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay?
{19146}{19191}I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
{19192}{19256}Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
{19257}{19301}Is that why you're on this trip, huh?
{19302}{19378}Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
{19379}{19446}- Oh, you don't want me on the trip?|- Not if you're gonna be like this!
{19447}{19522}Not if you're gonna be like this!
{19523}{19567}Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
{19568}{19633}All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!

{20121}{20188}Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
{20189}{20242}No.
{20243}{20324}Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
{20325}{20404}No that made me feel precious.
{20405}{20428}Oh, I know!
{20429}{20481}Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?

{20925}{20946}Hey!
{20947}{20991}- Chandler! What are you doing here?|- Hey!

{21047}{21082}Why?!
{21083}{21114}I don't know! He went crazy!
{21115}{21199}Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
{21200}{21311}That game should not be played without my supervision.
{21312}{21351}Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know?
{21352}{21432}All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break,
{21433}{21491}that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him,
{21492}{21539}and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie
{21540}{21607}Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
{21608}{21637}What's in the bag?
{21638}{21759}Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.
{21760}{21797}Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
{21798}{21852}I do!
{21923}{22007}Okay.
{22054}{22080}Not even close.

{24191}{24251}I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened.
{24252}{24286}Y'know he's really upset about it.
{24287}{24442}Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
{24443}{24481}What did you do to his sweater vests?
{24482}{24611}Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.
{24612}{24701}Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
{24702}{24751}Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
{24752}{24797}- Hey, dude!|- Hey Pheebs!
{24798}{24880}Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
{24881}{24995}Oh that's my grandma.
{25008}{25117}And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
{25129}{25171}Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
{25172}{25255}Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering・
{25256}{25343}Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
{25344}{25377}Y'know, he won't even talk to me.
{25378}{25443}How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
{25444}{25484}Well, maybe you should send him something.
{25485}{25544}So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
{25545}{25578}That's a good idea.
{25579}{25682}I wonder where I could get a basket of porn・
{25683}{25740}No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
{25741}{25767}Really?
{25768}{25832}Y'know what you should send him? |A cartoon of cigarettes.
{25833}{25884}'Cause that why he could trade it for protection.
{25885}{25970}No. That's prison.
{26004}{26038}Okay Pheebs,
{26039}{26102}I know how we're going to figure this out.
{26103}{26207}Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
{26208}{26252}- Okay?|- Uh-hmm.
{26253}{26297}What do you like better flora or fauna?
{26298}{26313}Fauna.
{26314}{26360}- Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?|- Garfunkle.
{26361}{26490}- Why are you mad at me?|- You said I was boring--Ohh!
{26491}{26530}When did I say you were boring?!
{26531}{26609}Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
{26610}{26687}Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
{26688}{26778}Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess,
{26779}{26822}you said I was boring,
{26823}{26985}and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!

{28371}{28423}Uh, hang out?! How long?
{28424}{28484}I don't know. A week? Maybe two?
