1
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:08,143
Hmm... This cake is amazing.

2
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,998
My God! Get a room!

3
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:16,243
I would get room with this cake.
I think I can show this cake a good time.

4
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,861
If you had to, what would you give up? Food or sex?

5
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,264
Sex.

6
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:25,621
Seriously, answer faster.

7
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:27,166
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

8
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:32,167
When you said sex, I wasn't thinking about sex with you.

9
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:36,786
It's like a giant hug.

10
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:39,992
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up, sex or food?

11
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:40,847
Food.

12
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:45,993
OK, how about sex or dinosaurs?

13
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:52,063
Oh, my God, it's like Sophie's Choice.

14
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:56,991
What about you, Joe? What would you give up?
Sex or food?

15
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:02,279
Uh... I don't know, it's too hard.

16
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,830
No, you gotta pick one.

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,049
Food.

18
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:07,442
No, sex.

19
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:08,744
Food.

20
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:09,354
Sex.

21
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,461
Food.

22
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:16,474
Sex, I don't know... I want girls on bread!

23
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:22,474
Friends*1010 Chandler Gets Caught
<English Subtitle: Öì³¤Õ÷ cz_z@sina.com>

24
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:58,446
- Ok, you gotta see the latest pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute!

25
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:02,517
- She looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no no, that is a doll.

26
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:06,935
Oh, thank God, 'cause I think that is really creepy.

27
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:10,116
Look, there is Chandler.

28
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh, who is the blonde, she is pretty.

29
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:15,160
He is having an affair.

30
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:16,564
He is not having an affair!

31
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,108
You know I'm always right about these things

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,020
No, you are not.

33
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:22,838
Last week, you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

34
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:28,859
Well, I'm sorry, but it's hard to believe that
anyone who tell a story that dull just to tell it.

35
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,889
I swear, there's something going on with them.

36
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,697
Look, he is getting into the car with her.

37
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:36,600
That doesn't mean anything.

38
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:39,446
Oh, yeah? well, let's see.

39
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:46,478
OK, duck down.

40
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,730
Hello.

41
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:51,550
Oh, hi, Chandler. It's Pheobe.
I know Monica is working today,

42
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:55,951
so I was wondering if you want to
come to the movie with me and Rachel.

43
00:02:56,064 --> 00:03:01,564
Oh, I have to work too.
Yeah, I am stuck here at the office all day.

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,140
Well, it's a shame that you miss the movie
'cause you're gonna see... You know,

45
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:16,861
either Liar Liar or Betreyal or An Affair To Remember.

46
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:20,448
Those are really old.

47
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:23,586
OK, then maybe it'll be...

48
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,089
"Do Towards My Car"

49
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,729
What?

50
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:30,035
They are in the car.

51
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:34,064
OK, talk to you later, OK, bye.

52
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,910
OK, quick, we gotta find a cab and follow them.

53
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:42,198
Oh, yeah, OK, let me just grab
my night vision gargos and my stun gun.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,900
I got them.

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Hey.

56
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,023
Hey sweety.

57
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:54,265
You smell like perfume and cigrettes.

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,370
I was in the car with Nancy all day.

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,280
Nancy doesn't smoke.

60
00:03:57,282 --> 00:04:00,982
Well, at least perfume is not mine,
you'll be thankful for that.

61
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,608
So. What did you think the house?

62
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,259
It's perfect, it's everything we've been looking for.

63
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:12,365
Isn't it? And what about the amazing wings coating,
and crown molding and doormal window and attic?

64
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,657
And wiggal worms and zip zops?

65
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,807
What were the things you said?

66
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,192
Do you love the huge yard?

67
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,860
And fireplace in the bedroom.

68
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:27,863
And Nancy said it's really under-price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!

69
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,926
Well, this is bringing out a lovely color in you.

70
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:35,734
- Do you think we should get it?
- I don't know, what do you think?

71
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,702
- I think we should.
- I do too.

72
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:38,836
- This is huge!
- I know.

73
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,287
How about you want to smoke right now?

74
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:44,514
I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigrette?

75
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:49,311
By the way, Pheobe called just as I was getting in Nancy's car, so if she ask you, I was at work all day.

76
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:50,274
Gotcha.

77
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,585
When do we tell them about this?

78
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,249
We don't, not untill to 100%.
I mean why upset everybody over nothing?

79
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,849
OK, right.

80
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,537
Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.

81
00:04:58,537 --> 00:04:59,965
I know.

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,626
Good luck with it.

83
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,857
I just can't see Chandler cheating.

84
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:10,416
I'm telling you guys,
we followed them out to a house in west Chester.

85
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:15,417
They were in for like 45 minutes
and they came out looking pretty happy.

86
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:21,975
Chandler? 45 minutes?

87
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,275
Something is not right!

88
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,374
I can't believe he'll do this to Monica.

89
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,735
I know, and with the baby coming?

90
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:30,560
So should we tell her?

91
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,705
I don't know.

92
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,361
Pheobe, if one of us saw Mike was with another woman,
would you want us to tell you?

93
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:39,395
Why? Who do you see him with?

94
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:40,464
No, I'm just saying.

95
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,000
Tell me what you know.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,155
No, Nothing! He is great guy, it was hypothotical.

97
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:49,157
All right.

98
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:52,000
He is a good guy, you're right. He wouldn't cheat.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,190
She wouldn't believe me,
if I did see him with someone, there's no way...

100
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:59,192
Who did you see him with?

101
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Oh look at her, so happy.

102
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:23,107
if only there's smaller one to clean this one.

103
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,681
Hey. Is Chandler here?

104
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:31,097
No, he is picking up dinner. What's up?

105
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,870
Whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.

106
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,228
All right.

107
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,830
We think Chandler might be having an affair.

108
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,105
What?

109
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:48,460
Pheobe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street

110
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,272
and then we followed them to a house in west Chester.

111
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:56,274
They went in together. So sorry.

112
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,183
Oh my God.

113
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:03,065
Oh my God, that's awful.

114
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:09,250
What did you think of the house?

115
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,237
What?

116
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,110
Monica, you understand what I was saying, right?

117
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,460
Yeah, sure.

118
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:19,232
Devastated, obviously.

119
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:24,000
Did you think the neighbourhood was homey?

120
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,902
Hey.

121
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,130
You son of a bitch!

122
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:32,906
Is it me or greeting's gone down hill around here.

123
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,171
Pheobe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today.

124
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:38,520
They think you were having an affair.

125
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:39,381
Who is Nancy?

126
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:42,245
What's going on?

127
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:43,848
OK.

128
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:48,345
Guys, you'd better sit down. This is pretty big.

129
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:53,871
I'm not having an affair.

130
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,500
Nancy is our realtor.

131
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,510
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes.

132
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,040
Why do you have a realtor?

133
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:10,722
She has been showing us houses out side of the city.

134
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,352
What?

135
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:13,856
Are you serious?

136
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,041
We found out that we're gonna get this baby.

137
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:20,343
Chandler and I sort of talking, and we decided
that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.

138
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,632
So you are gonna move?

139
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,637
Oh my God!

140
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:29,394
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

141
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:31,730
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?

142
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,271
I am doing it.

143
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:34,277
Ross is doing it.

144
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:37,440
Sara Jessica Parker is doing it.

145
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:38,942
That's great for you guys.

146
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:43,640
But we want a long and a swing set
and street where kids can ride their bikes

147
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,722
and maybe an icecream truck can go by.

148
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:50,290
So you want to buy a house in the 50s.

149
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:54,380
We thought about you were giving up.
You can't move out the city.

150
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:57,520
What if you want Chinese food at 5:00am?

151
00:08:57,521 --> 00:09:00,280
Or a fake Rollex that breaks as soon as it rings,

152
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:04,470
or an Asian hooker sent right to your door.

153
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:07,971
You know what,
if you wanna look for your house, that's ok.

154
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,300
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.

155
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,810
It's ok, because I've to get it at their system.

156
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:22,644
OK, you are gonna realize
this is the only place you wanna be.

157
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:27,844
Actually, we already found a house we love.

158
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,134
What?

159
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:35,003
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.

160
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:43,969
Bet you wish I was having an affair now.

161
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,851
You put an offer on a house?

162
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,000
It's so sweet.

163
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:55,984
It really is, it has this big yard that
leads down to the stream and there are old maple trees...

164
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:59,700
Well again, with the nature. What are you, beavers?

165
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:02,380
I know this is really hard and we are really sorry.

166
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:10,388
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat you food, I can stop doing that, I really really think I can.

167
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,180
You know that's not the reason, Joe.

168
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:24,662
I think if you saw it, you'll understand.
You guys were there, it's beautiful, isn't it?

169
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,048
Yeah, it is.

170
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:29,560
What the hell you are doing?

171
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:38,883
Well, it is, all right. When we were out there today, all I was thinking was I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but man! It's such a nice place to live.

172
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,067
Yeah, but so is this.

173
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:44,204
Yeah, I mean if you move there you have to leave here.

174
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,208
How can you leave this place?

175
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,367
Come on Daddy, listen to me.

176
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:54,890
It's like all of my life, everyone has always told me,

177
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:58,693
'You're a shoe! You're a shoe,
you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'

178
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:01,440
And today I just stopped and I said,
What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

179
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:06,797
What if I wanna be a... a purse, y'know?
Or a... or a hat!

180
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,450
No, I don't want you buy me a hat.
I'm saying I am a ha... It's a metaphor, Daddy!

181
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:18,710
You can see where he'd have trouble.

182
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:24,513
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

183
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:29,087
Well, I guess we've established
she's staying here with Monica.

184
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:32,932
- Your money's mine, Green.
- Your fly is open, Geller.

185
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:36,060
You guys, you know what I just realized?

186
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:42,562
'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J'. Coincidence?

187
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:48,527
Hey, that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!

188
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:56,017
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

189
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,549
That had to hurt!

190
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,300
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving, too.

191
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,500
Y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.

192
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,680
We will.

193
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:17,066
Okay, Rachel, you wanna
put the marshmellows in concentric circles.

194
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,070
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles.
I want to do this.

195
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:36,747
Every year!

196
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:39,480
It's stuck!!!

197
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,645
Easy. Step. How did it get on?

198
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,740
I put it on to scare Chandler!

199
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:49,322
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out.

200
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:51,425
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

201
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:57,753
Well, of course it smells bad.
You have your head inside a turkey's ass.

202
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:07,328
Hey, did you get the turkey basted...
Oh my God! Oh my God!

203
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,838
Who is that?

204
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:11,176
It's Joey.

205
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,980
I got it! How about, if we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.

206
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,887
Oooohh, that's interesting.

207
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,260
If you win, we give up the birds.

208
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:30,267
But if we win, we get your apartment.

209
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,920
Deal!

210
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,926
What was Monica's nickname
when she was a field hockey goalie?

211
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:38,745
Big fat goalie.

212
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:43,481
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...

213
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:44,176
Dangerous Liaisons.

214
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:46,473
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...

215
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,889
- Weekend at Bernie's.
- Correct.

216
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,080
All right, Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?

217
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:54,681
Everyday use.

218
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:55,545
Fancy.

219
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:56,480
Guest.

220
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,209
Fancy guest.

221
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,360
Two seconds.

222
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:00,363
Uhh, 11!

223
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:04,922
11, unbelievable 11 is correct.

224
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:07,441
Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?

225
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:08,042
14?

226
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,886
- No, 19.
- Thanks man.

227
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:14,188
Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend.
His name was?

228
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,349
Maurice.

229
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,124
Correct, his profession was?

230
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,934
- Space cowboy!
- Correct!

231
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,729
What is Chandler Bing's job?

232
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:29,070
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.

233
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:31,154
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding...

234
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:35,430
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce...transpondster!

235
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:38,926
That's not even a word!

236
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,100
I can get this! I can get this!

237
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,910
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

238
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:51,564
Y'know what, you are mean boys,
who are just being mean!

239
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,802
Hey, don't get mad at us!
No one forced you to raise the stakes!

240
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:57,672
That is not true. She did! She forced me!

241
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:00,458
Hey, we would still be living here
if hadn't gotten the question wrong!

242
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,464
Well it's stupid, unfair question!

243
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:04,865
Don't blame the questions!

244
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:10,069
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us!

245
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,361
Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window!

246
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:22,081
I saw what you were doing to my sister!
Now get out here!

247
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,200
Wow! Listen, we had a good run.

248
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,741
Four? Five months?

249
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:32,404
I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime!
So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!

250
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,779
Hey Ross. What's up, bro?

251
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,072
What the hell are you doing?!!

252
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,090
Hey, what's-what's going on?!

253
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:47,130
Well, I think, I think
Ross knows about me and Monica.

254
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:51,732
Dude! He's right there!

255
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:55,304
I thought you were my best friend,
this is my sister!

256
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:58,404
My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!

257
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,920
Look, we're not just messing around!

258
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:05,511
I love her. Okay? I'm in love with her.

259
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,570
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.

260
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:13,577
I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.

261
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:24,216
My best friend and my sister!

262
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,820
I cannot believe this.

263
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,401
Well, this is the last box of your clothes.

264
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:34,782
I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"

265
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:40,787
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall
and write that on Chandler.

266
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,152
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse,
but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.

267
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,020
What?!

268
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,235
You're just so mean to each other!

269
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:53,377
And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel.
I still like you!

270
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,940
Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving.

271
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,330
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe, you gotta take her!

272
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:01,600
Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her.

273
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,980
But y'know Rachel has some good qualities
that make her a good roommate.

274
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:10,288
She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down
the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.

275
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:12,814
What else?

276
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:17,395
When I take a shower,
she leaves me little notes on the mirror.

277
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:20,186
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.

278
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:25,888
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.

279
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:32,755
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading,
she covers me over with a blanket.

280
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:37,679
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.

281
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:46,809
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in
with Chandler, she was really supportive.

282
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:54,664
You were so great. You made it so easy.

283
00:17:55,496 --> 00:18:02,496
And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!

284
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,662
She really left.

285
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:22,430
I know.

286
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,821
Thank you.

287
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:27,125
No problem, roomie.

288
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:34,960
Can I ask you a question?

289
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,204
Sure!

290
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,730
What the hell is that dog doing here?!

291
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,164
Little toast here.

292
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:46,133
I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving
that all of you all planned,

293
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:49,862
but for me, this has been really great.

294
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:56,162
You know, I think because it didn't involve
divorce or projectile vomiting.

295
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,882
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean,
if you'd gone to Vail,

296
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:07,441
and if you guys'd been with your family,
if you didn't have syphilis and stuff,

297
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,267
we wouldn't be all together, you know?

298
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:18,269
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that
I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

299
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:23,593
That's so sweet.

300
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:31,765
- And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
- And a crappy New Year.

301
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,184
You can't move, you just, you just can't.

302
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:41,522
Rachel is right. This is where you guys belong.

303
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:46,823
Yeah, you are not well with west chester.
That's like the worst of chesters.

304
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,733
You know, sometimes when I am alone in my apartment,
I look over here,

305
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:55,737
and you guys are just having dinner or watching TV
or something that...

306
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,585
makes me feel better.

307
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,090
And now when I look over, whom I'm gonna see, the...

308
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,930
They don't make me feel so good.

309
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:11,083
Yeah, so don't move.

310
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:16,962
OK, just stay here. And maybe close your blinds at night.

311
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,940
Hello.

312
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:28,842
It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.

313
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,249
And?

314
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:36,768
OK, thanks.

315
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,401
They passed.

316
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,760
They said they wouldn't go a penny
under the asking price.

317
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,089
- We can't afford that.
- I know.

318
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:51,976
Well, there you go.

319
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,132
Really sorry, guys.

320
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,233
I am sorry, too.

321
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:03,968
I mean I would be more sorry if that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.

322
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,011
Yeah, we are gonna let you be alone.

323
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,220
You're gonna be ok?

324
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:10,621
- Yeah, we'll be OK.
- I love you guys.

325
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,862
You know I am sorry I wasn't so supportive before.

326
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,050
That's ok, we understand.

327
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:25,755
And about this Nancy,
if you are not sleeping with her, should I?

328
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:30,304
I know there will be other houses, but it's just so...

329
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,032
I love that one so much.

330
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:37,508
Yeah. That's a good thing we got that, then.

331
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,480
What?

332
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:40,786
We got the house.

333
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:42,216
Oh, my God!

334
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,281
- I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
- Oh my God, my God, we got the house.

335
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:51,840
We are getting the house.

336
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,920
We are getting the house.

337
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,595
And a baby.

338
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:57,388
We are growing up.

339
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,860
We sure are.

340
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:01,166
So who's gonna tell them?

341
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:06,167
- Nod it!
- Damn it!

342
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:15,048
Rachel, this is yours.

343
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:17,424
- What are these for?
- You'll see.

344
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,380
OK, everybody opens them.

345
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:24,367
This is so beautiful.

346
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:27,484
- These are ones I was looking at them at the store.
- I know.

347
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:29,248
I love this.

348
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,400
Wooh, a meatball sub.

349
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,217
Thanks.

350
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,956
Seriously you guys,
what's going on? what are these for?

351
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:39,363
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before. But...

352
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:40,289
We got the house.

353
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,292
Enjoy!

354
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:51,462
What did they say?
