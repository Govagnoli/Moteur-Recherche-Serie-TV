00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,200
Hi!

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
- Hey!
- You come back!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,300
How is the honeymoon?

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,100
Oh, incredible!

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,500
Oh, champagne, candle at dinner and
moonlight walks on the beach, so romantic!

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
So, where's Mike?

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,500
Oh, he's at the doctor's,
he didn't poop the whole time we were there.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,400
Well, anyway, I'm glad you're back.
I really need your help.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,300
Oh, why? What's up?

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,900
Well, I have an audition for this play and
for some of them would have to speak French,

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,500
which according to my resume, I'm fluent in.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,900
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, you really shouldn't!

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
BTW, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,400
It was ok.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I did not know you spoke French.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,300
Oh, you're so sexy.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,400
Well, so will you help me?
I really wanna be in this play.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Sure.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,900
Seriously, stop or I'm gonna jump on you.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,100

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,583
"So no one told you life was gonna be this way"

23
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:17,124
"Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's DOA."

24
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:21,326
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear"

25
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:26,472
"When it hasn't been your day, your week,
your month, or even your year"

26
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:36,369
"but I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)"

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Hey. Why are you wearing my apron?

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,700
I'm making cookies for Erica.

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Oh, btw, we have to leave for the airport soon.
Her plane comes in ahout an hour.

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:58,400
Oh hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child?

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
No?

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Divorce?

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Hey. Do you guys know where Rachel is?

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,900
Unbelievable! She was supposed to meet me
half an hour ago with Emma.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
Hey!

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,700
These are for Erica!

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,300
Well, is she gonna eat all those cookies?

39
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,300
I want the baby to come out all cute and fat.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,100
So why is Erica coming to visit you?

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Because we want to get to know her better and...

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,300
she's never been to NY, so she wants to see all the tourist spots, you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...

43
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,700
Oh, those places. There's always so many people there
being crowd like cattle,

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,700
and, you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Moo".

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,100
Oh hi, thanks for showing up 30 minutes late!

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,500
- Ross...
- No no, I'm sure you have a great excuse.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,000
What, was it a hair appointment?
A mani-pedi or is there a sale at Barney's?

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,100
My father had a heart attack... while I was at Barney's.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,800
- Oh my god.
- Honey. I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,100
Is he ok?

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine.
But he's still having sedated.

53
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,800
Ok, I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you,
I mean, you can't be alone right now.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
No, come on, I'm totally ok.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,500
I don't need you to come.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I can totally handle this on my own.

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,300
Still, still, let me come... for me.

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Ok, if you really need to.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
I bet someone could use one of
Monica's freshly baked cookies.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,500
Oh, I really could.

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
Alright, this seems pretty simple.

62
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,100
Your first line is "My name is Claude."
So, just repeat after me.

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,200
Well, so let's try it again.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,000
Huh, it's not... quite what I'm saying.

65
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,100
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
It does? Really?

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,100
Alright, let's just try it again.

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,500
- Really listen.
- Got it.

69
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Hey, you guys!

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,700
I want you to meet someone really special.

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,400
Phoebe, this is Erica, and this is the baby.

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Joey, Erica, Baby.

73
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,200
Everyone! Erica, Baby.

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Monica, calm, self.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,100
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

76
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,900
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,900
Well, welcome to NYC, or should I say ...

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Why would you say that?

79
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,900
Ok, what are you gonna be doing today?

80
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,800
Oh, I want to see everything.
Time Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,300
Oh, you know what you should do, you should walk
all the way to the top of Statue of Liberty.

82
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,400
- Oh yeah, let's do that!
- Great.

83
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,800
This baby better be really good.

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,700
Hi, excuse me. I'm here to see my father.
My name is Rachel Green.

85
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,900
And I'm Dr Ross Galler.

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Ross, please. This is a hospital, ok?
That actually means sth here.

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,800
- So, can we plase go in?
- Absolutely.

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because...

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,900
my throat is feeling a little scratchy,
I don't wanna infect him.

90
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
I am not scared of him, I'm really sick.

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
He's still under sedation, so he's pretty much out.

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm feeling better.

94
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh, my god.

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,300
Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone
if you'd like to speak to him.

97
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Oh, great. Uh, are you gonna be ok?

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,500
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine.

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,700
Did the TV wake you?

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,600
No, when you put your feet up on my bed,
you tucked on my cathode.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,100
Ouchy.

102
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you doing here, Galler?

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, I came with Rachel
who should be back any second.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
So what's new?

105
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Ooh, I had a little heart attack.

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,300
Great, is it painful?

107
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,300
What? A heart attack is sitting here talking to you.

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,900
Let's see if we can get Rachel back in here.

109
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,800
So what's new with you, huh?
Knocked up any more of my daughters laterly?

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,400
Nope! Just the one. Rach!

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Noo!

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,100
Ok, maybe if we just break it down.

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,800
Ok, let's just try one syllable at a time.
Ok, so repeat after me.

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,400
Great, ok, faster.

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,500
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!

116
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,200
What are you doing?

117
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,500
I have to go before pull your head through a wall!

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,300
No, no! Don't go, I need you. My audition is tomorrow!

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey. I was gonna make some dinner but all I found
in your dad's frige was bacon and heavy cream.

120
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
I think we solve the mystery of heart attack.

121
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
Did you call your parents?

122
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
- Oh, yeah, Emma is doing great.
- Oh, good.

123
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
Wow.

124
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,300
What?

125
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,100
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.

126
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,700
What do you mean? You have been in my room before.

127
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Yeah, sure, right.

128
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,800
Like I have ever been in Rachel Green's room.

129
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,700
Ok, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.

130
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Sorry.

131
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,100
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,600
'Yeah' to a rough day, huh?

133
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,700
I mean, he's a doctor,
you don't expect doctors to get sick.

135
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,900
But we do.

136
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,500
You know, he's gonna be ok, Rach.

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Oh, I don't want him to wake up alone,
I should go to the hospital.

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,500
What? No, no, wait. Hey hey, look.

139
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,400
They gave him a lot medication, ok,
he wouldn't even know if you were there.

140
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,000
Look, we'll go and see him
the first thing in the morning, ok?

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,200
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No, God. Hey.

142
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,700
Rach, you've been an amazing doughter, ok?

143
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Right now, you just need to get some rest.

144
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,300
Ok, maybe you're right.

145
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,600
Good night.

146
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,300
Wait, wait.

147
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Would you stay here with me for a while?

148
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,200
Sure.

149
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
Thank you for coming with me today.

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,700
Oh, of course.

151
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,700
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.

152
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,000
Me, too. Come here.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,500
I just don't want to be alone tonight.

154
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Ok, well, I can, maybe grab a sleeping bag or...

155
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,300
No, Rach!

156
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,900
I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea.

157
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,200
We won't know that until we do it, will we?

158
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,300
No, uh look, uhm...

159
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,700
You are upset about your father
and you're feeling vulnerable.

160
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,900
And I just don't feel it will be right
if I'd like be, you know, taking advantage of you.

161
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,900
What taking advantage?
I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!

162
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Ok, I'm sure it would be great but...

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,900
I think one of us has to be thinking clearly,
so I'm gonna go.

164
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll see you in the morning.

165
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Haven't had sex in 4 months,
I should get a medal for that!

166
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,700
Thanks so much for taking me to all these places,
I had a great time.

167
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,500
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize
about Chandler, though.

168
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,400
I just did not see this coming.

169
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,100
NY is awesome!

170
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,800
What is with you?

171
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
You know, I've been to these before
but I've never really seen them, you know?

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Yeah, you missed a lot when you were mooing.

173
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,300
Thanks so much for showing me around.

174
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,200
Oh, it was our pleasure.
We're so much enjoying getting to know you.

175
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Well, is there anything else you want to know?

176
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Oh, uh, ok.

177
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,700
Do you mind if I ask you some questions
about the father?

178
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,900
Oh, sure, yeah.

179
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,200
Well, he was my high school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
And he got a scholarship, went off to college.

181
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,500
That's great.

182
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

183
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
How is that now?

184
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Well, there is a chance it's another guy.

185
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,900
I mean, I've only ever been with 2 guys
but they sorta overlapped.

186
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,500
So, what does the other guy do?
Does he go to the college, too?

187
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,200
No, he's in prison.

188
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Uh, was he falsely accused of sth?

189
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,300
No. He killed his father with a shovel.

190
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,500
But other than that he's a great guy.

191
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

192
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,100
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

193
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,100
As so from now on I'm always awake.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Alright, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.

195
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer.

196
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Alright, alright, let's say it is him.

197
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,600
Would we not want baby? No.
Would we treat him any differently?

198
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,900
I'll keep an eye on him.

199
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,300
- We have to find out which one the father is.
- How?

200
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't know, there're tests for these things, right?

201
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting.

202
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Easy for you to say. He's a father killer.

203
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,600
He probably loves his mommy.

204
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,600
He's probably got a tattoo says "Mom"
on the shovel wielding arm.

205
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
"We'll now count from 1 to 5: ....."

206
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,200
- "Good job!"
- Thank you.

207
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey, Joey.

208
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,000
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday
and I thought it about a lot know I was too inpatient.

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
So let's try it again.

210
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,900
Oh no, that's ok. I don't need your help.
I work it out on myself and I gotta say I'm pretty good.

211
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,900
Really? Can I hear some of them?

212
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,100
Sure, sure.

213
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Ok.

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,000
See?

215
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Alright, you're not, you're not...

216
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!

217
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,600
Oh, well I think I am, yeah.
And I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.

218
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,900
How could you possibly think that?

219
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,700
For one thing, the guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!

220
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,000
Hi, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?

221
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,000
Sure.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,500
You've been quiet all morning, is everything ok?

223
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,200
- You sure you are alright.
- Yep.

224
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Ookay. Uhm, well I'm gonna go grab some breakfast.

225
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,700
- FYI...
- There it is.

226
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,800
In the future, when a girl asks for
some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.

227
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,500
Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?

228
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,500
I was just trying to do the right thing.

229
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,100
Really? Well it seems to me if you've done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed,

230
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.

231
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,500
- Well...
- Oh, stop that!

232
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
I can't believe this. What do you...

233
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
I was just being a good guy.

234
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,800
I treated you with respect and understanding.

235
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,700
Ahh, that is so hot.

236
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,600
Hey, I was looking out for you.

237
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh, really? Well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl,
I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.

238
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,000
I gotta say I have not had sex a lot times before,
this is the worst ever.

239
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,700
Oh really, really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me, either.

240
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,900
Oh, ok, you know, hey hey! You know what?

241
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,600
To avoid this little thing in the future,
let's just say you and me, never having sex again.

242
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,300
What?

243
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,600
That's right, sex is off the table!
I'm never having sex with you again.

244
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Dr Green, are you feeling better?

245
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Hey, how was lunch?

246
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,100
We had a good time.

247
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,700
BTW, I want to ask you sth.

248
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,600
It would really mean a lot to me.

249
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,600
If the baby is a boy, would you
name him after my father Jiminy Billy Bob?

250
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Oh, really?

251
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Noo. You were right, that was fun.

252
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm gonna go finish packing.

253
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,900
So, is she gonna take the test?

254
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,600
No, she doesn't have to.
I found out who the father is.

255
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,100
Oh, God, it's Shovelly Joe, isn't it?

256
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,800
No, it's not.

257
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,000
How do you know?

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Well, it turns out that
Erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class.

259
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,600
Because the thing she did with the prison guy
would be pretty hard to make a baby that way.

260
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, God. What was it? The thing
we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?

261
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,300
The thing we never do.

262
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Shovelly Joe.

263
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,500
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right.

264
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm sorry, what's going on?

265
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Dude, come on. French it up.

266
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Joey, do you speak French?

267
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,500
You know what, I think this audition is over.

268
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,100
Uh, excuse me?

269
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Uh, I am Ugeon Phillogne.

270
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:09,900
I was passing by when I heard this man speaking
the regional dialect of my French town of Estelloude.

271
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
You really think this man is speaking French.

272
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Good job, little buddy.

273
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,900
That was some really good French.

274
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,700
But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.

275
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,600
Oh, alright. But my French was good?

276
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,100
It was great.

277
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,800
Merci.

278
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,200
- Emmas's down for the night.
- Oh, good.

279
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,200
So, I guess I'm gonna takeoff.

280
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,800
Hey, listen, just before you go, I...

281
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,300
Again I just wanna say 'thank you' for coming with me.

282
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Oh, no problem.

283
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,300
And also, you know I...
I was thinking about what you said,

284
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,100
uh, you know, about the whole sex thing and...

285
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,800
Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.

286
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

287
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,900
It's shame though, I mean, when we did it,
it was pretty good.

288
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

289
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Hey, do you remember that one really great time?

290
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,800
Oh, yeah.

291
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,800
- You know, it was your birthday...
- It was Valentine's day...

292
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Well, I guess that's all the past now.

294
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Uh-huh.

295
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,100
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.

296
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,400
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it REALLY bad.

297
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,800
That's what WE decided.

298
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Right.

299
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
- It's kinda hard, though.
- Yeah.

300
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,300
You know? When two people have a connection,
you know, that's...

301
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,500
just seems like... such a waste.

302
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,900
I hate waste.

303
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,700
- Ross...
- Yes.

304
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,600
Just so you know,

305
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,500
with us, it's never off the table.

306
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Dammit, it's never off the table.

307
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,000

308
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Ok, can you really tap dance?

309
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,500
No.

310
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,700
Off the resume.

311
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,100
- Archery?
- No.

312
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,100
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.

313
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,200
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

314
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,400
That I can do.

315
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Come on, you can drink a GALLON of milk
in 10 seconds?

316
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Alright, watch me!

317
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,100
Ok, your time, are you ready?

318
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Ready, go!

319
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,100
You did it!
