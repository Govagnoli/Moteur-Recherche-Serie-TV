00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:07,569
Hi. So l'm doing the <i>Soap Opera Digest</i>
crossword puzzle. . .

2
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:11,368
. . .and guess who is the clue
for three down?

3
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:15,009
<i>''Days of Our Lives</i> star,
blank Tribbiani. ''

4
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:18,011
That's me! l'm blank!

5
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:22,447
How cool! We know three down!
l'm touching three down.

6
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:24,245
Yeah, you are, baby.

7
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:28,207
Three down knows l'm married.
What's three down doing?

8
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,927
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

9
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:34,648
No. They wanted to do
a profile on me. l said no.

10
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:36,206
Why'd you say no?

11
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,927
Remember the last interview l did?

12
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,409
l said l write my own lines,
the writers got mad. . .

13
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:47,129
. . .and l fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what l'd say now?

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:51,804
lf only there was something
in your head to control what you say.

15
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,971
Come on, you'll keep it
in check this time.

16
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:59,371
The publicity would be good for you.
You deserve that.

17
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:04,886
ln the interview, you could mention,
l don't know, ''gal pal Rachel Green. ''

18
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:09,052
ls that ''gal pal'' spelled L-O-S-E-R?

19
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:14,608
-Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
-Fine, all right, l'll do it.

20
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:18,806
You have to be there to stop me
if l say something stupid.

21
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:23,689
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

22
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:27,963
We'll be there the whole time.
Just remember:

23
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:31,290
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

24
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:37,684
l'm gonna be in <i>Soap Opera Digest</i>!
And not just in the dumb crossword.

25
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:40,009
Seriously, proud of you.

26
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:42,564
The One With Joey's lnterview

27
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:24,003
-Thanks for taking the time for this.
-Not at all. Happy to do it.

28
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,683
You think we're being obvious?

29
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:31,967
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

30
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,243
lt's great that we met here.

31
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:40,210
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.

32
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,043
Actually, l didn't know
the magazine was paying.

33
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:48,929
Wouldn't have mattered. l do this
for the fans, not the free food.

34
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,522
-Can l get you anything?
-Coffee.

35
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,611
And l'll have all the muffins.

36
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,647
-Hey.
-We're not talking.

37
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,048
Oh, finally.

38
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:07,971
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.

39
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:11,404
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

40
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:16,604
<i>All you want is a dingle</i>

41
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:19,646
<i>What you envy's a shwang</i>

42
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:23,010
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

43
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:26,091
<i>Or play with, or simply let hang</i>

44
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,404
<i>This ever happen?</i>
<i>You want a glass of milk...</i>

45
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:46,685
<i>...but these darn cartons</i>
<i>are so hard to open!</i>

46
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,690
<i>Boy, you said it, Mike.</i>

47
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:54,682
<i>-There's gotta be a better way!</i>
<i>-There is, Kevin!</i>

48
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:59,045
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>he's ever used this. It's easy.</i>

49
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,850
<i>-This works in any milk carton.</i>
<i>-It is easy.</i>

50
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,409
<i>Now I can have milk every day.</i>

51
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,369
So this is it, Victor?

52
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:14,325
Yeah, l guess it is. And so. . .

53
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,169
. . .l'm gonna get on this spaceship. . .

54
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:30,008
. . .and l'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

55
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:36,528
But when l return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

56
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,201
But l won't have aged at all.

57
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:47,042
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

58
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:51,044
Because, Adrian. . .

59
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,011
. . .baby. . .

60
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,887
. . .l'm gonna want to meet her.

61
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:07,849
Here l come.
l'm coming to fix the copier.

62
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:12,410
l can't get to the copier.
l'm thinking, ''What do l do?''

63
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:18,572
So l just watch them have sex.
And then l say-- Wait, here's my line:

64
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:21,924
<i>You know, that's bad</i>
<i>for the paper tray.</i>

65
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,849
-Nice work, my friend.
-Wait, you see me again.

66
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:30,011
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

67
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:33,205
There l am. There l am. There l am.

68
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:37,967
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.

69
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:41,173
l'm getting coffee. Want anything?

70
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:45,412
-A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
-Double latte.

71
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:49,003
-A bagel with only--
-l was just being polite.

72
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:55,083
How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?

73
00:05:56,733 --> 00:06:01,488
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.

74
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:05,003
Get out of the way, jackass!

75
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:09,208
Who names their boat
<i>Coast Guard</i>, anyway?

76
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,370
That is the Coast Guard.

77
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:17,010
What are they doing out here?
The coast is way over there!

78
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,530
This is unbelievable.

79
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:24,409
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

80
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:30,971
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

81
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:39,923
Well, l see you've had
a very productive day.

82
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,092
-lsn't the cowboy hat a little much?
-Come on, it's fun!

83
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,844
All right.

84
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,209
lsn't this a woman's hat?

85
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:00,803
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

86
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:04,412
We have to turn off the porn.

87
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,607
l think you're right.

88
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,565
-All right, ready?
-One.

89
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:13,412
-Two, three.
-Three.

90
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,084
That's kind of nice.

91
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,523
-lt's kind of a relief.
-Yeah.

92
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,925
-You wanna see if we still have it?
-Yeah.

93
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,213
Free porn! We have free porn here!

94
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,605
ln my spare time, l read to the blind.

95
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:41,010
And l'm also a mento for kids.

96
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:45,044
-A mento?
-You know, a mento. A role model.

97
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,804
-A mento?
-Right.

98
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:53,403
-Like the candy?
-As a matter of fact, l do.

99
00:07:55,653 --> 00:08:01,205
Our readers always want to know how
soap stars stay in such great shape.

100
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,722
Do you have a fitness regime?

101
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:08,529
We stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

102
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:13,291
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?

103
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,687
Are you serious?

104
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:19,842
l realized it a half-hour ago,
but l didn't want to jinx it.

105
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:23,489
-Wow, we are pretty good at this.
-Yeah.

106
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,412
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

107
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:29,969
That's the first time
l've ever missed a meal.

108
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:33,006
My pants are a little loose.

109
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,890
What's wrong with you?

110
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:40,883
l got this blinding pain in my stomach
when l was lifting weights.

111
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:43,687
And then l passed out.

112
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:48,842
l haven't been able to stand up since.
But l don't think it's serious.

113
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,851
Sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

114
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,247
No way!

115
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:58,846
lf l go to the doctor, it's for this
thing sticking out of my stomach!

116
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:04,005
Why'd l have to start
working out again?

117
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:06,727
Damn you, fifteens!

118
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,766
-What is it?
-A trifle. lt has layers.

119
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:13,204
A layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

120
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:16,530
Then custard,
which l made from scratch.

121
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:21,329
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sautéed with peas and onions.

122
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,331
Then a little bit more custard.

123
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,322
lt tastes like feet.

124
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,448
l like it.

125
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,972
-Are you kidding?
-What's not to like? Custard, good.

126
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:41,051
Jam, good. Meat, good!

127
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,251
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

128
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:51,127
Well, the fridge broke,
so l had to eat everything.

129
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,847
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

130
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,647
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

131
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:59,651
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.

132
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,526
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

133
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,203
-Stick to your side.
-Hey, come on, now.

134
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,842
All right, what are we having?

135
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:28,253
l don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.

136
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,171
Your muffins.

137
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:34,121
l'll take those to go.

138
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,607
For the kids.

139
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,649
l know what l wanted to ask.

140
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:43,687
They killed you off years ago.
What happened there?

141
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,045
l said some stuff in an interview
l shouldn't have said.

142
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:52,292
-But that is not gonna happen today.
-Understood.

143
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:56,247
-So, what'd you say back then?
-l said that l--

144
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:59,286
-Hey, Joey!
-How you doing?

145
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:08,089
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.
Shelly, these are my friends.

146
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:13,083
Hi, l'm gal pal Rachel Green.
lf you want the dirt, come to me.

147
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:17,002
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

148
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:21,571
l'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

149
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:25,812
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

150
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,652
l'm gonna go get this warmed up.

151
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,129
-You're doing great.
-So far, nothing stupid.

152
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,289
-Mento?
-No, thanks.

153
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:41,163
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?

154
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,251
No, just that he is a great guy.

155
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,286
That'll get you
into <i>Soap Opera Digest.</i>

156
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:48,846
Well, l--

157
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:51,123
l'd like to say that Joey. . .

158
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,849
. . .truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

159
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:00,685
l think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

160
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:05,284
-l like that. What's your name?
-Phoebe Buffay.

161
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:10,521
-How do you spell that?
-lt's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.

162
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,883
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

163
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:17,883
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, '''ello there, mate! ''

164
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:20,852
Great. lt was nice meeting you.

165
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,726
-Yeah, you too.
-Thanks.

166
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:28,804
lt seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?

167
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,808
How come you have two?

168
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,848
Well, this one's for you.

169
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:40,772
-Get out!
-No, l can't.

170
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:47,008
l know how much this means to you.
This isn't just about jewelry.

171
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:52,207
lt's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

172
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:57,042
ls this friendship? l think so!

173
00:12:57,253 --> 00:13:00,051
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

174
00:13:00,253 --> 00:13:02,687
That's what they'll call us!

175
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:08,528
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right. Don't worry about it.

176
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,122
That's gonna leave a stain.

177
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,167
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

178
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,207
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

179
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,684
-l've never lived like this before.
-l know!

180
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:34,012
Well, don't waste it.
l mean, it's still food. Jeez!

181
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:37,565
l feel guilty.
l wanna be a good friend. . .

182
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:42,403
. . .and damn it, l am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

183
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,324
You are a good friend.

184
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:53,208
The audition was this morning,
and l didn't get it.

185
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:58,927
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

186
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:05,211
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

187
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,210
And they're off!

188
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,566
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge!

189
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:13,333
Judge rules: No violation.

190
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:19,052
-The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
-No! That's just an old won ton.

191
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,729
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

192
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,083
Tough call.

193
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:31,005
-l saw it on the Discovery Channel.
-Wait a minute. l saw that!

194
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:34,046
Yeah, about jellyfish,
and how if you--

195
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,728
You peed on yourself?

196
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:45,324
You can't say that! You don't know!

197
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,491
l thought l'd pass out from the pain.

198
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:53,005
Anyway, l tried,
but l couldn't bend that way.

199
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,211
So. . . .

200
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,650
That's right, l stepped up!

201
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,645
She's my friend and she needed help!

202
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:14,323
lf l had to,
l'd pee on any one of you!

203
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:20,407
Nope. No best friend.

204
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:23,411
Just a lot of close friends.

205
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:26,805
So now back to the show.

206
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:31,052
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

207
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,323
Really? Me?

208
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:37,566
Wow, l don't even know
any huge gay people.

209
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:41,243
lt hurts me. lt physically hurts me.

210
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:45,805
Now, off the record, you're not. . . .

211
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,962
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

212
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:54,009
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.

213
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:58,172
lt's got compartments for stuff:
your wallet, your keys.

214
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,489
Your makeup.

215
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,081
Should l climb down your front
so we're face to face. . .

216
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:10,606
. . .or should l climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

217
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,402
-l think face is best.
-Yeah, face.

218
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,609
-Okay, here l come.
-All right.

219
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,642
Oh, my--
How much do you weigh, Ross?

220
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:28,967
l prefer not to answer that. l'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

221
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:41,570
When we said ''face to face,'' we didn't
think it all the way through!

222
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,729
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hey!

223
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,009
Check it out.

224
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:55,412
How much of a man am l?

225
00:16:55,653 --> 00:17:00,010
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

226
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,483
You're turning into a woman.

227
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:07,808
No, l'm not! Why would you say that?
That's just mean!

228
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,607
Now l've upset you? What did l say?

229
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:15,442
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

230
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,611
Oh, my God! l'm a woman!

231
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,529
-Great nap.
-lt really was.

232
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,648
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

233
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:49,203
But l have a number
of close friends who are.

234
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,604
So let's talk about women.

235
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:57,567
l'm sure our female readers are
interested in your romantic life.

236
00:17:57,773 --> 00:18:01,368
What l do is, l look a woman
up and down and l say:

237
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:05,168
''Hey. How you doing?''

238
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,731
Oh, please.

239
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:11,806
Hey. How you doing?

240
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:18,732
Hey. How you doing?

241
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,686
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

242
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:26,290
l'd love to show you, but l just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

243
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:29,803
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

244
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:38,683
-ls Rachel here? l'm her sister.
-Oh, my God! Jill!

245
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,884
-Oh, my God! Rachel!
-Oh, hi!

246
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:45,166
-Oh, my God! lntroduce us!
-Well, this is Chandler.

247
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:49,082
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

248
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:52,410
-Hey, how you doing?
-Don't!

249
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:59,682
You're a really nice guy. l'm happy
to be your roommate and friend.

250
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:04,842
l'm just. . . . You know, l just
don't feel that way about you.

251
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,521
l see what happened.

252
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,203
lt's because l was trying
to repel you. Right?

253
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:18,612
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if l turned it on.

254
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:21,611
-l don't think so.
-Oh, l do.

255
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:25,729
How you doing?

256
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:29,370
l'm okay.

257
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,605
What? Oh, dear God!

258
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:39,809
Not much to tell there.
l'm really shy.

259
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:44,972
So that's it.
l guess that's all l need.

260
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:49,166
Thank you so much.
l think they'll run this next month.

261
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:52,285
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

262
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,802
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

263
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,173
-l did it.
-Amazing.

264
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:02,366
Wait, l almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

265
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:05,963
Other than <i>Days,</i>
what's your favorite soap opera?

266
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:11,725
Oh, l don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? l have a life, you know?

267
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:17,808
The readers at <i>Soap Opera Digest</i>
will be happy to learn that.

268
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,605
Good enough.

269
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:24,765
So close.

270
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:33,532
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.

271
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:38,204
l called the lady and said l
was joking. She was nice about it.

272
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:41,530
-You slept with her, didn't you?
-A little bit.

273
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,522
This picture of you is steamy.

274
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:49,965
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

275
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:54,405
-Did you just wink at me?
-You're the one who loves the picture.
