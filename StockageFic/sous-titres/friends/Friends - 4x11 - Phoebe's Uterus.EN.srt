1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,970
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,090
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,979
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch--

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,770
Why were you at court?

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,530
Lunch.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,290
We were like...

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,530
... we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

8
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,889
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,770
Oh, it's so great.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,900
Stop it! Don't!

11
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:45,369
I'll get you a gift now.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,529
Is there anything you need?

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,689
We've been trying to get pregnant.
Thought we'd get a jump on things.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,529
No one's getting any younger.

15
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:04,290
Because the thing is, we're not
able to, you know, conceive.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,690
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,889
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

18
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:15,010
... is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,129
... and put it into another girl.

20
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,930
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

21
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,690
That's a really nice gift.

22
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,970
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,690
The One with Phoebe's Uterus

24
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:37,010
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

25
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:23,330
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

26
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,690
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,690
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

28
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,250
You said "black. " Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

29
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,649
Well, you know what I meant.

30
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,250
You messed it up.

31
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,529
You're stupid.

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,970
So what job'd you get?

33
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,130
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

34
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:59,449
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

35
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,889
They give you
all the information.

36
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,410
It's like memorizing a script.

37
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:08,889
On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,690
very nice.

39
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,289
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,089
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

41
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,979
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!

42
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,940
Oh, my God!

43
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,490
They're having a baby!

44
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,449
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

45
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,050
-My God!
-Are you serious?

46
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,690
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

47
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:47,080
Ew! And, oh no!

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,490
They want me to be the surrogate.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,649
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,490
What did you say?

51
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,520
I had to think about it,
but what is there to think of?

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,929
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

53
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,130
You'll carry their child,
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

54
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,970
This is an incredible thing to do.

55
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:14,740
But there are things to think about.

56
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,130
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean pregnant.

57
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,290
I know.

58
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,290
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,690
I mean, morning sickness, labor.

60
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,450
It's all for somebody else.

61
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,410
Yeah. What's your point?

62
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:34,899
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

63
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,290
I couldn't do that.

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,089
I figure, the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

65
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,929
And that baby was, you know...

66
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,660
... a keeper.

67
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,649
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

68
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,529
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

69
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,140
Just think it through.

70
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,369
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,250
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

72
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,209
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

73
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,359
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,779
I am so jealous.

75
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,369
You guys are just right there.

76
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,049
Right where?

77
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,929
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

78
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,609
... and sex and talking.

79
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,890
You got to love the talking.

80
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,290
And the sex?

81
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,809
We haven't had sex.

82
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,170
What's the big deal?
This is special.

83
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,010
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

84
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,570
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

85
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,529
That is really nice...

86
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,140
... Iying!

87
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,140
-No way is that the reason.
-Why?

88
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,209
You're not mature enough
to understand that!

89
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,410
He's right. I'm totally lying.

90
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,410
Then what is it?

91
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,649
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,970
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

93
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,890
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

94
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,570
I was going for the metaphor.

95
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,609
I was saying the actual words.

96
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,649
He's had girlfriends.
It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

97
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,579
We share a wall.

98
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:43,890
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

99
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,410
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you are in love.

100
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,089
Just go for it.

101
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,570
Yeah, you should.

102
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,500
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,929
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

104
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,489
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

105
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,329
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

106
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:16,209
This is a museum. No talking.

107
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,690
Right down here we have...

108
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,890
... a large foot.

109
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,130
And over here we have Ross Geller.

110
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,329
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

111
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:33,609
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

112
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,369
Okay, moving right along.

113
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,899
Come on.

114
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,290
It's open. Come in.

115
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,290
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-That's okay.

116
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,970
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

117
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,089
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

118
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,529
I was working on my pottery.

119
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,609
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

120
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:11,730
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: pottery and erotica.

121
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,649
Erottery!

122
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,929
Thanks for coming out to see me.

123
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:22,970
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

124
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,170
I don't think it's a good idea.

125
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,899
Why not?

126
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,290
You'd be giving up a baby.

127
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,210
And I really don't--

128
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,369
I don't know if anything I say...

129
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,289
... would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

130
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,289
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

131
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,010
No, no. The puppy is yours.

132
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,450
I get a puppy?

133
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,210
But for only three days.

134
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,770
Why?

135
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:02,969
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parenty on you now.

136
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:12,010
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

137
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,049
I know what I'm talking about.

138
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,010
I gave up two babies.

139
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,809
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

140
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,849
... how terrible it is.

141
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:31,010
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

142
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,090
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

143
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,289
... it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

144
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:46,090
I shouldn't have given you
the puppy first.

145
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,090
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

146
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,659
You mean Dr. Geller?

147
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:58,890
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

148
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,890
Oh, he won't sit here.

149
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,130
Only people in white coats
sit there.

150
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,169
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

151
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:09,200
How come?

152
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,369
That's how it is.

153
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,450
That's crazy.

154
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,570
It's crazy in a perfect world:
a world without lab coats and blazers.

155
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,049
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

156
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,700
See that scientist?

157
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,609
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now....

158
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,020
Peter! Hey, Peter!

159
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,090
It's me, Rhonda from P. S. 129?

160
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,359
I shared my pudding with you, man!

161
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,450
I gave you my snack pack!

162
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:49,409
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

163
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,330
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

164
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,489
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

165
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,130
... but Ross is my friend.

166
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,289
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

167
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,609
Here! I saved you a seat!

168
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:15,090
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

169
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,890
This is saved.

170
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,900
Gift shop.

171
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,890
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

172
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,409
You do what you got to do.

173
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,729
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

174
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,409
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

175
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,690
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

176
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,289
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

177
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,690
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

178
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,489
Look, Ross.

179
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,130
It's no big deal.

180
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,729
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

181
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:11,489
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

182
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,099
I understand, you know?

183
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,890
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

184
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,010
So it's, you know, it's cool.

185
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,690
I'll see you tomorrow.

186
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,570
When we're in the audience,
he does wave.

187
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:43,489
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?

188
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,130
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

189
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,489
Come on, let's go to the balcony.

190
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,729
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

191
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,289
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

192
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,140
So, did you do it?

193
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,729
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

194
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,890
It was bad?

195
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:10,770
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

196
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,090
She was like, "I see your point.
I'm all right with it. "

197
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,330
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

198
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,289
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

199
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,210
Look, you have to help me.

200
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,530
I mean--

201
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,090
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

202
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,559
I need to know...

203
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,690
... what makes it go from nice to...

204
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,690
... "My God! Somebody's killing her
in there! "

205
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,650
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

206
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,530
All right.

207
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,969
Now.

208
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,890
You don't have to draw an actual--
Whoa, she's hot!

209
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,530
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

210
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,210
You got one, two, three...

211
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,169
... four...

212
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,409
... five, six and seven.

213
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,289
There are seven?

214
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,690
Let me see that.

215
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,330
That's one?

216
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,289
Kind of an important one.

217
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,250
I was looking at it upside down.

218
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,489
Well, you know sometimes that helps.

219
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:33,049
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

220
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,289
That's bad?

221
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,289
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

222
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,890
You might if it were like seven.

223
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,729
The important thing is
to take your time.

224
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,530
You want to hit them all...

225
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,010
... mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

226
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:54,289
Oh, toes!

227
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,890
For some people.

228
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,090
All right.

229
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:07,609
You could start out
with a little one.

230
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,080
A two.

231
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,530
A one, two, three.

232
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,330
A three.

233
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,770
A five.

234
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,690
A four.

235
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,500
A three, two.

236
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:20,609
Two. A two, four, six.

237
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,250
Two, four, six.

238
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,049
Four. Two.

239
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,770
Two. Four, seven!

240
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,369
Five, seven! Six, seven!

241
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,890
Seven! Seven!

242
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,809
Dr. Geller?
There's a seat here.

243
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,090
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

244
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,929
But I'm having my lunch...

245
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,169
... at this table.
Here in the middle.

246
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,969
I'm eating...

247
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,890
... right here
with my good friend, Joey.

248
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:10,969
If he'll sit with me.

249
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,250
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

250
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,330
You know...

251
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,890
... we work in a museum
of natural history.

252
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,530
And yet, there is something...

253
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,210
... unnatural...

254
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,049
... about the way we eat lunch.

255
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,739
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

256
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,729
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

257
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,090
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

258
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,130
Now, I say we shed these coats...

259
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,969
... that separate us.

260
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:59,010
And we get to know
the people underneath.

261
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,130
I'm Ross!

262
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

263
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,729
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

264
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,099
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

265
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,489
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

266
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:28,530
-There you go!
-Hang in there, Teddy!

267
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,180
I'm Andrew.

268
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:34,010
And I didn't pay for this pear.

269
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,770
Okay. Good for you.

270
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,609
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

271
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,489
Wow, Rhonda.

272
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:53,050
-I'm Scott.
-Yeah, okay, Scott!

273
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,089
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

274
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,699
... or my family will die.

275
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,329
My mom will be here soon.

276
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,810
I can't. I can't give him up.

277
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,489
Yes, no. I can.

278
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,290
I don't want to.

279
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,300
But I can.

280
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,130
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.

281
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,290
You know, I never saw that.

282
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,489
Oh, it was only okay.

283
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,530
I can't do this.

284
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,729
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

285
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,130
... there's no way
I can give up a baby.

286
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,209
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

287
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,890
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

288
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,729
We were in the neighborhood.

289
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,930
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

290
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,530
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

291
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,219
Who's this little guy?

292
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,280
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

293
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,619
You are so precious,
I'd take you home.

294
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,050
Why don't you?

295
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,729
Are you serious?

296
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:21,890
Thanks.

297
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,810
-What are you doing?
-I'm okay with this.

298
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,329
You know why?
Because look at them.

299
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,290
Look how happy they are.

300
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,290
And I made that, so you know...

301
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,540
... it'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby. But God!

302
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,369
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

303
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,650
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

304
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,010
Thank you so much!

305
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,890
You don't know what this means to us.

306
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,569
I think I'm going to cry!

307
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,689
It's going to be so great.

308
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,219
-What's going on?
-I gave them the puppy.

309
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,130
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

310
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,609
-Phoebe--
-No, I know.

311
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,410
We're different, though.

312
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,810
This is a different situation.

313
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,329
I am not going to regret this.

314
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,290
I understand all that.

315
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:32,849
It's just, that was my puppy.

316
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,729
Would you ever be a surrogate?

317
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,369
Depends who asked.

318
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,209
What if I asked?

319
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,930
Oh, Mon, sure!

320
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,290
-Really?
-Yes.

321
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,930
You're not asking me, are you?

322
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,209
Yes. Totally.

323
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,819
Thank you! Thank you!

324
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:05,209
Thank you!

325
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,290
Yes, thank you!
