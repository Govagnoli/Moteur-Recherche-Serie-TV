1
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,006
-Hi!
-Hey!

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,529
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,372
Twenty. Some work people
had things to do.

4
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,450
Your sisters can't make it.

5
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:18,213
They're not coming
to a social event. . .

6
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:22,446
. . .where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

7
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,524
As long as my mom's here.

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,528
-Oh, my God. Your mother.
-My mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:33,164
Given we forgot to invite her, it'd
be a big coincidence if she was.

10
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:35,484
My God!

11
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:38,332
Phoebe was in charge
of the invitations.

12
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:41,132
l don't have a mother.
Often l forget--

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,563
Oh, give it a rest.

14
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:46,845
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

15
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,332
No.

16
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,492
Neither is mine.

17
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:55,971
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

18
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,523
Make sure she comes.
lt's important. lt's my mom.

19
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:02,691
-l know. What's her number?
-l don't know.

20
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:05,771
Go. l have it in my book. Go.

21
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:14,921
lf you're in charge of invitations,
why am l calling her?

22
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,051
Hello, Mrs. Green!
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

23
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,811
-Oh, hello, Monica.
<i>-Hi.</i>

24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,722
lt's last-minute, but we've decided
to throw an impromptu. . .

25
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:27,687
-. . .baby shower for Rachel today.
-My daughters told me. . .

26
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:32,324
. . .when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

27
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,929
-Okay, l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.
<i>-For what, dear?</i>

28
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,045
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

29
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:43,126
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

30
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:47,806
Please, please, can you come?
lt starts at 4:00.

31
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:52,251
-Well, all right. l'll see you at 4:00.
-Thank you.

32
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:57,248
-lsn't it at 3:00?
-Son of a bitch!

33
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:59,523
The One With the Baby Shower

34
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:36,005
Hey! Wanna shoot some hoops?

35
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:40,132
l'm practicing for an audition
to be host of a game show.

36
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,322
-Cool!
-Great!

37
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,570
lf l get it, by day,
l'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

38
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,612
But by night, l'll be Joey Tribbiani!

39
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:52,683
You'd be perfect! That's your name!

40
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,364
The audition's soon,
and l don't understand the game.

41
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:57,881
Do you want help?

42
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:02,530
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

43
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:06,009
We can lose to junior-high girls
some other time.

44
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:10,168
-All right. Let's play Bamboozled!
-Bamboozled?

45
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,364
-lsn't that a cool name?
-Yeah!

46
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:17,004
All right. Okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

47
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,289
Tell us about yourself, Ross.

48
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:23,969
Well, l'm a paleontologist.
l live in New York.

49
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:28,843
l have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And--

50
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:32,330
l said, ''a little bit. ''
How about you, Chandler?

51
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:36,372
l'm a headhunter. l hook up
out-of-work Soviet scientists. . .

52
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,684
. . .with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

53
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:43,408
Excellent! Let's play!
Chandler, you'll go first.

54
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,292
-What is the capital of Colombia?
-Bogotá.

55
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,405
lt's Bogotá, but close enough.

56
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:54,770
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

57
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:58,852
-What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
-l should know that.

58
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,203
Let's see. One moment, please. . . .

59
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:08,403
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines if you go higher or lower.

60
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:10,803
Higher or lower than what?

61
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:16,089
-This is embarrassing!
-Can you believe how lame this is?

62
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:21,407
l'm sorry. l don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

63
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,767
l told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

64
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:33,124
You ordered a stripper?
That is inappropriate.

65
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,006
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

66
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:40,603
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
l'm so glad you could make it.

67
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:45,364
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.

68
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,046
Try.

69
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:49,885
There's my little girl!

70
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,609
-She's still mad.
-Yeah, l know.

71
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:56,322
lsn't it great? One less
person to make small talk with.

72
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,963
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
lt doesn't bother you?

73
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:03,722
We've apologized twice.
l can't do any more than that.

74
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:06,532
You hate it when people
are mad at you. . .

75
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:09,685
. . .but you just have
to be okay with it.

76
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:13,050
Okay. l can do that.

77
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,364
-l gotta go powder my ass.
-Oh.

78
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:19,525
That face! Like when
you were in high school.

79
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:23,925
lf l didn't know better, l'd say
you're a cheerleader in trouble.

80
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:25,731
Come, let's get some tea.

81
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,930
Oh, my! Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

82
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:33,644
Did you pick a nanny? lf you use your
maid, it will split her focus.

83
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:38,250
Actually, l'm not gonna use a nanny.
And l don't have a maid.

84
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,331
lt's like you're a cave person.

85
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:45,965
You must get a nanny. You don't
know how overwhelming it will be.

86
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,284
When you were a baby, l had Mrs. K.

87
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:53,372
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

88
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,172
l actually think
l remember some of it:

89
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,962
<i>Tu madre estâ loca.</i>

90
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,532
Such a sweet woman.

91
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,566
As great as she was,
l can't afford that.

92
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:08,525
-Oh, Rachel!
-What?

93
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:12,481
l just had a great idea!
l'm gonna come live with you!

94
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:14,804
What? What?

95
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:19,484
Oh, l'm so happy l'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

96
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,963
Look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

97
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:27,132
Yes, yes, l do.

98
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,126
Ross is in the lead.

99
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,484
Another question,
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

100
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,288
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey.

101
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,205
l'll take another question.

102
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:41,483
This is tough. Hold your breath.

103
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:43,371
lt's okay. l'm ready.

104
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,366
You gotta hold your breath
until you answer.

105
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,451
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna--

106
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:56,729
Okay. What do you have a fear of if
you suffer from this phobia? Triska. . . .

107
00:06:56,893 --> 00:07:00,852
Holy cow. That's a big word. Tris. . . .

108
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,368
Look at this. How do you say that?

109
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,491
-Let me see that.
-This one right here.

110
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,212
-Triskaidekaphobia.
-Fear of Triscuits!

111
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:14,605
-No! No. Fear of the number 1 3.
-Fear of Triscuits?

112
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:18,089
lt's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

113
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:20,812
Chandler, you're up.

114
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:24,449
l'm entitled to use my Angel Pass
for a free turn.

115
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,771
-This game makes no sense!
-You're upset because you're losing.

116
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,727
Oh, come on, Ross.
l think we're all losers here.

117
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,002
You can either spin the Wheel
or pick a Google Card.

118
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:40,609
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, l don't care.

119
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:44,085
You must choose.

120
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:48,451
-Either. lt makes no difference.
-Choose, you jackass.

121
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,610
-l'll take a card.
-You picked the Gimme Card!

122
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:56,049
-You get all of Ross' points!
-What?

123
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,333
This game is kind of fun!

124
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:02,485
You don't think it's crazy
you get my points--?

125
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:06,481
The contestants aren't supposed
to speak to each other.

126
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,923
-Why did you invite my mother?
-What?

127
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:15,244
She wants to move in
and help care for the baby.

128
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,723
-For how long?
-Eight weeks.

129
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:22,284
l love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

130
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:25,331
l'd be honored if she wanted
to live with me.

131
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,967
She can't hear you.

132
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,685
What am l gonna do?

133
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:34,568
lf you don't want her to move
in with you, just tell her.

134
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,566
You're right.
l'm about to have a baby.

135
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,805
l can say l don't want
her sleeping on my couch.

136
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:44,124
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.
This can't happen.

137
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,322
That is right.

138
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:48,371
Tell her you don't want her
to live with you.

139
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,763
Do not take no for an answer.

140
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:56,164
This is great! Now she's
gonna be mad at Rachel!

141
00:08:56,333 --> 00:09:01,248
And l'm just gonna swoop in there and
be like the daughter she never had.

142
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:06,045
l have new respect for Chandler.

143
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:10,411
All right, everybody!
lt's time to open the presents!

144
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:13,406
Yes! The first gift
that Rachel opens. . .

145
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,922
. . .should be from the grandmother.

146
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:21,804
Because you're the most important
person in this room! And in the world!

147
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:25,211
l don't have one
because l was invited late.

148
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:30,208
But thank you so much, dear, for
bringing that to everybody's attention.

149
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:36,524
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents!

150
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:41,162
-lt's okay that you didn't get a gift.
-l kind of did.

151
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,608
Me! Eight weeks of me.

152
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:47,448
Okay. See, Mom?
The truth is, l can do this on my own.

153
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,286
l know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

154
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:53,251
But you need help at the beginning.

155
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,013
l know what l'm doing.
l can handle it.

156
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:57,925
Really? Remember Twinkles?

157
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,921
He was a hamster.
l'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

158
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:05,290
Okay, come on, Rach.
lt's present time!

159
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,331
You're the glue holding
this party together.

160
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:11,644
lt's kind of falling apart here.

161
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:13,929
-Oh, look!
-Wow!

162
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,890
This is from work friends.

163
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:21,366
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
Oh, l know what this is.

164
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,285
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:26,286
That can't be right.

166
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,965
ls that a beer bong for a baby?

167
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,123
Darling, that's a breast pump.

168
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:39,766
Did l say l was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

169
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,447
Oh, wow! What's this?

170
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,929
-lt's a Diaper Genie.
-lt dispenses clean diapers!

171
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,089
lt's where you put dirty ones.

172
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:52,128
Why don't you take it outside
and throw it in a dumpster?

173
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:57,128
-You're gonna do that 1 0 times a day?
-What, it goes 1 0 times a day?

174
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:59,727
Are we feeding this baby lndian food?

175
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,932
No, dear. That's what babies do.

176
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:07,325
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

177
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:13,003
What will you do with the baby
while you trot out to the garbage?

178
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:17,009
l don't know,
l'd leave it on the changing table?

179
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:22,003
-What? What did l do? What did l do?
-You can't leave a baby alone.

180
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,845
Of course, l know that!

181
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,766
Of course you never leave
a baby alone.

182
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,242
lt would--
She wouldn't be safe.

183
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:33,441
Not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy.

184
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:37,288
Opening the presents is a little
overwhelming right now.

185
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:40,729
l'm gonna maybe open
them all a little bit later.

186
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:43,327
Thank you for coming,
for the gifts. . .

187
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:48,726
-. . .and this basket is beautiful.
-lt's actually a bassinet.

188
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:52,010
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

189
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:59,252
ln what film is the line:
''We don't need no stinking badges! ''

190
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,246
<i>-Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>!
-Backwards Bonus.

191
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:05,684
<i>-Madre Sierra the of Treasure</i>!
-Yes!

192
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,727
l'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance!

193
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,242
-Wise! How many rungs?
-Six!

194
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:16,645
-That noise can only mean one thing.
-Hungry Monkey!

195
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:20,682
-l'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
-lt's an audio question.

196
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:24,448
Name this television theme song:

197
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,731
Oh, my God. l know this.
Give me a second.

198
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,889
-Tell the Time Turtle!
-Shut up!

199
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,089
-''l Dream of Jeannie'' !
-Yes!

200
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,448
l'd like to spin the Wheel.

201
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:42,729
Oh, come on!

202
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,531
Super Speedy Speed Round.

203
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,366
-ls there a Hopping Bonus?
-Of course.

204
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:52,843
-Who invented bifocals?
-Franklin!

205
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,732
Which monarch ruled
Great Britain the longest?

206
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,127
Queen Victoria!

207
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:01,372
You forgot to switch legs between
questions. No Hopping Bonus!

208
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,649
Every time!

209
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:07,647
-Yeah. Now over to Chandler.
-l'd like a Google Card.

210
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:12,329
-Are you sure?
-Yes! No! Google!

211
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:17,442
Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross!
Because, Chandler. . .

212
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:19,683
-. . .you've been Bamboozled!
-No!

213
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:25,047
-Yes!
-This is the best game ever!

214
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:28,128
You'll stay as long as l need you?

215
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,853
-Of course.
-l swear l'm not an idiot.

216
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:33,891
l read books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

217
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:38,206
l didn't think to read about what
to do when the baby comes.

218
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:40,011
And the baby's coming. . .

219
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:45,042
. . .and l don't know what to do.
Oh, can l throw up in my Diaper Genie?

220
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:48,171
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

221
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,445
-Where you going?
-l'm going to the bathroom.

222
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:56,249
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

223
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,169
lt is gonna be okay!

224
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,203
Worth a shot.

225
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,766
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

226
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:12,368
l just Bamboozled Chandler!

227
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,563
Which is not a sexual thing.

228
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:23,452
-Well, that was a quick shower.
-Not if you were here.

229
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,372
We got good stuff.

230
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,570
We did. My mom got
us the greatest gift of all.

231
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:30,650
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

232
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:35,732
No. She's going to live
with us for eight weeks.

233
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,292
What?

234
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:41,122
Yes! She's gonna help us
take care of the baby!

235
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:44,049
You're not serious!

236
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:48,252
She's a very nice woman,
but we can't take eight weeks of her.

237
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:50,529
-She'll drive us crazy--
-Hi, Ross!

238
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:52,809
Hey, roomie!

239
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,570
Hey, l'm Ray.
l'm the producer of the show.

240
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:04,765
lt's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

241
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:09,006
This is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help with the audition.

242
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:13,047
-Right, Ray.
-Whenever you're ready.

243
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:17,610
Hello. l'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!

244
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:22,250
Erin, first question. ln hockey,
who is known as ''The Great One''?

245
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,602
-Gretzky.
-Correct!

246
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:27,522
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel?

247
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,805
Didn't your agents give
you the revised rules?

248
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,931
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

249
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,004
Why?

250
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:40,166
lt was too complicated.
People didn't follow it.

251
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,167
Complicated?! Spin the Wheel
to go up the Ladder of Chance. . .

252
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,530
. . .through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.

253
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,730
You yank his tail,
and you're in Paradise Pond!

254
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,483
Yeah. All that's gone.

255
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,611
lt's a simple question-
and-answer game now.

256
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,929
Well, what's fun about that?

257
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,405
You expect me to host a boring game
of people answering questions?

258
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,252
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.

259
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:09,251
Let's play Bamboozled!

260
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,723
Oh, and all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have. . . .

261
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,049
They might be better in the garage.

262
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:20,487
-Well, we don't have a garage.
-Did l say garage? l meant garbage.

263
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:26,403
You know what? Maybe it's not
absolutely vital that you live with us.

264
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:31,886
-Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
-l really do. l don't know anything.

265
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,845
l'm sure that's untrue.

266
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,772
Oh, no?
Do l know anything about babies?

267
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,891
-No. Not a thing.
-lt's frightening.

268
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,051
Even if she doesn't
know anything, l do.

269
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,643
l have a son. His mother
and l didn't live together.

270
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:51,170
When he was with me, l took
care of him all the time, by myself.

271
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,370
-That's true. You do have another child.
-Yeah.

272
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,251
With another woman.

273
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:59,650
Have you no control, Ross?

274
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,962
That's a different issue.

275
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:09,129
The point is, when the baby comes,
l will be there to feed her. . .

276
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,568
. . .and bathe her and change her.

277
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,930
l want to do all those things.

278
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:19,484
-You don't need me to live with you.
-Yes!

279
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,489
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

280
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:27,812
-You'll be a great father.
-You'll be a wonderful grandma.

281
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:32,007
Hello? l still don't know
what the hell l'm doing!

282
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:35,364
Every first-time mother
feels that way.

283
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:41,290
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city. . .

284
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:46,573
. . .you were a spoiled, helpless little
girl who used Daddy's credit cards!

285
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,646
l hope you're going
somewhere with this.

286
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:52,532
Look at you.
You're this big executive.

287
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,327
You are very capable.

288
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,492
l have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

289
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,725
-Really?
-l'm telling you.

290
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:05,410
Thank you.

291
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:10,002
All right. l'm gonna get going.

292
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,444
No, sweetheart, stay put.

293
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:17,522
l'll let myself out. lt's like l'm
not here. Which l almost wasn't.

294
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:23,561
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do l do?

295
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:27,602
Nothing. You have apologized
to her like a million times.

296
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,765
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

297
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:36,001
You just threw her daughter a lovely,
albeit slightly boring, shower.

298
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:41,042
-And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
-You know what? You're right.

299
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:44,285
lf you wanna say anything,
l'd tell her off.

300
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:45,852
Really?

301
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:49,448
Okay, l will.

302
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:51,883
Mrs. Green?

303
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,532
Mrs. Green?

304
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:56,491
lt is rude not to say
goodbye to the host.

305
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:01,323
When someone apologizes to you,
the decent thing to do is to accept it.

306
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,643
What l did wasn't on purpose.

307
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:07,328
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

308
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:08,807
-Spiteful?
-Right.

309
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:12,767
lt's time you took a good
look in the mirror, young lady!

310
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,605
Old lady!

311
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:16,525
Lady!

312
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:19,446
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

313
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:26,641
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, l will forgive you. Good day.

314
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,243
l can't feel my legs!

315
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,771
You were fantastic!
l'm so proud of you.

316
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:38,809
-Yeah? l'm proud of me too.
-You should be.

317
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:43,285
-Could you get me something to drink?
-You got it!

318
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:48,129
Mrs. Green? Okay, l'm really sorry!
l apologize. lf you. . . .

319
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:52,610
Okay! l bit my tongue!

320
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:55,970
But l'm still really sorry!

321
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,684
-Okay, l'm ready.
-You sure?

322
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:06,691
l've done my studying,
and l know my stuff.

323
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,969
All right, then.

324
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,086
Rachel Green,
let's play Bamboozled!

325
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:16,332
How do you test
bathwater temperature?

326
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,524
-Put your elbow in it.
