1
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,093
-What's up?
-l left my guitar here.

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,642
Okay. No problem.

3
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:18,732
Okay. Here you go.

4
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,245
-What?
-You want to hang out or something?

5
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:29,083
You caught me at a bad time.

6
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:31,853
-Are you and Chandler. . .?
-Exactly.

7
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:33,850
-Can l play for you?
-No.

8
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,364
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

9
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:45,841
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

10
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:54,566
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

11
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:58,652
-Phoebe, l can explain.
-You said you hate massages.

12
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:02,926
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

13
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,922
How long has this been going on?

14
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:10,729
-Well, Alexandra has--
-lt has a name?

15
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,971
Phoebe, don't get upset.

16
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:19,247
Okay. Oh, too late! l'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

17
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,164
Well, l thought l'd. . . .

18
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,125
Yeah, what the hell.

19
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:27,804
The One With the Secret Closet

20
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:06,768
One more push.
Come on, we're almost there.

21
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:12,451
l'm happy things worked out for us and
we're having this baby. l love you.

22
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,684
l love you too.

23
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,891
l hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say. . .

24
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,647
. . .you're the best sex l've ever had.

25
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:23,647
That's always appropriate.

26
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:27,364
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

27
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,807
There we go.

28
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:38,043
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

29
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:49,651
l hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

30
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,287
Joey!

31
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:58,451
-What's going on?
-Come feel my belly.

32
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:02,489
-The baby's kicking for the first time.
-Really?

33
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,166
Yes.

34
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:06,847
You know what? Maybe you--

35
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:12,044
Maybe you should come to me.
l'm not wearing any bottoms.

36
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,284
Oh, my God.

37
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,251
lt's unbelievable!

38
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,883
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like. . . .

39
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,011
Who's that annoying
girl soccer player?

40
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:28,046
-Mia Hamm?
-Mia Hamm!

41
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,444
-lt's amazing.
-One hand on the sheet, Joe.

42
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,649
Sorry.

43
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,642
Hey, babe.

44
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:45,808
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

45
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:50,287
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

46
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:54,042
-Maybe we can take it back.
-Where would we return it?

47
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:57,245
How about to the street,
from the balcony?

48
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:00,531
Why don't we just find a place for it?

49
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,725
ln that cabinet?

50
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:10,252
That's for canned goods. Have you
forgotten everything from orientation?

51
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,847
How about the closet by the bathroom?

52
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:18,250
-Okay. Let me do it.
-No, l'll do it.

53
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:23,283
You have to relax and let me
take care of things once in a while.

54
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:27,601
lt's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?

55
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,045
No reason.
l keep private things in there.

56
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,292
l've been here a while,
and l've never seen what's in there.

57
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,404
What is in there?

58
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:39,361
Feminine stuff.

59
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:42,883
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

60
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:49,441
Nothing in there concerns you.
lf you love me, you'll just let it go.

61
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:53,246
-Fine.
-Thank you.

62
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,049
Love you.

63
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:05,572
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

64
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:12,647
lf it helps, Alexandra's only
been massaging her for three years.

65
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,444
lf! l said, if it helps.

66
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:22,490
Why won't you let me massage you?

67
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:27,090
l'd be self-conscious.
You're my friend. l'd be naked.

68
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,008
We lived together for years.
l've seen you naked.

69
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:34,569
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

70
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:39,166
l'm curious about the human body.

71
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,166
You can understand
why this would be weird.

72
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,967
l'm a professional
and l'm really good.

73
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:50,689
lf you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Give me a chance. Please?

74
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,449
lf it means that much to you.

75
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:57,481
lt does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

76
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,851
Or how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

77
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:05,925
-Dinosaurs.
-Potato, potahtoe.

78
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,844
Ross, the baby's kicking.

79
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,049
What? lt is?

80
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:21,044
lt's not kicking now.

81
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:25,485
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

82
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,530
When? What happened?

83
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:31,328
Last night. l went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

84
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,047
A dreamless sleep.

85
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:38,282
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

86
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:43,891
l wish l would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

87
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:47,688
l got some stuff going on
if you want to feel.

88
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:52,648
l don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

89
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:56,289
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it.

90
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,525
l don't care if it's 3 a.m.
and you want ice cream.

91
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,247
Can l get a copy of that?

92
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:09,449
-Are you under the sheet?
-Yes.

93
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,851
Great, let's begin.

94
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,242
How's the pressure?

95
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:27,165
lt's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

96
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,086
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

97
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,246
-And it's not weird, is it?
-No.

98
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:39,251
That's right, you just enjoy.

99
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,642
Oh, yeah!

100
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:52,645
-Oh, yeah!
-Okay.

101
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,245
Oh, God, Phoebe!

102
00:07:56,493 --> 00:08:00,452
That's it! That's it, right there!

103
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:15,289
l wasn't trying to open
your closet, l swear.

104
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:21,925
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

105
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,250
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see it.

106
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:29,685
-Why not?
-l don't know! What's she hiding?

107
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,003
l don't know.

108
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,602
l'll bet it's Richard.

109
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:38,121
Why would she keep Richard in here?

110
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,483
Off the top of my head. . .

111
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,964
. . .maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

112
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:47,449
You being the ''cake,''
Richard being the ''too. ''

113
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,123
-Or. . . .
-And here we go.

114
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,690
l saw a movie where there was a door.
Nobody knew what was behind it.

115
00:08:55,933 --> 00:09:00,449
When they finally got it open,
millions of bugs came pouring out. . .

116
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:04,043
. . .and they feasted on human flesh!

117
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,642
lt wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

118
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:16,207
Stupid closet full of bugs!

119
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:21,769
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. l don't--

120
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:24,123
When my sisters were pregnant. . .

121
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:27,569
. . .they got weird feelings
and it was always nothing.

122
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:29,411
-Really?
-Absolutely.

123
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:33,845
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. l'll page Ross.

124
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:40,043
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.
Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

125
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,244
Crushing bones!

126
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:45,650
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

127
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,203
-So?
-She's fine.

128
00:09:55,413 --> 00:10:00,248
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.
Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.

129
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:05,243
Mild discomfort? l take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

130
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,205
-Everything's normal?
-Yes.

131
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:09,483
-There's no danger?
-No.

132
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,730
Contractions can be unnerving,
but she's fine.

133
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:17,569
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

134
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:21,652
l wasn't calm! l've never been
more scared in my life.

135
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:26,649
-You said everything was okay.
-What do l know? l'm not a doctor.

136
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,644
-But everything is okay. l'm fine.
-You sure?

137
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:34,528
Yes. l got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

138
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,691
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

139
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,525
-ls everything okay?
-Yes.

140
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,691
Your page said, ''Come to
the hospital. '' What happened?

141
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,647
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

142
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,811
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

143
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,129
No uterus, no opinion.

144
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:55,685
What's with the candy?

145
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:59,090
l was at the concession stand
at the movies.

146
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:02,922
-You went to the movies by yourself?
-Mona!

147
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,806
-l gotta go back in there.
-What's wrong?

148
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:11,245
-l just gotta--
-No, really, tell me. What's up?

149
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:14,843
Look, l forgot my underwear.

150
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:20,286
Thanks for bringing her
to the hospital.

151
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,212
Don't worry about it. No big deal.

152
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,042
But still, it should have been me.
l'm the dad.

153
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:31,248
-Here's information on Braxton Hicks.
-Thanks.

154
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:34,291
You did the right thing
by bringing her in.

155
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,848
You'll make a wonderful father.

156
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:43,242
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

157
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:52,046
-There has got to be a way.
-Easy there, Captain Kirk.

158
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,362
-Do you have a bobby pin?
-Yeah.

159
00:11:56,613 --> 00:12:00,492
Oh, no, wait.
l'm not a 9-year-old girl.

160
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,803
Then why do you throw like one?

161
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:07,203
-Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
-Oh, sure, ''Monica. ''

162
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:12,009
So how's the inappropriate
crush on Rachel coming?

163
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:16,491
Really good. l should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

164
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,844
Well, you sure found that quick.

165
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:27,847
l wish l didn't feel this way about
Rachel. l wish things could be normal.

166
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:32,843
l love living with her, and
helping out with the baby is amazing.

167
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:36,085
But now l think Ross feels left out.

168
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:41,361
When l took Rachel to the hospital,
the doctor thought l was the father.

169
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:44,730
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

170
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:49,484
l have no idea what l'm doing.
For all l know, l'm locking it more.

171
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:54,092
-You try opening it with a credit card?
-That's a good idea.

172
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,803
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

173
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:00,846
-l feel terrible.
-lt's not your fault.

174
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:05,092
What are you gonna do, not take her?
You're doing nothing wrong.

175
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:09,531
Except for harboring love
for the woman carrying his baby.

176
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:18,449
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

177
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:26,443
l gotta tell you, yesterday was
amazing. That massage felt so good.

178
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,883
No, l got that.

179
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:32,642
-Can we make it a weekly appointment?
-Okay.

180
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:37,762
You should know though,
l've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

181
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:40,768
-Okay.
-l mean 500.

182
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,642
-What?
-600.

183
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:45,252
What's going on?

184
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,525
You make sex noises
when you get massaged.

185
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:53,853
lt freaked me out. After a while,
l tried to hurt you. lt spurred you on.

186
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:58,052
You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises l make.

187
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:01,046
There's nothing sexual about this?

188
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:03,608
Oh, God!

189
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:09,365
What are you looking at?

190
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,092
l mean, hi.

191
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:16,248
This is embarrassing.
l'm never getting a massage again.

192
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,365
Don't let this stop you
from getting massages.

193
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:23,009
l have lots of clients
that make those noises.

194
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:25,681
-Really?
-Well, not clients. Lovers.

195
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:31,932
We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

196
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,852
-You sure?
-Yes.

197
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:39,092
-l guess.
-Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

198
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,848
So did you hear something you liked?

199
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,246
Hey, Ross, check it out!
l learned a new trick.

200
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,812
Hey, l bought you some lunch.

201
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:58,052
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

202
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,970
-Did you put pickles on this?
-Well, yeah.

203
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:09,089
What? What? Rach, what?

204
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,211
-What's going on?
-l made her tuna with pickle.

205
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,973
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

206
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:19,052
Giving her pickle is
like giving me salad.

207
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,047
l'm sorry, l didn't know. You okay?

208
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:26,007
l'm fine, but someone make sure
it's gone when l get out?

209
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:28,249
l'm on it!

210
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:33,243
l shouldn't be the one
making her throw up.

211
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:37,605
-lt could happen to anyone.
-Not to you. You know this stuff.

212
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,452
l don't know any of it
and l'm the father.

213
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:44,441
l wish l could be
more involved, you know?

214
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:53,651
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
l no longer eat tuna.

215
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:58,048
Can l talk to you guys for a second?

216
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,642
-Yeah.
-What's up?

217
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:04,888
Sit down.
l wanna talk about our situation.

218
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:07,812
Are you breaking up with us?

219
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:11,249
The thing is. . .

220
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:18,282
. . .because l live with Rachel,
l'm here for a lot of stuff.

221
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:22,765
And Ross is missing everything. So. . . .

222
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,372
Yeah?

223
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,093
You two should live together.

224
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,171
Are you asking me to move?
You don't want me here?

225
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:35,651
No, l love living with you.
lt just seems that. . .

226
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:40,045
. . .if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

227
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:46,044
But, Joey, l don't think Ross wants me
to move in and disrupt his life.

228
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:49,843
Or he does.

229
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:54,450
l would love to be around
for you and the baby.

230
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,884
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

231
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:01,847
-But it's you and me.
-lt wouldn't be anything romantic.

232
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:05,841
l'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

233
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:10,805
l was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

234
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,166
So, what do you think?

235
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,171
-l don't know. ls it crazy?
-No.

236
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:19,329
Joey, this is a smart idea.

237
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:22,850
Well, l was due.

238
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:25,490
-Let's do it.
-Really?

239
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,810
Rach, that's great. That's great.

240
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,243
Not too shabby.
l got this all off myself. . .

241
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:45,047
. . .using my wife's tools.

242
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,053
Oh, my God.

243
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,847
How did you get in there?

244
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,131
You're messy.

245
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:09,210
-No! You weren't supposed to see this!
-l married Fred Sanford.

246
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:12,052
Chandler, you don't understand.

247
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:19,683
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.
l'm sick.

248
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:24,842
No, honey, you're not sick. l don't
love you because you're organized.

249
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:28,045
l love you in spite of that.

250
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,051
Really?

251
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,726
-Promise you won't tell anyone?
-Yes.

252
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:39,451
Now that l know, if l've got extra
stuff, can we share the closet?

253
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,645
Well. . . . lt's just. . . .

254
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,646
l'm afraid you might mess it up.

255
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:57,688
So Rachel's all moved out?
How you taking it?

256
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,686
l wanted to have a few beers. . .

257
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:04,926
. . .but l got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell.

258
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,648
l have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium.

259
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:14,445
lt's a couple weeks past its expiration
date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

260
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:21,211
-Are you okay?
-You kidding me? Yeah, l'm great.

261
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:24,564
l'm better than great. l am good.

262
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:32,448
Now that she's gone, l can do stuff
around here that l couldn't do before.

263
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,450
Like. . . .

264
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,042
l can walk around naked again.

265
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,090
l can. . . .

266
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:42,649
l can watch porn in the living room.

267
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:45,170
This is good for me.

268
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:50,282
l like being on my own.
l'm better off this way.

269
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,848
l'm a lone wolf.

270
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:56,841
A loner. Alone.

271
00:19:57,213 --> 00:20:01,650
All alone. Forever.

272
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,922
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

273
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:18,251
That's it, just relax.

274
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,608
-Come on, more.
-Oh, God!

275
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,281
You like that, don't you?

276
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:29,845
-Yeah, right there.
-Want it there? Take it there, baby.

277
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:35,441
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, say my name. Say it.

278
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,844
And now l'm going
to cover you back up.

279
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:52,846
And l won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.
