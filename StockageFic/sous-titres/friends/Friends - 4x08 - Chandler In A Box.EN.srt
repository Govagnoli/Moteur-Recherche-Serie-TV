1
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:08,119
It's me.
I know you can 't stand to see me.

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,720
I'm trying to apologize
over the phone--

3
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,709
I shouldn 't have kissed
your girlfriend--

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,430
Stop calling!

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,719
This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,389
...calling with our $ 1000
daily challenge!

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,750
All right!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,069
What is the name of...

9
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:40,310
... your roommate who is very sorry
and would do anything--

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,119
The One with Chandler ln a Box

11
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,430
Subtitles and Rip by
.:staz:. (staz@post. cz)

12
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,709
Oh, turkey!

13
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,519
Giving thanks!

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,150
Look, everyone.
It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,510
Are things with Joey better?

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,360
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,400
... trying to get him
to talk to me.

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,160
Eight hours.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,919
You could probably use
a plug-in telephone headset.

20
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:53,349
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that are stolen from your office?

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,949
You shouldn't.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,949
Speaking of Christmas....

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,949
Since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have no money...

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,550
... this year we could do Secret Santa
and each only buy one gift.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,869
And there's the added mystery
of who gets who.

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,039
Who gets "whom. "

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,119
I don't know why I do that.

28
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,550
I'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,520
We haven't eaten yet.

30
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,429
I know, but all that work
you're doing to get it ready and....

31
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:37,750
Did you pick Rachel for your
Secret Santa? I'll trade for her.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,389
I picked her.
Thank God, you want her!

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,470
Why do you want to get
rid of her so badly?

34
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:45,949
She exchanges every gift she gets.

35
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,479
It's impossible to get her
something she likes.

36
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,160
Come on, let's trade!

37
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,000
I got her that backpack
and she loved it.

38
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,949
I remember she cried
when that big dog ran off with--

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,720
There was no big dog.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,509
This sucks! I already got her
a briefcase with "R. G. " put on it.

41
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,199
Her initials.

42
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,830
You can give it to somebody else.
Like Ross Geller!

43
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,919
You know what?
It's a girlie briefcase.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,919
Who cares!
He works in a museum.

45
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,750
The big game's about to start!

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,949
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade.

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,919
What is wrong with this freezer?

48
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,759
-What happened?
-Ice just got in my eye!

49
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,309
People are trying
to sleep in here!

50
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,360
Monica got ice in her eye
and it hurts!

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,350
-Open it up. Let me see.
-I can't. It really kills.

52
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,119
Maybe you should put
some ice on it.

53
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,479
-It looks bad.
-We should take you to a doctor.

54
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,399
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,320
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,110
He's really picky about his patients.

57
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,149
You've got to go.
What's his office number?

58
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,919
Like I remember his office number!

59
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,589
Speed dial seven.

60
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,029
I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye.

61
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,960
Is Richard Burke in today?

62
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,709
He's not in. Will she
see the on-call doctor?

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,109
She's very excited about that!

64
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,320
It's so cool.
Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.

65
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,920
And I get to make all the decisions.

66
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,640
She told you to follow
the recipe exactly.

67
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,510
Get out of my kitchen.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,989
I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,640
When I walked in,
he went to his bedroom...

70
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,399
... but he only slammed the door once.

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,399
Yeah, he gave me the finger
while doing it.

72
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,630
I've got to call my mom and
ask her a left-handed cooking question.

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,160
I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but
I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

74
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,989
You want to switch?

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,679
I was trying to trade...

76
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,950
... for you.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,920
Really? That's so nice.
What are you getting me?

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,709
I don't know, R. G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

79
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,350
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

80
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,709
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift.

81
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,630
No, I got her lots of stuff
she never took back.

82
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,869
Like?

83
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,519
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

84
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
When did she wear it last?

85
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,309
She wore it all Christmas day
and then....

86
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,470
Big dog?

87
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,269
What are you doing?

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,869
Sending back this stuff
Chandler bought.

89
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,630
Even the Tv?

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,040
No, I'll put that in my room.

91
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:01,589
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

92
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,510
But can't you hear him out?

93
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:07,589
If Chandler had kissed Rachel,
would you hear him out?

94
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,910
That's a good point.

95
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,190
How long you going to punish him?

96
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,880
Five years.

97
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,989
You've sentenced him?

98
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,119
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,190
The guy's your best friend.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,190
Was my best friend.

101
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,279
I don't know why
you're pushing for him.

102
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,910
With him out of the way as
my best friend, there's a spot open.

103
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,709
Who, me?

104
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm honored. You know what
I'm going to do as your best friend?

105
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,119
I'm going to get you
to talk to Chandler.

106
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,309
All right.

107
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,109
But if you weren't
my best friend....

108
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,190
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,880
I walk in the room,
and he won't talk to me.

110
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,920
He just mumbles something in ltalian.

111
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,679
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

112
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,029
Gunther, have you seen Chandler?

113
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,720
I thought you were Chandler.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,869
But one of you is over there.

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,079
Hey, Joe.

116
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,480
I'll be right with you.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,510
Thanks for coming in.

118
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,510
Oh, my God!
How cute is the on-call doctor?

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,709
So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,750
Dr. Burke will see you now.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,519
Not Dr. Burke.
The on-call doctor will see me now.

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

123
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,519
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

124
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,720
Ready?

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,109
Hey, I'm sorry. That--

126
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,119
-Where you going?
-My folks' .

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,320
When you coming back?

128
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,920
I don't know. I might stay there
while I look for an apartment.

129
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,549
I thought we could talk
about this. Work it out.

130
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,760
Seeing you two together, I don't....

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,070
What do you want me to say?
Should I stop seeing her?

132
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,710
It's not about her. Okay?

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,280
But seeing you together
reminds me of what you did.

134
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,840
I won't live with someone who
doesn't know what it is to be a friend.

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,960
I know what it is to be a friend.
I screwed up.

136
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,599
Yeah, you did.

137
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,510
And that's why I'm leaving.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,710
If you're not going to stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

139
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,710
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.

140
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,840
When that guy was robbing us...

141
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,349
... and I was locked in the
entertainment unit for six hours...

142
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,469
... do you know what I was doing?

143
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,109
I was thinking about
how I let you down.

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,270
If I knew what kind of friend
you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.

145
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,400
Wait one second! There has
to be something that I can do.

146
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,919
If we still had that unit...

147
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:30,669
... I'd get in it for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

148
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,919
We got a box.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,520
I remember the last time I saw you.

150
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,919
It was the morning I left for college.

151
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,109
You were standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

152
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,510
Just probably waiting for it to open.

153
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,359
You look great now.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,150
You look great too.

155
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,510
You're an excellent patient.

156
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,510
How does it look?

157
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:06,630
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.

158
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,549
Like a pirate?

159
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,909
If that helps you.

160
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:17,919
How long have you been working
with your dad?

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,119
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

162
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,320
I moved back here a couple months ago.

163
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,109
Big family dinner tonight?

164
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,320
No way!

165
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,119
I was going to have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

166
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,719
But we broke up.

167
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,719
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,030
So you made her walk the plank,
aye, matey?

169
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,590
You're not wearing the patch yet.

170
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,520
I know.

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,559
He's coming here for Thanksgiving?

172
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,989
I know. It's sick.

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,229
Why is it sick?

174
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,830
It's Richard's son!

175
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,599
It's like inviting
a Greek tragedy over for dinner.

176
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,669
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

177
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,919
I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,559
Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.

179
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,719
What's twisted?

180
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,429
Me going out with Richard's son.

181
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,159
It sounds like a really bad idea.

182
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,000
Is he okay in there?

183
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,520
He's fine!

184
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,750
If things work out
between you and Richard's son...

185
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,520
... you can tell your kids...

186
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:42,030
... that you slept
with their grandfather.

187
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,229
Judge all you want to.

188
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,679
Married a lesbian,
left a man at the altar...

189
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,349
... fell in love with a gay ice dancer...

190
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,440
... threw a girl's wooden leg
in the fire. Live in a box!

191
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,159
What exactly is the point of the box?

192
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,320
The meaning of the box is threefold.

193
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,760
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

194
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:16,640
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,719
And three...

196
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,950
... it hurts.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,119
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

198
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,950
Can I see it?

199
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,950
Why?

200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
I just want to check something.

201
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,640
Now we'll see.

202
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
Air hole! Air hole!

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,119
Here it is. I love it.
I wear it all the time.

204
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:53,400
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

205
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,830
Well, maybe...

206
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,150
... it changed.

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,669
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.

208
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,950
Isn't it better to exchange it
for something I enjoy...

209
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,440
... and can use a lot?

210
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,309
What did you get?

211
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,080
Credit.

212
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,400
I'll get it. I'll get it.

213
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,510
Hi, Tim.

214
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,119
Thank you.
Come meet my friends.

215
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,880
Phoebe.

216
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,349
And Joey.

217
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,119
My brother, Ross.

218
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,869
And Rachel.

219
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,109
That's Chandler.

220
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,710
How do you do?

221
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,750
-What's--
-Well, he's....

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,150
He's doing some thinking.

223
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,309
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend!

224
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,000
I like those sunglasses.

225
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,479
"Like them" Iike them? Or "I'd like
to get store credit" Iike them?

226
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,869
This turkey is ready.

227
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,000
Where can I wash up?

228
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
Let me show you.

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,119
The towels are hanging next
to the sink.

230
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,109
And you can use the fancy soap.

231
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,719
Fancy soap? I thought we were
saving that for the Pope.

232
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,719
See. He's nice, right?

233
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,950
Do you want a relationship
where you can actually say:

234
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,719
"That's not how your dad
used to do it?"

235
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,719
Everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

236
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,919
Saved you a seat.

237
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,719
Sick, sick, sick.

238
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,390
I'll get it.

239
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,309
Got you!

240
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,119
That doesn't sound
like thinking to me.

241
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,880
Sorry!

242
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,710
You shouldn't be talking.

243
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,000
You've got too much thinking to do
to be talking and joking.

244
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,789
Okay, you got it!

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,750
Ross, pass me the yams?

246
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,309
Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

247
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,200
Stop!
What's the matter with you?

248
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,919
We've got company.

249
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,070
Nothing's the matter with me.

250
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
I have feelings.

251
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Okay, fine.

252
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,349
You can't tell, but I'm breaking
the tension by mooning you guys.

253
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,119
All right, look!

254
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,590
If this is a big joke to you,
forget about it.

255
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,760
This means something to me.

256
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,760
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

257
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,109
Otherwise, you're just
an idiot in a box.

258
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,719
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

259
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,119
I want to be friends again.
I swear I won't say another word.

260
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,520
-So you'll take this seriously?
-Absolutely!

261
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,919
That sounds like another word to me.

262
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,109
Are you going to take this seriously?

263
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,320
Okay!

264
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,989
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

265
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,750
This is a movie stub
from our first date.

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,760
This eggshell is from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

267
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:38,320
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

268
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,909
... were together.

269
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,510
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

270
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,919
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,789
Though you're not
supposed to take these.

272
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,159
It's like a million years old.

273
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,349
We actually have people
looking for that.

274
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,800
This always happens.

275
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,750
Here, let me.

276
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,719
Thank you.

277
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,040
You have very beautiful...

278
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,400
: : :eye:

279
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,839
My friends think this is weird.

280
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,439
I thought so too. I almost
canceled, but it really isn't.

281
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,189
I know. Me and your dad,
that's totally separate.

282
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,319
I totally agree.

283
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,430
We're two people
who find each other...

284
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,760
... very attractive.

285
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,359
Right?

286
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,910
What?

287
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,709
Nothing, nothing.

288
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,680
No, really.
Was that not okay?

289
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,109
No, that was good.

290
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,709
That was a good kiss.

291
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
It reminded you of--

292
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,920
Don't say it!

293
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,680
-It did, didn't it?
-Yes!

294
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,109
I know!

295
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,680
I want you to know how sorry I am--

296
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,400
Chandler's the one I'm mad at.

297
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,119
Well, I'm still sorry.

298
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,280
Is he here?

299
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,750
In the box.

300
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,989
He can't talk right now.

301
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,199
What's going on?

302
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,270
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

303
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,680
By being in a box?

304
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,349
Joey had reasons.

305
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,189
They were threefold.

306
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,349
You not being able to talk
might make this easier.

307
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,709
Listen....

308
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,109
I don't want to be someone
who comes between two best friends.

309
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:37,869
I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

310
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,000
And I don't want to be
the cause of that.

311
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,359
I don't think we can see
each other anymore.

312
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

313
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm going to stay there for a while.

314
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,920
I think this could have been
something really amazing.

315
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,119
But, you know, this is
probably for the best.

316
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,520
You know?

317
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,829
I'm going to miss you.

318
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,709
Goodbye, Chandler.

319
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,920
Open the box!

320
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,199
He can still catch her.
Get out of there!

321
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,000
We're going to be fine.
Get out!

322
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,709
You did some real good
thinking in there.

323
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,630
I mean, this is....

324
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,239
You could still catch her!

325
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:55,040
And Merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa!

326
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,119
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

327
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,119
He sees her!

328
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,750
He's catching up to her.

329
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,310
She sees him!

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,510
They're hugging!

331
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,520
He's taking her purse.

332
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,349
That's not them.

333
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,310
I'll go call the police.

334
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,709
There they are!

335
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,160
All right, get a room.
