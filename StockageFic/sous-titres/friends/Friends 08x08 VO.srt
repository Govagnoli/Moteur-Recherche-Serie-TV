1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,082
l'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow. Wanna come?

2
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,284
Sure. He's kind of sexy.

3
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:14,164
l'll be there too.

4
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:19,366
So we'll come up with a signal.
lf it's going well, you can take off.

5
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:23,567
l need your support.
l haven't told him l'm pregnant.

6
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:24,966
Oh. Why not?

7
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:28,209
He's gonna flip out.
l hate it when he's angry.

8
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:31,051
This is all so ''Papa Don't Preach. ''

9
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:34,608
He's scary.
Once, he caught me smoking.

10
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:38,282
He said if l did it again,
he'd make me eat the pack.

11
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:40,887
Wow. Well, l will be there.

12
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:45,085
l won't let that man
make you eat your baby!

13
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,888
Hey, who is that guy?
l think l know him.

14
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:51,886
No, you don't.

15
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:56,961
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party!

16
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:01,284
Her what?

17
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:05,491
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:10,329
-Bachelorette party?
-She untied his G-string with her teeth.

19
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,442
Somebody stop me!

20
00:01:13,972 --> 00:01:19,046
We weren't gonna have parties.
We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

21
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:21,891
lt's a grand tradition!

22
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:25,483
They surprised me.
There was nothing l could do.

23
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,525
You could've untied it
with your hands.

24
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:33,084
This is so unfair. l wanted
to throw a bachelor party. . .

25
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:36,244
. . .but l wasn't allowed.
All we got was dinner.

26
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:39,410
You went home with the waitress.

27
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:42,691
Yeah, that was a good night.

28
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:44,883
Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:49,051
The two pillars of marriage
are openness and honesty.

30
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:54,047
l knew giving you that book would
come back and bite me in the ass.

31
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:56,443
The One With the Stripper

32
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:37,850
-l'll order everyone the chicken.
-Oh, l don't eat meat.

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,561
lt's chicken!

34
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:44,606
-l don't eat that either.
-l never understand you lesbians.

35
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,365
-So, what's new with you?
-Well, actually. . . .

36
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,489
Your '7 4 Lafite, sir.

37
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:57,930
l ordered the '75. That's a
magnificent wine. '7 4 is sewage!

38
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:01,090
Why would you bring me sewage?

39
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:05,120
Are you an idiot?
ls that why you're a waiter?

40
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,846
This is why l didn't want
to wait on you.

41
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:10,885
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

42
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:17,011
ln case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

43
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:20,682
He's right, though.
The '7 4 is absolute piss.

44
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:25,848
This was a huge mistake.
l can't tell him. l can't.

45
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:27,041
Rachel--

46
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:32,565
l'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.

47
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:37,927
-Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
-That's the baby's problem.

48
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:45,607
-Everything okay with the waiter?
-l don't know. l went to the bathroom.

49
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:52,203
So, sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what's new with you.

50
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,363
l got TiVo.

51
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:03,091
-What's TiVo?
-lt's slang for ''pregnant. ''

52
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:09,411
Are you pregnant?

53
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:12,690
Well, yes and no.

54
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:14,968
Except, not no.

55
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:17,368
So to sum it up, yeah.

56
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:21,611
Who is the father?
Please don't tell me it's her!

57
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,440
No, it's Ross. You like Ross.

58
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:31,123
l hope you're okay with this.

59
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,728
This is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild!

60
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,207
You're gonna be a poppy!

61
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:40,484
That's true. l'm a poppy!

62
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,124
l'm gonna be a poppy!

63
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,525
-So when is the wedding?
-The who?

64
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:53,883
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.

65
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:59,450
Young lady, don't you tell me my first
grandchild is gonna be a bastard!

66
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:04,283
-Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!
-February 2nd!

67
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:12,406
lt was cool seeing you lecture today.

68
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:17,049
Thanks. Although it seemed like
you were falling asleep.

69
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:22,491
No, l had my eyes closed so l could
concentrate and take it all in.

70
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:25,729
A lot of my students do that.

71
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:29,648
-l've got to get going.
-l'll see you tonight?

72
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:36,971
Thanks for showing me your semiprecious
stone collection. lt was amazing.

73
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,526
My God, you must be good in bed.

74
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:45,884
So you and Mona. lt's been a while.
How is it?

75
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:48,084
lt's going good.

76
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,568
l mean, we get along great.
She's so. . . .

77
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:54,884
-Hot?
-l was gonna say sweet, but yeah!

78
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:57,808
She's okay with the baby?

79
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:02,051
l haven't actually told her yet.
l don't wanna scare her off.

80
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:06,404
You have to be honest, or you may
think you're on the same path. . .

81
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:08,688
. . .but you're on different ones.

82
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:13,090
l'm gonna take that book
and beat you to death with it.

83
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:16,685
You are gonna love me so much.

84
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:19,486
l felt bad about
the bachelorette party. . .

85
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:22,843
. . .so tonight you're gonna have
a bachelor party.

86
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:27,682
l got this number from a guy at work
and l hired a stripper for you.

87
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:31,642
l'm going in the wife hall of fame!

88
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:36,130
-Honey, l don't want a stripper.
-Will you let the lady talk?

89
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:40,362
Come on, it'll be fun.
lt'll make me feel better.

90
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:46,044
l appreciate it, but it's a little
creepy. l'm not a bachelor anymore.

91
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:50,683
Just think of it as
a two-month anniversary present.

92
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:54,925
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.

93
00:06:56,212 --> 00:07:00,125
Please, l feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked!

94
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:04,088
-Fine, but l'm only doing this for you.
-Yeah!

95
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,243
And Joey.

96
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:12,691
-Who else do you wanna invite?
-Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

97
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:16,168
l can't make it.
l'm seeing Mona tonight.

98
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,927
Why cancel a real date
to go to a fake bachelor party?

99
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,369
l'm sorry.
l gotta cancel tonight, baby.

100
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:32,681
l'm sorry l won't make it to your
imaginary wedding. l'm busy that day.

101
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:38,208
l already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

102
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:42,490
l know. l panicked.

103
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:47,368
l didn't want him yelling at me
like l was some '7 4 Latour.

104
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,284
lt's Lafite.

105
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:53,008
The '7 4 Latour is actually
drinking quite nicely.

106
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:58,049
l'm gonna tell him.
l'm gonna be strong.

107
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,364
l just called a friend.

108
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:05,091
l think l may be able
to book the Plaza on short notice.

109
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,684
Really?

110
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:09,491
The Plaza?

111
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,842
Oh, Daddy!

112
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:16,721
-Daddy, l need to talk to you.
-What is it, sweetie?

113
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,125
Ross and l aren't getting married.

114
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:23,641
-l'm sorry.
-l don't believe this!

115
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:27,481
-Stay calm, please.
-How do you expect me to stay calm?

116
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:31,241
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
And l wanna know why!

117
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,285
ls it because that punk
won't marry you?

118
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:38,411
-ls that it?
-Yes. He says l'm damaged goods.

119
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,041
You nervous about getting married?

120
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:53,284
What are you doing?

121
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:57,844
Pretend it's a real bachelor party.
lt'll be more fun.

122
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:02,165
All right. l can't believe
tomorrow's the big day.

123
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:06,768
You're never gonna be
with another woman.

124
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:11,369
You have to wake up
to the same face every day. . .

125
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:15,320
. . .until you finally have
the sweet release of death.

126
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,724
You're right. This is more fun.

127
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,042
That's her! Okay, come on!

128
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,288
Which one of you is Chandler?

129
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,289
That's me!

130
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:38,601
That's me.

131
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,964
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

132
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,010
-ls that a bedroom?
-Yeah, right over there.

133
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,089
Whenever you're ready.

134
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:52,651
That was weird.

135
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,886
-Why would she go in the bedroom?
-l'm waiting.

136
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:09,884
-So she's a--
-Yeah, that's one naked hooker.

137
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:15,090
l love your place.
Where is this guy from?

138
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,489
That's an 1 8th-century artifact
from Calcutta.

139
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:19,966
Oh. Wow.

140
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,450
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

141
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,889
So much more.

142
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:35,286
Oh, my God! l am so sorry!

143
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:37,642
Forget it. lt's from Pier 1 .

144
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,245
Sorry.

145
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:50,328
Think you can knock up my daughter
and not marry her?

146
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,881
l ought to kill you!

147
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:58,687
This is actually not
a great time for me.

148
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:06,721
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.

149
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,765
-You got Rachel pregnant!
-You got her pregnant?

150
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,730
-Who did?
-You did!

151
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:17,091
Yes, but it was a one-night thing.
lt meant nothing.

152
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:21,001
Oh? Really? My daughter means nothing?

153
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:24,927
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
l love Rachel.

154
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,600
-What?
-But not that way.

155
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,690
l'm not in love.
l love her like a friend.

156
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:34,242
So you get her in trouble
and refuse to marry her?

157
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:38,650
l offered to marry her.
But l didn't want to.

158
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:43,050
Why not? You wanted to be
with this tramp?

159
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,486
Tramp?

160
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:48,082
l'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.

161
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:53,162
l can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there!

162
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,966
Maybe she's a hooker
and a stripper. . .

163
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,010
. . .but she got confused
about what to do.

164
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:03,048
Maybe. Technically, she stripped.
We just missed it.

165
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,285
Ma'am?

166
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,482
Are you also a stripper?

167
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,724
No, but l can pretend to strip.
Costs extra.

168
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,844
Here's the extras:
Handcuffs, spanking--

169
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,932
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

170
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:26,681
Getting her husband a hooker.
That's pretty funny.

171
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:31,325
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

172
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:36,208
l'll bet Ross was in on it.
He was conveniently busy.

173
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:40,247
-You mind if l smoke in here?
-Actually, l'd rather--

174
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:44,441
Go ahead. We're gonna have to
burn that room, anyway.

175
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:49,927
-How could you hide this?
-l wanted to tell you, but--

176
00:12:50,132 --> 00:12:53,681
You'd get what you wanted,
then dump her, like Rachel.

177
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:58,084
Hey, l did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

178
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,891
Can l--?

179
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:07,086
We'll just let the machine get that.

180
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:10,931
<i>Ross, it's Joey.</i>
<i>There's a hooker here.</i>

181
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:14,090
<i>We thought you'd</i>
<i>know something about it.</i>

182
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,089
No! No! No!

183
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,447
No!

184
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,882
l need to lie down.

185
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:27,005
Tonight's the bachelor party?

186
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:30,887
-Thanks for that number.
-No problem. Who's the party for?

187
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:34,323
-My husband.
-You hired your husband a hooker?

188
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,047
-She's a stripper.
-No, a hooker.

189
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:41,407
-ls that a name for strippers?
-lf they're hookers.

190
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,684
Stu, l can't believe you did this.

191
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,769
You're sure she's a hooker?

192
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:51,642
Either that, or she's the best,
most expensive date l ever had.

193
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:59,686
-Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
-Why would she do that?

194
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,765
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.

195
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:08,691
ls there anything
you're really bad at, sexually?

196
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:12,603
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.

197
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,522
-What's taking you boys so long?
-ln a minute!

198
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,366
What's gonna happen in a minute?

199
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,127
You should ask her to leave.

200
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:24,283
-Why me?
-lt's your party.

201
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:29,044
-Which is why you should do it.
-No, you do it.

202
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:33,245
Rock, paper, scissors
for who tells the whore to leave.

203
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:39,330
-What?
-l miss this.

204
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,769
l don't think we've
done this before.

205
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:45,361
No, l miss hanging out with you.

206
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:48,604
-We still hang out.
-Not like we used to.

207
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:51,730
Remember? We used to be inseparable.

208
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:56,488
You know, now it's like
things are different.

209
00:14:56,732 --> 00:15:00,725
Well, you know, things are different.
l'm married now.

210
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:04,089
Don't get me wrong,
l'm happy for you guys.

211
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:09,281
l just miss hanging out.
Just us, you know?

212
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:12,169
Yeah, l miss that too.

213
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,529
From now on,
we'll make time to hang out.

214
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:18,491
You got it. Come here.

215
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,651
Oh, God.

216
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:26,567
Listen, l am this close
to robbing you guys.

217
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:29,403
She's a hooker!
She's a--

218
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,962
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

219
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:42,251
So your dad dropped by.

220
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,568
He's a pleasant man.

221
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:48,003
-Oh, no.
-l better go.

222
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:57,129
Just over here.
l can't miss the fight.

223
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:59,090
Ross, l am so sorry.

224
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,688
l'll straighten this out
tomorrow in person.

225
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,450
Or via e-mail.

226
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:10,087
l don't care about your dad.
Mona is totally freaked out!

227
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:13,642
l'll fix that too.
What's her e-mail?

228
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,570
l'll fix this.
l swear l'll talk to her.

229
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:19,450
Okay. Thank you.

230
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:23,683
That's it?
You call that a fight?

231
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:28,522
''We were on a break! '' ''No we weren't! ''
What happened to you two?

232
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:37,448
Thank you so much
for coming back over.

233
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:40,283
Oh, good. You're here.

234
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:44,002
And l was worried that
it would be uncomfortable.

235
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,089
Mona, just hear me out.

236
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:50,086
l'm sorry about my father
yelling at you.

237
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:53,682
But you held your own.
You have to tell me how.

238
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:56,087
-Focus.
-Okay.

239
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:59,332
Yes, Ross and l used to date.

240
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,729
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

241
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:06,760
But we are definitely not
getting back together.

242
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:10,482
-How can l be sure?
-We drove each other crazy.

243
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:16,489
He was possessive, jealous.
He couldn't let the little things go.

244
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:18,723
Trying to date this woman.

245
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:23,284
None of that compared
to how kind and gentle. . .

246
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,608
. . .and thoughtful he is.

247
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,650
You probably shouldn't touch me.

248
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:32,482
l don't want something so complicated.

249
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,923
But what relationship
is not complicated?

250
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:38,891
We all have our baggage.
You must too.

251
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:42,124
Why else would you still be single?

252
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:44,721
l'm so gonna leave right now.

253
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,648
Should l leave this open?

254
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:54,047
l'm not sure.
Why didn't you just tell me?

255
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:57,324
lt has nothing to do
with how l feel.

256
00:17:57,572 --> 00:18:01,884
-You still should have told me.
-l was going to. . .

257
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:06,688
. . .but l thought you should hear it
from Rachel's father.

258
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,244
l made a mistake. . .

259
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:13,804
. . .but it's only because
l really like you. Really.

260
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:19,283
Okay. l guess you can
close the door now.

261
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:34,211
Forgot my purse.
Oh, you guys made up.

262
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,846
Good kisser, isn't he?
l'm going!

263
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:47,689
l swear l didn't know
she was a hooker.

264
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:50,285
You let her smoke?

265
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:56,250
Her ass-print is still on our quilt.
Really want to talk about smoking?

266
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,891
l'm gonna make this up to you.

267
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:01,730
l promised a stripper. . .

268
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:07,247
. . .and you're gonna get a stripper.

269
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,244
-Monica, wait.
-What?

270
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:13,048
Carry on.

271
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:32,324
These tennis shoes are so tight.

272
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:37,204
-l think l'll take them off.
-Could you not narrate?

273
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,363
Gotcha, sailor.

274
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,805
<i>Just because</i>
<i>you're not in love....</i>

275
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:56,803
-You told your dad the truth.
-An hour ago.

276
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,286
-Wanna go see a movie?
-Yes.

277
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,727
Bye, Dad.

278
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:12,727
<i>It's unacceptable! What does love</i>
<i>have to do with it?</i>

279
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:16,328
<i>There are more important things</i>
<i>than love.</i>

280
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,284
<i>You have to think about</i>
<i>the consequences of your decisions!</i>

281
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:30,643
l do think about
the consequences of my decisions!

282
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,887
What gives you the right to--?

283
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,287
Go to hell!

284
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:44,247
Stupid guy on my phone.
