1
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:05,949
I'm getting my nails done!

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:08,270
You said it was going to be fun.

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:10,829
Which it kind of is.

4
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,989
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,040
There's one right over there.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,239
That's a mailman!

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,709
That's our mailman!

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,959
Don't worry. This doesn't
make you any less of a guy.

9
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,830
That does.

10
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,479
What am I sitting on?

11
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,029
What was this woman scratching
when this broke off?

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,270
You know who had nails like that?

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,479
Oh...

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,759
: : :my: : :

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,430
... God!

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,270
The One with All the Rugby

18
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,629
Joey, let me ask you a question.

19
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,160
What does this light switch do?

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,199
Nothing.

21
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,150
Did it drive you crazy
to not know?

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,319
I know what it did.
Nothing.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,550
They put it there for something.
How can you not care?

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,120
Like this.

25
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,669
Here's another question.

26
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,750
What does the silver
knob on the toilet do?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,199
It flushes it.

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,350
Since you know, when you come over,
would you use it?

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,229
Guess who we saw today?

30
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,470
-Janice!
-Is this amazing?

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,029
-How have you been?
-Well, I'm divorced.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,839
I'm riding the alimony pony.

33
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,639
And there it is.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,440
I just came up to say "hi. "

35
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,639
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,440
I'll see you tonight.

37
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,149
I can't stand the woman!

38
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,800
What?
I thought you were crazy about her!

39
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,559
But you know all those annoying
things she did before?

40
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,429
Her voice, her laugh
and her personality?

41
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,720
They're all back!

42
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,960
And she's picked up, like,
nine new ones!

43
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,000
Why'd you bring her here?
There's people here!

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,309
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,429
You are not!
You never break up with her.

46
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,190
I don't have to break up.

47
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,119
We're not involved.
I'll do a preemptive strike.

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,119
I'll end it with her
before it starts.

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,440
My ass is, like, frozen!

50
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,240
Try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

51
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,470
I'm telling you!

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,160
I can't believe
you walk alone here at night.

53
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,509
-You hear such stories about New York.
-It's not that bad.

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,470
I mean, l, for one,
feel perfectly safe.

55
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,160
Help! Help!

56
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,789
No, no, Ross!

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,830
These are friends from home.

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,470
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,389
-Hi, mate.
-How are you, man?

60
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:11,960
That was a good one, huh?
"Help! Help! "

61
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,559
How are you?

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,950
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,799
... but I've been rather busy.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,149
We have not seen each other
since that U2 concert.

65
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,429
Oh, my God. You're right.

66
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:28,829
Actually, the last time we saw
each other was the next morning.

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,109
Oh, Liam!

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,829
Oh, Liam.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,630
So were you guys playing soccer?

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,839
Or should I call it "football"?

71
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,480
We were playing rugby.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,920
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.
You're welcome to play.

73
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,839
Ross play rugby?
I don't think so.

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,839
What's so funny?

75
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:57,079
Well, you're American, to start with.
You don't have rugby here.

76
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,040
Well, we didn't have freedom
here until 1776 either, so....

77
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,880
So, good!
We'll see you at the park at two.

78
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,440
Cheers!

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,589
Oh, boy! I just love to sing.

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,390
Yes, I know you do.

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,279
The reason people complained...

82
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,630
... was because they paid to hear
the actor sing "Old Man River. "

83
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,320
Look at us!

84
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,829
Who would've thought Cupid had
a station at 14th Street Nails?

85
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,029
Okay, we have to talk.

86
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:42,269
I'm just getting out of
a very serious relationship.

87
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,480
I know. And I'm just
getting out of a marriage.

88
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,279
Talk about "meant to be. "

89
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,589
Right. But I think this
is happening too soon.

90
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,309
Oh, too soon, too schmoon!

91
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,320
Face it, I'm not letting you
get away this time.

92
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,589
I hear you!

93
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,640
But...

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,079
... unfortunately...

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,799
: : :my company: : :

96
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,269
... is transferring me overseas.

97
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,630
Oh, no!

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,839
Where to?

99
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,109
To Paris?

100
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,750
No, not Paris.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,720
To London? Rome? vienna?

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,709
Barcelona?

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,480
Could you just stop talking
for a second?

104
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,440
Yemen.

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,910
That's right. Yes!
I'm being transferred to Yemen!

106
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,309
When?

107
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,079
I don't know exactly.

108
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:45,309
Well, I will just have to
soak up every ounce...

109
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,989
... of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes.

110
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,640
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

111
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,559
-Done?
-Yep!

112
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,559
What's up?

113
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,519
This switch is
driving me crazy.

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,109
I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

115
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:11,200
Four don't work, which means
one is controlled by the switch.

116
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,839
So I plugged things in the outlets
that make noise.

117
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,510
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise.

118
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,029
Bet I stopped listening first.

119
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,470
You know, you also could
have used lamps...

120
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,079
... and followed the light.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,239
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.

122
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,390
So, everybody ready?

123
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:35,920
Here we go!

124
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,309
Something. I hear something.
Where is it?

125
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,829
It's coming from Joey!

126
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,510
Oh, my God! That's so freaky!
Turn him off!

127
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,230
Could we put on the news?
It might be raining.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,630
Hold on. I'm watching
this rugby thing on ESPN.

129
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,630
I'm man enough to play this sport!

130
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,880
You're not even man enough to
get the channel that carries the sport.

131
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,399
Hey there, Ross!

132
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,839
Janice.

133
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,559
You know, you really didn't
have to help me pack.

134
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,880
When you said all you'd be doing
before you leave is packing...

135
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,390
... you really didn't
leave me much choice.

136
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,070
I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,429
What's going on?

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,989
I'm packing, you know,
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

139
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,429
Thanks for telling me!

140
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,719
I'm going to be pretend-moving
to Yemen. To get rid of her.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Good one!

142
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,840
Yemen! That actually sounds
like a real country!

143
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,830
I'll show you how to roll your
underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

144
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,270
It's a space-saver.

145
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,190
I do that because
it makes me look taller.

146
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,349
Come on!

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,229
-Joey, trade lives with me.
-Nope.

148
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,719
Ross, I can't believe
you said you'd play.

149
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,960
This is brutal!

150
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,630
I can handle it.

151
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,320
Please, Ross. You got hurt
playing badminton with my dad.

152
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,510
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

153
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:47,190
Look! Right here,
it's called a "scrum. "

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,750
It's like a huddle.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,440
And is a hum like a scruddle?

156
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,080
Ross, they're going kill you!

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,669
Why are you doing this, anyway?

158
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,239
You should've seen the guy
she used to date.

159
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,469
He's like "Joe Rugby" !

160
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,760
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?
That's funny!

161
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,760
Oh, I see. You did that.

162
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,510
She thought the very idea of me
playing rugby was hilarious.

163
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:20,109
So I'll show her
how tough I really am.

164
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,710
I'm sorry.
You are a tough guy.

165
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,119
The toughest paleontologist I know.

166
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,070
Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

167
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,640
Thanks.

168
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,869
Don't worry about me.

169
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,429
I'll just look energetic
and stay away from the ball.

170
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
I'll be that guy,
right outside the circle.

171
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,630
Maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

172
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,520
Stay away from that guy
and that guy...

173
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,479
... and that one.
Dude, they're all huge!

174
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,549
They're no bigger than me.

175
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,429
You're closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.

176
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,520
I'm going to go say "hello. "

177
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,469
I kind of liked it.

178
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,190
I know what to do.

179
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,429
I've got to go Red Ross.

180
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,510
You know, Red Ross?

181
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
Totally don't know.

182
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,309
That time we were in line
for Dances With Wolves...

183
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,039
... and that guy cut in front of us
and I just lost it?

184
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,630
Screamed at him, turned all red!

185
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,479
Red Ross!

186
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,039
You'll see!

187
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,989
Liam, do me a favor.

188
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,239
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

189
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,109
You don't say?

190
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,429
Good luck, babe.

191
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,349
Come on, get in here!

192
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,080
Come on!

193
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,119
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!

194
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,669
Ross, get in!

195
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,109
Joey!

196
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,440
You're not going to believe it!
Joshua came in today, and guess what?

197
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,909
He asked you out?

198
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:55,909
But I showed him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

199
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,239
Saucy!

200
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,039
-What are these?
-Electrical plans for the building.

201
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,909
Okay, should I be scared?

202
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,830
I know that switch does something.
I got these from City Hall.

203
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,640
I just paid $25
and waited for three hours.

204
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,150
Wow! lf only more people knew!

205
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,320
You really didn't have to
take me to the airport.

206
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,440
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.

207
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,479
Besides, someone had to ride
with your luggage.

208
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,799
And your friends don't seem to care
that you're leaving.

209
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,190
We're not that close.

210
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:50,150
Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.

211
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,679
Oh, no!

212
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,799
It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving
till you get on that plane.

213
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,280
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just "wait here" then.

214
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,390
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

215
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,630
One ticket?

216
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,510
I just need a pretend ticket.

217
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,669
Okay, what would you give a kid
to play with?

219
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,039
Are you traveling with a child?

220
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,159
She'll think I'm
handing you a credit card.

221
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,030
But what I'll really hand you
is a library card.

222
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,869
A ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

223
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,799
What's the matter?
ls something wrong?

224
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,880
Do you have to stay?

225
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,239
American Express?

226
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,669
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!

227
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,320
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you, with the accent.

228
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,190
That's just halftime.
There's more.

229
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,880
Did you see me?

230
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:12,400
I was pretty good.
That is one fun game!

231
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,239
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?

232
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,510
Thanks!

233
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,590
I think I'm dying.
I really do.

234
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,880
Poor baby!

235
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,750
Tell my son that I love him.

236
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,349
Excellent!
Got to have some more fun!

237
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,159
They are killing you.

238
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,750
That's not true.

239
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,750
She's right.
You have to stop!

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,909
No! I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!

241
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,190
Dude, you go back out there,
you'll be Dead Ross.

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,429
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to finish this game.

243
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,479
If you insist on it,
at least let me help you.

244
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,510
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!

245
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,109
That's not it. I just know a few things
that can help you inflict pain.

246
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,830
I like that.

247
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,510
Listen closely.

248
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,679
Devon has got a weak ankle.

249
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,880
One swift kick and he'll back off.

250
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,669
Bad ankle. Got it!

251
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,919
And that big bloke with the beard?
He's got a trick hip.

252
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,280
And David over there,
he doesn't wear a cup.

253
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,710
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay!

254
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,520
And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

255
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,390
But Liam's on my team.

256
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,479
-I don't care. Just get him!
-Go and get him!

257
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,119
I am going back in!

258
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,479
Red Ross! Yeah!

259
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,989
What are these?

260
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,359
Just some pictures
I made and hung up.

261
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,640
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?

262
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,319
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

263
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,109
Oh, my God! Look at this!

264
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,589
But there is a wire there!
It's connected to something!

265
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,550
I don't care! The wires have
come loose in your head!

266
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,910
If I could follow the wire,
I'd find out what it did.

267
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,030
And did you?

268
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,229
No.

269
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,280
It disappears behind there.

270
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,469
For a minute, I thought
it went downstairs.

271
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,790
But it didn't.

272
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,430
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.

273
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,869
Oh, my God!

274
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,270
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

275
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,319
Are you sure you
don't want a doctor?

276
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,390
No, that'll just bring me down!

277
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:56,630
This was great! I was great!
This was a great day!

278
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,030
I'm buying everyone coffee.

279
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,790
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

280
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,439
No, not you.

281
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:08,239
Your eye's still popping out.
I'll go get some ice.

282
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,959
Ice, yeah!
I'm so in the mood for ice.

283
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,829
You were amazing out there.

284
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,880
I kind of was, wasn't l?

285
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, my God!

286
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,760
I made a man twice my size cry!

287
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,949
I haven't done that since I was four and
I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

288
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,750
You really enjoyed yourself,
didn't you?

289
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,390
Are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

290
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,430
I gave a guy a bloody nose!

291
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,630
I'm not proud of it...

292
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,030
... but I really am!

293
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,319
And it's all because of you.

294
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,040
-Wonderful, amazing you.
-I think you've got a concussion.

295
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,670
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.

296
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,750
You're welcome.

297
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,630
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?

298
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,910
It's worth the pain.

299
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,640
You know what? It's not.

300
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,640
This is the final boarding call
for flight 664 to Yemen.

301
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,839
Well, I guess I gotta go.

302
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,910
My Bing-a-ling.

303
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
I'll wait for you.

304
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
How long will you be gone?

305
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,319
Well, just until we find
an energy source to replace fuel.

306
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll write you every day.

307
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:38,199
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

308
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,709
Okay. Goodbye.

309
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,800
Janice! There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.

310
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,349
And also, you said you'd leave
after I got on the plane!

311
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,589
No. I want to see you take off.

312
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,630
Well, then I guess
I'm going to Yemen.

313
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,239
I'm going to Yemen!

314
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,839
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

315
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,599
All right. The super couldn't
figure out what it did.

316
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,510
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

317
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,630
I've had seven
pretty serious shocks.

318
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,560
I give up.

319
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,550
Thank God.

320
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:45,069
I guess Joey was right.

321
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,640
It does nothing.

322
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,829
See?

323
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,949
I'm doing it!
I am totally doing it!

324
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,199
I lost it.

325
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,780
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

326
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,739
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

327
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,819
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

328
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,329
London might have gotten started...

329
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,900
... because we needed to take advantage
of the show's popularity...

330
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,329
... and go do the show on
an exotic location...

331
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,859
... and have a good time.

332
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,500
There's so many people here
from all over the world.

333
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:18,290
Lately, the show's been about us
getting excited to go to London.

334
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,859
And then we realized in real life,
we're doing that same thing.

335
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,420
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check!

336
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,380
Are you ready yet?

337
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,890
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

338
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,489
Yeah!
London, baby!

339
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,699
It's all London, baby!

340
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,859
Here we go.

341
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,540
Ross is getting married...

342
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,489
... to this young woman named Emily.

343
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:48,130
And I set them up by accident.

344
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,339
Why don't we?

345
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,689
Why don't we what?

346
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,699
Get married.

347
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:57,939
I've started to...

348
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,660
... fall for this character, Emily,
played by Helen Baxendale.

349
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,219
And we decided to go all the way,
I guess, and get married.

350
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,780
Ross has asked me to marry him.
I say yes.

351
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:11,660
And so we arrange
a big wedding in London.

352
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:13,060
Things go a bit wrong.

353
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,180
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

354
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,420
You have to meet me in the middle.

355
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,459
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass!

356
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,099
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

357
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,369
That's it!

358
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:29,939
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

359
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,819
This is our wedding day!

360
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,339
From now on, everyone gets along.

361
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,729
And if I hear one more word...

362
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:39,540
... no grandchildren!
That's right!

363
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,010
Sorry, old boy.

364
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,900
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

365
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,729
We knew the show
was popular in England...

366
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:53,020
... and so it seemed like
a natural fit.

367
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:57,609
I knew how big the show was over here.
It was exciting to be welcomed.

368
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:00,130
Everywhere, walking down the street...

369
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,739
... bunches of kids watching.
So we've been signing autographs.

370
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:06,290
They're just big fans of the show,
I guess.

371
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,689
I watch it all the time
because my children love it.

372
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:11,339
They absolutely love it.

373
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,939
Tell my friend you like my hat.

374
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,380
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

375
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:20,380
Hi, Chandler!

376
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:23,339
We wanted it to
still feel like Friends...

377
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:26,300
... and so we shot a lot of it
in front of an audience.

378
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,540
And it seemed like
a really exciting opportunity...

379
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,300
... to shoot an American sitcom
in front of a British audience.

380
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,290
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

381
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,500
I'll be the on-camera guy.

382
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:43,219
All right. First stop...

383
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,489
... Westminster Abbey.

384
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,770
What is that?

385
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:49,300
That's London, baby!

386
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,339
We were really afraid, going over,
that either they'd be...

387
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,900
... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh....

388
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,699
They were great!

389
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,500
-Big laughers!
-They waited in line for hours!

390
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:06,089
-We traveled 329 miles.
-She's lying. It's more like 200.

391
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:10,099
The show's doing so well over here
that it just seems like...

392
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,500
... they're real, real receptive.

393
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:18,609
It's really wonderful and flattering
and overwhelming, truthfully.

394
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,209
We didn't have
a single bad audience.

395
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:24,609
Also, there was
a greater sense of "event. "

396
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:28,699
I think it energized everybody:
the actors, the writers....

397
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,420
We're just excited to be here.

398
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,050
Like, look back there.
Look how cool that is!

399
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,339
We missed Lisa.

400
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:39,050
That was probably the only
drawback I can think of.

401
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,300
I first thought, "How exciting!
I wonder if I'm going?"

402
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,420
It's awful that Lisa's not here.

403
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,140
We feel like
we have a limb missing.

404
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,579
Let's try some aversion therapy.

405
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,300
Look at the picture.

406
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,810
It's strange when one person's
not there. We miss her.

407
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,939
It's weird for all of us
to be here without her.

408
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,140
She's in the episode, on the phone
and things like that.

409
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,579
Hey, Pheebs!
It's Joey.

410
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,739
Hey, Joey!

411
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:17,099
I just saw someone that looks just
like you, on the subway.

412
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,770
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

413
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,699
That just cost me four bucks.

414
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:26,500
Part of me wishes I could go.

415
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:31,099
But I'm very happy to not get
on a plane for a lot of hours....

416
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:33,619
Sorry.
I'm not a good traveler.

417
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:35,300
The Waltham residence.

418
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,739
Is this Emily's parents' house?

419
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:39,859
This is the housekeeper.

420
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,900
And by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

421
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,859
First one identifies oneself...

422
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,260
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

423
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:56,339
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

424
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:59,300
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

425
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,300
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

426
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,459
It was also interesting because
we had shot about a third of it here.

427
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,729
And a bit of it
on the streets in London.

428
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:10,739
All right!

429
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,780
Westminster Abbey!

430
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:15,819
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

431
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:22,050
What do you think of the Abbey?

432
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,099
I think it's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

433
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:29,459
-To what?
-To "Put the camera away" !

434
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,500
Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. "

435
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:36,140
It was a really gratifying experience.

436
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,500
Pretty much everything we'd hoped
to get out of it, we got.

437
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:19,060
When you can go on location even
in Los Angeles that's exciting...

438
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,859
... much less have your whole crew...

439
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,449
...come out to "jolly old England. "
It's really, really exciting.

440
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:30,410
Just the idea of bringing
our entire "family" over here...

441
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,180
... is, like, wild.

442
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,219
Yeah!
London, baby!

443
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,209
It's amazing to me how many people
are excited about the show.

444
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:43,219
I knew how big the show was over here.
It plays a lot on television.

445
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,050
I saw it three times in one week.

446
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,420
They're very popular at home,
but I didn 't know they would be here.

447
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,219
It's got a massive following
in Britain...

448
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:55,849
... particularly among my generation.

449
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:58,489
It's quite sarcastic.
That's why it's popular.

450
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:02,010
We have great English character actors
who are working with us.

451
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,410
And an opportunity to interact
with the English crew.

452
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,260
We're about to be Ross' in-laws.

453
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:10,770
We're the Brits
that you love to hate.

454
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,660
We worked with
Sarah Ferguson this morning.

455
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,219
She was great and funny.

456
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,060
I was excited to be here today.

457
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,530
It's the first time I've ever done this
and I enjoyed it.

458
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,130
I am a great fan.
I think they are all marvelous.

459
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,140
Most British people tried to hate them
for being beautiful and funny.

460
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,660
I got a phone call:

461
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,859
"Small part, a few lines.
Do you want it?

462
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,459
Next to Jennifer Aniston. "

463
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:37,489
And I went, "Oh, wait a minute....
Oh, okay then. "

464
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:42,219
It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits
up the butt" episode, really.

465
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,619
You're gonna see a lot of comedy,
a lot of romance...

466
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,250
... and a lot of surprises.

467
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,219
And you get to see England.

468
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:55,020
Call the Queen Mum,
say you enjoy watching Friends...

469
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:58,979
... and that you know us, and she'll
have you over for tea like that.
