1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:04,127
All right!

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:07,888
Yes! From home to the hospital
in seven minutes!

3
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:11,250
Yes. The hard part is truly over.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,566
We're off to a great start, aren't we?

5
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,282
l knew l'd get here fast,
but this has to be a record!

6
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:21,531
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.

7
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:26,489
-How the hell did you beat us here?
-We took a cab. Did you walk?

8
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:30,248
No, we took a cab too.
But l did test runs--

9
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:31,961
Hey, you made it!

10
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:36,852
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?

11
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:41,007
Ross, you stay here and talk.
l'm gonna go have a baby.

12
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:46,008
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene. l'm
Ross Geller. We called from the car.

13
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:49,131
We have a semi-private
labor room waiting--

14
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:54,526
Oh, whoa! l'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.

15
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,806
Yes, l see that here.
We can't guarantee a private room.

16
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:04,366
-Currently, they're all unavailable.
-Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

17
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:08,043
l'm sorry. Semi-private rooms
are all we have.

18
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:11,762
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

19
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:18,451
-Give her some money.
-l really think they're out of rooms.

20
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:23,243
They're saving them for important
people! What if l was the president?

21
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:28,208
We'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.

22
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,252
Okay.

23
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:34,323
Say, would you mind checking again?

24
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,685
See if any private rooms
may have opened up?

25
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,604
This is a hospital.

26
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:45,089
You know what?
l don't really care for your tone.

27
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:50,930
This is not the only hospital in the
city. We have no problem-- Oh, gosh!

28
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,845
-What, what?
-Contraction!

29
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,412
Oh!

30
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:01,607
-Like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

31
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,843
The One Where Rachel Has A Baby - Part l

32
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,048
You're 2 centimeters dilated.
We need to get to 1 0.

33
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,324
-lt will be a while.
-Oh, okay.

34
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:47,452
-l'll be back in an hour to check on you.
-Thank you.

35
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:52,246
-l guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.

36
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:55,166
Oh, check these out.

37
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,172
Never done this before.

38
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,002
Yeah, well, it looks great.

39
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:13,132
Thank you very much.
l think we're ready to. . . .

40
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:24,083
Hi, l'm Ross. l'm here to ruin
this magical day for you.

41
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:27,490
Not at all. Marc Horger.
This is my wife, Julie.

42
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,690
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.

43
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,969
-ls this your first?
-lt is.

44
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,772
Well, little Jamie here is our third.

45
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:39,249
So if you have any questions,
just holler.

46
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,286
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.

47
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:48,847
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.

48
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:52,284
We are gonna share every
moment of this with you.

49
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:56,128
-l think we're gonna have some fun.
-Yeah.

50
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,523
-Oh, okay, l guess.
-Hey, smile!

51
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:00,649
-No.
-l really don't want any--

52
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:01,922
Oh, thank you.

53
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:06,245
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.

54
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,483
Okay, just breathe. . . .

55
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:12,083
-Oh, honey, l think l'm having one too!
-Oh, my God!

56
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:19,929
-Hey, look at this. Here you go!
-Oh, no!

57
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:27,967
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

58
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:32,530
The miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.

59
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:38,127
-Hey, you wanna see something?
-Sure. What?

60
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,370
This will be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.

61
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,569
-Honey?
-Yeah?

62
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,725
Listen, l've been doing
some thinking. . .

63
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,812
. . .and l don't know whether
it's because we're here. . .

64
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:53,612
. . .or Rachel's giving birth. . .

65
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:57,561
. . .but l think we should
try to have a baby.

66
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:02,884
Okay.

67
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,371
What's that now?

68
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:10,606
Okay. l've been thinking about it too.
l think we're ready.

69
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:16,368
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby?

70
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:17,926
Oh, this is fun.

71
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,687
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!

72
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,445
You said you were ready.

73
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:29,686
l was screwing with you to get
your voice high and weird. . .

74
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,172
. . .like mine is now!

75
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:34,411
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid forever?

76
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,127
Okay, just back off, mister!

77
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,006
Because l am ready to have a baby.

78
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,641
l just want Joey to be the father.

79
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:49,964
-What? Are you crazy?
-Right there! That's all l wanted!

80
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:55,570
l'm sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.

81
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,884
Oh, that's very--
Really, very, very okay.

82
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:04,531
Julie's cervix is dilated seven
centimeters. That's about four fingers!

83
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:08,450
-Doctor let me feel it.
-Have you felt Rachel's?

84
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:11,770
-No, l don't--
-We won't be doing that.

85
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:16,211
Well, you could feel Rachel's,
then feel mine to compare.

86
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:20,964
-Am l interrupting?
-Yes! Thank you! Later.

87
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,687
-You can't leave me with them.
-Sorry.

88
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:28,643
No, Ross, Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!

89
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:34,206
l'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. l wish you'd called first.

90
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,881
l'm coming back later with your father.

91
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:41,046
-l need to talk to you before the birth.
-Okay. What's up?

92
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,046
l brought something
that l want to give you.

93
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,364
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

94
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:51,050
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

95
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:56,331
Your grandma's engagement ring,
l want you to give it to Rachel.

96
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:59,889
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you. . . .
-Just hear me out--

97
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:04,444
No! Okay? We're not getting
married because she's pregnant.

98
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:11,007
Honestly, this isn't just some girl
you picked up in a bar and humped.

99
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,330
A child should have a family.

100
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,093
l can't deal with this now. l'm sorry.

101
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:22,087
Think about it. lf you don't,
l'll talk more about humping.

102
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,045
Give me that.

103
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:27,883
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

104
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:30,846
Ross, get in here!

105
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,402
She dragged me out of the labor room
to ask me why l'm not with Rachel.

106
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:44,566
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-Are you kidding?

107
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:48,521
We're not gonna be together
because we're having a baby!

108
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,883
lt seems you belong together.

109
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,887
l can't deal with this right now.
l have to go have a baby.

110
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,561
Right. And with who again?

111
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,923
He's crazy. Why doesn't
he wanna be with Rachel?

112
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,122
l know.

113
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:07,525
She's like the perfect woman.
l know she turned me down. . .

114
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:12,813
. . .but if she wanted to be with me,
l would take her in my arms and. . . .

115
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,728
l haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while.

116
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,687
-Hey.
-Hey.

117
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:27,367
-Who's that?
-New people.

118
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,806
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

119
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:37,127
They're having their baby.
lt's not fair, Ross. l got here first!

120
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:39,853
After you left, they wheeled her off.

121
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:45,929
Not before she gave me a nice, juicy
shot of little Jamie, crowning away.

122
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,646
Wow. Sorry.

123
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,373
So how are the new people?

124
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,122
Well, they have some unusual
pet names for each other.

125
00:08:54,293 --> 00:09:00,368
lncluding ''Evil Bitch''
and ''Sick Bastard. ''

126
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:05,204
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

127
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,324
-Are you looking at her?
-No!

128
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:12,527
-Don't look at her, you sick bastard!
-l swear l wasn't looking at her!

129
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:17,761
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?

130
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:21,602
l'm just gonna--

131
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:25,448
See? lt's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.

132
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:30,971
No, no. l'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.

133
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:35,602
You miss your girlfriend?

134
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,052
Just ignore them.

135
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,608
-You okay?
-Yeah.

136
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,168
-Ross!
-What?

137
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,803
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!

138
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,844
Wanna live to see your baby?

139
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:57,171
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
you stupid bastard!

140
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:05,165
Oh, good God! lf you want
a baby so bad, just go steal it!

141
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:10,444
Since when are you
so crazy about babies?

142
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:14,805
l'm not crazy about babies.
l'm crazy about us.

143
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,482
What?

144
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:21,330
We talk about having
babies someday, not now. . .

145
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:26,487
. . .but l'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.

146
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,247
We're really good.

147
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:31,611
We are pretty good.

148
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,805
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.

149
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,410
Well, maybe l'm ready now.

150
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:42,447
l mean, it's a little scary,
but maybe it's right.

151
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,531
lt's not right!
We're not ready for a kid!

152
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:49,772
-What?
-l'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

153
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:55,168
So we're gonna try?
l mean, we're trying?

154
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,967
We're trying to get pregnant.

155
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,448
l'm not comfortable doing
this in front of the babies.

156
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:10,807
-So when do you want to start trying?
-All right, hold on a sec.

157
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:13,727
-Period math?
-Yeah.

158
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,450
Well, we could start trying now.

159
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:23,085
-Right here?
-No, not here.

160
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:25,528
Maybe here.

161
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:29,732
We got time to kill. We're in
a building that's full of beds!

162
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:32,049
And it's so clean!

163
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,885
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

164

-No.

165
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:51,562
-l'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.

166
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,886
Hey, l got one! l got one!

167
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:58,642
-Hi.
-Hi.

168
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:02,283
-Oh, up or down?
-Oh. Down, please.

169
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:08,529
l hate to be a ball-buster,
but can l just do it?

170
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,561
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.

171
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:19,171
-l feel bad. l broke my leg once too.
-How did yours happen?

172
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,682
lt's a long, embarrassing story.

173
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:26,847
Let's just say, there was a
typographical error with a sex manual.

174
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:29,442
-How about you?
-Car accident.

175
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:34,249
-ldiot on a cell not paying attention?
-Yeah. Me.

176
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,125
Oh, hey, that's me.

177
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,850
Hey, l take it you're
just visiting someone.

178
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:47,245
Well, if you have some time,
and you wanna visit someone else. . . .

179
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,131
Yeah. l would like that.

180
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:54,845
-Great. l'm in room--
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

181
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,568
You gotta press the button.

182
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,086
They're bringing in another woman.

183
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:06,369
Oh. ls she pregnant yet?

184
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:10,964
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before l do.

185
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:15,570
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.

186
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,371
That's it.

187
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:22,845
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.

188
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:27,604
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.

189
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:34,568
Oh, that was a big one.

190
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:44,285
Could you help me? The patient
l'm looking for has a broken leg.

191
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:48,651
He's in a wheelchair. He's early
to mid-30s, very attractive.

192
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:53,244
-l know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room is he in?

193
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,126
Sorry. That information is restricted.

194
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:01,731
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?

195
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:07,326
Ramoray. lt's Portuguese.
We need that information. l'm a doctor.

196
00:14:07,573 --> 00:14:11,452
-At this hospital?
-Damn it! We're losing precious time.

197
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:15,652
You want this man's blood
on your head-- Hands!

198
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:20,523
lt is essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.

199
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,809
He's a patient of mine.

200
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:25,447
-He's in room 81 6.
-81 6. Thank you.

201
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:28,286
-And what is his name?
-No.

202
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:41,209
-l think we found a place.
-Okay.

203
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:47,004
-Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
-Okay.

204
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,607
-We'll dim the lights.
-Okay.

205
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:52,651
Or turn them out altogether.

206
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:57,651
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.

207
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,408
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.

208
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:10,044
Okay. l'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?

209
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:12,370
Oh, right!

210
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,852
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.

211
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:27,481
This is it!

212
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,087
-That's him!
-Great. Go get him!

213
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:35,567
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.

214
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,167
He's not really my type.

215
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,451
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him
questions and see what he's like.

216
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:46,083
-People tell doctors everything.
-You said he's great.

217
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:50,525
Guys l meet seem nice at first,
then turn out to be big jerks.

218
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,850
-You do attract some stinkers.
-l know.

219
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:58,163
Dr. Long, l've been at this
for 1 7 hours.

220
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,801
Three women have had their babies.

221
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:05,529
Give me good news. How many
centimeters am l dilated? Eight? Nine?

222
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:07,763
-Three.
-Just 3?

223
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:10,248
l'm dilated 3!

224
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:16,445
We are moving along slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.

225
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:19,889
-l'll be back soon.
-Thank you.

226
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,650
l'm not waiting.
l'm gonna push this baby out.

227
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:29,523
l'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?

228
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:35,525
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.

229
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:38,723
Oh! Oh! Oh!

230
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,965
We'll take you straight
to the delivery room.

231
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:45,728
Oh, for the love of God!

232
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:52,331
l'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. l have a few
routine questions l need to ask you.

233
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:54,688
l've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

234
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,851
l know. l'm a neurologist.
To be safe. . .

235
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:02,882
. . .Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.

236
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,608
Dr. Wells is a woman!

237
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:09,646
That was a test. Good response.

238
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:14,290
-All right. Full name?
-Clifford Burnett.

239
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,644
-Date of birth?
-November 1 6, 1 968.

240
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,047
Age?

241
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:25,766
-Can't you figure that out?
-l'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

242
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,486
-l'm 33.
-Okay.

243
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,688
-And are you married?
-No.

244
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:39,287
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would
you say you have commitment issues?

245
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,445
Are all the questions this personal?

246
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,092
Yes.

247
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,325
Well, if you must know, l'm a widower.

248
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:53,412
-Oh, that's terrible. l'm really sorry.
-Yeah.

249
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,641
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

250
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,770
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.

251
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:06,371
And finally, are you into any weird
stuff, you know, sexually?

252
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:10,762
-No!
-Wrong answer.

253
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:15,646
-What else? What else?
-He's 33.

254
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:17,451
-A widower.
-Oh!

255
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:22,932
He seemed like a standup guy. And
he's not into anything weird sexually.

256
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,442
Enter Pheebs!

257
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:32,249
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, listen to me!

258
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,768
Since l've been waiting,
four women. . .

259
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:38,443
. . .one higher than the centimeters
l'm dilated. . .

260
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:43,733
. . .have come and gone with their babies.
l'm next. My turn. lt's only fair.

261
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:48,967
lf you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, l will sue you.

262
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:53,291
Not this hospital. l'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.

263
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:57,128
-Rach?
-You get back on that case, honey!

264
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,245
l don't think the next
patient is far along.

265
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:03,889
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

266
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:16,932
Oh, my God!

267
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:33,847
l can't believe this!

268
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,690
And yet, somehow, it's true.

269
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:44,645
l mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!

270
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,129
Squeeze your legs together,
cover the baby's ears.

271
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:53,610
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hi, sweetheart.

272
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:57,448
This is my husband, Sid.
l don't think you've met him.

273
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:03,086
l nabbed him at the dermatologist's.
Thank God for adult acne!

274
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:07,041
l can't believe it.
l'm the luckiest guy in the world.

275
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,965
Really?

276
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:10,968
What did he say?

277
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:14,848
You have to speak loudly,
he's almost completely deaf.

278
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:18,329
-Oh, there you go.
-Of course he is.

279
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:22,327
Congratulations!
l didn't even know you got married.

280
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:25,610
-Oh, no. We didn't.
-What?

281
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:31,046
We're just having this baby together,
but that's all. You know?

282
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,931
Why?

283
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:41,082
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.

284
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:44,012
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

285
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:47,248
Just tell me how.

286
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:50,851
Oh, l feel another one coming.
