1
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:06,242
Great.
l'll just change the film.

2
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:11,128
l know l'm not supposed to know,
but l do and l'm so excited.

3
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:15,121
-What's going on?
-Monica's pregnant.

4
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:18,483
ls that why you had to get married?

5
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:23,163
-l'm not pregnant!
-Ah, slow swimmers?

6
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:29,240
-You're not pregnant?
-Did you tell anybody l was?

7
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:33,764
No.
l'll be right back.

8
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:36,440
l'll shoot Monica
and the bloody soldier.

9
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:41,282
-You gotta change before the party.
-l don't have any other clothes.

10
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:46,885
Find anything that doesn't say,
''l died tragically in France. ''

11
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:50,402
Let's see the bride and groom,
and the bridesmaids.

12
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:55,924
-Why did you say you're not pregnant?
-'Cause l'm not.

13
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:59,329
We found your test in the trash.
lf you're not pregnant. . .

14
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:06,928
. . .it's because l am.

15
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:12,252
-What are you talking about?
-l am with child.

16
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:17,845
l didn't say anything
because it's your day.

17
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:20,122
So you told people l was pregnant?

18
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:24,407
Does this look like
a moment to remember?

19
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:28,321
-Who's the father?
-l can't say.

20
00:01:28,532 --> 00:01:33,731
-Why not?
-l can't say because he's famous.

21
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:37,331
Oh, my God, who is it?

22
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:40,684
Come on, you have to tell us.

23
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:43,406
-Okay. lt's James Brolin.

24
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:50,483
-James Brolin is the father.
-Barbra Streisand's husband?

25
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:54,924
What? He never said that to me.

26
00:01:56,612 --> 00:01:58,648
The One After 'l Do'

27
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:34,729
Let's get Chandler
and the bridesmaids.

28
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:39,369
-How about just the bridesmaids?
-You know, l am the groom.

29
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:47,440
-Oh, my God!
-Thank you for doing that!

30
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:51,520
-You said Monica was pregnant.
-You did, l just didn't disagree.

31
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,163
Sneaky!

32
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,012
Smile, ladies!

33
00:02:57,212 --> 00:03:00,284
-By the way, James Brolin?
-l know.

34
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:04,770
l could only think of two names:
him and Ed Begley Jr.

35
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,930
Then l remembered he's gay, so. . . .

36
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:12,724
-Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
-Really?

37
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:26,690
Thank you very much. lt gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you:

38
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:29,929
Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!

39
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:39,922
-Before we go, l got a present.
-l won't put my hand in your pocket.

40
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:43,568
No.
l've been taking dancing lessons.

41
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:47,162
l wanted this to be memorable.

42
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,249
That is so sweet!

43
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:54,083
So will you join me in our first dance
as husband and wife?

44
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:02,287
-What is it?
-These new shoes are all slippery.

45
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,882
-Will you be able to do this?
-Not well.

46
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,928
Good news!
l don't think anyone's looking.

47
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:19,925
-Are you ready to talk about it?
-No.

48
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,291
Now?

49
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:25,891
No!

50
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:31,212
Okay, we'll talk about
something else. Who's the father?

51
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:37,009
l haven't told him yet, so l don't
think l should tell anybody else.

52
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:40,249
That's fair. ls it Tag?

53
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:45,406
l'm sorry, l'll stop.
ls it Ross?

54
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,365
-Oh, my God, it's Joey!
-Stop it.

55
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:51,040
l'm not telling you until l tell him.

56
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:54,164
At least we know it's a him.

57
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:02,409
-Oh, sweet Lord.
-l'm sorry, okay?

58
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:06,161
lt was either this or a bathrobe.

59
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,842
What's more important?
My clothes, or being here today?

60
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:13,965
l'm not even going to pretend
to be listening.

61
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,966
l don't think we met.
l'm Ross, Monica's brother.

62
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:27,528
Hi, l'm Mona from her restaurant.

63
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:30,883
Hello, ''Mona from her restaurant. ''

64
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:40,166
-Mona. What a beautiful name.
-l always kind of hated it.

65
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:42,642
Come on! Mona Lisa?

66
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:45,161
Mona. . .

67
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,488
. . .Klegglachen?

68
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,406
The famous botanist.

69
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:53,888
She's-- Well, she's dead now.

70
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:58,802
But she was once
the hottie of the plant world.

71
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:05,128
-l never knew about her.
-Linda Klegglachen. . . .

72
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:13,725
So, what table are you at?
Me too.

73
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,850
Good. There will be
someone who likes my name.

74
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,652
Yes, there will.

75
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:30,206
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

76
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:34,928
lf it's all right with you,
l'll take your place at table six.

77
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,726
Martin Klegglachen!

78
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:42,840
That's better. Bend your arms,
look straight ahead.

79
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:47,091
This time,
really put your ass into it.

80
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:55,252
Look, my date has arrived.
l want you to meet Dennis Phillips.

81
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:57,488
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

82
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,162
Dennis is a dear old friend.
And a fantastic lover.

83
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:05,206
Bravo, Dennis,
thanks for pleasing my mother so.

84
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,767
l missed the ceremony
because l was at auditions.

85
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,167
Dennis is directing
a Broadway show.

86
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:14,567
l don't believe we've met.

87
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:19,282
l've admired your work for years.

88
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,564
Thank you.
Excuse me, l'll get myself a drink.

89
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:24,490
l'll be back in a moment.

90
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:29,442
-Dennis Phillips! How did you meet?
-lt's a funny story.

91
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:32,405
Funny ''ha-ha,'' or funny--?

92
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:44,565
Thank you. lf you'll take your seats,
dinner will be served.

93
00:07:55,932 --> 00:08:00,926
-l thought you were at table six.
-No. Nine.

94
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:07,287
When you showed it to me,
you held it that way. . .

95
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:11,405
. . .which was misleading.

96
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,040
Hello.

97
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:33,405
Can you see if your mom can give
my résumé to Dennis Phillips?

98
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:36,684
lf l got a Broadway show,
l would've done it all:

99
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:42,569
Film, television and theater.
Not radio, but that's for ugly people.

100
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,401
-What size shoes do you wear?
-Eleven.

101
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:50,571
My shoes are giving me a problem.
Can l borrow your boots?

102
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:54,287
l don't know where l left them, so. . . .

103
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:59,011
-Those aren't 1 1 s.
-Okay, fine, l'm a 7!

104
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:03,000
All right, l have small feet.
But the rest of me is good!

105
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:10,249
-l can't believe Phoebe's pregnant.
-Let's not talk about that now.

106
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:14,161
-This is so huge.
-Sure, but as big as your wedding?

107
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:17,523
Of course not. Nothing is.

108
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:22,608
ln this day and age, how dumb
do you have to be to get pregnant?

109
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:26,766
Sometimes you can wear
everything you're supposed to. . .

110
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:30,442
. . .and one of those little guys
just gets through.

111
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:34,486
-How?
-l don't know, maybe they have tools.

112
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:38,526
She said she's
definitely having the baby.

113
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:41,411
She's gonna raise it on her own.

114
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:44,928
Maybe that's really brave.

115
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:48,966
l just hope she realizes
how hard it's gonna be.

116
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:54,051
Maybe she hasn't really
thought it through that much.

117
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,049
There's a lot to think about.

118
00:09:56,572 --> 00:10:00,770
How is she gonna
handle it financially?

119
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:06,649
Does she realize she's not gonna
have a date for the next 1 8 years?

120
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:14,360
-l don't know.
-Are you okay?

121
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:20,683
l'm just thinking
about poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

122
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:24,931
-Champagne?
-Thank you very much.

123
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,604
That's how the French drink it.

124
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:51,449
Well, l just got off the phone
with my lover, James Brolin.

125
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:56,921
-Really?
-And he is married to some singer.

126
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:02,481
But he said he'd leave her for me.
So l said, ''Are you sure?''

127
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,081
-And he said--
-Rachel's pregnant?

128
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,288
What?

129
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:12,890
-Why bother?
-How do you feel?

130
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,601
l don't know.

131
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:19,282
l have to make all these decisions
that l don't want to make.

132
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:24,168
-Someone take this away from me!
-Maybe you're not pregnant.

133
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:29,165
When l got pregnant,
l took the test three times.

134
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:33,843
Yes. Are you sure
you peed on the stick right?

135
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:36,771
How many ways are there?

136
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:41,284
l'm just saying,
don't freak out until you're sure.

137
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,403
l'll take it again at home.

138
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:47,201
You gotta take it now,
as a present to me.

139
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,200
Okay. Thank you.

140
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:52,290
-l'll run out and get you one.
-You're great.

141
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,448
Wait a minute. Who's the father?

142
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:59,168
-She won't tell us.
-Come on! lt could be my present.

143
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:03,809
-l just gave you peeing on a stick.
-This is why you register.

144
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:14,523
lt was the chair again.
l'm not doing it!

145
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,605
lt was-- Look, l don't.
You know what. . .?

146
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:26,448
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure.

147
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:31,645
-Dr. Geller?
-l wasn't farting!

148
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:37,725
A little game from our table.

149
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,887
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

150
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:47,563
Maybe later.
l'm about to dance with this lady.

151
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:55,927
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

152
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:59,841
l'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

153
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,885
Yes, l am.

154
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:07,688
ln fact, let's try my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

155
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:09,166
Hop on.

156
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:18,448
ls the pretty lady looking?
Keep dancing.

157
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,850
And the world will never know.

158
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:36,126
-Did you talk to Dennis?
-l told him how talented you were.

159
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:41,167
-And about <i>Days of our Lives.</i>
-No, you don't tell him that!

160
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:45,081
-He'll think l'm just a soap actor.
-But you're not!

161
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:49,729
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

162
00:13:57,852 --> 00:14:00,002
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Miranda.

163
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,772
-Melinda.
-All right.

164
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:07,488
-How cute was that?
-Were you watching?

165
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:11,650
Can l go next?

166
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,412
Of course you can. Hop on.

167
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,600
But l get to hop on after her.

168
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:26,731
-l am so gonna score!
-What?

169
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,765
l like your bow.

170
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:38,370
l'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler. . .

171
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:42,804
. . .the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

172
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:48,644
When l first found out they were
getting married, l was a little angry.

173
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:53,448
''Why, God? How can you
take them away from me?! ''

174
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:57,483
But then l thought back over our
memories together.

175
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,206
Happy memories.

176
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:06,207
And there were some sad memories.

177
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,968
l'm sorry.

178
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:14,761
And some scared memories.

179
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:24,447
And then l realized
l'll always be their friend.

180
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:28,201
A friend who can speak
in many dialects. . .

181
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:33,725
. . .has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

182
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,730
To the happy couple.

183
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,321
-That was nice.
-Can we do it again?

184
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:48,682
No, no.

185
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:53,608
-So is it my turn?
-l'm next.

186
00:15:56,012 --> 00:16:00,528
-Okay, you can dance with her first.
-Are you sure?

187
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,647
-What's your name?
-Gert.

188
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,685
That's pretty.

189
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,164
What are you doing, Gert?

190
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:19,967
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls.

191
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:26,003
Okay. Hop on, Gert.

192
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:34,403
-Why aren't you moving your feet?
-l'm trying.

193
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,411
You're not going fast enough.

194
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,649
Maybe l should stand on your feet!

195
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:48,928
Did you happen to catch my toast?

196
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:53,888
-Was that for my benefit?
-There was something for everyone.

197
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:59,325
-l know you're casting for a show.
-l don't think you're right for it.

198
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:03,320
You're wrong.
Whatever it is, l can do it.

199
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:07,571
-Try me.
-lt's an all-Chinese cast.

200
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:10,809
Can you be Chinese?

201
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:15,563
-l'm not proud of this, but. . . .
-No, please!

202
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:21,401
-Want to go back to the dance floor?
-Did it turn into sand?

203
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:26,402
-Come on, you'll be fine.
-No, l won't.

204
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:30,165
Know why l took all those lessons?

205
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:35,765
l didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen with some clumsy idiot.

206
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,921
You could never embarrass me.
Okay, you could easily do that.

207
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:43,646
But it doesn't matter.

208
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:48,801
l married you.
So l'm gonna dance with my husband.

209
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:54,241
Just try not to move your feet at all.

210
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,850
There you go.

211
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:08,608
l'm gonna have you arrested.
You stole my moves.

212
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:15,048
-How much longer?
-Thirty seconds.

213
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:17,245
Did l miss it?

214
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,648
Rachel, l want you to know. . .

215
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:27,690
. . .that if it's positive, we--

216
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:31,328
-l know.
-You do? Okay.

217
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,003
lt's time.

218
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,449
No!

219
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:43,726
-Go ahead, Rach.
-l can't look at it.

220
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:47,004
Somebody tell me.

221
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,683
lt's negative.

222
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:57,244
-What?
-lt's negative.

223
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:08,250
Well, there you go.

224
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:16,127
That's really great, great news.

225
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,047
Because the whole. . .

226
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:27,644
. . .not being ready,
the financial aspects, all that. . . .

227
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:34,607
This is just the way
it was supposed to be.

228
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:39,722
Well then, great.

229
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:44,610
This is so stupid.

230
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:51,085
How can l be upset
over something l never had?

231
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:56,002
-lt's negative?
-No, it's positive.

232
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:04,005
-What?
-lt's not negative, it's positive.

233
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:08,491
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, l lied before.

234
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:17,528
-Now you know how you really feel.
-That's a risky little game.

235
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:22,126
Are you really gonna do this?

236
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:27,326
l'm gonna have a baby.

237
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,921
l'm gonna have a baby!

238
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:42,488
-With who?
-No, it's still not the time.

239
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:54,203
l just didn't see
the fast song coming.

240
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:59,088
Don't try to talk. We'll get you
up to your room, soak your feet.

241
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,522
That's so sweet!

242
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:05,281
There's so few
genuinely nice guys out there.

243
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:09,121
l feel like l'm holding down
the fort all alone.

244
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:11,721
-lt's Joey, right?
-Yeah.

245
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:15,049
Wait a minute! l'm the nice one!

246
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:18,728
l danced with the kids all night.

247
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,048
How small are your feet?
