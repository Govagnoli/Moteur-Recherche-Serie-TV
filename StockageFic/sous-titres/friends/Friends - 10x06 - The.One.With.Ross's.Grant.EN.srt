00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,235
Phoebe, what's wrong?

3
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:10,935
I'm so exausted from draggin'

4
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:12,546
Oh my God!

So, did he get you on one knee?

7
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,724
Did he have a speech prepare?

8
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,071
Or did he cry?

9
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:23,414
Yeah! Big surprise, I like proposals.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,325
He was really sweet.

11
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:29,425
And like the most romantic thing ever.

12
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,283
Oh, well. Here's to Phoebe.

13
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:32,875

00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,078

Oh, Phoebe. Honey that's nice.

21
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,428
But, you know what? I think I'm okay.

22
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,209
Why don't you give to one of
your other single girlfriends?

23
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:55,004
I would. But you're the last one.

24
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:58,810

00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,951
And he had a full life.

31
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,700
He was in the first wave at Ohama Beach.

32
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,416
I'm sorry. I should give you
my black book when i got marry.

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,159
Although so much a book is (?)

Hey sweety.

41
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:31,166
Is Monica not here?

42
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:32,626
I'll tell you.

43
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,475
My agency was beating for a big account.

44
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:35,483
And they got it!

45
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:36,817
It's my first national commercial.

46
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,420
- Cool!
- Yeah

47
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,166
(?)
but a lot of the ideas were mine.

48
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:44,001
Hey, you weren't there?
ALL the ideas were mine.

49
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:45,966
That's great!

50
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,135
Hey, can you cast me in it?

51
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,454
How ... I don't know I really don't
think you're right for the part.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,007
What you mean? I can do
anything, I'm a commedian.

53
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,247
I'm old.

54
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:01,812
I'm tired.

55
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,519
I'm hot, I'm cold.

56
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,627
Come on, what can't I do!?

57
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:10,107
First of all, BRAVO!

58
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:13,238
But I really don't think you're right for this ...

59
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,351
... the part calls for a
stuffy college professor.

60
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:16,618
I can do that!

61
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:20,445
Hello! I'm your professor,
when I'm not busy

62
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:23,548
thinking of important things
or ... "professing" ...

63
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,679
... I like to use ...
Oh, what's the product?

64
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:31,064
Software that facilitates
interbusiness networking e-solutions!?

65
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,104
I'm cold!

66
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,206
- Hey.

00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,144
Apparently I beated
undreds of other applicants.

72
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,145
Including five guys I went
to graduate school width.

73
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,146
Not that I'm keeping
score, really. FIVE!

74
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:53,147
Wow, that's great! So,

complete my field research.

77
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,150
And there will be an article about
me in the Paleontology Review.

78
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,151
It'll be the first time
my name is in there ...

79
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,152

serious questions about my work.
