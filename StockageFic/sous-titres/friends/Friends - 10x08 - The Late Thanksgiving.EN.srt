1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,100
Hi, you guys?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, hi, hi!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ah, we need to talk to you about something.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,100
Yah. We don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,800
What? What?

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,200
What, are you kidding? What are you talking about?

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,200
Well, it's just with the work, the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Plus, we don't think it fair that every year the burden falls on us.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,900
That don't sound like you. That's Monica talking!

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
No, no, we made this decision together!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
She's putting words in your mouth!

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Not you put words in peoples' mouth, you put turkey in peoples' mouth.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,000
I can't believe this, this is Emma's first thanksgiving!

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,900
No, it's not.

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,900
It's not? When was she born?

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,700
Personally, I think it's great that you give yourself a break.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,500
Thank you, Phoebe.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Just as well, last year was very good, it won't be better again.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,300
What? You are a way off, lady!

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,300
Am I? What? Am I? Well, you could do a thanksgiving and prove me wrong!

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,100
Think about it, think about it, you are trying to get on top of what you did last year. You'll be in competetion with yourself.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,800
That's my favorite kind.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Ok, we are doing this!

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,100
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Stay out of this Chandler, this is between me and me!

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,500
We are supposed to make these decisions together.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Did you know what the doctor Filler tell you?

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,100
F-R-I-E-N-D-S

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hi! Happy thanksgiving!

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, happy needless turkey murder day!

31
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,700
I've ordered some chocolate pies from the baker & blicker, could you pick them up for me?

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,900
You are not making the pies yourself?

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,900
You know, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger, I entered a pie eating contest that I ate so many of them, and they just make me sick.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Did you at least win the contest?

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Two minutes twelve pies and I was part of the one ten!

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
Okay, I'll see you girls at four.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Can't wait!

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,700
Hey, Rachel, what's Emma doing today?

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Well, she, I know that she had a meeting with her lawer, and then she has to make a very big poop.

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Why?

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,900
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty passion.

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Oh my god! That's the greatest bit I've ever heard!

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
I heard it long before you know, my friend Susan is entering her kid and comparing to Emma, she's a real dog!

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Oh.. Pheobe, all babys are beautiful!

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,100
Oh, okay.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Phoebe, just the idea of pittng one baby against another, I mean you know in judging who is cutier, just for a trophy?

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,700
A thousand dollars.

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,700
It's something I am very interested in!

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,400
Please don't tell Ross.

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,100
He doesn't believe what's inside....

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,600
Oh, and there is a prize for the competetion!

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Well, Emma is going to get a prize on thansgiving!

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,500
Well, I was thinking.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Take the cloths off Joey's penguin!

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,300
Someone dropped his bayonet again?

56
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Why wholly from Kansas, to do that?

57
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't get older, I just get better!

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, it just occurs to me, it could be the last thanksgiving there's only two of us.

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,700
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.

60
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,800
You don't know that!

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,300
Somebody's gonna to pick us.

62
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,500
We haven't heard anything from the adoption agency, and it has been weeks!

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I tell you, it's gonna happen. Next year it will be you, me and little Hemingway being!

64
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
What, he's my favorite author.

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Name one of his books.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
The Firm?

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Okay, let's see. The turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready.

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,200
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.

69
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet! But did you do everything that Doctor Feel told you to do?

70
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,100
I am serious, just le me do something. Not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing high-profile.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me see... Oh, the cranberry sauce! It's easy, and normally no one cares about it!

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Tell me more?

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay, I have to go & check something across the hall, you start by washing this.

74
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Not with soap!

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You obviously haven't tasted my palmalo potatoes.

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,700
Hey, guess what Joey has?

77
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,600
Three tickets to today's Rangers' game!

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,300
Dude, I wanted him to guess!

79
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh my god!

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
Ya, they are great seats, too!

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Guess what they are!

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,900
Sunnerise.

83
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Did I do something to you?

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
Emm, the game's at one.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,300
So?

86
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
Dinner's 4:00. We won't make it back.

87
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,100
So, we will leave before it is over, that will be enough time.

88
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:14,100
You say that now but it takes a long time to go back home. Plus that Joey can get lost and make it pages us to pick him up.

89
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,600
Do two times of that happen?

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Look, Monica is working hard for the dinner all day she wannt the thing she hosts in the first place. We shouldn't go!

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
He's right, man.

92
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,400
Alright, I guess. So see you at four.

93
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,700
And get ready to taste my very special cranberies.

94
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Or should I say, Chan-berries?

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,700
That's some gentle comedy do.

96
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,300
We should go to the game, right?

97
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Ya!

98
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,400
Hey!

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Hi,listen, Phoebe, I don't like this place. This place just freaks me out. Have you watched that guy over there? I don't think him was a kid!

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:12,500
But you can't leave now. There is only one baby has been favored to win to win but he got a cold, he has to stay home. This competetion just blew wide open folks!

101
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,000
Phoebe, it is so weird. People here wears thing as if running the videos on!

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, I know that I should have been more prepared.

103
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,100
It's okay. The way I see it, a real competetion is Cameron.

104
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Oh, my god they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms, looks like a man!

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,900
Phoebe, come on, it's already 3 oclock now and they haven't got to Emma's group yet, we have to go, we have a dinner!

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,700
But Emma will get what she takes and then we can go off the way!

107
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Phoebe, you have to calm down.

108
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Okay, Rachel, the hottest babies in this area are in this room, right now!

109
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,700
I have ever heard a judge say that they haven't handle that kind of Emma!

110
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,500
Really?

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Ya!

112
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,600
You heard them say that?

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
Ya.

114
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Okay, alright, okay, let's give those babies something they can cry about!

115
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,800
Hey, great, let's get down to the business! Emma needs some make up.

116
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,900
What?

117
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,200
She's gonna look better than the other contestants.

118
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Phoebe, I am not letting you put make ups on my baby!

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,700
Why not?

120
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Because I already did!

121
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,300
Oh! Get on!

122
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,500
What a game!

123
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
I know, yeah!

124
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,900
I can't believe Chandler's missing that.

125
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,900
I sorry that he is not here but what I gonna say is that I really enjoy Natural Chips.

126
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Probably I can enjoy more giving that I can handle my weight.

127
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh!!!

128
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,700
It is so great!

129
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,500
I know, I know!

130
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,500
When I was here on my holiday, I was sitting so far away that Michelle Kuang can't read my banner.

131
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, we'd better leave now, back for dinner.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But it is really a tight game! We can be a little late, you know the girls will be there, let's stay for one more goal.

133
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, no.

134
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,200
One more fire, okay?

135
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Okay.

136
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Where is everybody? They are already forty-five minutes late.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I can't believe that they are not here! I slaved, and I slaved for what?

138
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,300
They've ruined the Cranberry Day!

139
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,900
How late are we?

140
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,800
Forty-five minutes.

141
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,900
Ouch.

142
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:41,800
Rachel and Phoebe are already there, so they've probably started, so we just sneak in, and none knows we are here and none know where we were.

143
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,400
You may wanna lose that finger?

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh, no no no, you just want to put it on your hand.

145
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,100
You are not in the thanksgiving?

146
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,700
No, no we are late!

147
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,900
What are you doing here?

148
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,400
We are late, too!

149
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,100
We don't think we can be late because we think that you two gonna be on time!

150
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't point that thing at me!

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,300
So, nobody's here and Monica's gonna kill us!

152
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,500
Where were you?

153
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
yeah, what was the trophy?

154
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Well, we were at a spelling being.

155
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,600
And I won!

156
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,600
You won at a adult spelling being on thanksgiving day?

157
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,600
Y-E-S, yes!

158
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Let me see this...

159
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,900
Grand Super Little Darling, New York Division.

160
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,600
That's me!

161
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
You two entered Emma into a beauty contest?

162
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Well, what a beauty she is with the make up and bonnet?

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen this bonnet?

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! And you treated she like a show-dog, is that excusable?

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,600
Well, she won us a thousand dollars!

166
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,600
So,  is this an annual thing?

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Ah! That makes me memory of that!

168
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,300
You guys, there are people there they are not getting any happier!

169
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
God, what are we gonna do?

170
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know, you guys figure it out, I gonna put Emma down not.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, Rach, at least get something what we can make.

172
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,600
What we gonna say?

173
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,400
We say that we were mugged, you can't get mad when someone's mugged!

174
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
That's good, but you don't look like that you are mugged.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,700
Hi!

176
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,700
Did you hear something?

177
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,900
There are all there!

178
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,800
Let me see!

179
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Oh, I cannot believe that, they are all one hour late and they just stand there talking!

180
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Everything is so distorted, looks like Joey has a giant hand!

181
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,700
It says "Rangers" on it, they went to the game!

182
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Oh, oh, there are an inferno world of pain!

183
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Ross's shirt is torn.

184
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
They are late, and sloppy!

185
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,700
Alright, Emma's napping. What happened to your shirt?

186
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,700
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Rach, we are just trying to figure out an excuse.

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Oh, think this, we can say that Monica told us it is five o'clock, not four o'clock, so we arrived on time!

189
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Or,

190
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,300
We can place PCP in the apartment and cups in the corner!

191
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,700
It would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.

192
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,100
You can just say that she said it was five oclock and we are just causal, we are not late and we are on time!

193
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,300
We know you are out there.

194
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Where do you think it's from?

195
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
Oh god, it is bad, it is so bad!

196
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,100
Well, let's just go in there and face them.

197
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,100
I am not going in first. The face that angry Monica has will just make me crazy.

198
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,500
I hate that thing, it's like a "Boddle Lightening."

199
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,400
Hey, I have an idea, we play Rock-Paper-Scissors and the loser's going in first!

200
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,900
Okay, okay, I am ready.

201
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Ready?

202
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Ah, I win!

203
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,700
What is that?

204
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,800
That's fire, beats everything!

205
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Oh, really? Does it beat a water ballon?

206
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,300
Well-played, Phoebe, well played.

207
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,800
Well, okay okay, let just go in at the same time!

208
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Okay.

209
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
It's locked!

210
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Sure, now they locked it. But when they are in the couch waiting for sex, they just say, oh, coming, my body is surprisingly hurry!

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,900
Alright, come on. How are you guys? We are so sorry that we are late, please let us in thus we can have dinner together.

212
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,500
No, everthing is cold, the turkey has dried out and the stuffings are saggy.

213
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,700
Yah, and the bowl of cranberry sauce is....

214
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
What happened with the cranberry sauce?

215
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,900
Nothing, it's fine.

216
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,100
Oh, thank god.

217
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,600
Come on, you guys, we are sorry, our car broke down.

218
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,400
It's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand!

219
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I've told you to take it off!

220
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:52,200
You guys, it doesn't matter whether we are late, we are all here and just let us come in and have the delicious turkey!

221
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I dream of that piece, it isn't that?

222
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,100
That's all the turkey you'll gonna get!

223
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,700
How are we going to decide who get this?

224
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Water balloon!

225
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,500
What are we gonna do, I am starving!

226
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Oh yes! I just remember some thing we can eat, Monica has left something in the oven this morning!

227
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,900
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry!

228
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Guys, listen to me, the veins are bigger than what I have ever seen!

229
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Oh my god it is brussel srouts!

230
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,900
What's that, it's no food!

231
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Ah-huh, are you guys think Monica's stinky sprouts?

232
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,600
Stinky?

233
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,700
Please let me stay on this side of the door!

234
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Oh, I know, I still have my old key!

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
We can just unlock the door!

236
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,100
I don't think that is a good idea, they clearly don't want to be with us.

237
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,000
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but on Thanksgiving, we should-not-be-together should be together!

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,500
Let's just get in and make a face-to-face apology, look into my eyes, and they will forgive us.

239
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,400
I don't know.

240
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm telling you.

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,100
I can do it.

242
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,500
Yeh, you can do it.

243
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
No.

244
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,300
Ah, they look so beautiful!

245
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,700
The turkey, the stuffing,

246
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,000
The cranberries?

247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Enough, a monkey could make them!

248
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,400
Hey, listen guys, we feel realy terrible,

249
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him.

250
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Come on, you guys, we want you to know that we are very, very sorry....

251
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Right guys??

252
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I feel terrible, sorry, sorry, sorry!

253
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Don't let us ruin this day, you worked so hard! Let's move pass it and have some nice meal together!

254
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,800
The floating heads still make it a good point.

255
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, they do seems that they feel pretty bad.

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So bad, so bad, so bad.

257
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Okay, you two, go get the dessert, and I'll let you in.

258
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,800
Dessert?

259
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?

260
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Pies? Ah we thought you said "prize"?

261
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Here!

262
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,800
Grand Super Little Darling?

263
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Congratulations!

264
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Oh my god, you forgot the pies? Well, I can't believe this! You forced me to make dinner, and you are one hour late and you forgot the one little thing I asked you to do!

265
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Really, girls are cool.

266
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Well, are you man heads any better? You lied about going to the game, you know it will make you late and you still wend anyway.

267
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I get a little tired, we said we are sorry. It's thanks giving for thanks, a day of forgiveness!

268
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
The day to be thankful.

269
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Don't make me come up there!

270
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,100
Too late for apologies!

271
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,400
Fine, let us go, I don't need it for dinner!

272
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,900
It will be a lot more convincing if you want drolling.

273
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Oh, is it what it is?

274
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,300
Sorry.

275
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,000
Hi, you guys, let's just do our own thanks giving!

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Yeah, I'll cook!

277
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,700
Yeah, let's go out!

278
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
You three, have a nice thanksgiving!

279
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,500
The three of us?

280
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
You, Chan, and the Vain!

281
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,700
A-o, I'm stuck!

282
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,300
Joey, that is not going to work!

283
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,500
No, seriously, I am really stuck in here!

284
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,300
I'll pull you through!

285
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Ahhhhh! Stop, stop, I am worried about damaging my head!

286
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,000
It's a little late for that!

287
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,100
Hurry up, you gonna do something.

288
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,800
This is not changing anything! We need to get something to increase the size of the space.

289
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,700
We got turkey gravy!

290
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,000
Bring it!

291
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I am sorry that I refered to the vain as the separate person.

292
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,900
Here you go.

293
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh, that smells good.

294
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Okay, try it.

295
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
It isn't working!

296
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,900
Ah, we are going to unscrew the chains!

297
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,800
Hurry, I cannot feel my ears!

298
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,500
Can you ever feel your ears?

299
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,300
Interesting!

300
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,700
Chandler, where are your tools?

301
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Oh, I left them at my some where else!

302
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,200
I don't have tools!

303
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,100
I do, but Rachel borrowed them!

304
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,300
I lent them to Ross.

305
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,400
I gave them to Joey.

306
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,900
I left them at the park.

307
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,400
I am find that it is really a mess with them.

308
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,700
I am already stuck by the brussel sprouts smell down his pants.

309
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,600
Nice.

310
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,500
Ok, I have to get that. When I get back I want you and your friends to be gone!

311
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Thanksgiving is over! The vain has spoken!

312
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,000
It really stuck my head!

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,700
Okay, I will pull the door and you guys push on the door as hard as you can and we may get enough room for him to get out, okay?

314
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,400
Okay, so push!

315
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Just a separate kind, we are in the middle of something here...

316
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh, stop putting things in my pants!

317
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,900
Come on, guys, push!

318
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,900
Come on, push, push, push!

319
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
My cranberries!

320
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,800
I am all over of it!

321
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,000
I can't believe what you've did, Monica's going to kill you!

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Look, look, look what the floating-head did!

323
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,300
I don't care.

324
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,900
What's going on?

325
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,100
That was the adoption agency.

326
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,700
And?

327
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
We are getting a baby!

328
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Are you serious?

329
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,900
There was a pregnant women in Ohio and she picked us!

330
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,400
Congratulations, we are so happy for you!

331
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
This thanksgiving can beat the last thanksgiving's ass!

332
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
To Monica and Chandler, and that girl or boy in Ohio!

333
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
I am so happy that you guys are finally getting a kid!

334
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Have you considered pragnanting?

335
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,700
I can't believe that they called and we are actually getting a baby!

336
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,400
I know how you feel!

337
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,300
Really?

338
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Sure! I went to exactly the same thing in my memory!

339
