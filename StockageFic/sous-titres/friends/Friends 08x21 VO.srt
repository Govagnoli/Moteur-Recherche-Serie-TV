1
00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:05,971
-Hey. l got some bad news.
-What?

2
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:11,250
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, ''Extra! Extra! Read all about it! ''

3
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:15,489
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the <i>Post.</i>

4
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:16,731
Oh, no!

5
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:21,805
l didn't want her to see it, so l ran
around and bought all the copies.

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,611
This is bad.
And l've had bad reviews.

7
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:27,727
l remember my first good one:

8
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:30,808
''Everything else in <i>Our Town</i>
was terrible.

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,854
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal. ''

10
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,929
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.

11
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:43,891
lt must be a good review. ls it great?

12
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,085
Oh, dear God.

13
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:54,495
But the good news is, no one
in a two-block radius will ever know.

14
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,773
-And the rest of Manhattan?
-They all know.

15
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:02,535
Oh, my God, this is horrible.
l'm so humiliated.

16
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:06,126
They say there's no such thing
as bad press.

17
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:12,605
You don't think that ''the mahi-mahi
was awful-awful'' is bad press?

18
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,332
l didn't write it.

19
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:19,252
-God, is he right? Am l awful?
-Oh, no!

20
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,969
Monica, listen to me.

21
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:24,367
l'm not just saying this
because l'm your friend.

22
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:27,653
Your food is abysmal!

23
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:30,687
The One with the Cooking Class

24
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,094
-Ross?
-What? What?

25
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:15,771
-l am freaking out!
-Are you?

26
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,366
My due date is in one week!

27
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:21,369
-What are you doing up?
-That is seven days.

28
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,613
l had a lot of water.
Can we do this after--?

29
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,488
No, no, no, no, Ross!

30
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:29,295
We don't have any big stuff we need.

31
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:32,653
We don't have a changing table
or a crib.

32
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:37,452
-We do not have a diaper service.
-Funny you should mention diapers.

33
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:41,685
-l'm serious.
-There's nothing to worry about.

34
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:45,775
There's a baby store on West 1 0th.
We'll go there. . .

35
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:50,373
-. . .and get everything we need. Okay?
-Okay. Thank you. That's great.

36
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,494
Where on West 1 0th?
There's a shoe store--

37
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:58,133
Okay. lf you're gonna do this,
then l'm gonna go do that, so. . . .

38
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:01,807
-Wait, Ross! l'm sorry, one more thing.
-Yeah.

39
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,929
Our situation, you know,
what we mean to each other. . .

40
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:11,415
. . .and, l mean, we're having this baby
together and we live together. . . .

41
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:14,807
lsn't that--? lsn't that weird?

42
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:21,250
Well. . . .

43
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:24,095
l'm just kidding. You can go pee.

44
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:31,845
Did we say we were gonna meet here
or at the movie?

45
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:35,332
-We said at the movies, but--
-l'll see you there.

46
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:40,092
-Now that you're here. . .?
-l'll hang out till l have to meet you.

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,965
-How come you're not going?
-l've got a job interview.

48
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:48,966
-l thought you already have a job.
-And they say you don't pay attention.

49
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:52,845
lt's a better job.
lt's vice president of the company. . .

50
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:56,770
. . .that does data reconfiguration
and for other companies.

51
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:02,767
-Wow. How do you know how to do that?
-That's what l do now.

52
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:06,086
-Joey? Come taste this.
-What?

53
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:09,612
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well. . . .

54
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,649
l'm getting my revenge.

55
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:15,007
You cooked him?

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,886
No. He teaches a course
at The New School. . . .

57
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:22,293
l want to make him try
my bouillabaisse again.

58
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,613
l can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

59
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:30,327
''Restaurant reviewer admits:
'l was wrong about Monica.' ''

60
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,487
The front page?

61
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:36,285
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?

62
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:44,008
You want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?

63
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,172
-Oh, no, no.
-No, no.

64
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,135
-We're not married.
-We're having a baby. . .

65
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,287
. . .but we're not involved.

66
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:55,569
l mean, we were seeing
each other a while ago. . .

67
00:04:55,736 --> 00:05:00,764
. . .but then we were just friends, and
then there was one drunken night. . . .

68
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:06,164
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd like this delivered, please.

69
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:09,408
-Can you fill out this address card?
-Oh, okay.

70
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,809
-You picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
-Yeah.

71
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:16,565
That's one of the reasons
why we're not a couple.

72
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,284
l chose those. l'm a paleontologist.

73
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,731
Really? That is so cool.

74
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:27,329
Don't get too worked up. lt sounds
like he's a doctor, but he's not.

75
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,885
No. l'm fascinated by paleontology.

76
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:34,015
-Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
-l teach it in class.

77
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:39,415
Standing at a cash register, l'm
holding a credit card, and l'm bored.

78
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:44,168
l love your neighborhood.
There's a great gym around the corner.

79
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:48,124
-That's my gym.
-l could tell you work out.

80
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:57,327
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like lndiana Jones.

81
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,206
l am like lndiana Jones.

82
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:10,925
Hi, Pheebs.

83
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,530
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

84
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:16,210
Great! We got everything we needed.

85
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,335
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.

86
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,566
A whore.

87
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,005
What?

88
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:29,092
We were paying, and this sales
woman just started flirting with him.

89
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,689
Can you believe that?

90
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:34,935
-Did she know you two weren't married?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:40,170
Oh, my God. Well, the idea--
A woman flirting with a single man?

92
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,214
-We must alert the church elders.
-No.

93
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:47,651
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

94
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:51,049
-Sounds like you're jealous.
-No, l'm not.

95
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:55,129
l just think it's wrong.
l mean, here l am, about to pop. . .

96
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:59,528
. . .and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?

97
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:03,045
ls that a real place?

98
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:05,685
Are they hiring?

99
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:09,694
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.

100
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,574
Why so fancy?

101
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,448
l got a job interview.

102
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:18,325
lt's more money, and l'd be doing
data reconfiguration.

103
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:23,326
-l think l know someone who does that.
-Me. l do that.

104
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,045
So do l look okay?
l'm nervous.

105
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:28,167
Oh, yeah. You look great.

106
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,454
You know, just don't
get your hopes up.

107
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,365
-Why not?
-Well, the interview.

108
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:35,929
-Yeah?
-You know.

109
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:39,293
You don't make a very good
first impression.

110
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:42,568
-What?
-Oh, you don't know.

111
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,494
-Are you serious?
-When l first met you, you were like:

112
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:50,648
l was like:

113
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,974
What is it that l do?

114
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,771
lt's just, like, you're trying too hard,
making jokes. . . .

115
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,131
You come off a little needy.

116
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:03,651
Did you like me when we first met?

117
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:09,608
Chandler, l'm not gonna lie to you.
But l am gonna run away from you.

118
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:16,614
Hi. l'm Monica Geller,
chef at Allessandro's.

119
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,733
Still?

120
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:21,046
The things you said were unfair. . .

121
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:24,453
. . .and l want you to try
my bouillabaisse again.

122
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:27,449
l don't see why l'd do
that to myself again.

123
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,489
Either eat it or be in it.

124
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,246
Spoon?

125
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,844
-What do you think?
-l'm torn. . .

126
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:44,612
. . .between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

127
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:50,009
But l must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.

128
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:56,329
Thattagirl! We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.

129
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,050
Welcome to lntroduction to Cooking.

130
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:04,165
Can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and béarnaise sauce?

131
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,406
-l can.
-Okay, go ahead.

132
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:11,086
Well they both have a egg yolk
and butter base.

133
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:15,886
But a béarnaise has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.

134
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,691
Very good. What's your name?

135
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:22,735
-You go to the head of the class!
-Okay!

136
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,890
This stuff takes up a lot of room.

137
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:31,532
How serious are you about keeping
Ben in your life?

138
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:35,373
My son? Pretty serious.

139
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,811
Hi, Katie.
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,689
The delivery went out
and they forgot this.

141
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:52,289
lt must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.

142
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:58,292
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
aren't really part of my job description.

143
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:05,207
Oh, l actually came here
to ask you out.

144
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:09,614
Oh. Wow.
Yeah, that sounds great.

145
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:15,971
l'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

146
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:18,604
l'm free now.
You want to get coffee--?

147
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:22,365
-Sure.
-Horny bitch.

148
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:29,055
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

149
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:31,935
No, you're a horny bitch!

150
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,326
You guys have a good time.

151
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:40,051
l'm just gonna grab my coat.
And my whip.

152
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,613
You know, because of lndiana Jones.

153
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:49,811
Not because l'm into S & M.

154
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:52,809
l'm not into anything weird, you know?

155
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:55,046
Just normal sex.

156
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:00,776
So l'm gonna grab my coat.

157
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:10,293
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

158
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,207
Are you okay with this?

159
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,852
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.
You guys have fun.

160
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:18,369
-Okay.
-Yeah.

161
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:19,605
Nice to see you.

162
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:24,048
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.

163
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:28,090
-Although you missed a button.
-Oh, actually, l. . . .

164
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,890
Oh, okay, l see
what you're doing there.

165
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:37,610
l can't even believe this.
l really come off that badly?

166
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:40,449
lt's okay. You calm down
after a while. . .

167
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,847
. . .and then people see
how wonderful you are.

168
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,605
Good. Because l'm sure this
interview will last weeks.

169
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:51,968
All right, don't freak out, okay?
l will help you.

170
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:55,685
-How long before you have to leave?
-An hour.

171
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:58,330
-l can't help you.
-Phoebe--

172
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:03,769
We'll do our best. l'm the interviewer
and l'm meeting you for the first time.

173
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:07,895
-Okay.
-Hi. Come on in. l'm Regina Phalanges.

174
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,767
-Chandler Bing.
-Oh, Bing.

175
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:14,611
-What an unusual name.
-You should meet my Uncle Bada.

176
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:23,050
l'll let myself out.

177
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:32,008
Your alfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

178
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:37,165
When you say ''use,'' do you mean
''eat as a pre-cooking snack''?

179
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,893
-And the cream?
-Cheese makes me thirsty.

180
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:46,046
-Okay. Let's move on.
-All right.

181
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:50,810
Something smells good
over at Monica's station.

182
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:55,604
My God! This is amazing!
You've never made this before?

183
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,365
Oh, no. l don't know anything
about cooking.

184
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:04,206
l had to ask what it was called when
the water makes those bubbles.

185
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:09,214
-Hats off to the chef.
-Your mouth was full. l didn't hear.

186
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,332
-Hats off to who?
-The chef!

187
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,768
That's right!

188
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:20,929
You'll find that l don't micromanage.
l don't shy away from delegating.

189
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:25,727
That's good to know. But let's stop
focusing on what you don't do. . .

190
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,932
. . .and focus on what you do do.

191
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,006
What l do do. . .

192
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:39,886
. . .is create an atmosphere of support
for the people working with me.

193
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,610
Nice sidestep on the ''do do'' thing.

194
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:46,331
-Hardest thing l've ever done.
-Oh, you gotta go!

195
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,165
-Don't worry. You're ready.
-Really?

196
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:54,609
Absolutely! Just fight all your
natural instincts, and you'll be great.

197
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:57,807
Monica, my star student.

198
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:03,090
You called me that before,
so l fashioned a star out of foil.

199
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:07,454
Now, no pressure. lf you like my
cookies, you give me the star.

200
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,491
Wow, a star!

201
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:19,294
l know you all hate me,
and l'm sorry, but l don't care.

202
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:22,927
-Okay, Joey, you're up next.
-Yeah.

203
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,688
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

204
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:29,687
You get an A.

205
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:34,372
l got an A? ln school?
Hey, l'm a dork!

206
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,812
Joey, l'm so proud of you.

207
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:44,006
-l think you should give him your star.
-He doesn't know what he's doing.

208
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,366
Nobody knows what they're doing.

209
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:49,648
l do. l'm a professional chef!

210
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,734
Oh, relax. lt's not a courtroom drama.

211
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,649
Why are you taking
lntroduction to Cooking?

212
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,494
Yeah!

213
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,565
l'm sorry. l cook at this restaurant,
Allessandro's. . .

214
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,806
. . .and l just got a bad review.

215
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:07,769
-Allessandro's? l love that place!
-You do?

216
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:11,008
You're a great chef.
As a person you're a little--

217
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:14,925
-Oh, l'm crazy, but you liked the food?
-Very much.

218
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:19,294
Okay, then. l don't stink.
l'm a good chef! Okay.

219
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:21,811
l don't want to go. l'm having fun.

220
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,570
Did either of you pay for this class?

221
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:28,530
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

222
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:41,254
l was the point person on my company's
transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

223
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:45,654
-You must have had your hands full.
-That l did. That l did.

224
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:49,765
So let's talk a little bit
about your duties.

225
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,372
My duties?

226
00:15:58,576 --> 00:15:59,645
All right.

227
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:04,088
You'll be heading a division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.

228
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:07,885
l see.

229
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:10,530
But there'll be 30 people
under you. . .

230
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:13,608
. . .so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

231
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:20,493
-Good to know.
-We could go into detail--

232
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,607
No, don't, l beg of you.

233
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:26,485
All right. We'll have a definite
answer for you Monday.

234
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:30,649
But l can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.

235
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:33,809
-Really?
-Absolutely.

236
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:37,774
-You can relax. You did great.
-Yeah, thanks.

237
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:41,724
l was really nervous.
l'm told l come on too strongly.

238
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:45,889
And then it was really hard
to side step that ''duty'' thing.

239
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:48,892
Duties?

240
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:51,811
Doodies?

241
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,772
Poo?

242
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:58,126
Poo?

243
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:03,534
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

244
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:07,325
That was the real Chandler Bing.
This is some crazy guy.

245
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:11,370
Call security! There's a crazy guy
out in the hall!

246
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:14,007
Poo?

247
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:17,374
l'll look forward to your call.

248
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:24,169
-Hey.
-Hey.

249
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,452
-You're back.
-How are you?

250
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:31,736
l'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

251
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:34,364
lt was fun.
We just had coffee.

252
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:39,013
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

253
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:42,694
What's going on?
Do you not like Katie?

254
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:48,653
No. No, she was nice. l mean,
she was a little slutty, but who isn't?

255
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,010
Well, l liked her.

256
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:54,926
Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla
if it called you lndiana Jones.

257
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:59,691
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

258
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:03,326
No. lt's just that--
Katie bothered me.

259
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,175
Why? What was wrong with her?

260
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:09,766
There was nothing wrong with her.
She was lovely.

261
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:13,810
-Okay. So, what's the matter?
-l don't want you to date her.

262
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:17,207
Why? What, are you jealous?

263
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,170
Yes. And not because
l want you to go out with me.

264
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:24,772
Because l don't want you
to go out with anybody.

265
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:28,685
lt's terrible to even think this
and it's inappropriate. . .

266
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:33,765
. . .but l want you to be at my constant
beck and call, 24 hours a day.

267
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:37,969
l'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that l feel.

268
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:43,205
-Okay.
-What?

269
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,295
l won't date. l'll. . . .

270
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:50,209
l'll be here with you all the time.

271
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,932
Really?

272
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:57,813
But l'm being so unreasonable.

273
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:04,015
True, but you're allowed to be
unreasonable. You're having our baby.

274
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:12,135
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

275
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:17,171
You feel better?

276
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,335
No, not really. You're pressing
the baby into my bladder. . .

277
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,646
. . .and now l have to pee.

278
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:25,085
-Okay.
-Rach?

279
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:28,407
-Yeah?
-Just one thing. . . .

280
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:34,933
We live together. You're having our
baby. l'm not gonna see anybody else.

281
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,850
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

282
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:45,130
Wow. l don't know, maybe--

283
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:48,726
Oh, Rach, l was just messing around.

284
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:54,015
-Like you did when l had to pee?
-Oh! l knew that.

285
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:57,248
l knew that!
l was just messing with you too!

286
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:02,448
Okay. Because for a minute
you seemed. . .

287
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:05,568
-No, it's just. . . .
-. . .like you actually. . . .

288
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,534
That's just because l'm such
a good messer!

289
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:15,771
-Rach?
-Yeah?

290
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:18,365
-The bathroom?
-Right.

291
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:24,968
l had fun. l learned how to bake,
ate great food.

292
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:30,330
lt's my first A since 7th grade and
l didn't even sleep with the teacher.

293
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,814
-Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
-Yeah.

294
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,566
-Wanna feel good about yourself?
-What the hell!

295
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,125
Let's start with some basics.

296
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:45,808
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

297
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,329
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
