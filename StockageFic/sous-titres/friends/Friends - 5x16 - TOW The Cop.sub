{13036}{13170}Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what|if Martin Luther King had said that?
{13171}{13247}I kinda have a dream!
{13248}{13366}I don¡¯t want to talk about it
{13367}{13408}Well, it involved Monica
{13409}{13453}You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?!
{13454}{13536}Oh, that is so cool! |I can't tell you how many times|I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing
{13537}{13632}Anyway we're talking about your dream|I love you! Your dream?
{13633}{13687}Don't worry,|there wasn't any sex in it or anything
{13688}{13845}I haven't dreamt about her like that|since I found out about you two--ish
{13895}{13934}What was the dream about?
{13935}{14000}Well, okay
{14001}{14046}You were my girlfriend
{14047}{14151}and we were doing the crossword puzzle|Y'know like you guys were doing last night
{14152}{14217}So, that's it|I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out
{14218}{14256}Wait, Joey! Joey!
{14257}{14334}That doesn¡¯t mean|that-that you're in love with me!
{14335}{14352}It-it doesn¡¯t?
{14353}{14412}No!|No, it can mean anything
{14413}{14511}Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous| because I've become the apartment stud
{14512}{14606}That kinda sounds like your dream dude
{14617}{14694}Or, it could mean |that-that you saw Chandler and me together
{14695}{14747}and we y'know were being close and stuff
{14748}{14802}and then you|just want to have that with someone too
{14803}{14889}In the dream I did enjoy the closeness
{14890}{14959}Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? |Right here, right now
{14960}{15062}you attracted to her?
{15063}{15121}- Not really|- Well there you have it!
{15122}{15233}Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!

{15266}{15349}that you're not in love with me,| because you just want a girlfriend!
{15350}{15420}No, I don't think|it's just about just getting a girlfriend
{15421}{15478}Y'know? I mean,|yeah, I can get a girlfriend!
{15479}{15526}Yeah, we could sit in the chair|and do crosswords,
{15527}{15613}but y'know are we ever going to have| y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
{15614}{15709}Well y'know, Monica and I|were friends before we started dating|So maybe-maybe that's it?
{15710}{15765}Friends first?
{15766}{15831}That's interesting
{15832}{15872}You become friends after?

{16814}{16855}Excuse me, is this your car?
{16856}{16878}Yeah
{16879}{16961}Well I don't think|it's very nice of you to park here, |y'know you're blocking the entrance
{16962}{17002}Don't worry about it. It's not a problem
{17003}{17093}Well, it's a problem for me, |which means it's a problem for you
{17094}{17175}'cause I'm a cop
{17176}{17279}So am I!
{17280}{17374}Ohh, no
{17375}{17420}Oh okay, so you're a cop
{17421}{17507}which means you can park anywhere, |'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too
{17508}{17573}So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4
{17574}{17646}Hey, wait a second! |So wait, what precinct are you with?
{17647}{17704}I-I'm with the umm, the 57th

{17934}{17976}Who-who else is in vice up there?
{17977}{18080}Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
{18081}{18105}Sipowicz?
{18106}{18135}No, I don't think so
{18136}{18218}Yeah, big guy, kinda bald|<font color="yellow">*½ÃÆ÷À§Ã÷:ÀÎ±â °æÂûµå¶ó¸¶ 'NYPD BLUE' ÁÖÀÎ°ø
{18219}{18289}No, I don't know him

{18636}{18815}I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right|I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good
{18816}{18869}And where did you find my badge?
{18870}{18936}Oh
{19111}{19202}Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
{19203}{19263}Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class
{19264}{19425}But y'know what?|I guess I can blow that off, for you
{19461}{19493}Thanks!
{19494}{19545}Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something
{19546}{19607}Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler
{19608}{19670}- boy they are really tight|- I know
{19671}{19781}Yeah that's not such a bad situation|they got going over there
{19782}{19904}I'm thinking of getting me one of those
{19905}{19959}What's up Joe?
{19960}{20039}Well, the reason|I think Monica and Chandler are so great
{20040}{20093}¡¦is because they were friends first
{20094}{20163}Y'know? So I asked myself, |"Who are my friends?"
{20164}{20218}You and Phoebe,
{20219}{20308}and I saw you first. So¡¦
{20346}{20368}What are you saying?
{20369}{20526}I'm saying|maybe you and I crank it up a notch
{20549}{20595}Y'know honey umm,
{20596}{20734}as uh, as flattered as|I am that uh, you saw me first,
{20735}{20863}I just, I-I don't think|we should be cranking anything up
{20864}{21013}I'll treat you real nice
{21069}{21184}Yeah, well, y'know umm¡¦No honey listen
{21185}{21279}I think it's a great idea to become friends|with someone before you date them,
{21280}{21385}but I think the way you do it is |y'know you meet someone,
{21386}{21427}become their friend,|build a foundation,
{21428}{21473}then you ask them out on a date.
{21474}{21575}Don't hit on your existing friends!
{21576}{21654}Won't-won't that take longer?
{21655}{21699}Yeah. Yeah
{21700}{21761}Oh, but once you find it,
{21762}{21833}ohh it's so worth the wait
{21834}{21936}Yeah. I understand. I understand
{21937}{22037}Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
{22086}{22160}Come here to me
{22161}{22243}No-no, you come here to me
{22244}{22302}Hey Ross!
{22303}{22332}I brought reinforcements
{22333}{22376}Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
{22377}{22418}Well, I brought the next best thing
{22419}{22467}Hey!
{22468}{22591}Chandler?!You brought Chandler?!  |The next best thing would be Monica!
{22592}{22629}Y'know, I would be offended,
{22630}{22702}but Monica is freakishly strong, so¡¦
{22703}{22764}Look, I-I drew a sketch|about how we're gonna do it
{22765}{22866}Okay Rach, that's you|That's the couch
{22867}{22922}Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
{22923}{22985}Oh, that's me
{22986}{23040}Wow!
{23068}{23162}You certainly think a lot of yourself
{23163}{23265}No! That's-that's my arm!
{23320}{23485}Oh, I see. I thought you just really, |really liked your new couch
{23486}{23527}Y'know what?|Just-just follow my lead
{23528}{23586}Okay!

{24052}{24152}Oh yeah it will! |Come on, up!  Up-up-up! Up!
{24153}{24197}Yes!
{24198}{24317}Here we go! Pivot! |Pivot! Piv-ot!

{24844}{24924}All right, let's uh,|let's bring it back down and-and try again
{24925}{24982}Okay,
{25009}{25067}yeah,
{25130}{25226}let's bring it back down and-and try again
{25227}{25271}I can't believe that didn't work!

{25314}{25406}I mean, you had a sketch!
{25407}{25505}Oh, y'know,|what did you mean when you said pivot?
{25591}{25673}Hey! How's it going?|Did you make any new friends?
{25674}{25744}Yeah, yeah, I met this woman
{25745}{25793}Hey, whoa-whoa!
{25794}{25847}What's she like?
{25848}{25952}Uhh, well, she's¡¦really good in bed
{25953}{26005}Joey, I thought|you were gonna try to be friends first!
{26006}{26045}Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
{26046}{26084}What?! Why?!
{26085}{26164}Well because you didn't give me advice! |No! You gave me a pickup line!
{26165}{26262}As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know,| build a foundation and be friends first
{26263}{26401}I suddenly, through no fault of my own,| became irresistible to her!
{26402}{26488}And her roommate!
{26489}{26538}What about the closeness?
{26539}{26663}Closeness-shmoshness! |There was three of us for crying out loud!

{27399}{27443}I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
{27444}{27510}Ooh, God, it's him!|It's that cop!
{27511}{27556}God, I can't believe it!|He found me!

{27615}{27730}Well, if I'm going down,|I'm taking you with me
{27731}{27827}Harboring a fugitive? |That's one to three years minimum
{27828}{27913}Good luck Chandler
{27953}{27997}Okay, you can arrest me
{27998}{28049}you'll never make it stick|and you know it!
{28050}{28133}Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice,|it's my job.| I mean, you understand right?
{28134}{28179}Yep! As long as you understand
{28180}{28239}that I'm going to call my lawyer |and once he puts you on the stand
{28240}{28352}he'll make you look like a fool.|like a fool!
{28353}{28406}I don't like looking foolish
{28407}{28510}Y'know what?|Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today|Maybe I came by and you weren't here
{28511}{28580}I would love it if I weren't here!
