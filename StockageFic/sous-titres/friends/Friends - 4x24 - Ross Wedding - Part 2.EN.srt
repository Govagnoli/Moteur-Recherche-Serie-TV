00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,639
Previously:

2
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:06,880
-I can't believe you won't be there.
-I know.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,760
Why can't you take
a couple of days off?

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,119
-Because I can't.
-This is my wedding.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,810
-I can't wait to see it!
-Her parents got married there.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,729
It's the most beautiful place.
It's over--

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, my God!

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,360
Postponing it is not an option.

9
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:24,049
This wedding won't happen.

10
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:29,799
If you don't love this, then we'll
do it any other place or time.

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,559
It's perfect.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,250
I'm going to London.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,599
It's not over
until someone says, "I do. "

14
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,360
I do! I do!

15
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:39,319
Rachel, no!

16
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,049
The Waltham residence.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,000
Is this Emily's parents' house?

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,889
This is the housekeeper.

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,680
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

20
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,520
First one identifies oneself...

21
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,770
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,639
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

23
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:08,449
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,599
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,040
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

26
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,040
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,959
I'll be nice, I swear.
Could you just give me their number?

28
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:27,129
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

29
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,239
Somebody is on their way to ruin
the wedding, and I have to warn them.

30
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,370
So give me that number
or I'll come over there...

31
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,800
... and I'll kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

32
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,199
She knew I could kick her ass.

33
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:47,000

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,770
Hi, sweetheart.

36
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,240
Mom, Dad.

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,759
Sorry, we're late.

38
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,039
My fault.
I insisted on riding the tube.

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,199
Judy, the kids!

40
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,360
That's what they call the subway.

41
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:47,679
I thought--

42
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,800
Dad, we got it.

43
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,520
Here comes my dad and stepmom.

44
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:53,839
Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

45
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,839
This is Steven...

46
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,490
... and Andrea Waltham.

47
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,520
very nice to meet you.

48
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,529
Darling, the Gellers.

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,330
Darling, it's the Gellers.

50
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,000
She's self-involved.
I should never have married her.

51
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,559
-It's the Gellers.
-Where?

52
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,600
That's one and that's another one.

53
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,240
Lovely to meet you.

54
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,639
Nice of you to pay
for half the wedding.

55
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,279
The hell with tradition!
We're happy to do it.

56
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,130
We know how expensive
weddings can be.

57
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,199
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

58
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,009
A joke that's funny in all countries.

59
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,520
-What's in it?
-Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

60
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,520
That's not food.

61
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,089
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.

62
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,559
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

63
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,000
I can't remember
what Phoebe looks like!

64
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,559
It's been three days.

65
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,250
You're just homesick.

66
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,600
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

67
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,399
You're different here too.

68
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,399
You're mean in England!

69
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,039
What the hell?

70
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,160
What's up, Dad?

71
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,959
This bill for my half.
It's insane.

72
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,640
Why is it so much?
The reception's at their house.

73
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,640
Flowers, liquor.
Re-carpet first floor?

74
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,450
New guest bath, landscaping.

75
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,799
I'm paying to remodel this house.

76
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:32,769
I'll give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

77
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,320
Please.

78
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,040
I don't want anything
to upset Emily.

79
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,010
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

80
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,440
Here.
Let me go talk to him.

81
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,839
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

82
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,000
Sometimes I forget
how powerful you can be.

83
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,290
And I'll go get drunk.

84
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,359
Your next flight to London?

85
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,839
There's one leaving in 30 minutes.

86
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,359
And I do have one seat left.

87
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,040
Thank you, thank you.

88
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,040
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

89
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,880
I don't have enough left
on my credit card.

90
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,440
You can split it with another card.

91
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,480
How about five?

92
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,440
Thank you.

93
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,000
I need to see your passport.

94
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,920
I don't have it, but I can tell you
where it is on my nightstand.

95
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:44,799
You know what?
I have my driver's license.

96
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,399
And I have a 20.

97
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,200
My father is not going to pay
for the built-in barbecue.

98
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,399
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

99
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,970
I might be able
to get you the new lawn.

100
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,809
Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

101
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,399
I go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

102
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:15,209
Will you say something, Steven?

103
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,799
Don't take that tone with me.

104
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,399
All right, you can.

105
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,410
Thank God!

106
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,720
You changed your mind.

107
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,440
You probably don't want
to talk about it.

108
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,559
You're doing the right thing.

109
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,079
Where are you going?

110
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,609
What are you doing?

111
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,600
Why am I always pregnant
when she does that?

112
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,160
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.

113
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,200
My big toast is tomorrow.

114
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,369
This is kind of my little toast
or Melba toast, if you will.

115
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:03,320
I knew Ross when he was going out
with his first girlfriend.

116
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:07,839
I thought things would work out
until he over-inflated her.

117
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,609
Oh, dear God!

118
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,799
Hello, Waltham lnteriors.

119
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:20,399
Mrs. Waltham.

120
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,200
I need to speak with
one of the best men or Ross' sister.

121
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,850
-Who is this?
-Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

122
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,799
If you're Ross' friend,
why aren't you here?

123
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:35,119
I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.

124
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,079
Am I on the radio?

125
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,839
Can I talk to one of them?
It's important.

126
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,010
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.

127
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:56,440
We're excited that Ross and Emily are
getting married at Montgomery Hall.

128
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,369
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

129
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:01,600
Come on, Monty Hall!

130
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,440
Let's Make a Deal.
Come on, you people!

131
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,209
All right, forget it.
Congratulations.

132
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,040
Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.

133
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,010
I'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

134
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,880
Congratulations to the happy couple.

135
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,000
I first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

136
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,880
Home.

137
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,840
New York City.

138
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,280
Where everybody knows my name.

139
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,239
Anyway...

140
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,400
... I love you guys.

141
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,409
But not as much as I love America.

142
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,159
Can we please go home now?

143
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,849
Are you going home?

144
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,599
I was hoping to get
to know you better.

145
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

146
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,010
I was laughing.

147
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,400
Out loud?

148
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,849
I didn't want everyone
to think I was stupid.

149
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,159
How are you?

150
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:22,080
My mom's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married!

151
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm happy.
I won't let anything spoil that.

152
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,359
I just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

153
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,799
Thanks. We like him.

154
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,440
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

155
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,729
There's no way in hell
I'm paying for it.

156
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,359
Look, we're down to just one point.

157
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,679
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

158
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,039
Fine, but I'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

159
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,520
... you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!

160
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,039
The guy was hammered. There's
no way you look like Ross' mother.

161
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,960
-Then why would he say it?
-Because he's crazy!

162
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,239
Earlier, he thanked me for my very
moving performance in Titanic.

163
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,849
My mother's right.
I'll never get married.

164
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,440
You know what, that is--

165
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,599
Who wouldn't want you?

166
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,960
Please! I'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

167
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm getting married!

168
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,559
Morning.

169
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,359
I'm getting married today!

170
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,799
Do you think he knew I was here?

171
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:54,400
I've never done that with you before.

172
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,289
So how are you?

173
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,200
You okay?

174
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,200
You?

175
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,440
You?

176
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,400
We did you.

177
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:16,599
-I better get going.
-Absolutely.

178
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,049
Could you not look?

179
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't want to look.

180
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,400
Excuse me, if you plan on
doing that the entire flight...

181
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:47,640
... tell me now, so that
I can take a sedative.

182
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,609
Or maybe slip you one.

183
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,440
It's just that I'm kind of excited.

184
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm going to London
to tell this guy that I love him.

185
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,840
Where the hell have you been?

186
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,520
I spent the night out.
I met this cute bridesmaid. She is--

187
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:19,960
I don't want to hear it!

188
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,440
Pheebs, you know you're still
my number one girl.

189
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,000
We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

190
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,679
Great!

191
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:34,039
No, she's coming to tell Ross
that she loves him.

192
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,280
But he loves Emily.

193
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,210
I know that!

194
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,280
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

195
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,599
I've done my part, okay?

196
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:47,919
It's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.

197
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,200
So tell me about this girl.

198
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:56,679
Have you seen Monica?

199
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,369
I'm not seeing Monica!

200
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:07,880
We got to find her. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

201
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,880
-Oh, my God!
-Do you know where Monica is?

202
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,400
What's with the third degree?
Why not just shine a light in my eyes?

203
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,809
Then I realized all this stuff
I had been doing...

204
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:24,929
... proposing to Joshua,
lying about why I couldn't come...

205
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:27,200
... was all just a way of--

206
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,210
I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?

207
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,880
I just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

208
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,000
Pardon me?

209
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,599
You're about to ruin
the happiest day of his life.

210
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,960
I have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

211
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:47,400
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

212
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,880
-But he has to know how I feel.
-But why?

213
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,969
He loves this Emily.
No good can come of this.

214
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,809
I think you're wrong.

215
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,119
Oh, no!

216
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,679
By the way, it seems to be clear
you were on a break.

217
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,799
Oh, my God!

218
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,440
It's like a fairyland.

219
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,760
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

220
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,640
I love it. I only hope
my wedding looks this good.

221
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,840
-I just--
-You can let some go by.

222
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,440
Start looking out for Rachel.

223
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,520
I'll cover the door.
You watch that big hole.

224
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,039
I've got Chandler covering Ross.

225
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,320
Why would I care where Chandler is?

226
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,280
You know...

227
00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:46,919
... sometimes I don't even
like Chandler.

228
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:52,760
I do.

229
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:54,799
I do.

230
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,280
It's the second one.

231
00:14:58,489 --> 00:14:59,679
Right?

232
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,520
Hello, Joey.

233
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,289
Hey, Felicity.

234
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,000
I thought about you all day.

235
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,090
Talk New York to me again.

236
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,200
Forget about it.

237
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,119
How you doing?

238
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,280
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

239
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,400
You have to meet me in the middle.

240
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,369
My foot will meet
the middle of your ass.

241
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,239
-What's going on?
-Everything's under control.

242
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,409
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

243
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:40,960
That's it!

244
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,320
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

245
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,210
This is our wedding day!

246
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,599
From now on, everyone gets along.

247
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,960
And if I hear one more word...

248
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,320
... no grandchildren!

249
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,719
That's right!

250
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,000
Sorry, old boy.

251
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,400
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

252
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:05,690
What was that about?

253
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,679
It was this disagreement over--

254
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,479
My God! You look beautiful.

255
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,960
You can't see me before the wedding.
It's bad luck.

256
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:21,400
I think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

257
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,440
My God, Rachel!

258
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:03,400
You're here.
I can't believe it.

259
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,119
Why are you here?

260
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,199
I just came to--

261
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,400
I just needed to tell you...

262
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,000
... congratulations.

263
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,250
Waltham lnteriors.

264
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,400
Mrs. Waltham? It's Phoebe.

265
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,880
Can I talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.

266
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,800
There's a girl on the phone for you.

267
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,599
Great!

268
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,719
It's Phoebe.

269
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,680
Did you stop Rachel?

270
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,839
But she just hugged him.
That's it.

271
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,119
Nothing got ruined?

272
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,400
That's so great!

273
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,599
So what's going on now?

274
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,199
I'm walking down the aisle.

275
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,000
Still walking.

276
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,040
I'm at the front with Ross.

277
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,609
It's Phoebe!

278
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,239
He looks pretty mad.

279
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,640
I better go.

280
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,199
Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.

281
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,000
-What we did last night was--
-Stupid.

282
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,040
Totally crazy, stupid.

283
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,800
What were we thinking?

284
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm coming over
tonight though, right?

285
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,479
Definitely.

286
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,040
Friends, family...

287
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,199
... we are gathered to celebrate...

288
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:35,280
... the joyous union
of Ross and Emily.

289
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,369
May the happiness of today...

290
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:39,719
... be with them always.

291
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:42,040
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

292
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,599
-I, Emily...
-I, Emily...

293
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,959
-... take thee, Ross...
-... take thee, Ross....

294
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,000
... as my lawfully wedded husband
in sickness and in health...

295
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,199
... till death parts us.

296
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:56,199
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

297
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,319
... until death parts us.

298
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,959
Now, Ross.

299
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,000
Repeat after me.

300
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,760
I, Ross...

301
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,040
I, Ross...

302
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,640
... take thee, Emily...

303
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,479
... take thee, Rachel--

304
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,839
Emily!

305
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,400
Shall I go on?

306
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,829
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

307
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,790
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

308
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,869
In London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

309
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,380
London might have gotten started...

310
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,949
... because we needed to take advantage
of the show's popularity...

311
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,380
... and go do the show on
an exotic location...

312
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,910
... and have a good time.

313
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,550
There's so many people here
from all over the world.

314
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,339
Lately, the show's been about us
getting excited to go to London.

315
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,910
And then we realized in real life,
we're doing that same thing.

316
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:24,469
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check!

317
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:27,430
Are you ready yet?

318
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,939
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

319
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,540
Yeah!
London, baby!

320
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,750
It's all London, baby!

321
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:35,910
Here we go.

322
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,589
Ross is getting married...

323
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,540
... to this young woman named Emily.

324
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,180
And I set them up by accident.

325
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,390
Why don't we?

326
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,739
Why don't we what?

327
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,750
Get married.

328
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,989
I've started to...

329
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:59,709
... fall for this character, Emily,
played by Helen Baxendale.

330
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,270
And we decided to go all the way,
I guess, and get married.

331
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:06,829
Ross has asked me to marry him.
I say yes.

332
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,709
And so we arrange
a big wedding in London.

333
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,109
Things go a bit wrong.

334
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,229
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

335
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,469
You have to meet me in the middle.

336
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,510
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass!

337
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:23,150
You want a piece of me?
ls that what you're saying?

338
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:25,420
That's it!

339
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,989
Parents! Parents!
Back away!

340
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:29,869
This is our wedding day!

341
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,390
From now on, everyone gets along.

342
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,780
And if I hear one more word...

343
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:37,589
... no grandchildren!
That's right!

344
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,060
Sorry, old boy.

345
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,949
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

346
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,780
We knew the show
was popular in England...

347
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,069
... and so it seemed like
a natural fit.

348
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,660
I knew how big the show was over here.
It was exciting to be welcomed.

349
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:58,180
Everywhere, walking down the street...

350
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,790
... bunches of kids watching.
So we've been signing autographs.

351
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,339
They're just big fans of the show,
I guess.

352
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,739
I watch it all the time
because my children love it.

353
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,390
They absolutely love it.

354
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:13,989
Tell my friend you like my hat.

355
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:17,430
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.

356
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,430
Hi, Chandler!

357
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,390
We wanted it to
still feel like Friends...

358
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,349
... and so we shot a lot of it
in front of an audience.

359
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:27,589
And it seemed like
a really exciting opportunity...

360
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:32,349
... to shoot an American sitcom
in front of a British audience.

361
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,339
-Do something!
-I am. I'm ignoring you.

362
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,550
I'll be the on-camera guy.

363
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,270
All right. First stop...

364
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:43,540
... Westminster Abbey.

365
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,819
What is that?

366
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,349
That's London, baby!

367
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,390
We were really afraid, going over,
that either they'd be...

368
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,949
... far more sedate and wouldn't laugh....

369
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,750
They were great!

370
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,550
-Big laughers!
-They waited in line for hours!

371
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,140
-We traveled 329 miles.
-She's lying. It's more like 200.

372
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,150
The show's doing so well over here
that it just seems like...

373
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:11,550
... they're real, real receptive.

374
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,660
It's really wonderful and flattering
and overwhelming, truthfully.

375
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:19,260
We didn't have
a single bad audience.

376
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,660
Also, there was
a greater sense of "event. "

377
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,750
I think it energized everybody:
the actors, the writers....

378
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,469
We're just excited to be here.

379
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,099
Like, look back there.
Look how cool that is!

380
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,390
We missed Lisa.

381
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,099
That was probably the only
drawback I can think of.

382
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,349
I first thought, "How exciting!
I wonder if I'm going?"

383
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,469
It's awful that Lisa's not here.

384
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,189
We feel like
we have a limb missing.

385
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,630
Let's try some aversion therapy.

386
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:52,349
Look at the picture.

387
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:00,859
It's strange when one person's
not there. We miss her.

388
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,989
It's weird for all of us
to be here without her.

389
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:07,189
She's in the episode, on the phone
and things like that.

390
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,630
Hey, Pheebs!
It's Joey.

391
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:10,790
Hey, Joey!

392
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,150
I just saw someone that looks just
like you, on the subway.

393
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:19,819
I was going to say hi, then I figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

394
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,750
That just cost me four bucks.

395
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:24,550
Part of me wishes I could go.

396
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,150
But I'm very happy to not get
on a plane for a lot of hours....

397
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,670
Sorry.
I'm not a good traveler.

398
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,349
The Waltham residence.

399
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,790
Is this Emily's parents' house?

400
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,910
This is the housekeeper.

401
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,949
And by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

402
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,910
First one identifies oneself...

403
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:50,310
... and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

404
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,390
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...

405
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,349
... if it's not
too much trouble, please.

406
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,349
Might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

407
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,510
It was also interesting because
we had shot about a third of it here.

408
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,780
And a bit of it
on the streets in London.

409
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,790
All right!

410
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,829
Westminster Abbey!

411
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,869
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

412
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,099
What do you think of the Abbey?

413
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:24,150
I think it's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

414
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,510
-To what?
-To "Put the camera away" !

415
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,550
Man, you are Westminster "Crabby. "

416
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,189
It was a really gratifying experience.

417
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,550
Pretty much everything we'd hoped
to get out of it, we got.

418
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,109
When you can go on location even
in Los Angeles that's exciting...

419
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:19,910
... much less have your whole crew...

420
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:23,500
...come out to "jolly old England. "
It's really, really exciting.

421
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,459
Just the idea of bringing
our entire "family" over here...

422
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:31,229
... is, like, wild.

423
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,270
Yeah!
London, baby!

424
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,260
It's amazing to me how many people
are excited about the show.

425
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,270
I knew how big the show was over here.
It plays a lot on television.

426
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,099
I saw it three times in one week.

427
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:47,469
They're very popular at home,
but I didn 't know they would be here.

428
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,270
It's got a massive following
in Britain...

429
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,900
... particularly among my generation.

430
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,540
It's quite sarcastic.
That's why it's popular.

431
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,060
We have great English character actors
who are working with us.

432
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,459
And an opportunity to interact
with the English crew.

433
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,310
We're about to be Ross' in-laws.

434
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,819
We're the Brits
that you love to hate.

435
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,709
We worked with
Sarah Ferguson this morning.

436
00:32:11,949 --> 00:32:13,270
She was great and funny.

437
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:15,109
I was excited to be here today.

438
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:18,579
It's the first time I've ever done this
and I enjoyed it.

439
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,180
I am a great fan.
I think they are all marvelous.

440
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:26,189
Most British people tried to hate them
for being beautiful and funny.

441
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,709
I got a phone call:

442
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,910
"Small part, a few lines.
Do you want it?

443
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:31,510
Next to Jennifer Aniston. "

444
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,540
And I went, "Oh, wait a minute....
Oh, okay then. "

445
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,270
It's basically a "Iet's kick the Brits
up the butt" episode, really.

446
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:44,670
You're gonna see a lot of comedy,
a lot of romance...

447
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,300
... and a lot of surprises.

448
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,270
And you get to see England.

449
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:53,069
Call the Queen Mum,
say you enjoy watching Friends...

450
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,030
... and that you know us, and she'll
have you over for tea like that.
