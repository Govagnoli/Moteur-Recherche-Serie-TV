<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,803
- How she know my name?
- I don't want to die!

3
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:11,181
- She's with me.
- You make this go away.

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,058
She's going to be staying with us.

5
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,989
You and your drug-dealing mommy?

6
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,729
You can stay here and float me
till the market comes back.

7
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:20,696
Tell her I expect 10 grand
on the first of every month.

8
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:24,069
- When are you coming back?
- The minute she misses a payment.

9
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:26,227
- Hi.
<i>- Hola.</i>

10
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,532
You guys heading towards Ren Mar?

11
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:31,534
Davenport, Iowa.

12
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:32,869
Close enough.

13
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,455
Andy's friends,
I'd like to welcome you to our country.

14
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,123
I hope you get to stay.

15
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:40,584
Why are you here in our house,
Mr. Wilson? Where's your family?

16
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:44,589
My family left me, buddy.
My life's a toilet. I hate myself.

17
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,254
You happy?

18
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:49,260
This is your new job.
We're making you manager.

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,175
You're gonna give me all that money to
manage the San Ysidro Maternity World?

20
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:56,692
I got a normal, boring job.

21
00:00:57,053 --> 00:01:00,730
It looks like I'm gonna be doing it
for a long, long time.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,411
What the "f"?

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,167

00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,062
<i>¡Dígame, pendeja!</i>

26
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,606
<i>- Dígame, qué esta haciendo aquí?
- No comprendo!</i>

27
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,647
Cesar...

28
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,068
Tell him that you know me.

29
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:54,070
<i>Levantate!</i>

30
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:02,305
Hi.

31
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:14,299
You know, all I want to do is go back.
Would you let go of my arm?

32
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,802
It's not like I haven't been
to the garage before.

33
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,678
I just came in the back way this time.

34
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,971
Okay, I think we're in America now.
I have rights.

35
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,915
It was the man in the suit, wasn't it?

36
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,362
The boss, big boss, <i>el jefe</i>?

37
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,091
I think it would be wise

38
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:34,944
for you to reimagine
the events of this evening.

39
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,730
Now, you close up your shop,
go on home to your family,

40
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,366
and you saw nothing.

41
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,160
You mean no one.

42
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,260
That's right.

43
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:09,060
Don't break it!
I'm asking a buck apiece for those.

44
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,398
These are all 50 states.
You can't break up the set, man.

45
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:15,151
You can't keep taking stuff.
There's gonna be nothing left to sell.

46
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,286
Are you kidding me? Look around.

47
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,239
We're not selling pictures of Judah.

48
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:23,210
Photos are not included,
just the frames.

49
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:25,094
Fine.

50
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,872
But not the metal one, though.

51
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,289
Or that wood one there.

52
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:30,458
Or this other one here.

53
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,211
Pipes. Can I have one?

54
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,791
I think I could pull off a pipe.

55
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,924
4 bucks.

56
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,965
Four bucks? What a rip.

57
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:42,679
I am keeping these.

58
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,555
You're all scavengers.

59
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,391
- Yeah, scavenger.
- Fuck you.

60
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,976
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

61
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,894
There's gonna be nothing left
for the estate sale

62
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:54,023
- if everybody keeps everything.
- Anything you want to keep?

63
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:57,408
Nothing. Except maybe
this cool cigar box

64
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:59,445
so I can save it for my ashes.

65
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,197
You are a dark little fellow.

66
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:03,780
- Jews can't get cremated.
- Technically, I'm not Jewish.

67
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,370
You are in the reform movement,
and those are all the cool Jews.

68
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:09,778
"Scraps"?

69
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,041
"Rufus"? "Lucy"?

70
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,064
Vintage murdered-dog collars.
Five bucks each.

71
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,078
Oh, Jesus, Bubbie.

72
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:26,139
Did you get lucky with the Rocky
Mountain Chocolate guy last night?

73
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,003
Fung?

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,493
Please, I'm so not into Asians.

75
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:33,677
Little rice dick, all that soy,
Pai Gow... not for me.

76
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:37,817
I would take the free fudge, however.
How was your night?

77
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:38,740
I...

78
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:43,272
saw no one attractive
in a place I wasn't.

79
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,088
You're babbling.

80
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,697
- You need coffee.
- Yes, I do.

81
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:51,482
Hi.

82
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,574
<i>Hola.</i>

83
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:58,736
A Mexican man with a machine gun.

84
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,026
That looks like...

85
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:04,405
a nice pastry.

86
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,138
Are you gonna be here long?

87
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,056
<i>Todo el tiempo.</i>

88
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,941
All the time, okay.

89
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,363
Well, then...

90
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:13,919
<i>Soy Nancy</i>...

91
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:15,813
Celia.

92
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:17,440
Ignacio.

93
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:20,276
Ignacio, nice to meet you. <i>Mucho gusto</i>.

94
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,820
Well, we're just gonna go

95
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,797
and open up.

96
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:27,992
Do you want any coffee or anything?
I'm getting coffee today.

97
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:33,669
Got your coffee.
Okay, then. Bye now. Get out.

98
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,141
- Nancy...
- Celia.

99
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:43,305
- There's a giant hole in the floor.
- I'm aware.

100
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:46,094
- What's in the hole?
- Mexico.

101
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:49,922
You must never go there
through the hole.

102
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,944
You can drive to Mexico
whenever you want.

103
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,532
Just be aware
there's a very long wait to get back.

104
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:57,576
Don't drink the water.
Stay away from the hole.

105
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:03,923
And the man? Is that the attractive man
from the place that you weren't?

106
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:06,323
I went straight home. I saw no one.

107
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:10,003
But he was so much
better-looking than that guy.

108
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:17,583
Hey, Davenport!

109
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:20,085
<i>Pescados.</i>

110
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:22,221
Yeah, you go, man.

111
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:27,553
Look at Yoga Ass,
with the ass like an apricot

112
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,310
- that she got in yoga.
- Check out bitch badge.

113
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,598
Or is it tramp stamp?
Either way, she's hot.

114
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,600
Her friend's got Madonna arms.

115
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,436
- You think that's sexy?
- Not on a white woman.

116
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,888
You need to find a place to live,
a place to take home the ladies.

117
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,526
I got to make some money.

118
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,320
We should be coyotes.

119
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:49,505
That guy who brought over
Davenport and Marzipan

120
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,375
was such an asshole
and he charged them a fortune.

121
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:55,371
I think... we got
a real opportunity here, Doug.

122
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,986
We could be good coyotes,
nice coyotes,

123
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,294
like the Jetblue of coyotes.

124
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:02,316
Sun chips and bottled water.

125
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,673
competitive pricing
without the rape trees and extortion.

126
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:09,010
- That could be our slogan.
- I'm serious, man.

127
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,637
Look, Asian with big, fake tits.

128
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,632
What is that?
Is there ice cream up the street?

129
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:16,142
I love her.

130
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,815
I love you!

131
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:21,981
I think illegal immigration
for profit...

132
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,535
That's our next venture.

133
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,205
Let me think about it.
I don't really like Mexicans.

134
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,536
Well, think about it.
It's good money.

135
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,073
I'll think about it.

136
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,706
These pants are great,

137
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:38,297
very elastic.

138
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,067
Here's a belly pillow.

139
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:46,214
- What month is this belly?
- That's about a... six-month belly.

140
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,716
Holy shit.

141
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,678
Wait till you see
the six-month ass.

142
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:04,216
Hi.

143
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:05,684
"Hi"?

144
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,319
You don't "hi" me.

145
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,697
You made trouble for me,
going where you don't belong.

146
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,736
I didn't know.
When you gave me a tour of the store...

147
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,199
"Here's the cash register,
here's the back room"...

148
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,659
you might have said,
"By the way, here's a tunnel to Mexico."

149
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,832
But you didn't. You said nothing.

150
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:24,041
Go do your job

151
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,989
and go out to the front,
and smile at the pregnant ladies.

152
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,973
- That's a lot of pot.
- That's what it's all about.

153
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,387
Did you really get in trouble
with the man,

154
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:44,855
the man in the suit?
Who is the man in the suit?

155
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:47,858
You didn't see a man in a suit.

156
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:52,738
Fine, the invisible man...
What would he do if he existed?

157
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,266
Don't know yet.

158
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,783
But anything happens to me,

159
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,494
worse gonna happen to you.

160
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:02,830
We're just hoping for sunshine,
preparing for rain.

161
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,584
Get the fuck back out there.

162
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,666
I'll go look for an umbrella.

163
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:18,703
I just don't understand
why you're here.

164
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:19,676
Isabel!

165
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:21,417
Hi, Mrs. Botwin.

166
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,269
You don't even like me.

167
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,199
That's true. I don't.

168
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,931
So the fact that I am here,
begging to live with you,

169
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:31,095
should clearly demonstrate
how awful my life has been.

170
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:32,948
I can't do it anymore.

171
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,780
I took a Greyhound
and sat next to a man with one leg.

172
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:38,117
I have no place to put you.

173
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,783
I've been sleeping on a chair, listening
to Daddy weep in the next room.

174
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,472
This it the first time
I've left the hotel in weeks.

175
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,494
He clings, he over-shares.

176
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,862
I'm gonna be the only person he knows
in Michigan.

177
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,774
You're moving to Michigan?

178
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:53,205
Dad's going to defend criminals
in Detroit.

179
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:55,940
Everyone's out of work,
no middle class,

180
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,857
felonies at an all-time high.

181
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,388
It's his golden opportunity.

182
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,891
You're exaggerating.

183
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,435
It's Motown. It's cold.

184
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:07,730
You can layer.
I hear there's... a great lake.

185
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:09,565
Canada is...

186
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:10,961
up there.

187
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,473
Look, go back to your father.

188
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,674
I will give you money
to take the train.

189
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:18,976
It goes right along the coast.

190
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,826
It's lovely.

191
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:23,885
For the first time in your life,
please,

192
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:27,458
please don't act
like a selfish fucking bitch!

193
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:29,919
Save me.

194
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,047
I have a customer.

195
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,472
- I'll take the pants.
- Good.

196
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,539
Great. Take the pants.

197
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,457
Go, have children.

198
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:48,421
See how they grow up
to denigrate the fine city of Detroit

199
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,353
and call you a fucking bitch.

200
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:52,611
Here.

201
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,276
Have a coupon.

202
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:02,396
Look at you.

203
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,073
Court appearance?

204
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:06,758
Laundry.

205
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:08,921
You got your tooth fixed.

206
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,418
Want to do it?

207
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:13,620
Fucking you ruined my life.

208
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,299
- The sex was good, though, wasn't it?
- Not bad.

209
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,308
- My best.
- Really?

210
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,595
- Legendary.
- That's sad.

211
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,140
I'm lonely.

212
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:25,394
Me, too.

213
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,686
I think I'm getting used to it, though.
I burned through my happiness...

214
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,149
The American dream.

215
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,346
I don't think that comes around twice
for many people.

216
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,160
Be nice if it came around once.

217
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,160
- Isabel's a great kid.
- You don't have to be her mother.

218
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,600
Neither do you.
You just hang out with her.

219
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,855
I wish I'd tried that with my son.

220
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:44,532
Gays are huge chick magnets.

221
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,786
He could have introduced me
to some young hot thing.

222
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:50,491
Your "young hot thing" days
are long over.

223
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:52,501
Yeah, probably...

224
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,992
Unless I get rich.

225
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,630
You could embezzle from Ren Mar.

226
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,196
I like it down here.

227
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,164
The ocean is therapeutic.

228
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:08,986
- So, you want to...
- No.

229
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,442
Absolutely not.

230
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:16,839
We'll see how strong your resolve is
after a few nights of couch squatting.

231
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,479
I'm picking up
my FEMA vouchers tomorrow,

232
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:22,025
getting myself a cordial suite.

233
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:25,617
It should last a few weeks
and then a few more to evict me and...

234
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:27,657
God, Doug, I said "no."

235
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:29,192
I heard you.

236
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:32,693
Warm.

237
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,299
Well, you have a good night.

238
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,362
Leave the wine and the mag.

239
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,930
How much do we want
for the coffee table?

240
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,972
$125.

241
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,140
$80.

242
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,246
$125.

243
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:50,643
$120.

244
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:52,478
$130. Keep it up.

245
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,398
Oh, my God. Andy, look.

246
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,117
Check it out.

247
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:01,152
- It's Yoga Ass.
- Where? You sure it's her?

248
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:03,796
There, on the stairs.
She's looking at the grapes.

249
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,823
That's her.

250
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:07,888
I could never forget an ass like that.

251
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:22,664
- She's mine.
- She is so mine.

252
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,742
- No, I saw her first.
- On the beach maybe,

253
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:26,698
- but I saw her first here.
- All right.

254
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:29,098
So we both go for it,
and then best man wins.

255
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,609
I am so gonna win.

256
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,726
So not. Watch it.

257
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:37,565
Fuck!

258
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:40,109
- That is not cool.
- So not cool.

259
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,152
He looks good, though.

260
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,988
Look at him work.

261
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:46,438
He must be stopped.

262
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,121
- What was that?
- Gosh,

263
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,611
I am so sorry about that!

264
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:57,398
I am such a clumsy clown.

265
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:00,536
Hi.

266
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:06,449
We live here.

267
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,523
Nice platter.
That's such a nice platter.

268
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,222
I can get you a discount on that.

269
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,474
Well, thanks.

270
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,059
Hey, guys.

271
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:17,638
Look at this.
Everyone wants a piece.

272
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:21,025
I got to show you something downstairs.
They have a metal detector!

273
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,720
Who are you talking to?

274
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,205
My mom.

275
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,487
This is Lisa,

276
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,400
also known as Rad's mom.

277
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,128
Rad's mom.

278
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,833
You own the cheese shop?

279
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,403
Cheese gotta have it...
Yep, that's me.

280
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,595
That is so clever.

281
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,749
- Thanks.
- I love your cheese.

282
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:42,921
- Come on, come on.
- It was nice meeting you.

283
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,408
Yeah.

284
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,140
You, too, Silas.

285
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,344
Excuse me.

286
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,556
Your kid is scary.

287
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,088
My kid's awesome.
You're just cheap.

288
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,993
Enjoy your table!

289
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,191
Put me down! Put me down!

290
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:14,003
Okay, I got it.

291
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:15,811
What's the grand total?

292
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:19,249
We sold $8,327 worth of Lenny's stuff.

293
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:20,918
And fuck him, we're keeping it.

294
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,984
Where did Nancy go? She ditched us?

295
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,423
She probably went out
to buy a "bed skirt."

296
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,753
Or she's out selling drugs.

297
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,186
- Can I hold the money?
- No.

298
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:35,796
I'm gonna go hide this.

299
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,026
- We'll find it.
- Yeah, we will.

300
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,648
Check out sexy.

301
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:43,428
She swam in her clothes.

302
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,375
She's a wild hippie.

303
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,333
Think she shaves her pits?

304
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,616
That must be the boyfriend.

305
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,620
This is weird.

306
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,305
- Is this really happening?
- This is like a movie.

307
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,799
I wish we had milk duds.

308
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:16,140
They're illegals.

309
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:18,142
<i>Ayudame!</i> Help me!

310
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,523
You are so beautiful.

311
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:32,871
You are like a mermaid,
a Mexican mermaid...

312
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,160
- A mermex.
- I thought you didn't like Mexicans.

313
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,802
Just the fat ones.

314
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:39,163
- I'm Doug.
- I'm...

315
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:41,262
What's going on here?

316
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:43,834
It's my girlfriend.
She was just swimming with her clothes.

317
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,587
- I'm just doing my job.
- Your job is bullshit.

318
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,421
She just wants to be here.

319
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,215
She wants to clean our toilets.

320
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,927
- Or sewing, or <i>telecomunicación</i>.
- Let's go.

321
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:55,095
<i>Señor</i> Doug!

322
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,138
Mermex!

323
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,141
I keep your flippy-flop,

324
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,350
- you find me!
- I'll find you. I will.

325
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:02,132
Wait.

326
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,528
- Let's go.
- Wait, I don't even know your name.

327
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:12,613
Maria.

328
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:14,030
Maria Mermex.

329
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:15,913
Sí,

330
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,761
señor Flippy-flop.

331
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,372
You hear that? She called me
"flippy-flop." How cute is that?

332
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,654
We could bring her back here

333
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:27,904
if we were coyotes.

334
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,299
I'm in.

335
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,499
The sale's over.

336
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,900
Lisa, hi.

337
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,367
Hi.

338
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,804
Listen...

339
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:59,409
Did you sell that wacky pack poster?
Rad's been bugging me about it all day.

340
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,704
No, I kept it. I like that poster.

341
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,742
But if he wants it, he can have it.

342
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,366
- Really?
- Yeah. Sure.

343
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:12,965
He's a kid. He should have it.

344
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:15,634
Rad doesn't... give a shit, actually.

345
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:23,757
You want to

346
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,520
go for a walk on the beach
or something?

347
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,001
Rad is fencing.

348
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,360
I have to pick him up at 6:00.

349
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,321
Well, let's go.

350
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,823
Just... let me grab a shirt.

351
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,085
Let's... Let's get walking.

352
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:51,999
Thanks.

353
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:57,759
Fine. Pack a bag.

354
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,951
Hurry up before I change my mind.

355
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:03,443
Thank you.

356
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,437
- I thought you didn't want her.
- I'm her mother, Dean.

357
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:12,649
- And I could use the company.
- I could use the company.

358
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,359
You could use a bath.

359
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,654
What if we move to Newark?

360
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:20,244
Or East St. Louis?
I got job offers there, too.

361
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,504
I live by the beach, Dean.

362
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:24,119
It's better for her.

363
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,331
But there's not enough crime
by the beach. I need a job.

364
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:29,671
What did I do? I'm getting better.

365
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:33,254
I just...
I want to be a carefree latchkey kid...

366
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,787
- who lives by the beach.
- You're throwing me over for the beach?

367
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,676
- Location, location, location.
- I just...

368
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:41,921
I really need a mom right now.

369
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:43,838
Celia said she'd try to find me one.

370
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:47,893
You understand
that your mother is Satan, right?

371
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,394
It's the devil I know.

372
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:51,239
I... I...

373
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,722
- I don't want to be alone.
- I'm not your wife.

374
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,232
You call me...

375
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:05,526
every day.

376
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,455
And when you start to hate her again,
which you will,

377
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:10,489
you come back to Daddy.

378
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:13,411
I love you.

379
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,068
I know. I love you, too.

380
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,161
Try not to get shot.

381
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,880
A widow living in Ren Mar.

382
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:37,878
Two sons... Shane and Silas.

383
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:42,354
You never finished
your last semester at Berkeley.

384
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,156
You have four
outstanding parking tickets

385
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,086
and a strange tattoo
on the upper left...

386
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:50,912
cheek of your backside.

387
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,338
You should not
have gone through the tunnel.

388
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,569
- That was a mistake.
- I know.

389
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:07,111
You should not be asking questions...

390
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:10,017
questions about me.

391
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,810
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:13,621
Yeah.

393
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:15,959
You are

394
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:17,183
sorry.

395
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,400
And your eyes are brown.

396
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,579
You must be punished...

397
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:33,070
learn a lesson.

398
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:36,735
It will be painful.

399
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:40,056
How about a...

400
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:42,034
spanking?

401
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,724
A good, hard spanking.

402
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:52,512
Don't move.

403
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:55,622
<i>Qué pasó?</i>

404
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:57,826
<i>Alguien</i>

405
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,484
<i>mas importante espera pa' verte.</i>

406
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:02,813
<i>Pues apenas se esta poniendo divertido.</i>

407
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,876
<i>Al menos que nos digas
que la matemos ahorita mismo.</i>

408
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,127
<i>Habra mas tiempo
para diversiones cuando...</i>

409
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,785
<i>no tengas negocios que atender. </i>

410
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,083
- It's time for you to go.
- Yeah, I...

411
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,376
I heard the verb for "to kill".

412
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,174
Yes, well...

413
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,992
work on your Spanish.

414
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:25,309
Am I...

415
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:27,969
am I going back in the trunk?

416
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,363
No, you're going home.

417
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:33,423
Just this once,

418
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,117
you may use the tunnel.

419
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:38,387
I'll call ahead and tell Ignacio
not to shoot you...

420
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,565
For now.

421
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,591
Good night, Nancy Botwin.

422
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,419
- He's the mayor?
- <i>Sí.</i>
