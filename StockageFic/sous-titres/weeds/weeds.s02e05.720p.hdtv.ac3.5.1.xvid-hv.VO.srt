1
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:06,253
She's already taken
a whole box of tests.

2
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:07,938
She's gonna take another one.

3
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,483
You're humiliating her.

4
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:13,370
- Silas, she's fine.
- She's pregnant!

5
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:15,375
We're going to confirm that.

6
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:19,435
Why do you have a home pregnancy test?

7
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:21,785
Do you want me to kill you?

8
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,670
I can't pee.

9
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,685
Drink some water.

10
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:28,700
I was just asking a question.

11
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,156
- I ask the questions.
- Alright.

12
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:31,874
- I'm the mother.
- Okay.

13
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:33,868
- How did this happen?
- You don't wanna hear it.

14
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,670
Oh, but I really do.

15
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:38,981
If I had to bet, I'd tell you
it was 3 weeks ago in my room,

16
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,153
doggystyle, when I pulled
out the condom was gone.

17
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:44,523
Megan has really strong
muscles, must have sucked it...

18
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,843
Stop! Stop! Stop!

19
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,583
You asked.

20
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:51,050
- Wanna be the cool mom.
- No. No, I don't.

21
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,231
Million things in
this world I wanna be.

22
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,440
Cool mom...

23
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,680
nowhere on that list.

24
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:04,080
I hope grandma is on that list.

25
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:07,623
This is all so exciting.

26
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,543
Isn't this exciting? It's exciting!

27
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,872
Are you nervous about the audition?

28
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:12,972
A little.

29
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:14,793
There's nothing to be nervous about.

30
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,102
- Hodes? Isabelle Hodes?
- She's right here.

31
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,023
Hey.

32
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,843
Do your best.

33
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:27,260
- Hello.
- You're late.

34
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:30,011
I'm running for elected office, Dean.

35
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,600
Believe it or not, I
have better things to do.

36
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,362
I have a job interview.

37
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:37,853
For a job, Celia, which we need
so we can afford your campaign.

38
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,952
Of course, who's rejecting you today?

39
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,052
Just try to make sure our daughter gets out
of here with some modicum of self-esteem.

40
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:46,930
Try not to get tazered this time.

41
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,191
Your girl is in there right now.

42
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:52,270
That's wonderful.

43
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:55,740
- You want a maple bar?
- No. No, thank you.

44
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm getting a corn syrup contact
high just sitting here.

45
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm comfortable in my skin.

46
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,400
I want my clothes to
reflect what's within.

47
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,323
Good things come in big packages.

48
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:15,052
The bigger, the better,
the Huskaroo sweater.

49
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,473
Excuse me.

50
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,050
Huskaroo lets you be you.

51
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,301
Huskaroo lets you be you.

52
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:24,590
Isabelle!

53
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,132
Mom?

54
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:28,662
She's fantastic!

55
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,911
This is us.

56
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,201
These are our pot growing
armenian neighbors.

57
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,550
10 houses on this block, 4 of them growing.

58
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,781
How in the fuck, fuck,
fuck, does that happen?

59
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,780
Hey, can I ask you for your pen?
I love the smell of Sharpies.

60
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:53,671
Oh, did you ever
smell dry erase markers?

61
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:54,592
Hey!

62
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:57,410
Don't any of you people fucking get it?

63
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,243
We just opened up a Burger King in
the middle of fucking MacDonald's.

64
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:03,143
Except Ronald is this tracksuit wearing
motherfucker named bizarre

65
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,090
with a last name who's like a eye
chart ready to cut your dick off

66
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,022
and mail it on 4 different directions.

67
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,800
We're butt naked in
front of George Bush

68
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,892
with our dick in his daughter's mouth.

69
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,223
Enough with the dicks.

70
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,003
What if those houses

71
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,593
accidentally burned down?

72
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,762
Okay, no thank you. No thank you.

73
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,062
We got a house full of plants, Lacey.

74
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,992
We need to pack 'em up in soil.

75
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:26,591
Rent us some U-Haul and get
the fuck out. We have to move.

76
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,131
Can we at least hire the guys outside
of Home Depot to move us?

77
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,801
I've got a lower lumbar pain.

78
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,160
We're not going anywhere.

79
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:37,072
- I don't believe that you heard me.
- I heard you dicks and MacDonald's.

80
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:41,753
We've as much right to grow pot
in our rental house as they do.

81
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,703
We're staying.

82
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:46,661
I'll take care of it.

83
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:54,151
British port, Connecticut.
Lifeguarding.

84
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:57,492
Charlie?

85
00:04:58,936 --> 00:04:59,771
Lawrence?

86
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,323
Ellen?

87
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:07,760
No? No.

88
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,500
I wanna talk to them by myself.

89
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:17,292
Oh. Okay.

90
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:20,193
It's gonna be great.

91
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:32,270
Text message me right after, okay?

92
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:38,510
Here you go.

93
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:39,801
What's this?

94
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,440
New  bakery. New location.

95
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,781
Under the X.

96
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,941
You're opening a bakery in
a residential cul-de-sac.

97
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:53,612
A special kind of bakery.

98
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:55,162
Special how?

99
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:58,490
Special in that we won't necessarily

100
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,633
bake anything there.

101
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,751
What are you going to do in this
bakery if you do not bake?

102
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:08,071
We're going to... that
is to say we're already...

103
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,013
growing.

104
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:16,951
- Growing?
- I grow.

105
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,313
That is special.

106
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:29,300
You didn't tell me
about this in Las Vegas.

107
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,942
- You're mad?
- This is visionary idea, Mrs. Botwin.

108
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,081
- You're mad.
- Something like that.

109
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:38,353
The circles, these are...

110
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,420
Other visionaries.

111
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,660
Hostile visionaries.

112
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:51,603
I'm wondering
what you think about it.

113
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:58,810
I'm thinking this
wasn't one of my vows.

114
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:01,820
Silas got his girlfriend pregnant.

115
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:05,071
- Doggystyle.
- What?

116
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,472
They're  telling her
parents today. I should be at home

117
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,980
waiting for him but I can't
'cause I have this problem.

118
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:15,203
I have fires in 2 houses, Mr. Botwin.

119
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:21,683
Mr. Scottson.

120
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,423
- I gotta get back to work.
- Oh.

121
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,373
Go be a mom.

122
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,252
Chedarella.

123
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,670
No crust.

124
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:58,520
So...

125
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,512
I don't know.

126
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,912
She  wanted to do it alone.

127
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:05,571
I said okay.

128
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:08,422
But she hasn't messaged me yet.

129
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,390
She's probably dealing
with a lot right now.

130
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,921
Maybe they took her phone.

131
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,381
Yeah, maybe that's it.

132
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,721
Water's nice.

133
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,901
I told Andy and Shane.

134
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,410
Do you wanna talk?

135
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:32,731
No.

136
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,391
Are you sure?

137
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,553
We went upstairs in this big building.

138
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,680
And after my uncle paid her,

139
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:51,371
Jade took me into a room

140
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:53,953
and told me to take off my pants.

141
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:54,613
Shut up!

142
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:56,241
- No way!
- Way!

143
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,780
- Did you do it?
- I did.

144
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,666
- You took your pants off?
- I did.

145
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,634
- No way!
- Shut up!

146
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:02,848
Shhh!

147
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:07,060
How long did it last?

148
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,161
I'd say 45 seconds.

149
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,841
- Shut up!
- No way!

150
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,292
That's awesome!

151
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,001
We're supposed to be studying!

152
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,091
Study this!

153
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,212
Bitches gotta learn.

154
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,932
You guys wanna see
what she looked like?

155
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:27,763
Whoa!

156
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,301
Whoa!

157
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:35,313
My uncle likes Cindy.

158
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:37,220
But I had Jade.

159
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,810
I got some on my knee

160
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:41,772
and she wiped it off with a warm towel.

161
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,162
Oh, Chedarella!

162
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,403
Botwin house.

163
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,583
Not here, ma'am. Try back later.

164
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,403
What?

165
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:25,812
Shane?

166
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:30,382
We have reason to believe that
Shane was abused by a masseuse.

167
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,501
- Here at school?
- No, not at school.

168
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,162
At a massage parlor.

169
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:37,890
And if I'm to believe the conversation
I overheard with his friends,

170
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:41,612
he's suggesting that his uncle
took him to this establishment.

171
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,532
- His uncle?
- You.

172
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:45,251
What? Me?

173
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,400
Come on.

174
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:51,191
What kind of man

175
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:54,291
would take a prepubescent
boy to a massage parlor?

176
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:57,471
An irresponsible, morally
bankrupted degenerate!

177
00:11:57,596 --> 00:11:59,943
Is that why you pulled me
out of the Yeshiva to tell me?

178
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:00,590
Yeshiva?

179
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,892
Yeah, at Amadrash la Torah

180
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,232
where I'm a full time
rabbinical student.

181
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,440
We're taught to contemplate,

182
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:11,003
ask questions and exercise restraint

183
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,041
before reaching conclusions.

184
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,491
And only then

185
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,983
and with religious trepidation,

186
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:18,982
do we attempt to

187
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,350
interpret.

188
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:22,042
What are you saying, Mr. Botwin?

189
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:24,140
What am I saying?

190
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,853
I'm saying...

191
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,322
he made it up!

192
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,572
He wanted to look cool
in front of his friends.

193
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,921
- He made it up?
- Shane is...

194
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,063
going through changes,
he's experimenting.

195
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,700
- Experimenting?
- He's masturbating.

196
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:38,641
Oh.

197
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,491
It's an akward time for a young man.

198
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:43,482
You remember that time, don't you?

199
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:44,390
Possibly.

200
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,351
You know you turn out the lights,

201
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,721
crowl into bed, you reach
down there and feel...

202
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:49,860
Think you're alone.

203
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,570
- Suddenly, it's...
- Halloween!

204
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:53,572
Your father is standing there dressed in a

205
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:54,990
bee costume...

206
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,363
watching you.

207
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,360
***

208
00:12:57,488 --> 00:13:00,023
- The shame!
- Yeah, the shame.

209
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:09,893
So you didn't take him to see Jade.

210
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:12,363
I took him to a chinese restaurant.

211
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:15,150
We're gonna let young Shane
off with a warning.

212
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,253
That's superb.

213
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,931
We're not gonna mention, you know...

214
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:19,511
Your father and a bee costume.

215
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,481
- Have a good day, Mr. Botwin.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:25,410
Hello, my name is Debra Garringer,

217
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:28,373
calling on behalf of the Agrestic
Citizens for Change...

218
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:32,571
We're making a courtesy
call about the debate.

219
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:36,753
Hi, this is Nancy Botwin, I'm
calling on behalf of Agrestic...

220
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,303
Citizens for Change.

221
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,680
Would you like Agrestic to
be a drug free community?

222
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:45,650
Nancy, put a little
more perk in your pitch!

223
00:13:51,616 --> 00:13:55,923
Hi, can I speak to Mr. Fuckyouson?

224
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,970
- I can't do this, Celia.
- What?

225
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:01,191
We're just letting people
know about the debate.

226
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:03,860
Debra Garringer,
Agrestic Citizens for Change?

227
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:05,610
Well, I can't just say it's me!

228
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,131
That would be too...

229
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,072
- Honest.
- Leading.

230
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:14,602
We're trying to let the
voters decide for themselves.

231
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,700
I guess it's only marginally delusional.

232
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:19,093
Hey, there's no gun
pointed at your head.

233
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:23,393
If you can't make time for the pressing
problems of greater Agrestic...

234
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:26,702
That's exactly it, I can't make
time, I've got problems at home.

235
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:30,160
Really? Do you wanna talk about it?

236
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,581
I don't wanna talk about it.
I just wanna go home.

237
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,893
You know, I tell you about
my husband's unemployment,

238
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,162
my daughter being the face
of America's trends fat so...

239
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:45,373
Tell me what's going on with you.

240
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,581
Please, Nancy.

241
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,131
- Celia.
- Aren't we friends?

242
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:52,052
- I just wanna go.
- You can't even say it.

243
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:55,000
You don't wanna be my friend.

244
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,730
Everything is not about you, Celia.

245
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:02,962
What the fuck are you doing?

246
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,150
Be my friend!

247
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:07,310
- Let go of my fucking hair!
- Be my friend!

248
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:11,680
- Let go of my fucking hair!
- Be my goddamn motherfucking friend!

249
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:16,340
Selfish! Selfish! Selfish!

250
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:25,792
You two are just like sisters.

251
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,173
Hey, Deano.

252
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,211
Hey, you got the late shift.

253
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,491
Don't you have a debate
with my wife tomorrow?

254
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,883
Oh yeah, the debate thingy.

255
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,503
What's on the boob?

256
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,540
As your campaign manager,
I should tell you

257
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:42,920
she's been practicing all week.

258
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,250
Well, she's wasting her time.
Nobody goes to those things.

259
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:48,730
And besides, I'm great at debating.
Go ahead, ask me a question.

260
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:53,942
Mr. Wilson, what zoning
laws do you plan to enact

261
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,581
to combat suburbans problems?

262
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:56,501
Next question.

263
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,221
You're not even worried.

264
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,923
Worried? Nobody likes your
wife, you don't even like her.

265
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,800
I could stand up on that
podium tomorrow night

266
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,830
and take a shit on one of
those make-a-wish cancer kid

267
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,423
and people'd still vote for
me 'cause they hate your wife.

268
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,843
And... I'm likeable.

269
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:12,223
You almost make me feel bad for Celia.

270
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,190
Tell her that, maybe she'll fuck you.

271
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:17,360
See, I'm on your side,
buddy. Vote for me!

272
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:34,583
Bitchin.

273
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,780
Don't you think it's
the circuit breaker?

274
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:40,482
Next  question!

275
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,541
Come on, boy, zip it up!

276
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,803
I'm trying, Heylia. You got
to inhale more or something.

277
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:46,150
I ain't that fat.

278
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:50,301
Just put some backbone into it. Come on! 1, 2, 3!

279
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:52,823
Alright.

280
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:54,932
That's him! That's him!

281
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:57,222
- Give me the vanilla extract.
- What you need that for?

282
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,321
Just  give it to me,
he likes baked goods.

283
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,183
Okay.

284
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:05,223
Alright here. How do I look? How do I look?

285
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:06,682
You look good.

286
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,981
Shit! You ain't Joseph.

287
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,651
You got any coffee?

288
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,831
Conrad, get chicka some coffee.

289
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:18,613
- Make it black.
- She likes it black, Conrad.

290
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,330
Late night?

291
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,380
Helping my friend Lacey out.

292
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:28,651
Some kids at her neighborhood put
a hand ax to her electrical cables.

293
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:32,421
I had to drive over there and figure
out how to hook up a generator.

294
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:35,231
You'd think they'd leave
instructions on those damn things.

295
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,751
- Where does she live?
- Gardendale.

296
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,443
Lacey needs to get
herself a new address.

297
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,581
That's what she's coming around to.

298
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,171
Conrad, did you say something?

299
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:49,373
No, I'm just getting Mrs here some coffee ***, ma'am.

300
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,440
- Who's having a picnic?
- I am.

301
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,252
I can't remember the last
time I had a picnic.

302
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:02,033
Oh God, that's good.

303
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,350
Did you pack that kush?

304
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,423
Two of them. Two.

305
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:09,772
Hello. Hey, honey.

306
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:11,971
Calm down.

307
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:13,623
Calm down.

308
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:15,921
I'm coming.

309
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:20,743
- Is that Lacey?
- No, I need my stuff.

310
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,381
- It's almost ready.
- I need it now.

311
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,740
You'll have to give me a second.

312
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,702
I'll come back for it later.

313
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:39,380
- Where have you been?
- I'm here. What happened?

314
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,862
- Where were you?
- What happened to your face?

315
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,342
I just went to see Megan.

316
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:45,923
Calm down.

317
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,483
She hasn't been in school for 2
days. They took her to a clinic.

318
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,222
She  won't answer my messages.

319
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:55,411
I just wanted to talk to her.
I just wanted to talk to her

320
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,701
and he won't let me talk
to her and he hit me.

321
00:18:57,787 --> 00:18:59,761
Hit you? Who?

322
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,032
I did.

323
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:07,123
You hit my kid?

324
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:09,130
I only wanted to talk to her.

325
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,562
You hit my kid?

326
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:14,953
Your son fucking stabbed me.

327
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:16,402
He put his foot through the window,

328
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,613
I grabbed ahold of him and
he grabbed the piece of glass

329
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,331
and he stabbed me. So yes, I hit him.

330
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:22,932
Silas?

331
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:25,481
Keep him away from my daughter.

332
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,771
Your son is a fucking loser.

333
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,760
You taught me how to drive.

334
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,530
Silas, get in the car.

335
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:45,370
He just wanted to talk to her.

336
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:47,323
What's the big fucking deal?

337
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:48,873
The big deal, Mrs. Botwin,

338
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,913
is that I had a decent,
respectable daughter.

339
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:51,872
Oh, please.

340
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,541
She meets your son,
she starts smoking pot,

341
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,893
she's doing ecstasy and
she's had an abortion!

342
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:58,302
She was the blowjob
queen of Dooey street!

343
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,420
And you're a shitty parent.

344
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:05,240
You lay a hand on my kid
again, I will kill you.

345
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:07,320
Do you understand me?

346
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,252
Are you fucking hearing me?

347
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,331
You need to leave now.

348
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:14,411
We're leaving. We are completely leaving.

349
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:26,842
Just drive.

350
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:28,880
Just drive.

351
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,050
You can make that choice for change

352
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:36,862
by giving me
your vote on election day.

353
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:42,601
And when elected, I promise to be
everything that Doug Wilson is not.

354
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:46,961
Active, Committed, Engaged...

355
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:49,630
ACE.

356
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:52,523
Thank you.

357
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:58,801
Mr. Wilson, your final statement?

358
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,530
Nah, I'm good.

359
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:05,200
Go Doug!

360
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:20,171
- Hey, Sanjay.
- Hey, Andy.

361
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,211
What's that humming sound?

362
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:25,390
The generators. The Armenians
cut the electrical cables.

363
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:27,232
Well, that's not very neighborly.

364
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,233
They're historically put up on people.

365
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,821
It's not neighborly
but it's understandable.

366
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:33,113
Why are you standing like that?

367
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:35,150
It's the only way to get Channel 12.

368
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:36,612
Oh.

369
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,370
Thanks.

370
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,210
We also get channel 34. Infomercials.

371
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:46,720
And you don't have to hold the antenna.

372
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,850
I bought diamonic earrings for Nancy.

373
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,600
I mean my mother.

374
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:55,852
- Good night.
- Bye!

375
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,401
- It's a raid.
- What?

376
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,081
The cops are outside everywhere.

377
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,021
They're all over the place, Andy.

378
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:30,372
Shit.

379
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:31,962
Shit! Shit!

380
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:33,220
What do we do? What do we do?

381
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:34,280
I don't know.

382
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,783
We gotta hide it. We gotta hide it all!

383
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:37,143
Okay. Okay. Okay.

384
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:38,411
Turn on the lights.

385
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,780
We can't turn on the lights.
We'll ruin the grow cycle.

386
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:42,651
Turn on the lights, Sanjay!

387
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,522
Conrad said never to
turn on the lights!

388
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:46,233
Fuck Conrad!

389
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,151
Okay. Goddamn it. Alright.

390
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,410
Shhh. Plants.

391
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,580
Shit. Shit! Shit!

392
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:55,491
Get the plants.

393
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:56,991
I said get the plants.

394
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,191
Wait, what do I do?

395
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,673
Flush everything. I gotta save the mother!

396
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,642
No. Oh no!

397
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:27,933
Okay, mamma.

398
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,101
Forgive me.

399
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,060
We had this pregnant hamster
in science class last year

400
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,231
and Denny Cohen put
a pencil up her butt

401
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:03,552
and later she had dead babies.
Kinda like an abortion.

402
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:07,521
Fuck you.

403
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:11,222
It's not a fucking hamster.

404
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:17,763
Shane.

405
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:19,113
What?

406
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,920
I don't want you playing
with Denny Cohen anymore.

407
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,613
Go get ready for school.

408
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:37,302
- Hello.
- I have a gift for you.

409
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:40,822
You do?

410
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:44,350
Yeah, turn on the TV, channel 8.

411
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:46,803
- Alright.
- I'd hurry.

412
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:52,610
The daring raid on 4
marijuana grow houses

413
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,870
took place late last
night in Gardendale.

414
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,893
Residents were awaken to the sounds

415
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:58,683
of police sirens and battering rams.

416
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,823
Over a 1000 plants
were confiscated and

417
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:04,832
dozens were arrested including
drug kingpin Aram Kashishian.

418
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:08,293
I'm here live with
agent Peter Scottson

419
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,753
from the Drug Enforcement Agency. He lead this raid.

420
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,723
He joins us now. Agent Scottson?

421
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:14,731
Hang on just a sec, will you?

422
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,181
Lieutenant Scottson, can you tell us

423
00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:20,070
is this a common base of
operation for drug dealers?

424
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:23,663
Gated communities can
provide a perfect cover for

425
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:27,523
a drug operation. Insulation from the outside world.

426
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,130
But they can also provide

427
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,142
the ideal environment
for a well executed bust.

428
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:36,133
Gates keep people out, but
they can also keep people in.

429
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,973
In this case, an armenian drug cartel.

430
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:41,912
Not sure I would use the term cartel

431
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:44,512
but no doubt it was a major operation.

432
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:48,040
This is a drug free zone now.

433
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:50,582
Okay, thank you, agent
Scottson from the DEA.

434
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:52,843
Reporting live from the
scene, I'm Lynn Amarillo.

435
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:56,273
- Back to you and the studio.
- Thanks Lynn. In other news...

436
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:57,900
Yep.

437
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,073
As I was saying,

438
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:03,813
I was looking for the perfect
gift to get for my wife and so...

439
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,361
I got her neighborhood.

440
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:11,151
- You got me a neighborhood.
- I did.

441
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:14,203
You're very thoughtful, Mr. Scottson.

442
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:19,970
And you are very, very
beautiful, Mrs. Scottson.

443
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:23,432
Oh my!

444
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:30,730
