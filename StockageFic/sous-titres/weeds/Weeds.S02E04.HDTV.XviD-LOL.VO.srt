1
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
It's a shame that

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
the one house in the neighborhood
that attempted originality

3
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
chose this.

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,900
If I'm elected,

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,300
people like this are
gonna have to pay a fine.

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
I'll call it "This is not fine"
fine and I'll just keep collecting it

7
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,200
until they can't pay their mortgage
and the bank repossesses their house.

8
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,400
With that in mind,

9
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,100
I'll go tell the neighbors
how enlightened you are.

10
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:28,800
- Hi.
- Hello.

11
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,706
I'm Celia Hodes.

12
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:34,704
- I love your statuary.
- Oh, thank you.

13
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,908
I just ordered the gazelle.

14
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,400
Wow!

15
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,700
Oh, no, thank you.

16
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:44,601
No, no, I'm selling anything.
This is my campaign litterature.

17
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,602
I'm running for city council.

18
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:48,200
And I would love your support.

19
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:51,202
- I'm voting for Doug Wilson.
- Really?

20
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:54,301
- Why?
- I like his campaign slogan.

21
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:57,903
"Change just brings problems."

22
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:03,100
Fucking immigrants.

23
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,200
How did it go?

24
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,801
I think they are Doug loyalists.

25
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:10,402
Why is everybody so stupid?

26
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,403
Look at the bright side:

27
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,002
like the rest of America,
most of them won't vote.

28
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:15,800
Mom!

29
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,001
This lady wants to talk to you.

30
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,201
Excuse me. Duty calls.

31
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:27,603
Hi. Celia? Lane Cassidy.

32
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,300
Hi, Lane. Celia Hodes
running for city council.

33
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:33,501
Did you have some
questions about my campaign?

34
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:37,302
No, it's your daughter.
She's absolutely perfect.

35
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:41,202
- For what?
- Modeling.

36
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:42,803
Ok, well, that's just cruel.

37
00:02:42,907 --> 00:02:45,002
Come on, Isabel, step
away from the crazy person.

38
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:47,300
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm a Huskaroo rep.

39
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,302
A what?

40
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:52,800
Huskaroo. It's a clothing
line for larger children

41
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,003
- and we are casting for models.
- That sounds awesome!

42
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,302
Yeah, well,
keep your sweat pants on.

43
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:01,802
My daughter is not
modeling fat clothes.

44
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:03,502
They're just roomier.

45
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,601
Well, if you change your mind,

46
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,802
call me.

47
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,803
This is so not gonna happen.

48
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:13,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

49
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:16,503
- You busy tonight?
- It's kinda short notice.

50
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,303
You can't just call a girl at
the last minute and ask her out.

51
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,802
Now that we're married
you're using the rules on me?

52
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:26,503
Well, truth is I'm gonna be
exhausted. I'll be no fun.

53
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,400
- What about tomorrow night?
- Movie night with Shane.

54
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,002
Uh... Sunday?

55
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:35,502
Can't. I'm going undercover for
weeks, I won't be able to see you.

56
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,602
Unless you're walking
down Pacific Beach

57
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:39,800
and you wanna
get your tongue pierced.

58
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:41,303
Mom, I wanna be a model.

59
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,802
Get an eating disorder
and we'll talk then.

60
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,002
I gotta go.

61
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,002
Fine. Choose your kid over me.

62
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,502
Everytime but...

63
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,600
you're ahead of my brother-in-law.

64
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,501
When I get back, you're
gonna date me, woman.

65
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:54,403
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:58,502
Mom, I need to get back to school
because lunch break's almost over.

67
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you please give me a ride?

68
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,602
Run back...

69
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:05,701
then maybe strangers won't ask
you to model plus size fashion.

70
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,602
- So, who was that?
- Nobody.

71
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:11,600
- A guy?
- Celia!

72
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:15,300
If you weren't dating already,
it's about time you started.

73
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,800
If you think I'm ready
then I guess I am.

74
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:20,200
Hey, what about going
out with Mr. Luterstein?

75
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:23,200
- He's fat. Very gay.
- What about Mr. Conser?

76
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,702
- Cock-eyed.
- Harry Lipman?

77
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,600
- He's in his 60s.
- Yeah, but he has a Segway.

78
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:33,200
Besides it's pretty slim
pickens for us at our age.

79
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,302
How are things with Dean?

80
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,201
Oh, let's see: he's a fucking loser

81
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,401
with a body shaped
like Cadbury egg.

82
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,602
Only with hair all over it.

83
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:45,801
But on the plus side, he's
tiny, he has a decent job.

84
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,100
Sorry, Mr. Hodes, you
can't take the chair.

85
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:52,203
This is my chair. I bought it
from Relaxaback with my own money.

86
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:53,101
I can't believe this!

87
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,400
Well, we're gonna need
your parking pass, sir.

88
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,603
- Thank you.
- Fucking... fuckers fucked!

89
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,103
Mr. Hodes, that's not appropriate.

90
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,701
Cheap ass corporate
cocksuckings cocks!

91
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,301
Sir, please, I kinda like you.

92
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,203
I'm filing you for maltermination suit,

93
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,900
you dirty lying stingy ass cunt pricks

94
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,802
with  your bullshit expense accounts!

95
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:15,901
Fuck all of you! Fuck all of you!

96
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:17,603
- Sir!
- You too! You too!

97
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:20,300
I know how you break in Edwin's
office and how you rug...

98
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,402
That's bullshit about Tara and Eric.

99
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,903
- No way did he bone her.
- Says he got a handjob.

100
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,802
So? Big deal! Candy gives
it to me all the time.

101
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:38,103
Dude, that slut gives
them to everybody.

102
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,803
Not to Strange Botwin she doesn't.

103
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:42,401
I bet he's never had one.

104
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,602
Can't even find somebody to lunch with.

105
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,203
Lacy Laplante?

106
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:57,801
My boy said that it means "the
plant". Seemed appropriate.

107
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,403
Yeah. Why not just call
me Mary Jane Dealer?

108
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:02,303
Look, if anything they'll
think you're a stripper.

109
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:03,703
You're sure this is gonna work?

110
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:04,901
Just be cool.

111
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:08,800
Next.

112
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:13,903
I set up an account
over the phone today

113
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,303
and I'm here to pay
the deposit in cash.

114
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:18,501
Driver's license and social please.

115
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,801
What are these?

116
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,902
I'm  from Canada... eh?

117
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,100
I'm not sure if we
can accept these, lady.

118
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:36,601
Look, I just moved down here and I
don't have a license or social yet.

119
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,102
But I really, really need
electricity by tomorrow.

120
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,501
What? You can't miss
Oprah for one day?

121
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:46,800
My husband is on a ventilator and
his medevac lands in the morning.

122
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,500
All right, I'll see what I can do.

123
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,102
Sorry about your husband.

124
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:53,800
Hockey.

125
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,302
A forward from Mouston
checked him so hard that

126
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,200
his  sternum broke and
he punctured a lung.

127
00:06:58,307 --> 00:06:59,903
That's when they found the cancer.

128
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:02,000
We moved here to be
close to a specialist.

129
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,001
Sorry about the Oprah crack.

130
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,402
Just give me power
and we'll call it even.

131
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:10,801
Yes, Mrs. Laplante. No problem.

132
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,103
Did you do it?

133
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:16,803
Lacey is...

134
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,201
a fucking...

135
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,402
badass.

136
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,901
Hey! Look, what I found
in the closet: a hookah.

137
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,601
Oh, cool, man.

138
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:31,302
Let's fire her up!

139
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,203
Oh, a hookah!

140
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:37,502
Mr. Avakian, the guy
that owns this house,

141
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,600
would always ask me to
share a hookah with him.

142
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:42,302
I thought he was just
some creepy armenian perv.

143
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,403
Now I realize he was
just a party brother.

144
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,806
How cool would it be if there
was a genie in this hookah?

145
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,204
Not for him, he'd be on fire.

146
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,408
Yeah. What if he popped out first though?

147
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,103
And granted you a
wish, what would it be?

148
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,001
Ok. All right.

149
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,703
There's this authentic
Chinese restaurant

150
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,501
I went to in San Francisco once.

151
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:13,103
Had the greatest
General Tso chicken ever.

152
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,702
I'd wish...

153
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,303
to fuck the hostess.

154
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:17,903
You?

155
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:21,402
$180 billion.

156
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,702
Oh... Cash over ass, huh?

157
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,800
Cash equals ass.

158
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,403
What was I thinking
taking ass over cash?

159
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:30,503
Guess I'm even hornier than I thought.

160
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:33,000
Things with wifey slowing down, huh?

161
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:36,102
It used to be wild. I mean intense.

162
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:42,000
But how do you ask a woman
that makes your kids lunches

163
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:46,202
to suck your balls and spread her
ass open like a geometry compass?

164
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:49,203
How, Andy? How?

165
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,901
I don't like this game anymore.

166
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,902
We are good to grow.

167
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,201
You're high already!

168
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,002
It's not even 4:20.

169
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:05,602
If you want me to do manual
labor, don't expect me to be lucid.

170
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,902
What's the point of cleaning
anyway? We're just gonna be planting.

171
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:11,203
The grow area has to be
completely sterilized.

172
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:13,800
There can't be any
germs or bacterias in here.

173
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:15,300
How do we get rid of those boxes?

174
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,803
You must mean the boxes I spent
all yesterday afternoon setting up.

175
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,200
We don't. That's our false front.

176
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,901
Who the fuck is that?

177
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,203
That's me. Planning ahead.

178
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:31,800
What the hell part of
"discretion" do you not understand?

179
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,601
"Cretion". I know the "dis" part.

180
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,601
Whose name did you sign up with?

181
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,503
Nancy Botwin... Oh, shit!

182
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:39,901
I am Lacey Laplante, you idiot.

183
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:42,102
I thought it would be
nice if we had internet.

184
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,603
Bring a penthouse.

185
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:48,103
Hey, we changed our minds. We think the Internet is just a phase.

186
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:50,500
Could you please rip up... As a matter of fact...

187
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,702
Save you the trouble.

188
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,903
You know what? As much
as I like to indulge,

189
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:00,300
we have a lot of work to do.

190
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:01,902
All the equipments are
being delivered tomorrow.

191
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:04,001
Victor is coming over to set it up.

192
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,702
So much for being discrete.

193
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:08,602
Yeah, you're sure we
trust this guy, right?

194
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,401
Yo, 98% of Victor's business
is setting up grow houses.

195
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:14,903
He rats out one person,
he fucks his entire livelihood.

196
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,300
You know what? I would like
to set this up ourselves

197
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,503
but in case you haven't
noticed, there are times

198
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,802
when our little posse seems like
the fucking Bad News Drug Dealers.

199
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,301
And the equipment that I
got is pretty sophisticated.

200
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,402
Just how sophisticated
are we talking about?

201
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:29,902
I'm talking about top of the line.

202
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:34,102
Not of this cheap passive
weak system bullshit.

203
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,603
Is this your way of telling
me you went over budget?

204
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,702
Baby, let's not get
hang up on corrosive.

205
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:41,900
My projecting say we're gonna be generating
a million plus in year of revenues.

206
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:42,801
What numbers?

207
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,102
20 metal highlight hood
locks bulbs, 2,000 a pop.

208
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,202
We're looking at multiple
gallon reservoirs.

209
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:50,102
Pumps, 10 wall fans.

210
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,701
What? 10% over?

211
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,303
Baby, baby, this is is my vision, all right?

212
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,903
And when I do something, I
do it right. Nothing half-ass.

213
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:57,303
I mean we got the cash, right?

214
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,900
What if we don't?

215
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:01,403
Do you have the cash?

216
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:02,100
No.

217
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,203
Lacey Laplante might.

218
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,300
Why do you be playing
with me like this?

219
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,702
So who's that? DirectTV?

220
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,202
Probably.

221
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,502
Jesus Christ.

222
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:17,900
Oh, it's just Dean.

223
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:33,601
You okay?

224
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,200
I guess we're square now.

225
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,001
Hey. How come...

226
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:40,200
How come Dean doesn't have to clean?

227
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,602
What's the matter?

228
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:01,003
Everyone at my grade has
already gotten a handjob.

229
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,301
Congrats, little stud. How was it?

230
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:06,202
No, everyone but me.

231
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:08,603
Now they're making fun of me.

232
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,201
Fuck them.

233
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:13,903
When you'll win the Pulitzer price,

234
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,403
you know how much
pussy you're gonna get?

235
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,001
I can't wait that long.

236
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,300
What am I gonna do?

237
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,002
Well, that's easy enough, young man.

238
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:25,600
Huh?

239
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,003
Don't ever say I'm not a good uncle.

240
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:36,500
Mimosa, my darling?

241
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:38,502
Isn't it a little early to be drinking?

242
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,003
Even for you, Celia.

243
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:43,702
- Big day today?
- Oh yeah, yeah.

244
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:48,101
I had to take depositions. Huge case.

245
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:53,202
Yeah, our client wants to sue the city.

246
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,303
Dean, it's Jack. Sorry about
what happened today, buddy.

247
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,603
If you need a
recommendation, let me know.

248
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:07,603
Hi, Mr. Hodes it's Starla.

249
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,500
I spoke to Blue Cross and you're
eligible for this thing called

250
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,601
Cobra Continuation Coverage.

251
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,703
And I'm not supposed to
be talking to you anymore

252
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:16,302
so call my cellphone. Bye!

253
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:29,701
I was the one who
recommended that they downsized.

254
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:33,701
I dedicated my life to that firm.

255
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:39,402
How could you do this to me?

256
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,701
Oh, he ain't even called yet.

257
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,403
Love has found Heylia James.

258
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,300
Girl, you better stop.

259
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:52,803
Just 'cause you ain't got
nobody in your business

260
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,601
don't mean you
can be all up in mine.

261
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:55,803
Did he say that he was gonna call?

262
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:56,901
I said "call me"

263
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,701
and he said "I don't have your number"

264
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,202
so I said "I'm listed", the home phone anyway.

265
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,602
Haven't left the house in 2 days.

266
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:06,203
How fucking pathetic is that?

267
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:07,400
It's cute.

268
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:11,203
If he wasn't hoping for the global
destruction of the white race,

269
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:13,202
I might really be rooting for you two.

270
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,502
He don't mean that shit.

271
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:18,300
Well, maybe he do. I just like him.

272
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,900
Sometimes you fall
for the wrong people.

273
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:25,001
Something about the
way they smell or smile

274
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:29,201
or  carry a little pack
of tissues in their pockets.

275
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,803
Maybe you do got
somebody in your business.

276
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,900
Yeah, he's in his 60s
and he rides a segway

277
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,303
but there's something about him.

278
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:37,503
What the fuck's a segway?

279
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:42,900
It's a thing with 2 wheels
that rich white people ride.

280
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:46,502
Well, ain't the lucky star shining on your lily pots.

281
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:48,302
Even if I break master

282
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:51,703
I  ain't getting boo for Allah knows how long.

283
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:55,502
Still... gives you a reason
to get dressed in the morning.

284
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:00,802
What if she doesn't like me?

285
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:04,500
$80 and a generous tip says she will.

286
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:05,801
Now keep your mouth shut,

287
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,200
consider this an
early birthday present.

288
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,700
Are you getting one too?

289
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,402
I've got a date in a few hours.

290
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:14,602
Of course i'm getting one.

291
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,000
No way to stay cool
if you're backed up.

292
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,903
Nice wedding band.

293
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:27,103
Who next?

294
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:29,702
Hi.

295
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:32,503
My little buddy over
here is a first timer.

296
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,901
I mean he's done the self-serve
but he's looking for a full.

297
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:36,503
Do you have any students discounts?

298
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:39,202
You go away! Inappropriate!

299
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:42,903
- Inappropriate behavior.
- Is this a negociating play?

300
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,802
You don't bring a little boy in here.

301
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:46,401
What? His money's not green?

302
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:48,502
Come on! He's been saving
his allowance for weeks.

303
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:51,302
You, I do. Little boy, no.

304
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:53,601
Where's Rhea?

305
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,601
- Rhea!
- What?

306
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:56,900
Andrew.

307
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,200
It's so nice to see you. It's been a while.

308
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,101
You have a date tonight?

309
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,701
Would you tell Mrs. Saigon
we're here for business?

310
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:08,501
He want happy finish for little boy.

311
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,300
Inappropriate!

312
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,703
He is 18 with a
glandular problem, right?

313
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,001
- Of course!
- He little boy!

314
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,803
If she won't do it, what can I do?

315
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,300
- Artritis.
- Oh, there's..

316
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:22,703
And gingivitis.

317
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,703
Sorry, little buddy.

318
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,202
N o!

319
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,703
Don't cry.

320
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't cry.

321
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,003
Ok. Come in.

322
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:55,401
Nice move with the tears, kid.

323
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,500
- I'm going to Megan's.
- Of course.

324
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,303
Lupita, I'm sorry I
took all your supplies.

325
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:11,700
You did? I mean you should ask.

326
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,900
I get nothing done.

327
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,301
What did you clean?

328
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:18,101
A homeless shelter. Made me feel good.

329
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:20,802
You know, you can
clean the whole house...

330
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,600
Make you feel great.

331
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:25,501
I wouldn't want to take that away from you.

332
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,702
Andy, where were you?

333
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,801
You were supposed to help me clean.

334
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,300
At the homeless shelter.

335
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,701
Oh yeah, the homeless shelter. Well...

336
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,301
I've been doing my own good work.

337
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:41,503
I need to take a nap.

338
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,600
Shane, what about movie night?

339
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,501
I'm tired, mom.

340
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:46,901
Sweet dreams!

341
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,801
I've been stood up!

342
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:53,302
Well, I gotta go ready for a date so...

343
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:55,301
catch you later, Mrs. Lonely Hearts.

344
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:01,502
Hello.

345
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:04,903
It's me. You still
wanna go out tonight?

346
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:07,300
Maybe I'm not available
on such short notice.

347
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:08,400
Are you?

348
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:10,603
I can go for a steak.

349
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,103
Food's boring.

350
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:15,501
Let's do something exciting.

351
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:32,002
- Sure you've never done this?
- You're a good teacher.

352
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,701
18 years on the job.

353
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,702
- Ever killed anybody?
- 18 years on the job.

354
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,003
What's to stop

355
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:49,903
you or me or them from
just blowing somebody away?

356
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:50,901
Death row.

357
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:53,700
Ok.

358
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:56,101
Your turn.

359
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:57,102
It's okay.

360
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:07,903
One more!

361
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,503
You have uh...

362
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,801
amazing shoulders.

363
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:13,401
No, they're tarnished.

364
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:17,001
Look, bullet wound from the army.

365
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:18,503
You saw battle?

366
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,103
Israeli men are very macho.

367
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:23,301
Everything is all fine when you
bring another woman into bed.

368
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:26,601
But you bring another
man and they go crazy!

369
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,100
So he shot you?

370
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,203
To be honest, if he hadn't,

371
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,901
I would have thought he was a faggot.

372
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,902
And the sex was great that night.

373
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,703
The pain and the pleasure...

374
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,201
very exciting.

375
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:42,902
Here you go.

376
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:54,101
- Hello.
- Heylia, this is Joseph.

377
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:56,601
Joseph?

378
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:58,802
Joseph.

379
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,001
So, how are you?

380
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,303
Well, I'm feeling somewhat
conflicted, Heylia.

381
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:07,000
As a follower of Islam,

382
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:09,801
one of the evils we must
be watchful for is the

383
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:13,000
enticing beauty of women.

384
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:14,300
Yet I...

385
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,102
I'd very much like to see you.

386
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:17,603
That's a compliment, right?

387
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,501
Are you available for marriage?

388
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:22,702
Excuse me! Did you just propose?

389
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,400
Damn, you don't waste no time for your God.

390
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,401
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry
if you misunderstood.

391
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:34,202
I was just enquiring if you were
available for marriage down the line.

392
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:38,301
Right now I wish us
to get better acquainted.

393
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:42,701
I just love the way you talk.

394
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:45,003
You wanna date me, right?

395
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,001
Look, I've been waiting
here for 2 hours.

396
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:48,800
Excuse me just a minute, Heylia.

397
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,602
I understand your frustration, ma'am.

398
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:56,301
We will find your bags. I'm doing my best.

399
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,101
Devil bitch.

400
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:03,803
Heylia, I'm afraid anything
beyond phone calls would be

401
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,800
unwise at this juncture.

402
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:09,102
The temptation would be too great.

403
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:12,200
How long is it gonna take
until you get unwise 'cause...

404
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:16,801
No disrespect to Mohammad
but I think you're damn fine

405
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,003
and I wanna see you face to face.

406
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:20,601
I'll see you in 40 minutes.

407
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,900
What are you doing?

408
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:30,701
Oh, I'm... I thought
we were hitting it off.

409
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,403
- Yeah, we are.
- Good.

410
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:39,801
Oh, I'm sorry, it's too soon

411
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:41,602
since your lover died.

412
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:43,401
No, I've been with many men.

413
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,800
Helps to get over things.

414
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,001
Good.

415
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,500
Am I getting mixed messages here or...

416
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:51,401
Look...

417
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,200
you're adorable.

418
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:56,801
But I'm not attracted to you.

419
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:59,600
Sorry.

420
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,700
Are you a chubby chaser or something?

421
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:04,103
No, just...

422
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:08,402
I like a man. Someone big and strong.

423
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,201
Someone who can grow a beard.

424
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:14,500
You're pretty. And I
could flip you like a pancake.

425
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:18,403
You'd ask permission instead of
slamming up against the wall

426
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:21,601
and fucking me until
I cum like a volcano.

427
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:25,702
But we can still be friends, right?

428
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:32,400
I wanna try the Glock next or maybe the Magnum.

429
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:35,301
Easy there, cowgirl. Maybe next time.

430
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:36,803
We're done?

431
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:39,800
I've got a long drive to Pacific Beach

432
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:42,800
and it takes me hours to
sterilize my piercing needles.

433
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,000
Sorry.

434
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:46,902
You like going undercover?

435
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:49,401
With you I do.

436
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:52,301
Come on, it's exciting, isn't it?

437
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:57,201
Until you get shot in the ass
by a meth freak with a nail gun.

438
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,103
Yeah, it's exciting.

439
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:03,700
Bye.

440
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,701
Can I try the shiny one
with the pretty pearly grip?

441
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,502
Sorry, we're closing in 10 minutes.

442
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:19,003
You don't have to go home
but you can't shoot here.

443
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:23,302
Oh, here's your license, Mrs. Laplante.

444
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:27,602
It's Lacey. My mother is Mrs. Laplante.

445
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:43,300
What are you doing back here?

446
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,903
How often are you gonna see
a grow house being built?

447
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:49,100
Close your eyes.

448
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:51,003
- Close your eyes.
- Shut up.

449
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm serious. Come on.

450
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,901
Close your eyes. Step in.

451
00:23:57,406 --> 00:23:58,600
Now...

452
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,003
I want you to picture

453
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:05,202
a bright, bright room filled
with beautiful green plants.

454
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:06,801
Look at the leaves.

455
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,100
Look closer now.

456
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,901
What's on those leaves?

457
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,100
What is going on those leaves?

458
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:16,002
It's money! We're growing money!

459
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:17,501
Well...

460
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,800
If bullshit makes the grass grow, then maybe you're right.

461
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:22,502
Oh but this ain't bullshit,

462
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:25,702
this is hydro.

463
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:28,701
Damn!

464
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:30,902
They're fast.

465
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,800
I think they're meth addicts.

466
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,301
They're not using any
nail guns, are they?

467
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,601
I'm sorry it's taken
so long. I'm Victor.

468
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,600
Hi, I'm Lacey.

469
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:46,802
- I like your eyeballs.
- Thank you, Victor.

470
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:50,002
They're real, you know?

471
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,702
Who the hell is that?

472
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,402
Can I help you?

473
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,901
This is for you.

474
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,701
- What is it?
- Baklava.

475
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:14,803
What for?

476
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:19,002
You are new to the neighborhood. This is to say...

477
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,002
goodbye.

478
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:22,800
Oh. You don't like blacks, huh?

479
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,202
I have no problem with the negros.

480
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:29,400
I like your music and your fried foods.

481
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,901
What's your problem?

482
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:37,703
I see several trucks pull up to
your house today and I'm thinking

483
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:39,503
"What will come out?

484
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,301
Perhaps a ping pong table,

485
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:45,502
maybe a lazy boy
or a flat screen TV."

486
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:50,600
But no, it was all boxes.

487
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:53,203
And I know these boxes.

488
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:57,300
These are Victor's boxes.

489
00:25:57,805 --> 00:26:00,502
I know what you are doing so get out.

490
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:02,500
Or next time I knock on your door...

491
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:04,000
I won't be holding pastries

492
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:07,101
and neither will my
brothers and my cousins.

493
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,100
Tell Victor "Kashishian says hi".

494
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,400
And the long ones are walnut.

495
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,302
Delicious!

496
00:26:29,705 --> 00:26:30,803
Victor...

497
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:35,501
Kashishian says hi.

498
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:37,103
Shit!

499
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:40,502
Guys, hold the work.

500
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:42,001
What's going on?

501
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:47,102
- Ahram Kashishian.
- Who's that?

502
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,201
North side Armenian power.

503
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,703
The competition.

504
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:53,401
I set up his grow houses.

505
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:55,702
Motherfucker is serious
about his business.

506
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:57,101
We gotta move.

507
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,003
This is America.

508
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:01,203
We can all do business.

509
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:02,600
We'll send him cookies.

510
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:04,501
Scare the shit out of him.

511
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:06,103
Did you hear the man?

512
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:08,402
We have problems.

513
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:13,203
There's always problems.
There's always solutions.

514
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:16,002
Keep going, fellows.

515
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:17,803
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

516
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,201
Fine.

517
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:20,903
Lacey...

518
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,800
can I talk to Nancy
for a second, please?

519
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:29,103
She's gonna go home. You
can talk to her tomorrow.

520
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:31,701
Finish.

521
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,802
What's going on?

522
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:58,603
Megan's pregnant.

523
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:02,703
And we're keeping it.

524
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:05,601
Hi, Nancy.
