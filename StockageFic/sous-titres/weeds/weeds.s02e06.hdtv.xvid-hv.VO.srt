1
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,308
Silas!

2
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,037
Come on!

3
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,342
You can't stay locked in there forever.

4
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:06,093
Please come out and ignore me.

5
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:09,754
Or let Lupita refuse
to change your sheets.

6
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,524
- Go away!
- We'll talk.

7
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,275
Come out and talk to me.

8
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:24,365
Hello?

9
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,337
We got trouble in Little Armenia.

10
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,352
Would it kill you to say
good morning when you call?

11
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:30,846
You know I ain't so sure it's
a good morning, the DEA...

12
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,554
The DEA knocked over some
grow houses near our spot.

13
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,488
- Who was on shift?
- Sanjay.

14
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,970
- Did you hear from him?
- No, but...

15
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,131
Just meet me over here,
we're gonna go in together.

16
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:45,732
Okay, I'll be there soon.

17
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:07,051
- Something ain't right.
- What happened?

18
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,303
- They must have busted Sanjay.
- Oh, no. No, no!

19
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:34,470
Don't shoot!

20
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,392
Oh, hi!

21
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:42,090
Hang on, okay? I've got a call.

22
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,583
Hello?

23
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,932
What the fuck happened?

24
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,493
We thought we were being busted,
we tried to flush the weed.

25
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,043
You think a house full of weed

26
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:55,441
is like a dime bag in a
boys room at Church camp?

27
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,223
- I'm Hindu.
- We? Who's we?

28
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,910
- Andy.
- Where is he?

29
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,612
I don't know. He just yelled "Out
of my way, brownie" and ran off.

30
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,913
- Where the fuck is my mother?
- Andy had it.

31
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:07,361
Listen, I have to go, my
mom is probably flipping out.

32
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,930
Go! Go! Go! Go!

33
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,850
What? No raid?

34
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,380
Motherfucker!

35
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:19,941
I think we need a panic room.

36
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,201
What'd you do?

37
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,703
We can't see out, okay?

38
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:26,410
There were sirens and helicopters and

39
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,663
if we had a panic room,
I wouldn't have panicked.

40
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,343
- Why does my plant smell funny?
- Because I saved it.

41
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:36,301
By the way, I'm a
little freaked out over here.

42
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,602
Thought I was going to jail.

43
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,471
Look at this face. I'd get passed
around prison like a loose joint.

44
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,732
Smells like piss. Did
you piss on my plant?

45
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:46,030
No, I did not piss on
your plant, I watered it.

46
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,340
- With my urine.
- You what?

47
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,920
I was saving her life. Not
only did I provide moisture

48
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:55,730
when she was dry, I wrapped her
precious roots in my good hoodie so...

49
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,942
- You're welcome.
- You pissed in my plant.

50
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,630
Pee has nitrogen in it.

51
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,080
Man, that's good for plants.

52
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:03,290
Not when it's concentrated like in pee.

53
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,692
It wasn't concentrated,
I drank like 7 bottles of water.

54
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:07,711
I know the importance
of staying hydrated, man.

55
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,793
Is this bad for us? Did he
hurt our plant with his... pee?

56
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:16,333
See, she's looking
pretty good, isn't she?

57
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,583
That is a little bit of me in her.

58
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:21,222
Why do you never know when to shut up!

59
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,762
I'll get her back in some soil,
see if she takes root again.

60
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:26,200
- If she does, we're okay, right?
- They fucked up our lights.

61
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,653
You better hope that the
rest of 'em plants are okay.

62
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:31,333
I'm gonna go clip some clones
and get us back on track.

63
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:34,392
Ah, well at least we're
still in business, right?

64
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,172
We could all be in a hooskow right now.

65
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,713
No, we couldn't. We were fine
until you trashed the place.

66
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:44,983
I'm gonna check the potty,

67
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,322
see if any of the other
clones are salvageable.

68
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,353
Yeah, you do that.

69
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,680
- Nice.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,650
You look adorable, honey.

71
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,151
Isn't this exciting? It's exciting.

72
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:02,183
It is.

73
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,400
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:08,560
Well, this is now our
only source of income.

75
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,443
So I'm protecting our assets.

76
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,922
Excuse me, the hair is all wrong.

77
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,752
She has a small head on a large body.

78
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,671
Don't let the moon face full you.

79
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:22,581
She needs her big hair
to balance things out.

80
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:23,981
This is what the director wants.

81
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:27,232
Well, the director doesn't
realize that Isabel has a

82
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,110
freakishly small head.

83
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:29,710
Mom.

84
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:33,412
I am looking out for your
best interest. Excuse me.

85
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:37,702
If you add a little volume to the hair,

86
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,851
she won't look like a pinhead.

87
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:42,960
I don't need these negative vibes.

88
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,831
My hairdresser should be
styling here at the circus.

89
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,520
You wanna have a go at make-up next

90
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:49,070
just to guarantee that she's fired?

91
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,901
Well, the make-up is terrible too.

92
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,130
I mean who gives an
11-year-old blowjob lips?

93
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:54,680
What seems to be the problem?

94
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:58,590
The  problem is that they don't
know how to style my daughter.

95
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:03,920
Why is it that all you gay
men hate women so much?

96
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:06,682
Because we have mothers like you.

97
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,651
Okay, you.. the hair.

98
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,761
Security... the mother.

99
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:13,823
- I beg your pardon?
- I want her off my set.

100
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:17,112
- Control freak.
- Horror show.

101
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:20,890
I love showbusiness.

102
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,630
Stop!

103
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,901
- You have to stop.
- Yeah, stop.

104
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,912
Not 'til Silas comes out,
this is my invasion of Panama.

105
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:41,741
Like when we got the canal?

106
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,851
No. What do they teach you in school?

107
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:47,190
How to pass the weekly standardized
tests to get the school more founding.

108
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,982
Okay, kiddo, home schooling.

109
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:54,680
In the 80s, Panama was ruled by a
man with bad skin named Manuel Noriega

110
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,930
who used to be our puppet
leader but then wasn't.

111
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:59,810
So as the US always seems to do
when we have a president named Bush,

112
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:01,121
we invaded his country.

113
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,661
Then Noriega hid out
in the Vatican embassy.

114
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,771
But we couldn't storm in there
'cause the Pope would freak.

115
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:08,692
So instead we blasted
rock music at the building

116
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,661
'til  it drove him so
crazy that he surrendered

117
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,441
and Silas is your mom's Noriega

118
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:15,721
and Polly Wolly Doodle
is her rock 'n roll.

119
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,481
Wow!

120
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,151
Now I'm tired again.

121
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:24,190
Did Noriega had acoustic
noise-cancelling headphones

122
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:28,672
because Silas does and I
don't, now I'm going mental.

123
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:29,963
Go to your

124
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:34,761
mediocre public school
before you're late.

125
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:38,183
Is it okay if I stay
after school a little bit?

126
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:42,001
-  I joined the debate club.
- What brought that on?

127
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:46,001
I don't know, I thought it'd
be fun to debate and stuff.

128
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,593
Well, good for you.

129
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,052
Have fun.

130
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,901
Silas.

131
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,951
Come out please.

132
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:04,311
I'm trying to help you.

133
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:08,912
Damn it!

134
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,381
What can I do to help you?

135
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:12,931
Buy him a car.

136
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:15,630
I want a car.

137
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:17,412
No.

138
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:23,532
So how's business?

139
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,180
I'm not gonna talk with you about this.

140
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:26,111
Not so hot?

141
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,833
Geez Nancy, if you can't
rake it in dealing drugs...

142
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,720
I swear...

143
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:33,203
Come on, stop thinking of
me like a kid. Talk to me.

144
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:36,216
My business is fine. Thank you.

145
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:43,964
So is it just weed? Are
you selling coke or meth?

146
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:50,448
- Just weed.
- Why?

147
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:53,963
Because I think...

148
00:08:54,406 --> 00:09:01,671
coke and meth are dangerous
drugs that destroy lives.

149
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:06,153
I think pot smoking is
basically a victimless crime.

150
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:08,222
Although I don't want you smoking
and you shouldn't smoke it.

151
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,713
Pot makes you stupid.

152
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:12,163
You two look like you are ready to buy.

153
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,321
I need something for my son.

154
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:17,792
Special occasion? Birthday? Graduation?

155
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,101
My girlfriend just had an abortion.

156
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,740
I've got just the car.

157
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,432
This is sweet.

158
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,701
Awesome.

159
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,250
Two-sitter.

160
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:32,692
No backseat, no trouble.

161
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,733
I'll be right back.

162
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:38,260
I love it.

163
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:42,020
No. Unsafe.

164
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:44,370
If you're so concerned about
my safety, maybe you should have

165
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,202
considered another line of work.

166
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,170
One more word, I'm
taking my dirty drug money

167
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,663
and I'm buying myself huge diamond
earrings and a gold tooth.

168
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,643
- Mom!
- I mean it.

169
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:54,800
Get your ass into a nice Ford and be
grateful you're not on rollerblades.

170
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:57,861
You can buy a sports car
when you're 47 and bald.

171
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,571
Agrestic elementary has become
a second rate debate school.

172
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:08,340
We were the regional champions
when students like Joel Garrity,

173
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:14,331
Leon Krantzberg and
Larry Chin were debating.

174
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:17,900
But now it's up to you
to uphold their legacy,

175
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,862
to make us the
powerhouse we once were...

176
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,110
Isabel!

177
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,160
I need to talk to you, Mr. Wilson.

178
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,380
Does your mother know you're here?

179
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,971
No. And please don't tell her.

180
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,751
Oh, I don't speak to that cunt.

181
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,860
- Your mother and I don't really speak.
- That's why I'm here.

182
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:19,160
I need someone I trust
to handle my money.

183
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:20,610
- What money?
- From my commercials.

184
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:21,971
I'm the new Huskaroo's girl.

185
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,803
The bigger, the better, the Huskaroo sweater?

186
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,450
Yeah, that's gonna be me.

187
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,610
And we're talking big hunks of chedder.

188
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:29,710
So can you help me, Mr. Wilson?

189
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:31,970
Well, I could put your money in a trust

190
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:34,892
but you need at least one parent to
be the signatory until you're 18.

191
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,440
That's bullshit, the money's mine!

192
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,600
The state of California says
you gotta pick one parent...

193
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:39,482
My dad.

194
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:45,790
Your mom really has no
idea that you're coming to me?

195
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:54,193
Can your accountant interest
you in a delicious Crunchy?

196
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:54,981
Yeah!

197
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:40,342
Are you still angry with me?

198
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:42,910
No, I'm fine. I'm fine
with being a friend.

199
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm a fine friend.

200
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,610
I have to fuck you.

201
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,671
Will you stop?

202
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,682
I told you...

203
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,122
You don't have the qualities
I look for in a man.

204
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,332
What exactly are those qualities? 'Cause I can get 'em.

205
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,072
I know a guy who knows a guy.

206
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:15,431
I like big men.

207
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:21,461
You have none of the physical
qualities I look for in a male lover.

208
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:26,051
But you do have soft skin.

209
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:29,730
And sad eyes.

210
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:33,702
And those are things I
find very attractive...

211
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:36,331
when I sleep with women.

212
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:41,061
Okay.

213
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:44,890
Well, I do so appreciate

214
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,991
how you respect my dietary laws.

215
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:51,380
Well, it's fun.

216
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,581
Let's eat!

217
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,601
Look at these lamb chops!

218
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:57,760
I like pork chops myself.

219
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:03,190
You know that pig is a filthy animal.

220
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:05,763
It carries parasites

221
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:07,780
that live in your intestine

222
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,551
and lay eggs causing
all kinds of illness.

223
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:13,801
Well, them parasites
taste damn good to me.

224
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:17,001
Mrs. Vaneeta, I'm simply
trying to educate you.

225
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,212
Why? This ain't muslim school.

226
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,521
That's enough, little girl.

227
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,393
Please, Heylia, let me talk to her.

228
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:25,510
Your hostility hangs

229
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:27,900
thick in the air.

230
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,071
What's troubling you?

231
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,083
You coming around here with
your "holier than thou" bullshit.

232
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,291
We don't eat this. We don't do that.

233
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:37,962
We like our women
dressed like fucking bee keepers.

234
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:44,942
My dear child,

235
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:49,912
maybe you need to take a good
hard look at yourself.

236
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:54,632
Look at your tattoos, your cornrows.

237
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,731
Listen to the language that
comes out of your mouth.

238
00:14:58,088 --> 00:14:59,593
You're not a lady.

239
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,460
You don't act like a lady.

240
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:04,762
And then you wonder why
your baby has no father?

241
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:06,971
Fuck you, you bow tie
wearing mother fucker!

242
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:08,182
Hey now, stop!

243
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,592
Both of you. I just...

244
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:11,753
Let's just relax and have a good meal.

245
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:13,773
I am sorry, Heylia.

246
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,412
Perhaps I should be going.

247
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:18,281
That's the best words coming
out of your foul mouth all night.

248
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,000
Joseph!

249
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,970
I'll call you, Heylia.

250
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,882
You got any last words?

251
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes.

252
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,202
Where the hell are you?

253
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:34,693
You're so busy finding fucking
couscous on the Internet,

254
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,292
you ain't taking care of your game.

255
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:39,160
Conrad is never here no more and business is off.

256
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:43,160
All you can think about is some
fancy preaching, pork fearing fat ass.

257
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,270
Heylia, if you wanna drop
out and become one of them

258
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:47,811
lee-lee shrieking Islam ladies,

259
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,210
let me know so I can
hire a fucking babysitter

260
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,283
and call Kewon in and get to work.

261
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,202
'Cause everything is going to shit.

262
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,342
What's that?

263
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,741
What does it look like?

264
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,192
You think you can take it?

265
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:24,960
It's not for me.

266
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:33,910
It's big.

267
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:35,731
I know.

268
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,031
That's really big.

269
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,483
It will fit.

270
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,941
- Does it have to be black?
- Stop being a pussy.

271
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:51,221
I thought that was the whole idea.

272
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:54,032
Don't forget to breathe.

273
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:30,111
What?

274
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,163
Hey,  check it out!

275
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,133
How are the kids?

276
00:17:54,918 --> 00:17:56,081
Conrad?

277
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,330
Got 20 new clippings,
we'll see how they do.

278
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:06,742
You're a genius.

279
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:11,990
What's wrong?

280
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,143
Been thinking.

281
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,831
About what?

282
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,452
About  a little miracle.

283
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:24,060
Dead smack in the middle of all these
houses that get busted and we escape.

284
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:24,993
Yeah.

285
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,190
Wow.

286
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,252
Were we lucky.

287
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:34,401
Funny thing about luck.

288
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:36,041
What's that?

289
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,541
I don't believe in it.

290
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,852
You got something
you wanna say to me?

291
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,610
You wanna tell me why
our little armenian pal

292
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,682
is suddenly no longer a problem?

293
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,421
I told you I was gonna
take care of them.

294
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,150
You're still fucking
that DEA guy, aren't you?

295
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:48,071
- It's not like that.
- Well then please...

296
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,041
tell me what it's like.

297
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,260
He's on our side.

298
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,992
You fucking lied to me.

299
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:55,903
You swore on your children
that he didn't know.

300
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,163
He didn't know when
I told you. I mean...

301
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,081
he did know but I
didn't know that he knew.

302
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:02,672
Turned out actually that he
knew all along but it doesn't...

303
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:05,340
It doesn't matter, it's okay.

304
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,531
How can you be so fucking sure?

305
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,402
- I have insurance!
- Insurance? What?

306
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:17,981
State Farm got some kind of get out
of jail free policy I don't know about?

307
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,253
I married him.

308
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,330
You what?

309
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,010
We're married.

310
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,461
No, it's really clever.

311
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:32,472
If I'm his wife,

312
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:35,481
he can't be forced to
testify against me and

313
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:40,003
he married a drug dealer so it's
kinda mutually assured destruction.

314
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,862
I have the marriage
certificate so we're protected.

315
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:48,872
You're protected.

316
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,481
Ain't no ring on my finger.

317
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:53,502
We're partners.

318
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:54,621
We're  partners?

319
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:58,113
Then why is it that every move
you make digs my grave?

320
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:08,800
- He doesn't know about you.
- For how long?

321
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:09,971
It's just a matter of time.

322
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,331
It's gonna be okay.

323
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,212
How the fuck is this gonna be okay?

324
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:16,841
You know, Heylia was right.

325
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,381
You just open your big
brown eyes and me

326
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,683
I just fall into shit.

327
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,870
What in the hell is this?

328
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,281
The Soft Hell Deluxe.

329
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,003
What the fuck is it doing in my atrium?

330
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,223
I bought it. It's mine.

331
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:50,292
Really? With what money?

332
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:51,462
My salary.

333
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,363
- You got a job?
- Yeah.

334
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,762
And why didn't you tell me? Doing what?

335
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm Isabel's manager.

336
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:07,002
Oh, no. No. No, no, no, no.

337
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,782
Yes, I am. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

338
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:13,221
You're a lawyer, Dean. You
need to find lawyer work.

339
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,900
Kill all the lawyers.

340
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:16,972
God, how did I get here?

341
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,753
What have I done?

342
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,723
This is not my life!

343
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,391
Same as it ever was.

344
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,162
Where were you?

345
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,043
Driving around.

346
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,423
Felt good.

347
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:52,332
Silas...

348
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:55,093
It's 4:30 in the morning.

349
00:21:56,436 --> 00:22:00,212
You're not allowed
to stay out this late.

350
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,883
I know. I'm sorry. I'll keep
better track of time next time.

351
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,840
Well...

352
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,881
Good.

353
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,831
- Mom.
- Yeah.

354
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,213
What you do and all...

355
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:21,941
Yeah?

356
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,342
I'm cool with it.

357
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:45,212
Fish and game officials
tranquilized the bear

358
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,611
who fell out of the
tree but was not injured.

359
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:58,013
Watch this!

360
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:03,373
No, watch this.

361
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:06,032
Where did you get this?

362
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,571
You e-mailed it to Dean as a joke.

363
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,823
Oh, yeah. It's pretty funny.

364
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:15,112
Won't be so funny when I bulk
mail it to every voter in Agrestic.

365
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:16,142
Ooh!

366
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,113
I'm shaking.

367
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:19,510
Well, you should be.

368
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:22,811
Because when I'm done, you
won't be able to get a sit

369
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:25,063
in a chair factory.

370
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:28,200
Unless you prefer to save
yourself some major embarrassment

371
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:30,971
and not to mention
potential criminal charges

372
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:36,112
by making me the
signatory on Isabel's account

373
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:38,551
instead of Harley Davidstein.

374
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:41,610
All I need is one parent and
Davistein beat you to the punch.

375
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:45,762
I will not allow you and Dean to
take control of my daughter's finance.

376
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:48,582
- Just following her orders.
- Her orders?

377
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,930
Isabel came to me and I explained to her

378
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:53,190
that she needed to
make a choice between you

379
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:55,490
or Dean or both you and Dean.

380
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:57,131
And it took her...

381
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,100
half a second to decide.

382
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,982
- Really?
- She hates you.

383
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:04,503
My God, too bad she can't vote.

384
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:07,751
Well, you know, Isabel and
I have had our differences.

385
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,481
She hates you.

386
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:12,593
Just like I hate you.

387
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:13,862
So you know what?

388
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:17,533
Go ahead and bulk mail your heart out.

389
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,183
See you.

390
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:31,881
Hi, welcome to Thurdays. How many?

391
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:33,662
Oh, I'm here to meet someone.

392
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,400
Well, would you like to have a seat?

393
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,461
- Hey, there.
- Nancy.

394
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,483
Welcome to Thursday's. How many?

395
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,122
Table for 3.

396
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:01,682
Okay, first things first.

397
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:03,653
I wanna apologize.

398
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:05,533
I didn't think either of you would show

399
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,451
if I told you in advance so I lied.

400
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,050
I'm a liar.

401
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:11,872
I'm sorry, Conrad. I'm sorry, Peter.

402
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,083
This should have happened a lot sooner.

403
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,801
That's my fault. Again,
I apologize. So if you have

404
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:21,811
any angers, then anger it this way.

405
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,722
Nancy...

406
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,922
who is this person?

407
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,893
This is Conrad. My business partner.

408
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,091
No, I am not.

409
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:33,860
I am just another out of work
black man. As a matter of fact,

410
00:25:33,957 --> 00:25:35,932
I've never seen this
woman before in my life.

411
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:37,150
It's okay.

412
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:38,742
Really.

413
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:40,662
Why are we here?

414
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,630
Conrad had some issues
with our arrangement

415
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:45,882
and I thought it'd be better if we met

416
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:48,000
and we got to know each other.

417
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:52,463
Conrad, the floor is yours. Ask Peter anything.

418
00:25:52,557 --> 00:25:54,813
- I don't think so.
- Peter, please.

419
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:57,541
- You're the husband?
- I am.

420
00:25:57,637 --> 00:26:01,263
And you're the... partner.

421
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:03,213
Conrad.

422
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:05,990
Why risk your whole
fucking career, man?

423
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:09,413
I'm half in trouble wrapping
my head around that part.

424
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:10,770
I do it for her.

425
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:14,203
Now it's my turn to have
my question answered.

426
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:17,021
How did this partnership begin?

427
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:20,321
My kid bit her kid at
a karate tournament.

428
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:21,862
- It's funny.
- Guys!

429
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:24,120
Your boys at the DEA, do they know about me?

430
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:26,571
I wouldn't know. Probably
not, you're small time.

431
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,153
Nobody knows about anybody, okay?

432
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:32,640
Conrad is my friend
and my business partner.

433
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:38,782
This was just sort of dropped into
my lap. I had not anticipated this.

434
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:41,182
I know. I'm sorry, I just
thought we should work things out

435
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,061
so that we could all move forward.

436
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:45,030
How the fuck is this
supposed to work out?

437
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:47,521
Off the top of my head, I would say,

438
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:50,351
don't expand further
than the grow house

439
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:54,162
and take your harvest directly
the medical marijuana clubs.

440
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:55,710
And you don't want a piece?

441
00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:57,470
I don't want any money.

442
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,121
I just want Nancy.

443
00:26:59,957 --> 00:27:01,593
And I'm just supposed to trust you.

444
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:04,183
Oh, you don't have to trust
me. Trust your partner.

445
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:07,902
Who happens to be my partner.

446
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:12,613
So by the transitive
property of partner trust,

447
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,451
we can trust each other.

448
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:19,643
See...

449
00:27:21,215 --> 00:27:23,100
All gonna be fine.

450
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:25,613
Right?

451
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:43,213
