1
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,585
Previously on Weeds...

2
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:09,804
I set the house on fire.

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:12,182
- We're going to Ren Mar.
- What?

4
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,236
- We're going to see Bubbie.
- What's she like?

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,686
She's somewhere far, far away.

6
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,648
It's a shame you boys
never got a chance to know her.

7
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:22,067
But you can blame
your mother for that.

8
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,210
You're not getting out of here
anytime soon.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,164
You fuckers ratted me out.

10
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:28,342
She got busted for a pot house.

11
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,784
- Your pot house, Mom.
- Fuck!

12
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:34,178
- Should I be nervous about all this?
- Of course you should.

13
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:36,289
It's the drug business.
It's dangerous.

14
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:38,780
You're gonna take a little drive
for me today, Blanca.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,130
There's big money in it
if you do it real good.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,204
You were recording me,
and there's no drugs?

17
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:44,422
The car was clean?

18
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:46,216
Tomorrow we review the tape.

19
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:49,094
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're starting a new life.

20
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:51,787
- She's trying to talk!
- It's Yiddish.

21
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:54,891
- What did she say?
- It means "Kill me."

22
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,390
Weeds - 4x03
The Whole Blah Damn Thing

23
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,512
Transcript : YDY
Synch : mpm, Macanto, Dapitch666

24
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,628
Relecture : mpm, Dapitch666, San-A

25
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,602
Her eyes don't move, but they follow you
like when you look at a painting.

26
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:16,535
She's like a painting.

27
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,124
"She's alone and palely loitering."

28
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:26,313
How is she?

29
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,767
Alone and palely loitering.

30
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:29,926
Nice coat.

31
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,994
Kept me toasty on the porch last night.

32
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,891
- Bubbie loves her pelts.
- What was wrong with the couch in here?

33
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:40,057
I got a little creeped out
after the whole "I want to die" thing.

34
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:42,749
Plus, it's like bunking
with Darth Vader.

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,925
The what thing?

36
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:48,576
Yesterday, Bubbie told us
she wants to die.

37
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:51,406
Actually, she said, "Kill me."
In yiddish.

38
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:54,492
Bubbie, this Bubbie,
the Bubbie that doesn't blink?

39
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:57,497
She seized a moment.
It was very intense.

40
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,790
So she's actually in there.

41
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,167
And she wants out.

42
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:05,795
I've got many long,
dark hairs in my tub!

43
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:08,089
I've actually got one
wrapped around my toe!

44
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,758
I'm thinking, "disgusting!"

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,731
I'm also thinking you're going bald!
Do women go bald?

46
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:16,182
- Where did you come from?
- Outdoor shower.

47
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,141
No line. No...

48
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,058
Lenny.

49
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,478
Where the hell is my bathrobe?

50
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,281
I believe this belongs to you.

51
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:36,392
And that belongs to me.

52
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,017
Another thief.

53
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:40,482
Good morning, Shane.

54
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:44,164
You, I'm not talking to.

55
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,629
Is this still about me being a thief?

56
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,841
Or have we moved on
to Bubbie's recent trip to Clarityville?

57
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,518
"Kill me."

58
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:55,148
"Kill me."

59
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,486
What do you think she meant by that?

60
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:59,328
Maybe it was her sled.

61
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,149
I said I didn't want to talk to you.
But you don't listen.

62
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:07,020
You just keep on talking, don't you?

63
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,516
It's a lot of hair.

64
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:16,065
You're under a lot of stress.

65
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:22,979
What do you think
brings two people together, miss Hodes,

66
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,282
chance or fate?

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,253
Chance?

68
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:30,963
No, fate. It's fate.

69
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,173
It's definitely... fate.

70
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:34,259
Wrong.

71
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,222
- Please don't put me back in jail.
- It's chance!

72
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,219
And I'm gonna give you one.

73
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,800
A once-in-a-lifetime,
never-to-be-repeated,

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,832
small-window-of-opportunity
chance to clear your name.

75
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,567
Does that interest you, miss Hodes?

76
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,220
Yes, it does. Yes.

77
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,988
I want to know where Nancy Botwin is.

78
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,024
I can do that.

79
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:00,340
I want to know
how she knows this man,

80
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,935
what she's doing with him,
when they met,

81
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,540
and who introduced them.

82
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,292
If you can give me the "why,"

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,635
I'll shit sunflowers.

84
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:12,589
And then you'll drop all the charges.

85
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,091
Did I say that?

86
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:16,244
No.

87
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,844
I did not say that.

88
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,191
I also did not not say that.

89
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,536
What you deliver to me,
I give back to you.

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,294
Quality of information equals

91
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:30,135
degree of leniency.

92
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,270
So I just, what?

93
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:37,173
Knock on her door?
Say, "hey, Nance,

94
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,798
got any new mexican friends?"

95
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,351
Actually, he's Puertorican.

96
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:44,295
How he ended up running Los Angeles
for a Mexican cartel

97
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,336
is something of a mystery to us.

98
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:49,286
Guillermo Garcia-Gomez.

99
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,923
That's who you want.

100
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,895
I'd love her, too. Love it!

101
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:57,790
But her time's coming,
'cause that's fate.

102
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,804
But this guy, he's a whale.
And I fucking love whales!

103
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:05,545
I'm Ahab, miss Hodes.

104
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,321
You report to me weekly.

105
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,231
- And, Celia?
- Yes?

106
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:23,242
I liked you blonde
on your driver's license.

107
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:26,726
Think about going there again.

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,979
Do you have anything to say about this?

109
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,145
Happiness is an empty bladder?

110
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,668
What's with all the skirt flapping?

111
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,642
I was drying my... self.

112
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:46,694
Silk chiffon. Expensive to dry-clean.

113
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,185
Chewie took a shit
in a bread bag one time.

114
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,930
So, that's why I got stopped?
Because I peed?

115
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,134
Yeah, 'cause you peed, 'cause you went
through right after shift change

116
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:00,108
when border guards
are fresh and eager,

117
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,048
'cause you wore that ridiculous,

118
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,615
check-my-shit-out,
technicolor slut suit

119
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:06,786
in the middle of the afternoon
on a tuesday.

120
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,888
Why you calling attention to yourself?

121
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,667
You're supposed to be
the all-American Mom.

122
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,544
Get yourself some J. Crew.

123
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,588
- Blend, señora.
- Blend?

124
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:18,492
Look.

125
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,778
Look at your hands.
They don't stop moving.

126
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,845
Banging on the steering wheel,
tapping on the dash,

127
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,472
- fanning your coochie.
- I had a lot of coffee.

128
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,224
So, next time, you have less.

129
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,923
Take some beta blockers, okay?
Just calm your shit down.

130
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,818
- What do you need with all that?
- The guy didn't have any change.

131
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,895
And he was the only one out there?

132
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:42,905
Look what message you sent.

133
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:46,242
A lady goes to T.J.
dressed like a guera peacock,

134
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,496
and she comes back with the mierda
she buys in line at the crossing.

135
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,207
I told them
I was looking for fade cream.

136
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:57,003
Why didn't you have and empty container
to show the guys in the store?

137
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,387
What's the brand name?

138
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,361
You're right.

139
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:01,599
I was vague.

140
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,616
You must always be thinking ahead,

141
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:05,344
know what's around you.

142
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:08,125
Stay relaxed. You've been thinking
East-West your whole life.

143
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,058
You need to start thinking North-South.

144
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:12,185
I want to make another run.

145
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,412
- Right now.
- Nah.

146
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:15,651
A real one.

147
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,030
You ain't ready for that.

148
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:21,694
You gave me a test, I failed. Fine.
But I get it now.

149
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:23,010
North-South.

150
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,720
J. Crew. Small bills.

151
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:26,489
Beta blockers.

152
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,270
So school's out?

153
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,411
You learned all you need?

154
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:32,622
I learned all I'm gonna learn
sitting in a warehouse.

155
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:35,833
Eager beaver.

156
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,920
Okay, you want to make a real run?

157
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,672
All right.
This time you're gonna take my ride.

158
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:49,472
There's really... There's really
no easy way to say this.

159
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,324
You want to kill Bubbie.

160
00:07:51,884 --> 00:07:52,691
No.

161
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,782
Well, yes, but no.

162
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:57,271
I mean...

163
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:01,067
Yes. And also no. Mostly yes.

164
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:02,944
Like an incredibly

165
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:05,971
humane, merciful, dignified "Yes,"

166
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,212
up here,

167
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:09,303
in the foreground, with...

168
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,374
this...

169
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,013
deeply felt, sorrowful,

170
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:17,123
tinged-with-regret-and-guilt-
about-the-big-fat-yes no,

171
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,752
back there, a ways.

172
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,754
I think it's the right thing to do.

173
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:24,822
Of course you do.
You talk to dead people.

174
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,926
It's what Bubbie wants.
What's your problem?

175
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,936
We don't have a whole lot of family.

176
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,431
Do we really want to kill one off?

177
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:36,526
That in there, that's as good
as it gets for Bubbie.

178
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,022
There's no recovery.

179
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,572
There's just pain,

180
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,287
and more pain,

181
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,025
and wanting that pain to end.

182
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,653
So let's just kill her?

183
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:48,151
Let's help her find peace.

184
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,440
By killing her.

185
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,296
I wish you wouldn't make "killing her"

186
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,413
sound so much like "killing her."

187
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,412
Show some balls.

188
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,000
That's the spirit!

189
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,378
Sure. Death is no big deal,

190
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:04,188
because life is just...

191
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,124
blah, blah, blah.

192
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,301
Look, Silas,
life is just blah blah blah.

193
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,099
You hope for blah.

194
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,926
And sometimes you find it.
But, mostly, it's blah.

195
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:15,894
And waiting for blah.

196
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,370
And hoping you were right
about the blahs you made.

197
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,396
And then,

198
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:24,267
just when you think you've got
the whole blah damn thing figured out

199
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:27,087
and you're surrounded
by the ones you blah,

200
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:29,588
death shows up.

201
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:33,701
And blah, blah, blah.

202
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:38,806
All right,

203
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,916
let's do this.

204
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:41,334
That was good.

205
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:43,501
I have my moments.

206
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,404
So, the plan:

207
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,342
unified front, three-man approach.

208
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:52,218
We send Shane in
to convince the old man.

209
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:53,512
Silas and I

210
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,181
hide out here.

211
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,058
- What?
- He likes you.

212
00:09:58,567 --> 00:09:59,377
Fine.

213
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:00,728
Pussies.

214
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,777
Fucking hotel key.
Shit. Fucker.

215
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,380
Maybe they gave you the wrong key...

216
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:17,613
for your room
that you have with your husband.

217
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,391
- Dean Hodes, the lovable gimp.
- Yes.

218
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:26,184
- Look at this thing.
- Do you want to hold it?

219
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:29,640
No, I don't want to hold it.
But what are we looking at, exactly?

220
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,051
- What is this?
- Well, when the fires hit Agrestic...

221
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,262
Oh, God, look.

222
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:37,139
- You said a "sneak"?
- Yep, that's the term, kind of like...

223
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,227
Oh, I love Huell Howser.
Don't you just love him, Celia?

224
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:44,455
He's so enthusiastic
and his hair is so neat.

225
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,131
Pam, get your head out of Huell's ass

226
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,360
and go out into the hall.
I need a lookout.

227
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:59,363
I wasn't looking at it
from the right angle, I apologize.

228
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:02,665
Now, she kind of had a premonition.

229
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,329
Mail, messages...

230
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,886
Shane.

231
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:11,257
"Great grandma dying. Weird house...

232
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:17,303
"Ren Mar is full of beach nazis."

233
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,617
Ren Mar...

234
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:30,443
¿Sabe?
Regrese como una hora o dos horas.

235
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:31,413
No...

236
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:34,081
Sorry, no comprende.

237
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,399
Farmacia.

238
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,413
Oh, no.

239
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,712
No, I'm gonna stay here and watch

240
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,132
and listen. See?

241
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,633
Hello, welcome to broadcast number six:

242
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,362
"Shopping". Hola.

243
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,824
Bienvenidos a podcast número seis:

244
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,390
"Comprar."

245
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:04,839
Now that you have purchased new shoes,

246
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,261
let's go next door to the pet store:

247
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,185
la tienda de mascotas.

248
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,477
Do you have video for cats?

249
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,746
Tiene videos para gatos?

250
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,389
I would like a talking bird.

251
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:18,616
Quiero un pajaro que hable.

252
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,315
What does the big lizard eat?

253
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,590
¿Qué come la lagartija?

254
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,332
This cat has no claws.

255
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:27,492
Este ga...

256
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,126
What is that?

257
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:32,571
Dónde is that?

258
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:34,526
¿Qué?

259
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,810
What the fuck is that?

260
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,204
This is Lento.
He's going to see his mother.

261
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:44,433
She's getting a gastric bypass
in Limón Grove.

262
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,839
I'm not smuggling any illegals.

263
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,579
I just do mota.

264
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:50,271
Mota, si.

265
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:51,643
No illegals.

266
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,317
Do not worry, Miss.

267
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,930
I am not illegal.

268
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,154
- I got a green card.
- You got a green card?

269
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:59,740
- I got a green card.
- Why don't you walk across the border?

270
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,826
I also got a prison record.

271
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,952
For what?

272
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:05,871
Why did he go to jail?

273
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:07,519
Jaywalking.

274
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,879
Vaya con Dios.

275
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,384
I need to talk to you about Bubbie.

276
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:22,471
Well, unfortunately for you,
I do not share that need.

277
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,516
But would you like a parting gift?

278
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,209
She's in a lot of pain.

279
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:30,854
Well, that's an amazing diagnosis...

280
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,819
considering you and your family
just got here

281
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,779
like little rays of sunshine
and euthanasia,

282
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,699
and you really aren't
as familiar with her medical condition

283
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,475
as, say, someone like...
I don't know. Who am I thinking of?

284
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:48,295
You know.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

285
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,222
Me.

286
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:50,933
But you nailed it.

287
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,251
What tipped you off?

288
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,354
Was it the morphine drip?

289
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:57,518
She said she wanted to die.

290
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,037
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

291
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:02,052
Let's rap.

292
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,531
Here, have a seat,

293
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,382
right by my mother.

294
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,219
Now,

295
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,855
what do you want to talk about?

296
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,465
I think that Bubbie has...

297
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:22,560
that you have...

298
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:25,451
the right to choose your death.

299
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,990
Well, you got to respect
a man who speaks his mind,

300
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:32,249
huh, ma?

301
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,684
I do it myself all the time
to varying effect.

302
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,713
But, still, respect must be paid.

303
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:39,298
Pulling the plug on her?

304
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,216
Is that what you have in mind?

305
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,427
Pretty much.

306
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,470
So, tell me,

307
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,434
would you want to kill your mom?

308
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,257
I mean, let's just say
that was her,

309
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,019
laying in that bed,

310
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:57,473
shedding hair all over the pillow.

311
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,589
If she said "kill me," I would.

312
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,794
Well, as luck would have it,
it's not your mom.

313
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,869
That happens to be the woman
that spent the wonder years

314
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:09,462
kicking my ass.

315
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,831
Calling me a loser,

316
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:14,073
a liar,

317
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,872
bad investment,

318
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:19,082
force-feeding me
liver and applesauce,

319
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,428
hanging my dog twice,

320
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:25,723
accidentally, or so she said.
But how do they get in that tree?

321
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:29,473
I think you're having
problems letting go.

322
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:31,662
Of course.

323
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,753
I am. I'm having problems letting go.

324
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:37,013
You know why?

325
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,108
'Cause it's my fucking mother.

326
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,572
All eyeballs,

327
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,395
and elbows,

328
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:48,363
and ready to play God.

329
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:51,542
Okay, big guy.

330
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:53,621
Here we go.

331
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:56,384
See the ventilator?

332
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:58,592
It starts here,

333
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:01,684
and it ends there.

334
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:05,494
So, all you got to do is reach down

335
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,647
and yank it out.

336
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,233
Just give it a tug...

337
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:11,575
pop!

338
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:13,424
And she's gone.

339
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:16,988
Easy, right?

340
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,404
I can't.

341
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:49,157
How do you say "I fucking did it"
in spanish?

342
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:51,263
"Lo hice, chingado."

343
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:52,976
¡Lo hice, chingado!

344
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:59,313
- ¡Chinga tu madre!
- What? What does that mean?

345
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:01,676
That means you hit a fucking pothole.

346
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,817
I'm sorry. We're almost there.

347
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,774
Are you lost, Miss?
We keep turning right.

348
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,428
These streets all look the same.

349
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:12,618
Have you been
to Guillermo's drug warehouse before?

350
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:15,412
Do you know if it's by an EZ storage?

351
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,206
Maybe if you stop and ask.

352
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,783
Yeah, not the kind of thing
you can ask someone... else.

353
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,920
It's this way.

354
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:26,840
- You drive for shit.
- Sorry.

355
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,151
Wait, this looks familiar.

356
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,001
Oh, this is it.

357
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,656
¡Lo hice, chingado!

358
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,086
Lo hice, chingado.

359
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,773
¿Hola?

360
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,644
Guillermo?

361
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,406
Chewie?

362
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:05,671
Shit.

363
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,272
- Is here?
- No.

364
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:15,227
Is not here.

365
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,497
Well, is here, but here isn't
here anymore, apparently.

366
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,396
You will please let me out now?

367
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,449
I want to.
But you're a criminal of some sort,

368
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:29,513
and we're alone.
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,825
'Cause I'm sure you're quite possibly
a nice Mexican who loves his mother,

370
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,406
but you might also want
to make a hat out of my kidneys.

371
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:40,509
So we'll get you out soon.

372
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,230
Soonish.

373
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,485
What the fuck do you want?

374
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,893
I'll give you a beer.
Will you go away?

375
00:18:58,486 --> 00:18:59,970
Can I drink my beer first?

376
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,650
Only if you swear, by whatever God
you consider significant,

377
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,145
that you absolutely will not speak.

378
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,467
You're gonna talk.
Give me the pabst back.

379
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:14,108
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'm not talking.

380
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,432
I'm drinking.

381
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,221
Just start talking.

382
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:26,794
We both know you're gonna talk,
so go ahead and talk.

383
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,700
You're trying to put me on tilt,
aren't you?

384
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,400
Fuck! Say it!
You want me to kill my mother!

385
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,591
- That really hurt!
- Say it!

386
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:59,180
Goddamn it, yes!
I want you to pull the plug!

387
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,840
I want you to cash in her chips.

388
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,090
I want you to enter her
in the dirt derby.

389
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,916
You're the one who told
us what she said... you.

390
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,881
It was yiddish. You could have
said anything, any lie you wanted.

391
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:11,296
But you told us.

392
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,053
You can't listen to that.

393
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,592
She doesn't know what's coming out.
It's just talk.

394
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:18,220
- How often does she talk?
- I don't know.

395
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,305
How many times does she say,
"I want to die"?

396
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,350
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

397
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,080
Once, twice, several times,
a bunch, often, never.

398
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,500
What do you want me to say,
that I want to kill my mother?

399
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,984
That I want her dead?
I wish this would all go away?

400
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,681
- Yeah.
- Fine.

401
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:36,947
I wish she were dead
and this would all go away.

402
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,802
So, do you want to be the one who...

403
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,316
Like this is some fucking honor?

404
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:05,057
- You do it.
- No way. She likes me.

405
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,860
Bubbie did say bringing not-Francie
into the family would kill her.

406
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:17,184
Psychic, my mother.

407
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,774
Is here Limón Grove?

408
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:30,330
No Limón Grove.

409
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,194
Will you please shut up about Limón
Grove every time I hit the... brake?

410
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:37,592
I've got to pick up my mama.
She gets discharged at 5:00,

411
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:40,376
and they're just gonna leave her
in the hallway.

412
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,429
Listen, listen.

413
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:43,810
Lento, I'm sorry.

414
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,374
It's just I'm dealing
with some seriously

415
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:49,311
thwarted expectations
of my own right now.

416
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:58,609
I'm gonna go inside. If Guillermo
doesn't call me back in 20 minutes,

417
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,510
- I'll bring some tools and get you out.
- I have to pee.

418
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,362
You go right ahead, sweetie.

419
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,007
Hi, guys.

420
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:13,377
We're just saying our good-byes.

421
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,768
- Oh, my God. Did Bubbie...
- No.

422
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,731
We decided it would be best
to pull the plug, though,

423
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,344
and let her rest in peace.

424
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,779
Tonight.

425
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,697
Actually, we decided,

426
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:32,080
you should...

427
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:34,898
do the honors.

428
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,797
I'm...

429
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,407
One sec.

430
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:46,268
Hola.

431
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:49,691
 Hey, you got my pot,
my truck, and my cousin Lento?

432
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,624
Where the hell are you?

433
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:52,650
Outside.

434
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:01,619
I'll be back in a sec.

435
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,540
It's okay, Nance, go outside.
Gather your thoughts.

436
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:08,306
When you're ready, we'll be here.

437
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,131
Where were you guys?

438
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:16,847
Security breach.

439
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,880
- Change of venue.
- How do you know where I live?

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,390
It's in your GPS. Under "Home."

441
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:23,725
That's nice.

442
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,071
I need to go kill
my dead husband's grandmother now.

443
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:31,121
Been there.

444
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,541
Dinero.

445
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,066
Oh, shit!

446
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:45,844
- Mucho dinero.
- Si.

447
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:51,574
Balls!

448
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:58,732
Fuck!

449
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,809
Think Andy gets residuals for this?

450
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:09,534
That foot is kind of hot.

451
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:12,793
Does that make me gay?

452
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:16,486
Crap. This is my favorite part.

453
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,247
Need like 10 more minutes, Izzy.

454
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,878
- Carilli.
- Wilson. I want answers.

455
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,310
We researched the insurance policies
on the municipal buildings.

456
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,398
There are several discrepancies that...
Jesus cock, you got a christ-on.

457
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,600
Sorry about that.

458
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,345
Must be upsetting.

459
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,237
Unless you own a horse.

460
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,787
I'll grab some pants, be right back.

461
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,297
Doug?

462
00:24:44,123 --> 00:24:45,505
Say goodbye to Izzy for me.

463
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,370
And tell her I'm sorry that we never got
to watch porn together.

464
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,557
Wait, no, don't tell her that.
Tell her...

465
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:52,369
"Herbie the love bug."

466
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,330
- What's going on, man?
- Nothing.

467
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,581
- Where's my armageddon bag?
- Oh, no.

468
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,251
Come on, stay.
We'll fight them together.

469
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:00,560
Adiós, buddy.

470
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,752
Oh, and that foot thing...
makes you totally gay.

471
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,278
- I love you, man.
- Gay!

472
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,834
Gay!

473
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:15,804
Bubbie...

474
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:17,501
To be honest,

475
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,256
I don't really know
a whole lot about you.

476
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,336
I don't even know your real name.

477
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,798
I mean, I do.

478
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,129
If I thought about it, probably.

479
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:31,355
Helen?

480
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:36,004
I'm sure I'll...

481
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,470
read it in the paper,
or on your grave.

482
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,574
Anyway...

483
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:41,753
I know...

484
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,699
Judah...

485
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:45,707
loved you.

486
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
And I know

487
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,802
you loved Judah, and that's

488
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,326
good to know.

489
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,431
I know you aren't...

490
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,108
hanging on for things you...

491
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,831
haven't done, because you did
what you needed to do.

492
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:04,128
You were here.

493
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,431
And you touched all these lives.

494
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:08,503
And...

495
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,142
you were loved.

496
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,923
And you...

497
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:15,630
collected many

498
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:19,814
excellent treasures
which we will now have to figure out

499
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:21,295
what to do with.

500
00:26:23,116 --> 00:26:23,924
I...

501
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,475
pray that...

502
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,648
you will rest easy,

503
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,875
that you will not fear, that...

504
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,844
you will have peace, and you will...

505
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,743
thank God it has come,

506
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:42,069
at last.

507
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,070
And...

508
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,486
please don't be mad at me.

509
00:26:56,985 --> 00:26:58,680
- Was that it?
- No.

510
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,826
- That one?
- That's the kitchen.

511
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,073
I can't...

512
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,173
How about now?

513
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:11,570
Getting warmer.

514
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,642
That's it.

515
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,899
She's still breathing.

516
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,144
Shane, get Mommy a pillow.
