Greetings Agrestic Elementary school, class of 2006

6
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:57,839
Hello teachers-

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,478
-siblings-

8
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,299
-parents-

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,044
-stepparents-

10
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:01,043
-pets

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,628
No pets.

12
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:09,456
Ok, Greetings Agrestic Elementary school, class of 2006.

13
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,388
Did you know about all this stuff ?

14
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,724
Of course not.

15
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,434
You never clean anymore.

16
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:26,065
I think he do this for you.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,161
Please !

18
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:31,306
Look, he decided to steal cameras,
not the car-stereos and door knobs.

19
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:34,314
Why would anyone steal a door knob ?

20
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,880
There are some nice door knobs.

21
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:38,896
Lupita,

22
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:40,768
listen.

23
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,778
Yes ?

24
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,050
If something would happen to me...

25
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,231
What's going to happen to you ?

26
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:48,363
Nothing, but, if something did...

27
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:49,211
Yes ?

28
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:53,022
The kids go to my sister Jill.

29
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,945
Not to Andy, ok ?

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,666
Jill ! Her number's in my book.

31
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,914
Jill, Price-Grey, with a fucking hyphen

32
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:03,760
Fucking hyphen.

33
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,966
Under J, for "Jill"

34
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:10,965
You know what, um...

35
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:12,973
Don't worry about it.

36
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,457
Nothing's gonna happen, yeah.

37
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,580
I'm gonna be fine !

38
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,280
Okay.

39
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:24,378
I'm not going to Chili with you !

40
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,139
Okay, to Bolivia then.

41
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:27,837
Or one of the guays

42
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:30,400
Para ? Ura ? You decide.

43
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,938
Why ? Why do we have to leave ?

44
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:34,004
Because !

45
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:38,978
I stole 1.3 million dollars worth at poker chips
from a casino in Canada.

46
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:43,503
And Abumchuk is not just a bounty hunter,
but he's also an ultimate fighter.

47
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,143
But don't worry, I have a plan

48
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,942
We'll go down to south America,
we find this guy Homet)

49
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:53,337
Serious gambler, he'll buy the chips
for 34 cents on the dollar.

50
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:56,065
We'll get a little casita, and have babies.

51
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,085
I always know exactly when I'm ovulating.

52
00:02:58,483 --> 00:02:59,547
Oh my god !

53
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:03,307
We'll leave today after graduation,
I'll make a waldorf salad for the road.

54
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:06,756
Or a corn salad,
I'll make a great corn salad.

55
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,100
Do we have a cooler ?

56
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,043
You know,

57
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,909
I haven't forgotten

58
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,933
how you stabbed me screaming "Die Shit hill, die ! "

59
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,932
You stepped on my spirit turtle.

60
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,253
You are bad shit nuts Kat.

61
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,793
and I love that about you.

62
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,249
But I've never meant for you to find me again.

63
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:29,354
And I cannot go away with you.

64
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,572
You know how I hate to travel alone !

65
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,869
I wanna lick this space where your toes used to be.

66
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:38,449
I know you do, I know !

67
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,588
Oh god ! That's it ! Right there, right there, right there.

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,652
Son of a bitch !

69
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:24,569
Son of a fucking cold bitch !

70
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,238
Silas ?

71
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,516
It's me, again.

72
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:31,499
I'm offering you amnesty if you come home in the next hour.

73
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:36,023
Probation, if you show up for graduation.
At the very least,

74
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:40,132
please, let me know you are okay.

75
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,813
You look very handsome !

76
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:52,042
Are... we moving ?

77
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:56,485
Why don't you let me get through today and then,
ask me about that again tomorrow, ok ?

78
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,286
Is Silas coming to my graduation ?

79
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,193
I'm not sure about that.

80
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:05,405
Mom ?

81
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:06,404
Yeah ?

82
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,993
What do I tell people when they ask what you do ?

83
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,008
You tell 'em I'm your mom.

84
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:28,479
I've been doing some research on the internet,

85
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,729
and I really think Pittsburgh is the place for us.

86
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:36,563
I'll keep that in mind.

87
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,496
Pittsburgh. Okay.

88
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:52,529
Oh no, I spilled.

89
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,146
I'll go get the paper towels.

90
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,234
Honey, relax, it's just a little milk.

91
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,547
But Mom will totally...

92
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:58,579
Mom will what ?

93
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:00,137
Mom's not here.

94
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:01,841
She'll be back.

95
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,203
No, honey.

96
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,864
Not this time, really.

97
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,059
Come on.

98
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,090
Dad, you know the Harry Potter books that we've read ?

99
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,433
Love'em all, love the Harry Potter.

100
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,689
Mom... is Voldemort.
Don't you know that ?

101
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,987
You may have reduced her to vapor now but,

102
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:22,574
she is out there,

103
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,425
gathering her strength.

104
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,454
And she will be back.

105
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,009
Don't you know that ?

106
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,671
You better get hurry for graduation !

107
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:35,280
Big day today.

108
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:36,443
Big day !

109
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,341
Silas ?

110
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,013
We're leaving for graduation now.

111
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:50,329
I hope you'll meet us there.

112
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:52,699
This is really important to Shane.

113
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,406
Really.

114
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,402
Don't do this to him.

115
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:06,317
Jesus, you scared me !

116
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:07,461
Good !

117
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:10,594
I hope you peed your panties.

118
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:12,974
Where is he ?

119
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:14,416
Who ?

120
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,712
Alright, I guess you had to ask that.

121
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,113
Who Celia ?

122
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:24,374
The one who called you a drunk at a public assembly ?

123
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,885
Or... the one who stole civic property ?

124
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:31,354
I have no idea what you're talking about.

125
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:36,803
I have Silas, on video.

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,026
Stealing.

127
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,287
I have no idea what you're talking about.

128
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:53,073
Oh, not today !

129
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,277
Mom, we're gonna be late !

130
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:58,089
Where the hell did you get a gun ?

131
00:07:58,132 --> 00:07:59,854
I borrowed it from Pam.

132
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,697
Oh my god !

133
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,000
I only had the one bullet.

134
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,279
I was gonna shoot Doug.

135
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,264
I'll see you at graduation.

136
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,114
Are you okay ?

137
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,224
This would have never happened in Pittsburgh.

138
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:35,493
Why am I even here ?

139
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,276
I heard you might be meetin'
your maker today.

140
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:39,801
So we figured,

141
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,938
send that boy off to die,
with a nice hot breakfast in his belly.

142
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:49,452
What do you know ?

143
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:50,573
What do we know ?

144
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,746
Vanita, what do we know ?

145
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,487
Is the baby too little for a blueberry ?

146
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:57,392
No, but if you give it to him,
cut it up real small.

147
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,588
And put a bib on, cause that shit won't stain.

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,922
Heylia got a little visit from your girlfriend.

149
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,886
I told her not to come in your home.

150
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,983
Nobody listen to you Conrad.

151
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,952
He come after you ?

152
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:11,655
Yeah.

153
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,685
He gon' want to finish it.

154
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:16,469
Probably.

155
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:17,877
Let me ask you this,

156
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,242
you wanna die today ?

157
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:24,020
No.

158
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,661
Eat your fucking waffle.

159
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,813
Greetings Agrestic Elementary School, Class of 2006.

160
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:37,348
Hello teachers, parents,

161
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:41,744
stepparents, siblings, boyfriends and girlfriends of parents,

162
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:43,776
all sort of relatives,

163
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:46,925
friends of your mom and dad who
you call aunt and oncle but really aren't.

164
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,030
And, Principal Dodge.

165
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:51,698
As I stand before you today,

166
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,571
on the brink of Junior High,

167
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,788
here is what I have to say :

168
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,753
You have failed us all !

169
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,230
Everything is not okay !

170
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,945
We have become alienated

171
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:10,918
desensitized,

172
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,695
angry,

173
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,458
and frightened.

174
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,409
If we picture Agrestic as an airplane,

175
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:25,018
A grand soaring jet carrying us through the sky.

176
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:29,102
I think you all need to understand,

177
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:33,477
there are motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane.

178
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,208
Okay, that's it Botwin.

179
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,120
That is quite enough.

180
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,815
You said no profanity.

181
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,884
You are done, and here's your diploma.
And you are Agrestic Junior High's problem now.

182
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,861
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to give out the diplomas.

183
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:54,117
Let him speak ! Let him speak !

184
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:57,068
Motherfucking, let him motherfucking speak !

185
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,353
I will call off this graduation
if we don't have order right now !
I mean it !

186
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:01,754
<i> Let him speak ! ...</i>

187
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,016
Everybody be quiet !

188
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,918
We are not safe !

189
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,474
*You move... you feel safe, but

190
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:15,710
your children are not safe !

191
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,610
I have to go, um.

192
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,829
I think take Shane to the party, and I'll see you guys later.

193
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,643
Tell Shane I'm sorry, I had to go.

194
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:29,198
Where you going ?

195
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:30,212
It's business.

196
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,035
Where are you going ?

197
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,991
Congratulations, you've all graduated. Goodbye !

198
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:05,129
Just making sure you were coming.
We both know how you lie.

199
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,851
Either you control your woman,
or I will.

200
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,871
I hear you,
I'm cutting in.

201
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:37,822
Are you my boyfriend, or not ?

202
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:42,475
I liberated a case of Cactus Cooler
for the ride

203
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,563
I'm not coming with you.

204
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,087
I tastes like baby aspirin.

205
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:48,025
Well, in that case, I'm still not going with you.

206
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,138
Jesus, you've scared me.

207
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:20,266
You ought to let a person know
you're coming.

208
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,749
I could have cut you up
into seven little men holding hands.

209
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:24,902
You hear from our friend ?

210
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,439
Yeah, he left a note on my car
just trying to scare me.

211
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:30,359
- Is it working ?
- Fuck yes !

212
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:35,936
You're a good kisser.

213
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,320
Oh shit.

214
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,238
What ? What's "Oh shit" ?

215
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,318
Abumchuk.

216
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,104
It's now or never.
Come with me.

217
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:50,526
I can't be alone, and
you're my favorite person on earth.

218
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,409
I can't do it, Kat.

219
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,004
Why ? Fuck you and give me your van keys.

220
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,407
You can't have my van !

221
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,405
I'm just gonna steal it anyway.

222
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:18,012
Wife fucker.

223
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:19,703
Carrer wrecker.

224
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,233
You punched my neck !

225
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:24,996
You're freakishly tall.

226
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:27,210
Most of are freakishly long,

227
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,304
so imagine how much of me
was inside your wife.

228
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:42,641
Hey, come here.

229
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:43,774
Did you hear my speech ?

230
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,973
No, I.. I missed it.

231
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:47,857
- You're an asshole.
- Look, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:49,721
Ok I had stuff to do.
Where's mum ?

233
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,142
I don't know. She took off
during my speech.

234
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,170
Did she say where she was going ?

235
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:55,149
No, she just.. left.

236
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:59,126
Some fucking family you got stuck with, huh.

237
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,507
Hey wassup ?

238
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,485
Men, you're coming in real time, or
you're coming in black people time ?

239
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,388
I will be here.

240
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,558
Black people time ?

241
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,365
Some of us like watermelons,
some of us got big dicks,

242
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,690
Most of us have trouble
getting in places on time.

243
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:19,862
I get it.

244
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,014
I like gin, and I'm not much for hugging.

245
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,665
Did you bring your gun ?

246
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:30,084
Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that
I'm not fulfilling today.

247
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:32,140
I brought a gun.

248
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,618
Celia left one at my house this morning

249
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,329
after she shot on my kitchen cabinet.

250
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,327
Jesus, give me that fucking thing.

251
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,902
There aren't any bullets in it.

252
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,591
Another great plan from you.

253
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:46,936
You shouldn't put metal in a microwave.

254
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:50,759
Hi honey, I got your note.

255
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,390
You sure know how to charm a girl.

256
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:56,984
You've been

257
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,811
fucking him the whole time
you were married to me ?

258
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:00,116
No, I told you that.

259
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,173
But you're a liar.

260
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,673
It's just business between us.

261
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,114
Always has been.

262
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,476
Your loss.

263
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,417
She fucks like a wild animal.

264
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,128
Hey guys.

265
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,914
Isn't it my shift ?

266
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,334
You're the little shit
who smashed my muffin.

267
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:23,101
Forgive me ?

268
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,194
If you would go, I would

269
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,914
I would kill you, I would kill you !

270
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:30,056
I will kill you, you son of a bitch.

271
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:32,939
All right, now you're dead.

272
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,149
Now you are fucking dead, Doug Wilson.

273
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:37,341
I have no respect for you.

274
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:38,513
Personnally.

275
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:41,300
But I always though you were cute.

276
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,239
And I'm a single now.

277
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,900
By the way, have you seen your nephew ?

278
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:01,474
Never mind.

279
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:02,627
So looks good.

280
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,452
I'll be in touch.

281
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:22,302
Get the fuck out of my way.

282
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:25,776
Jesus, people are so rude in the south.

283
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,789
Well, that's it.

284
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,065
Yeah ?

285
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,295
Yep. We are broken up.

286
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,246
Sorry kid.

287
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:35,522
He's a heart breaker.

288
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:39,671
Yeah well, maybe they deserve each other.

289
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,686
Who ?

290
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,808
Shane and Kat.

291
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:44,284
You know, well,

292
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:46,128
she's gone.

293
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:48,296
I know. They left together.

294
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:50,678
They left.. sh..

295
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,169
Shit ! When ?

296
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,475
Few minutes ago.

297
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,013
The two of them took off.

298
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:01,594
Yo motherfuckers.

299
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:02,685
Anybody home ?

300
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,561
Big bad wolf coming here.

301
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:05,622
I'll be waiting in my truck.

302
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:06,852
Motherfucker !

303
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,081
You out too.

304
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,211
No, within !

305
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,571
Somebody's got to answer to the door.

306
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,063
Hold on !

307
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,319
Okay.

308
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,533
Just wait here.

309
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:27,973
Don't come out of here, no matter what.

310
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:29,664
Don't come out.

311
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,919
Okay. Okay.

312
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:38,607
Oh hey.

313
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:39,980
It's about time.

314
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,855
I was just about to huff and puff.

315
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,894
Some nice set-up you got here.

316
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,692
Now take off your shirt.

317
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,505
- What ?
- Take off your fucking shirt.

318
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,552
Marvin, check Conrad for a wire, she's ..

319
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:00,942
Hold on dog, that's bullshit.

320
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:02,296
It's called due diligent.

321
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,217
Are you going to due to diligent, or am I ?

322
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,030
It's diligence.

323
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:12,307
These are nice titties.

324
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:14,755
Okay, I've shown you mine.

325
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:16,674
Now show me yours.

326
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,149
In a minute, I got to pee.

327
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:19,650
Where's your fucking toilet ?

328
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,831
Doing that maple lemonade flushes you out

329
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,868
Pees more than my cousin Juan
who only got one kidney.

330
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:32,119
Poor Juan.

331
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,724
We are gonna have the best adventure.

332
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,430
Thanks for keeping me company Shane.

333
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:43,470
Cactus Cooler ?

334
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:48,040
Where are we going ?

335
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,300
Where do you wanna go ?

336
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:52,728
- Pittsburgh
- Okay

337
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,740
But we have to make a quick stop
in Paraguay first.

338
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,032
Cool.

339
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,195
Tastes like baby aspirin.

340
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,358
Step on it Geronimo.

341
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:12,341
You watch that shit man.

342
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:21,231
Yes ?

343
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,005
No no no no no no no

344
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:25,984
Go go go, come on.

345
00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:27,694
Kashishian says good bye.

346
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,483
I have been on this flush.

347
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:52,905
Yeah huh.

348
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,750
Maple lemonade.

349
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,921
My kid's graduating,

350
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,746
so hum, could we just

351
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:01,245
get through this ?

352
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:04,031
You give us the money, we give you the drugs,
everybody ..

353
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,415
goes away.

354
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,452
You don't see the cash until I see the weed.

355
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:08,855
Marvin, help me with this.

356
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,239
No hey.

357
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,909
Open up.

358
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,387
No. You don't see the weed
till I see the cash.

359
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:19,578
You know what ?

360
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,653
You're almost right about that.

361
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:25,999
What the fuck !

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,536
Yeah, now give us the drugs,
and we'll let you live.

363
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:29,709
Open it up.

364
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:32,783
But where's the money ?

365
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,109
Ain't no money fool !

366
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:35,646
