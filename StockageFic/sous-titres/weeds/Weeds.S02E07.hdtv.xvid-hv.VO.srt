1
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,920
Hello.

2
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,160
Now, I thought your
people didn't eat cows.

3
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,280
I thought yours don't
eat cheeseburgers.

4
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
Well, we've suffered so much already.

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,360
I feel it's my destiny to induce
positive change in my tribe.

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,720
Beginning with a cheeseburger

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,880
progressing to extreme
sports and police work.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,440
Hey, fellows!

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,040
Who's a good doggy?
Yes, you are!

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,240
Hey, doggy!
Where did you come from?

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,160
Found him on the street,
doesn't have any tags.

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
Just this gold necklace.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
Must have belonged to the Armenians.

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,400
Not hairy enough.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,320
Man, get that beast
the fuck out of here.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760
Shh! You're scaring him.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,000
It's okay, Mr. Sweaters. Yeah,
who's our tough little watchdog?

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,600
You are. Yes, you are.

19
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,280
- Oh my God!
- Oh shit!

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,800
Oh my God! Let go of me!

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,080
Oh my God!

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
Get it off me.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Bad Mr. Sweaters! Off! Off!

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,960
Cheeseburger! Cheeseburger!

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,600
Sanjay, stick your finger up his ass!

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,080
What?

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,120
I read it on the Internet.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,840
If you stick a finger up
his ass, it makes him let go.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
Fuck you! Stick your
own finger up his ass!

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,280
Somebody stick their finger up his ass!

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,880
Okay.

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
I'll do it.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,600
Wow! It works!

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Somebody call 911. I've dog duty on my hands.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
No, no. Nobody call 911, all right?

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,640
That bitch hate my toes!

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
Judah!

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,280
Dad's cologne?

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,880
I found it in your bathroom,
I'll put it back, I swear.

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
It's okay, sweetie. It's
just... next time you might

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,200
not wanna use so much.

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
What reeks in here?

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,520
Shane has a debate.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,960
So, what? You're hoping
to stink out your opponent?

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
We're leaving in 5 minutes. So go pee

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
and get your notes and things together.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,800
- I need to talk to you.
- What now?

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,360
What now? Your SATs scores now.

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,680
You barely scored above
what you would have gotten

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,200
if you'd only signed your name.

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,480
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been a little preoccupied.

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,200
You took the SATs weeks before the...

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,080
thing.

55
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
- Abortion?
- That.

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,280
It had nothing to do with
your lousy performance.

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,840
I've spoken to Mr. Weinstock.

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,160
- Who?
- You guidance counselor.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,080
He says you can take the
test again in 8 weeks.

60
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
I am not taking the test again.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
Yes, you are.

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,240
Silas, you couldn't get into traffic
school with those scores.

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,480
So? From what I've seen,

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,440
you don't need a college degree to
start your own business, right mom?

65
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,760
Hey, Doug.

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,960
Oh shit! What kind of accident?

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Yeah, bye.

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,080
Uncle Andy is in the hospital.

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,040
What happened?

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm not sure, something with a dog

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,680
or a sweater.

72
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,080
Can you take Shane to his debate?

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,320
- Yeah, I'll take him.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,360
But in your car, I don't
want him stinking up mine.

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,880
How is he?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
He's doing better since
he got his morphine.

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,000
- Have you found my toes?
- His toes?

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,960
Dog ate two of his toes before
Sanjay stuck a finger up his ass.

79
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,880
Why was there a dog at the house?

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Hello. I'm Dr. Birdner.

81
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
Nancy Botwin.

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
- Your husband?
- Brother-in-law.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,640
Is he gonna be okay?

84
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,400
Is he a dancer, a professional
athlete or a foot model?

85
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,960
None of the above.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
Then he should live a normal life.

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
I wouldn't go that far.

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
You know,
if you'd brought in the toes,

89
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
we might have been
able to reattach them.

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,880
Must find toes.

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,320
- Conrad, where are the toes?
- The dog ate 'em.

92
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,200
- The dog ate 'em.
- Well, that's that.

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,240
When is he gonna be able to go home?

94
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
- Does he have insurance?
- Oh no.

95
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,880
He  can go home now.

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,720
Hey, I didn't mean to
blindsight you with Peter.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,160
I just knew that if
you met him, you'd...

98
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,280
Have no choice.

99
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,200
See that he wasn't a threat.

100
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,560
I gotta go back to the house and
clean up some fucking toe blood.

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,520
In keeping with the spirit
of tomorrow's local elections,

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,560
tonight's topic will be electoral
college vs. popular vote.

103
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,200
Advocating the popular vote,
Master Shane Botwin.

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,760
My argument for the popular vote:

105
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
George W. Bush.

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,040
But that's against the rules.

107
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
How am I supposed to argue

108
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,440
when he invokes the name of the
worst president we've ever had

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
and then just sits.

110
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,800
He didn't follow protocol.

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Just go, Gretchen.

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,280
This is totally unfair.

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,800
I forfeit.

114
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,240
You suck.

115
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,640
-  Nice job.
- This is a disaster.

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
You made her totally lose her shit.

118
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,480
That's a win in my book.

119
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
I made her hate me even more.

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,080
Oh my God! You like that girl!

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
I love her.

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
Does she know?

123
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,160
Never even spoken to her.

124
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,000
Only kicked her.

125
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
- Well, you know what that means.
- What?

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,040
- You're gay.
- Shut up! Forget it.

127
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,840
All right. So, you
really like this girl?

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Here's what you do.

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,320
I've done it. Dad did it.

130
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,280
Uncle Andy does it all the time, sometimes it even works.

131
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,040
What?

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,120
- Say something to her.
- Fuck you!

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,000
- Just do it. It's not so hard.
- Easy for you to say.

134
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Not really.

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,120
All women are evil lying bitches

136
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,640
but I'm trying to be
the good big brother here

137
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
so when she kicks the
shit out of your heart,

138
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll buy you a beer with my fake ID.

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,800
That idiot is gonna win.

140
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,680
- People like Doug.
- People are stupid.

141
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,480
They elected you head of the PTA.

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,480
Oh, please. I was like

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
Hitler in Munich.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,680
Those dimwits were just hitching
for somebody to follow.

145
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,000
You haven't lost yet.

146
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,280
- Give me a clue.
- I like to do it all by myself.

147
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Wanna have sex?

148
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,120
A sky high accessory. Ten letters.

149
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Orion's belt.

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,400
Oh shit! That's totally right.

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeepee for me.

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,080
Thank you.

153
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,160
Nancy!

154
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,680
Back off!

155
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,960
Hey, I'm sorry.

156
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,200
And I hope that you
won't let this little

157
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,800
incident between us
ruin our friendship.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,080
- I have to vote.
- Nancy!

159
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,120
My friend. My client. Thanks for showing off for me.

160
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,920
You know what? I need to
review the bond issues again.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
I'm gonna come back later.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,480
She's gonna vote for you. I'm gonna go cast my ballot.

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,320
Vote for yourself. I'd hate
to see you get shut out.

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
Mr. Wilson!

165
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
- Why are you smiling?
- Just wait.

166
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,320
Where's my name? My name is not on the ballot.

167
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,760
What the fuck?

168
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,360
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

169
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
It's  just a miracle.

170
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,400
God loves me.

171
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
Where's my name?

172
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,240
Excuse me, sir, only one person
allowed in the booth at a time.

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,040
My name is not on the ballot.
Where's my name?

174
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
What name would that be?

175
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,400
Doug Wilson or Mr. Fuckyouson?

176
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
You're responsible for this!

177
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,600
I wish that I could take
credit for this. I really do.

178
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
Doug, I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

179
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,920
Yes, your wife is a cheating whore!

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
Write me in!

181
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,520
Doug Wilson, write me in!

182
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Wait. Are you really
gonna let him do this?

183
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
- Doug Wilson.
- Mr. Wilson, I'm sorry.

184
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,160
There's a law that clearly
prohibits any candidate

185
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,760
from campaigning within
300 feet of a polling place.

186
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Well, I'm not a candidate

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,120
because my name is not on
the fucking ballot, asswipe.

188
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
Asswipe?

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,040
Vote for Doug Wilson, everybody. Change only brings problems.

190
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,960
- Doug Wilson.
- Get out of here.

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,520
295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300!

192
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
Vote for Doug Wilson. The riding candidate.

193
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Change just brings
problems. You know it's true!

194
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,600
Doug Wilson. Who's your pal?

195
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Don't you just hate Celia Hodes?

196
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,680
Celia Hodes has chlamydiae.

197
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
- What's that?
- Job applications.

198
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,440
- You already have a job.
- Yes, I do.

199
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,640
Soon you will too.

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,040
If you don't wanna go to college...

201
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,200
Work it is.

202
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,360
Not this again.

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,120
Starbuck's. Cost Plus.

204
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,520
And Ben & Jerry's.

205
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Agrestic is just booming
with job opportunities

206
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,560
for a young man with a high school diploma.

207
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,400
Mom, will you sign this?

208
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
What is this?

209
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,120
My letter of resignation
from the debate team.

210
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,320
Oh, this is a proud day for mommy.

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Why are you quitting the debate team?

212
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
Personal reasons.

213
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Would you like to share
those personal reasons?

214
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,160
No.

215
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,760
Don't be such a pussy.
Just go up and talk to her.

216
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,680
- Talk to who?
- None of your business.

217
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,440
You two should talk. Mother,
son. I'll catch you later.

218
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,200
Silas!

219
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,520
Later, I promise. We'll have a walk or something.

220
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm going to school.

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,640
Who should you talk to?

222
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,480
Gretchen.

223
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,200
And Gretchen's on the debate team.

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
That's why you were
wearing dad's cologne.

225
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,240
Look, I already went
through this with Silas.

226
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
I'm just gonna avoid her
for the rest of the year.

227
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,320
Hey!

228
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm not gonna let you
off the hook like that.

229
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
You have to be brave.

230
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,120
I hated your father
when I first met him.

231
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
He  slept on a futon.

232
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,160
He had a goatee.

233
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,760
He hit on my roommate.

234
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,520
But over time I got to know
him and we fell in love.

235
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm not saying you and
Gretchen are gonna fall in love.

236
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,880
You might not even like each other
if you'd spent time together but...

237
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,920
You have to give it a shot.

238
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,280
Why do you always have to bring up dad?

239
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,520
Yael.

240
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,680
Shalom.

241
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
How is my little man?

242
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,840
Ow! God!

243
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,040
Sorry, shooting pains.

244
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680
Didn't they give you medication?

245
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,080
Oh, I don't believe in painkillers,
they're addictive, you know.

246
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,560
What can I do to make you feel better?

247
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
How about letting me pitch
instead of catch this time?

248
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,960
Hello.

249
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,600
Hi, Syd.

250
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
Thank you.

251
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,800
It came down to 3 lousy votes.

252
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,080
3 fucking lousy votes. He wasn't
even on the fucking ballot.

253
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,280
You'll get him next time, tiger!

254
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
No, there's not gonna be a next time.

255
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,200
I won!

256
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,120
Hello.

257
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,440
I'll keep my concession speech short.

258
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,480
Fuck you!

259
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,760
Oh, that's brilliant.

260
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,240
Apparently my husband is
also your speechwriter.

261
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,960
No, I came up with
that one all by myself.

262
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,680
I even have it memorized,
you wanna hear it again?

263
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,000
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

264
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,880
Loser!

265
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,040
Speech!

266
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,800
Speech!

267
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,680
I won!

268
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
I fucking won!

269
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,280
That was not bad...

270
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,120
for a skinny gimp.

271
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,880
I find your *** spot, didn't I?

272
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
Hey, wait! Wait!

273
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Hang out. I thought
maybe we'd go again.

274
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,040
I have a life, you know.

275
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't spend all day
in bed like some people.

276
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay. Okay.

277
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,520
Well,  will you come by later?

278
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I have a lot of work at school.

279
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,520
When do you think you'll be back?

280
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,320
- Everyone misses you.
- Yeah, about that.

281
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,000
I think God has a
different plan for me.

282
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,800
What are you saying?

283
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm saying now that
I'm partially toeless,

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,920
there's no way I could be sent to Iraq.

285
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,360
So I'm thinking

286
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,400
God wants me to do something else

287
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,920
besides study for the rabbinat.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm thinking maybe

289
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,480
he wants me to open a microbrewery

290
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
or daytrade in oil futures.

291
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,880
You can't commit to anything, can you?

292
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,240
Don't say that.

293
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,080
I'm committed to you. Nothing changed between us.

294
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,320
I trusted you. I put my job on the line.

295
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,720
I thought you had ruaj.

296
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,760
I have tons of ruaj.
I'm filled with it.

297
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,960
No ruaj!

298
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Scrowny selfish little pig!

299
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,720
I did everything for you!

300
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,840
Fuck! Quit it!

301
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,800
That dog should have
bitten your dick off!

302
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,720
Yael! Yael!

303
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Shit!

304
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,000
Who am I?

305
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,000
Yesterday, I was councilman Doug.

306
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,560
I could park anywhere.

307
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,040
I had cutsies in every line.

308
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
The bank.

309
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,160
The movie theater.

310
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,680
Up Thongs.

311
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,520
They gave me the 3 item
combo for the price of two.

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,240
I got to drive the firetruck.

313
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,560
And now...

314
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,680
I got nothing.

315
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,800
Tilt, nada.

316
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm just another
certified public asshole.

317
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm sorry, Doug.

318
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,120
- It's not your fault.
- Actually, it is.

319
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,120
I never filed your
intent to run papers.

320
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,160
They were on my desk at work, I...

321
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,120
I had them all filed out and
ready to go, but then I got fired.

322
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,120
I threw them into a box
when I cleared out my office.

323
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,040
Then  I got tazered and I...

324
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,600
I guess I just forgot about them.

325
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,400
I don't know what to say. I'm really sorry.

326
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,000
What? I said I was sorry.

327
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,600
I completely fucked up.

328
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,280
But now it is time for us
to pull ourselves together

329
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
and do some serious soul searching.

330
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,880
Jesus!

331
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,000
You fucked up. Why do
I have to soul search?

332
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,720
- You ruined my life.
- But...

333
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,360
Get the fuck out of my office.

334
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,760
I've got pot. Amazing pot.

335
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,280
Get out of my office.

336
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
So here we are. What's your plan?

337
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,360
- I want in.
- In on what?

338
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,040
I want us to do this together,
I think we would be good together.

339
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,640
Are we gonna start a band?

340
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
I wanna help you sell pot.

341
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,560
- No, no way, next plan.
- There's no next plan.

342
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,280
I can't get in a decent school,

343
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm not working at Starbuck's
jerking lattes for minimum wage.

344
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,720
So it's the only thing
that really makes sense.

345
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll tell you what makes sense.

346
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,800
Going to Junior college, doing well,

347
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,480
transferring to a decent
university makes sense.

348
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,320
Face it, Nancy, I'm no genius.

349
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not gonna grow
up and be a doctor or

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,160
a lawyer. But I am
good at other things...

351
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,680
- Silas.
- I could help you.

352
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,720
Silas, I will never ever, ever
let you get involved in what I do.

353
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,160
- I just won't.
- I already am involved.

354
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
- This conversation is over.
- You're such a fucking hypocrite.

355
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes, I am so live with it.

356
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,920
You know, you think you're
protecting me but you're not.

357
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,240
You're not protecting
me from a goddamn thing!

358
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,160
Hello.

359
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,800
Nancy...

360
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Nancy, I left you a message.

361
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,040
- What did it say?
- Hi.

362
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,120
It said that uh... I have Tim.

363
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,720
My son, tonight.

364
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, Tim.
Hi, Tim.

365
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,880
What she doing here? I thought
it was just gonna be us.

366
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,760
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.

367
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
Bad timing. I should be going.

368
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,120
Nice to see you again, Tim.
Peter, I'll call you.

369
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,920
No, no, no. You should stay.
Tim and I were just gonna

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,520
play a game of...
Carcasse or something.

371
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,360
Carcassone!

372
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,800
It's inspired by the medieval town
of Carcassone in southern France

373
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,680
which is famous for its
formidable city walls and...

374
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
That sounds so exciting.

375
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,040
Didn't even let me explain.

376
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm just not really good at games.

377
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,560
My mom is. I guess she's
a lot smarter than you.

378
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,080
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that for a second.

379
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,800
Go set out the game.

380
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,240
Sorry.

381
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,840
No, I'm sorry. It's my fault. I should have checked my messages.

382
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,760
He goes back to his mom in the morning.

383
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
Dinner tomorrow night.

384
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,520
Great.

385
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,840
Dad. We're gonna play or not?

386
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Just a sec.

387
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,680
You're twice as smart as his mom.

388
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,840
Conrad.

389
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,600
Can I join you?

390
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,520
- It's your house.
- It's yours too.

391
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,720
No, I'm just a night watchman.

392
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
You're my partner.

393
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,960
Whatever you wanna call me.

394
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,000
I came here...

395
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,880
How is it that I can live for 36 years,

396
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
pack everything that's important to me

397
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,160
and fit it into a duffelbag?

398
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
- You packed a duffelbag?
- It's in my car right now.

399
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,880
I came here to say...

400
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,960
You came here to say
you're sorry again?

401
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,280
You can still walk away if you want.

402
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,200
Nancy, don't take me to dinner
with your husband one night

403
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,400
and then tell me I can walk the next,

404
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,280
I know I can walk. I know that.

405
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,800
Are you gonna walk?

406
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,680
I'd be all alone.

407
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,280
You got your husband.

408
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
It's a business arrangement.

409
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,920
You've got your friends, your kids.

410
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,480
Shit, I've got a fucking duffelbag.

411
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,200
Sometimes I wish that's all I had.

412
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
No, you don't.

413
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,760
Sometimes.

414
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,840
I love my kids.

415
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,200
I love my kids more than
anything but sometimes...

416
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,560
I think what would it have been
like if they died when Judah died?

417
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,760
What it would be like
not to have to worry,

418
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,680
to be only responsible for me.

419
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,800
And free.

420
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,680
How nice

421
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,960
that might feel.

422
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,840
How horrible is that?

423
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm an

424
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,920
awful, horrible person.

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,760
- I can't go home stoned.
- It's okay.

426
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,480
I can't be stoned in front of my kids.

427
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
2 hours. You'll be be clean in 2 hours.

428
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,880
If this shit is gonna
have your name on it,

429
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
it'd be kinda weird not to try it.

430
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,480
At least once.

431
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,160
- I love my kids.
- I know you do.

432
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,000
They're my life.

433
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
One hit takes the shit rolls it back.

434
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,400
Two...

435
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
takes it out the house.

436
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,160
You packed a duffelbag?

437
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,320
If I was going, I'd be gone.

438
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,040
What are we gonna do for 2 hours?

439
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,080
Watch the grass grow...

440
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,400
literally.

441
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,920
Sounds like fun.

442
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,680
- Dean.
- Yes, councilwoman Hodes.

443
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,600
You're gonna have to stop smoking pot.

444
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,280
I can't have you getting busted.

445
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,640
I am making Agrestic a drug free zone.

446
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,800
Warn your dealer.
