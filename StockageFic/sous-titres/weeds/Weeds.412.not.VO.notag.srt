2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,632
What was it like?

3
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,422
Confusing, brisk,

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:06,979
messy.

5
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,220
How's your mom doing in rehab?

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,972
I can't visit till she's detoxed.

7
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:11,973
Chilea?

8
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:13,091
Celia.

9
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:15,143
Ain't we fancy.

10
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:18,438
You have to take that fucking attitude
out the door right now, you hear me?

11
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,358
- Head cheese sandwich.
- Six inch or foot long?

12
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:23,735
- Foot long all the way, bro.
- Enjoy.

13
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,236
It's her, man.

14
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,274
- She didn't get fat, did she?
- No. She's beautiful.

15
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,909
<i>Señor </i>Doug?
What are you doing?

16
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:34,287
- I want to make the <i>sexo </i>with you.
- But we do not know each other.

17
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:36,581
Okay, I hear you.
Can I just see one boob?

18
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,982
Go get Miss Hodes a glass of water.

19
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:41,600
Now,

20
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,046
Agent

21
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,281
Shlatter.

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,322
- Deliver me Guillermo Garcia Gomez.
- I don't know of any Gomez.

23
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,681
- If I did once, I don't anymore.
- Not what I hear.

24
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,488
- What the fuck?
- Exactly. What the fuck?

25
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,214
This is supposed to be a pot tunnel.

26
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,479
It's a tunnel.

27
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,440
There's no magical
"weed only" sign at the entrance.

28
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:03,900
Cut the shit.

Synch: mpm, Dapitch666

31
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,924
I asked you to come alone.

32
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,851
<i>Agent Shlatter's my partner.</i>

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,013
And so your word is shit.

34
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,593
My word is shit?

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,144
<i>You called. I'm here.</i>

36
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,019
I need assurances.

37
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,609
What kind of assurances?

38
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,358
Everything I ask for, I get.

39
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,986
I'm not your Daddy.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,807
I'm not fucking around here.

41
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,449
This information I have,
very few people have it.

42
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,829
I'm listening.

43
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:00,106
It's gonna look
like it came from me.

44
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,440
It cannot look
like it came from me.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,107
More important than anything you do
with this information,

46
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,799
it must not look
like it came from me.

47
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,385
- Okay.
- You make a bust,

48
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:15,510
I do not go down with it.
My people do not go down with it.

49
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,307
Still, it never comes back to me.

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,734
Fine.

51
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,668
My name never appears
on any piece of paper.

52
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:22,571
No one ever speaks my name.

53
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,714
- This meeting never happened.
- Done.

54
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,059
I will not be fleeing.

55
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,347
My family will not be going
into witness protection

56
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,154
because there will be no reason for us
to go into witness protection.

57
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:32,533
You're getting repetitive.

58
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,157
There's a tunnel.

59
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,211
So, I go to see one of my kids
in the foster home,

60
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:48,505
and I'm beggin' him to forgive me.

61
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:51,132
And he looks at me with those big eyes
and he says,

62
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,011
"Who are you, lady?

63
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,470
"I ain't your kid."

64
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:56,949
I'm thinkin',

65
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,746
"My own boy
doesn't even recognize me."

66
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,990
That's the saddest thing ever.

67
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:05,040
But it ain't.

68
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:06,888
The saddest thing is,

69
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,859
I was so fucked up,
I went in the wrong house.

70
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:14,236
It was so devastating,
I miscarried right there.

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,282
Thanks for sharing.

72
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,396
I thought I had hit bottom.

73
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:23,383
But after hearing your stories,

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,785
I realize it could be so much worse.

75
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:29,365
The truth is,

76
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:31,603
none of you

77
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,271
have any chance in hell

78
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,303
of ever pulling your lives
back together,

79
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:39,772
if you even had lives
to begin with.

80
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,577
As I have listened
to your tales of...

81
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,636
burning wreckage
and shattered existence,

82
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,115
I realize that

83
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,290
I am the only one here

84
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,985
that has any chance at all...

85
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,558
a chance

86
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,418
to make amends

87
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,823
and to start over...

88
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,024
fresh.

89
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,499
Stupid-ass bitch.

90
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:20,471
Hi, Maria.

91
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,475
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be sorry. Don't be sorry.

92
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,438
Okay, no towel. One sec.

93
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:32,859
What you doing here?

94
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,389
You have been in my dreams.

95
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,349
Dreams are weird.

96
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:43,955
I have this recurring one
where I'm playing pool with Lou Dobbs.

97
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,742
And suddenly,
his big, fat stomach opens up

98
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:49,412
and these nasty teeth
grow out of his...

99
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,461
torn, fat, marbled flesh.

100
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:52,921
Please make love to me.

101
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,632
I can't do that.

102
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,843
Do you not think I am attractive?

103
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:02,602
Who locked the fuckin'...

104
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:05,931
- You're very attractive, yeah.
- I think you are attractive.

105
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,241
But...

106
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,521
- Doug.
- He is not the man for me.

107
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,064
You are.

108
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,484
You are excited.

109
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,444
No, no. It's just windy out.

110
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:18,566
I do not think it is the wind.

111
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,375
Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs.

112
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,045
We're going to a wedding.

113
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,732
It's casual,
but evening casual, you know?

114
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,841
I was thinking
something with a drop waist.

115
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:40,843
Kind of Tory Burch?

116
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,530
Exactly.

117
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,104
- I'll help them, Sanjay.
- Well, I got it.

118
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,018
No, I need you
to redress the mannequins.

119
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:51,145
Well, it's about time.
Can I do a theme?

120
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,313
Yeah. Go for it.

121
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:55,214
The dressing rooms

122
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:57,127
are back this way.

123
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:00,283
Just let me know
if you need help with anything.

124
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,897
I'm thinking shades of blue
for the window.

125
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,520
And I'm thinking
that that man you just helped

126
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,792
is gay, gay, gay!

127
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,878
- The guy in the couple?
- Not a couple. There's weirdness.

128
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:17,922
I'd say maybe she's his surrogate,

129
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:19,832
but he called her "wife."

130
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,485
It's a puzzler.

131
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:24,220
They're a nice, married couple
having a baby.

132
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,140
- They're not a couple.
- You need to get your gaydar checked.

133
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,903
Listen, breeder,

134
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,712
my gaydar is never wrong.

135
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,932
That man hearts cock.

136
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,065
Clearly, he hearted
her vagina at some point.

137
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:38,151
- You ever hear of in vitro?
- So what?

138
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,249
Religious and societal pressures

139
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,197
have forced him
to live the lie of domesticity?

140
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,541
Or maybe...

141
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:47,252
he's a cop.

142
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:53,051
- What?
- Oh, that's it.

143
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,543
He's an undercover cop

144
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:58,963
here to scope us out and bust us...

145
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:02,884
and then ask me out.

146
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:05,982
All right.

147
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,682
Of course. That's got to be it.

148
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,098
- I'm telling you.
- Get back to your vision in blue.

149
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:14,896
- Leave the nice couple alone.
- I'm going, but know this...

150
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,617
No straight man knows
what a drop-waist dress is.

151
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,932
And if he does,

152
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,770
he denies it.

153
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:28,506
I really do not feel
like going back to class.

154
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:29,665
Fuck class.

155
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:33,756
Shit! I think something just bit me.
Could you not blow smoke in my hair?

156
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:35,801
You should dye it black.

157
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,921
It would look totally cool black.

158
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:41,463
Let's break into the science lab
and get high on nitrous.

159
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,633
They keep it in a locked cabinet.

160
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:45,927
We could break the glass
with a fire extinguisher.

161
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,074
No one would hear
the sound of breaking glass

162
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:49,972
in the lab in the middle
of the afternoon.

163
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,155
- But I want to get high.
- Me too.

164
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,935
I could get some pot.

165
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:58,606
- Mind your own business.
- Can you get it like now?

166
00:07:58,877 --> 00:07:59,607
Sure.

167
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,277
I'm going to class.
Are you coming?

168
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:05,364
No. He's gonna hang with us.

169
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,224
I'm gonna hang with them.

170
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,249
You two are totally making me
reconsider fucking boys.

171
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,747
You do them once,
and they become your puppet.

172
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:18,685
She's a dyke.

173
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:21,778
In that case, she should go purple.

174
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:24,234
Her hair would look
totally cool purple.

175
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,321
Head cheese sandwich, please.

176
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,769
- What are you doing here?
- You heard me. I want a sandwich.

177
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,814
- Then go to Subway.
- They don't have the kind I want.

178
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:42,441
Neither do we.

179
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:43,693
I think you do.

180
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,944
Fuck off.

181
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,193
Come on. Just one?

182
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:48,406
I'm not giving weed
to my little brother!

183
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:51,104
- You gave me a condom.
- That was sex.

184
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,119
This is drugs.
Why aren't you in school?

185
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,051
I knew you smoked when you were 13.
I saw you.

186
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:00,334
- You're already stupid enough.
- With that asshole Danny Melcher.

187
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:02,879
You were both giggling,
and then he stood up on our water slide

188
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,423
- and took a piss in our pool.
- You saw that?

189
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,702
Why do you think I didn't go
in the pool for a year?

190
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:10,928
Look, I'm not gonna sit here
and say "don't do drugs."

191
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:12,910
That would make you a total hypocrite.

192
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,865
But...

193
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:17,560
I'm not gonna be your fuckin' dealer.

194
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:22,315
- Does anybody work here?
- Be right out.

195
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,235
I'll give you 300 bucks.

196
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,324
Go back to school.

197
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:35,517
Sorry about that.

198
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,700
Do you know what a barcarole is?

199
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:44,972
I do not.

200
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,256
It's a boat song.

201
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,355
From the days when men
serenaded women in boats.

202
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:56,400
You got a thing for boats.

203
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:02,173
The finest barcarole ever written
and this is not my opinion.

204
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:05,145
It is generally agreed upon
by men of substance...

205
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,903
is the one you're hearing right now.

206
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,013
Who are the girls?

207
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:16,169
Melia, Cybelle, Adelita...

208
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,412
my daughters.

209
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,793
No pictures of mommy?

210
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,602
She's remarried now.

211
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:28,144
Lives in France.

212
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:29,382
They're all there.

213
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:31,801
You don't get to see them much?

214
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,966
Over Christmas,
we're going skiing in Whistler.

215
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,890
This picture wasn't here before.

216
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,000
I hid it.

217
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,688
It was a strange thing for me to do.

218
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:47,275
You make me do things
I wouldn't usually do.

219
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,906
Where are you?

220
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:01,963
What?

221
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,100
Where are you?

222
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,639
- You're in your head and not here.
- No.

223
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:10,870
I'm here.

224
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,844
No, I'm here. I...

225
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,682
I want to tell you something.

226
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:26,689
There were more girls in the tunnel.

227
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,082
I know that.

228
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:31,040
You do?

229
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:35,830
It is the business
of dark-hearted people.

230
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:38,316
And you and I

231
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:40,723
are not dark-hearted.

232
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,297
Girls will never come through
the tunnel again.

233
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,011
Do you dance?

234
00:11:59,027 --> 00:11:59,869
I do.

235
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,685
Would you care to dance with me,
Nancy Botwin?

236
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,398
You should say, "yes."

237
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:26,617
I threw up on my prom date.

238
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:32,252
Charming.

239
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:40,804
Do you love me?

240
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,275
Are you in love with me?

241
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,383
"Are you in love with me"?

242
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,869
That's not an answer.

243
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:53,818
You don't ask the mayor of Tijuana
if he's in love.

244
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,996
That is just not done.

245
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,564
You should have said "yes."

246
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,998
Would you like to take a trip with me?

247
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:20,314
Christmas in Whistler with the kids?

248
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,638
Sooner.

249
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,496
And only us.

250
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,518
I have a job.

251
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,561
I manage Maternity World.

252
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,267
I'll have to ask.

253
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:33,276
May I have a week off?

254
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,981
You didn't say "please!"

255
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,482
Please, kind employer?

256
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:43,996
You may.

257
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,397
<i>Patron.</i>

258
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:22,809
<i>Sí.</i>

259
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:44,297
What does that mean... <i>regaliz rojo</i>?

260
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,036
Very bad.

261
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,495
- Place is really coming along.
- Yeah not bad.

262
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,632
But as soon as we figure out
our next venture,

263
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,256
I want to get a bigger place.

264
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,769
I'm thinking
generic Mexican pharmaceuticals.

265
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,754
Sell them to old people
with no insurance. What do you think?

266
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:21,340
That's a great idea.
So, where are we eating?

267
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:22,758
Maria, any ideas?

268
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:25,469
Just, please, no more Mexican food.

269
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,929
- Cuban?
- Nothing with beans.

270
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,476
- Andy, any ideas?
- Maria and I had sex!

271
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,823
What?

272
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,122
We had sex. I'm sorry. We did.

273
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:43,443
Just once. Okay, twice.
But not two separate times.

274
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,025
One time.

275
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,615
And then again after.

276
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,247
- You guys had sex?
- It wasn't planned or anything.

277
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,915
- It just happened.
- I seduced him.

278
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,065
I feel like shit.

279
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,170
You're my friend.

280
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,037
I love you, man, and I'm...

281
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,022
It's tearing me up inside.
I had to come clean.

282
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:08,497
It's never gonna happen again,
I swear.

283
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,099
It was a one-slash-two-time thing...
Meant nothing.

284
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:13,142
I love him.

285
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:16,186
No, no.
You don't love me.

286
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,606
- You love Doug.
- No.

287
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:20,065
I love you, Andy.

288
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:23,152
You are the best lover
I have ever had.

289
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:26,054
Yeah,
but Doug's gonna be even better, right?

290
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:28,365
I mean, he's so tall
and he's so good with numbers.

291
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,200
She got scared, Doug.

292
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:31,902
I was a fear fuck,

293
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:34,649
'cause she's so totally into you
it freaked her out.

294
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,170
Tell him, Maria.

295
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,770
I'm so sorry, Doug.

296
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,754
But sometimes,
we cannot help who we love.

297
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:45,712
Well...

298
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:47,406
okay.

299
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:49,779
All right. I hear you.

300
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:54,642
- I'm glad you were honest with me.
- It'll never happen again.

301
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:57,061
It will.
It will happen many times.

302
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:58,833
Stop saying that!

303
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:00,598
It's fine.

304
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:05,064
You're my best friend,
and I love you.

305
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,237
And Maria's right:
we can't choose who we love.

306
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:10,263
But Maria,
as much as I've enjoyed having you,

307
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,997
it's a little awkward
for you to stay here now.

308
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:14,370
I understand.

309
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,709
You guys mind if I have a few minutes?

310
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:20,353
Of course, man.
Take all the time you need.

311
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,372
San Diego County.

312
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,769
Department of immigration
and naturalization.

313
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,021
You did very good work, Captain.

314
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:42,043
Clini...

315
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,357
Clinique.

316
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:44,983
Tell your men I said that myself.

317
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:47,730
He'll be taken care of.
You'll be taken care of.

318
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,269
There's a press conference.
I should be there within the hour.

319
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,365
Jimmy Jam, too.

320
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:54,201
Stay calm.

321
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,968
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

322
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,479
You?

323
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,138
Many arrests.

324
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:08,674
And one of Guillermo's men was killed.

325
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:10,534
Someone talked.

326
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:11,757
Really?

327
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,554
The one with the drug problem...

328
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,348
- your lesbian lover.
- Celia?

329
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:17,844
Oh, no.

330
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:19,184
No way.

331
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:20,936
She's terrified of me.

332
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,313
You know we're not lesbians, right?

333
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,819
I take your word.

334
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:28,652
What about the Asian homosexual?

335
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:31,613
Why are we focusing on my crew?

336
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,115
My people don't talk.

337
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,383
Oh, really?

338
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,369
Well, someone ratted out Guillermo
when he said he wanted to kill me.

339
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,997
- What about that guy?
- We'll be looking at everyone.

340
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:42,124
Will you be looking into me?

341
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:45,179
- Should I be looking into you?
- Only if you don't trust me.

342
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,170
Reckless,

343
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:47,838
impulsive,

344
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,757
but not suicidal.

345
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,828
You're gonna have your own problems
because of this.

346
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:55,454
<i>Adelante.</i>

347
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:58,526
<i>Patron,</i>

348
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,100
the car is downstairs.

349
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:03,353
It's gonna be hard for me
to see you in the short term.

350
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,606
- You understand?
- Of course.

351
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,762
It's an inconvenience, but...

352
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:10,068
we'll get by.

353
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,237
Dig another tunnel, right, Cesar?

354
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,310
Already digging.

355
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,198
Call Cesar if you run into problems.

356
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,027
I will.

357
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,673
I almost forgot.

358
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,218
Yes.

359
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:35,511
"Yes"?

360
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:38,680
The answer to last night's question.

361
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:58,408
And I'm sorry for the massive
body issues I have given you.

362
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,328
And I'm sorry
for judging your lifestyle choice.

363
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,997
If you want to love the ladies,
love those ladies.

364
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:05,495
Vagina power!

365
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:07,584
I'll buy you a big strap-on
for Hanukkah.

366
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:10,160
- Jesus, Celia.
- Okay, fine.

367
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,259
I'm sorry about that, too.

368
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,176
Do you forgive me?

369
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,494
That's it?
That's all you're sorry for?

370
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:22,850
What else is there?

371
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:25,514
Apology accepted.

372
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,315
Okay.
Dean, you're next.

373
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,984
Isabel, would you mind
leaving us alone for this one?

374
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:34,033
Fine. I'll be at the pool.

375
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:43,182
Okay.

376
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:44,962
Here goes.

377
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:51,227
I'm sorry for being married
to you without...

378
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,601
ever once,

379
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:54,882
I mean, not even for a moment,

380
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:58,135
being sexually attracted to you.

381
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:02,931
I'm sorry every time we had sex
I fantasized about other men.

382
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:06,613
I'm sorry the sight of your naked body

383
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:10,147
repulsed me to the point
that I was forced to stray.

384
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:14,145
- I'm glad this makes you feel better.
- I'm sorry I had children with you.

385
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,178
I'm sorry I made a life with you.

386
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:19,281
- That my hatred of you...
- All right, enough.

387
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:21,909
- No. I'm just getting started.
- No, you are finished!

388
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:24,286
I could care less
about your fucking apologies.

389
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:28,290
But we happen to have a daughter
who hasn't seen you in over two years,

390
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:31,691
who bore the brunt
of your insensitivity and anger

391
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:35,639
and who could use an apology,
a real apology, Celia,

392
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,594
- a hell of a lot more than I could.
- I don't know where Quinn is.

393
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,886
She's living in Oaxaca
with a guy named Rudolfo.

394
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,347
- Rudolfo?
- Go. Find Quinn.

395
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:45,223
Make things right.

396
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:49,634
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

397
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,268
You totally rock.

398
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,348
Totally.

399
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:13,687
I see you're still alive.

400
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:14,947
You're late.

401
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,691
Got stuck doing interviews.
Big story.

402
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:21,445
Big spotlight
shining on that maternity store.

403
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,293
What am I supposed to do now?
Can I go home?

404
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:25,240
Sure.

405
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,024
We'll arrest you tomorrow
and make it look right.

406
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,787
Store manager.
Got to question your ass.

407
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:32,789
We'll pretend to ask,

408
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,431
and you'll pretend to know nothing.

409
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,503
And we'll pretend
to fuck up on a technicality.

410
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,058
Sounds like a plan.

411
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,008
What about Sanjay?

412
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:45,177
We took him to Long Beach
and put him on a plane.

413
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,319
And Guillermo?

414
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,222
Guillermo's going away for a long time,
and so is his crew.

415
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:51,546
There was some...

416
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,935
international confusion.

417
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:56,221
Who is Guillermo's boss?

418
00:23:58,048 --> 00:23:59,298
I have no idea.

419
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,448
I hope that's the truth
'cause we got you covered on this side.

420
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,739
But they play a harder game down south.
You should know that.

421
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,075
You make it look right,
I'll be fine.

422
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:33,663
Agent Shlatter,

423
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,749
I think it is your partner.

424
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,312
Maybe we let it go to voice mail.

425
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,785
"Informant details location
of said tunnel.

426
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:57,249
"Informant confirms hour of delivery."

427
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:00,961
I'm going to ask you again
the same question.

428
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:02,891
Who is...

429
00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:04,544
"informant"?

430
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,730
I don't know. I don't know.

431
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,017
I did not hear you.

432
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:41,299
One more time, <i>amigo</i>.

433
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:50,774
Nancy Botwin.
