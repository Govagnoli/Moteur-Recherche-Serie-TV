1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,732
Previously on Weeds.

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,011
Everybody all right?

3
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:22,029
Snowflake?

4
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,640
She's in shock. Slap her.

5
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:24,886
What's this?

6
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:27,981
You're looking at a fine and probably an anti-drug class.

7
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,458
I wrote a gangsta rap about killing Devon Mensler with my gat.

8
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,170
My therapist says I'm just acting out 'cause my dad's dead.

9
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,255
Judah was my brother. I miss him too, Nancy.

10
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:38,901
Look, I made a mistake, okay?

11
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,905
I don't want Chelsea. I don't want any other girl. I want you.

12
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,333
Could my cover business eventually become my real business?

13
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:48,234
What do you think about this place as the bakery?

14
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:49,702
I have cancer.

15
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:52,540
What do you think about these?

16
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,103
I don't give a flying fuck if you do have cancer.

17
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:57,293
Put your tits away in front of my kid.

18
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,352
I love you, mommy.

19
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,733
I love you, mommy.

20
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:47,610
Shit!

21
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,472
Good morning ladies and "jointleman"!

22
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,962
My name is Billy, I'm a pothead

23
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:58,943
and I think these weekly marijuana anonymous meetings really help me quit

24
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:01,701
'cause every Saturday between 9 and 10,

25
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,162
I don't get high!

26
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,112
Jesus! What a nimrod!

27
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:07,681
One time I was staring at my aquarium just wondering

28
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:11,151
"after fishes have sex, do they fight about who sleeps on the dry spot?"

29
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,582
If we have to sit through this dreck,

30
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,570
they should pass out loose joints at the door.

31
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,090
It's the only human thing to do.

32
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,130
Hey, man!

33
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:20,693
Comedy is Billy's art. Don't be calling Billy's art dreck.

34
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,831
I didn't think so but the judge disagreed.

35
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:27,543
Okay, so let's all join me in the serenity prayer.

36
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,933
God, grant me the serenity

37
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:33,671
to accept the things I can't change

38
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,953
and the courage to change the things I can

39
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,752
and the wisdom to know the difference.

40
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,553
Amen!

41
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,861
What does this mean?

42
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,513
It's just boiler plate legal ease for release.

43
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:52,743
Hey!

44
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:55,150
Don't look at me. I'm fucked up on cornbread.

45
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,583
What maked me think I could run a bakery?

46
00:04:58,677 --> 00:04:59,382
Me.

47
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,993
Nancy, you just have to make it look like

48
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:03,170
you're running a bakery to legitimize your dealing.

49
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,740
You just called me a dealer!

50
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:05,731
You are a dealer!

51
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:08,153
We're in my house!

52
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:12,120
I'm not a dealer. I'm a mother!

53
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,831
Who happens to distribute illegal products

54
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:18,831
through a sham bakery set up by my ethically questionable CPA

55
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,833
and his crooked lawyer friend.

56
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:22,492
At least I can get myself off.

57
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,722
What's that supposed to mean?

58
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,982
In court, I'm a lawyer, I can get myself off.

59
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:28,160
Maybe I should have gone to law school.

60
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,700
You need a cool nickname like "Ice peek".

61
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:32,551
- Who's Ice peek?
- It's my old drug dealer.

62
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:33,353
What happened to him?

63
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,683
He opened a sham deli and got busted.

64
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,683
I'm joking! I'm joking!

65
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,862
He went back to Pittsburgh.

66
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,991
Mom! Mom! Mom! Do we have any batteries?

67
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:45,743
No.

68
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:46,681
Are you sure?

69
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:47,790
Trust me, no.

70
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,123
Well, can we go to Cosco?

71
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,751
- Not now, honey.
- I'm bored.

72
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:51,991
Then read a book.

73
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:54,273
Okay.

74
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,442
Please sign here.

75
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:01,340
Wait, wait, wait. I haven't explained everything yet.

76
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:02,381
All yours, Smoky!

77
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,460
Smoky?

78
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:05,163
I'm working on it.

79
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,811
- Hi, I'm Andy.
- Hi, I'm Sharon.

80
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,370
Sharon, this is my first meeting.

81
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,681
I just had to tell you I was so moved by your words.

82
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:19,822
Well, they're not my words,

83
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,520
it's a prayer.

84
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,972
But you had such convictions.

85
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:27,331
You  were kind of rude during sharing.

86
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,461
And you were late.

87
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:30,652
I'm having a really hard time off the pot.

88
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,831
It makes me so cranky and unpunctual.

89
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:34,402
I'm sorry about that.

90
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,010
No, I understand. That's very hard and

91
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,003
Billy is kind of a nimrod.

92
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,130
Yeah, he's kind of a nimrod.

93
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,643
So what do you think about your first meeting?

94
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,431
Hum...

95
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:47,920
truthfully?

96
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:51,900
I'm not really sure I'm strong enough to stay clean.

97
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:56,171
Well, I think that if you're honest with yourself

98
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,221
and you're willing to share with the group, you can do this.

99
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:02,552
So right. That's really what I want. It's everything that you said.

100
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,983
God! You're so together and beautiful. Sponsor me.

101
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:10,540
No. There're people here who are better qualified to help you.

102
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,010
And sponsors should really be the same sex.

103
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:13,762
Why?

104
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:17,091
So there's no emotional ties between the sponsor and the sponsee.

105
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:18,501
What about gays?

106
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,502
Are you gay?

107
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,682
Would  you sponsor me?

108
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:21,661
Andy...

109
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:23,371
Okay, look...

110
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:33,443
here it is: when I was young, my stepfather, he...

111
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,622
I can't talk to men.

112
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:39,402
I have no trust for them.

113
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:42,423
If I have no one I can open up to...

114
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:44,221
then I fear the worst.

115
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:47,451
I'm frightened, Sharon, I'm alone and I'm frightened.

116
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:00,750
Thank you.

117
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:01,832
Thank you.

118
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,123
Welcome!

119
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:20,283
It's the last time I do this.

120
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,412
Better get over your fear of bullets, girl.

121
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,640
Give me some time!

122
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,771
I'm sure it's unacquired taste.

123
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,602
You know what?

124
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,211
Find yourself another delivery boy.

125
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:31,213
Strong  proud black men like myself tend to stick out around here.

126
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:33,050
Smells like vindaloo.

127
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:34,040
Good nose!

128
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:35,032
I know.

129
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,343
Where you gonna store this stuff, girl?

130
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:38,191
At home.

131
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,361
Why the hell would you bring it home?

132
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,763
'Cause that's where I keep it.

133
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,612
You don't need to bring home the weed you know you're gonna moving real quick, right?

134
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:50,772
You're lucky you've got them pretty eyes and that sweet badunkadunk.

135
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:51,332
What?

136
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:52,623
The booty's nice.

137
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:53,553
Thank you.

138
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,161
Heylia keeps her weed at home.

139
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,260
Yeah, but Heylia ain't got two kids running around, does she?

140
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,493
And she damn sure ain't got a sweet place like this.

141
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:02,393
Strangest thing: banks will not give small business loans

142
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:05,340
to people poor, black, soon-to-be grandmothers in West Adams.

143
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:07,571
They will only give loans to white dealers.

144
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,665
Don't call me a dealer.

145
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,283
Baby, a sexy spade is still a spade.

146
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:14,744
Don't get old. It's no good.

147
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,701
Everyday I'm sweating through me clothes,

148
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:21,791
but down there, dry like the Mojave.

149
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:26,331
That sucks. Lupita, I need to tell you something.

150
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:27,603
My cousin Alejandro --

151
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,450
The baseball player? Or the drunk?

152
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:30,582
No, the baseball player.

153
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,851
He says that your Mrs.

154
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,741
is messing with his business.

155
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:36,361
What?!

156
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:40,552
He says your Mrs. sells weed.

157
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,191
Your cousin is crazy.

158
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:45,471
How does she pay for all this?

159
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:50,290
Simple, she's a skinny white lady in America.

160
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:51,792
What are we playing?

161
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:52,782
Terrorists.

162
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,101
I'm hungry.

163
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:58,771
You can eat once your oppressionist government releases our prisoners.

164
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,673
Do you guys have fruit rollups?

165
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,941
Silence!

166
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:06,520
Come in!

167
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:15,071
Hi!

168
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:31,260
Let me save you some typing, okay?

169
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:34,981
I'm an asshole! I'm an asshole! I'm an asshole! I'm an asshole!

170
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:45,381
So, are we cool?

171
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,091
You're an asshole.

172
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:52,300
Alright.

173
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:57,372
Sealer closet, hidden locks, turkey bags, seal-a-meal.

174
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:59,083
These are the things that you need to know.

175
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:00,032
Turkey bags?

176
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,001
You need to build yourself a secret locker

177
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,993
and you need to line that locker with sealer,

178
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,900
that's gonna help keep the bugs out.

179
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:07,400
I should be writing this down.

180
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:09,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you trying to get us arrested?

181
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:14,363
Look, protect that locker with a secret lock.

182
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:18,391
Now, the weed that you break into on a daily.

183
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:19,920
You wanna store that in your turkey bags,

184
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,340
that's gonna help hide the smell

185
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,661
but then again you could probably just sprinkle that shit all over the countertops

186
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,422
I wouldn't be able to tell in this place.

187
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:26,643
How do you not know any of this?

188
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:27,781
I live in Agrestic.

189
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,442
Do you know how to turn on automatic sprinklers?

190
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:31,430
Hey, Silas!

191
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:33,123
Shit.

192
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:40,810
Give me the weed.

193
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:41,402
What weed?

194
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:44,060
Don't fuck around! Give me the weed.

195
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:47,772
Jesus.

196
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,681
Is this what you wanna be? A couple of fucking teenage burnouts?

197
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:54,773
Oh! I'm 16! I have zits! Life's so tough.

198
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:57,633
Oh! I'm deaf! I can't hear! Life's so unfair!

199
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:58,793
What are you gonna do with it?

200
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,263
How about if I give it to your mother?

201
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,423
You wouldn't.

202
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:04,610
If Marijuana Anonymous teaches us anything,

203
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:06,923
smoking dope might be a lot of fun right now,

204
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,872
soon you're gonna learn it teaches you to live

205
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,822
in a privately defined world,

206
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:15,481
a world that gets smaller and smaller as you box yourself in

207
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:19,010
and narrow your options to absolutely nothing.

208
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:25,922
That's pretty much cashed.

209
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:32,130
You American dogs have 24 hours to comply and leave our country

210
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:33,210
or else...

211
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,080
You are seriously twisted, Strange Botwin.

212
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:38,591
Don't say my name, infidel!

213
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:42,711
Why does she see Mr. Doug so often?

214
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:47,473
And why does Mr. Doug always smoke weed after?

215
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:50,283
Maybe she's fucking Mr. Doug.

216
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:55,802
Nobody fucks Mr. Doug.

217
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,172
What a loser.

218
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:02,263
I tell you, I believe Alejandro.

219
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:04,010
Alejandro is full of shit.

220
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,393
That's right. Because he can't sell his shit no more.

221
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,940
'Cause your Mrs. is doing it.

222
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:15,903
What are you looking for?

223
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,313
Are you stealing from us?

224
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:21,541
This! My family needs this menora.

225
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,771
Mom said you once stole one of her rings.

226
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:24,631
What?

227
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,191
But then she found it.

228
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:32,120
I think you probably just wanna put your safe right here.

229
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:34,011
I'll pay you to install it.

230
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:38,003
You already owe me for a car hood, I haven't seen a dime of that.

231
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,523
Got to offer me something else.

232
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:40,511
What do you want?

233
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:41,543
Hello?

234
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:44,611
- Nancy?
- Celia.

235
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,021
What are you doing here?

236
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:50,313
I refuse to sit around the house for 3 days... waiting.

237
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:54,882
Puppies are coming off, Nanc'.

238
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:59,300
And I'm thinking it's time to take them out for one last walk.

239
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,482
Alright, who's the hottie?

240
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:06,882
My carpenter, Conrad. Conrad, this is Celia.

241
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:08,113
Hey!

242
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,713
Hello, carpenter.

243
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:13,213
Do you wanna see something?

244
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,842
Celia, you have to stop flashing your boobs...

245
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:18,602
Speak when spoken to!

246
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,822
Here today, gone tomorrow.

247
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:23,132
It's symbolic.

248
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,793
My homage to temporary permanence.

249
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,510
They're beautiful.

250
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,753
Whoa, thank you.

251
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,013
Would you like to take them out dancing tonight?

252
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:32,580
He doesn't have time to go dancing.

253
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:35,860
Come on, Nancy! We'll go out. All of us.

254
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,382
I've been fully waxed and I have a brand new tattoo.

255
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:42,303
I am not going to take no for an answer.

256
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:43,421
You have a husband!

257
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:48,780
Who's white and Jewish. If we were going out for Kreplach, maybe...

258
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,143
Let's raid your fridge.

259
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:52,981
Hey! Hey! Hey!

260
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,623
No more typing, alright?

261
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,603
Let's just talk.

262
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:59,452
I wanna hear your voice.

263
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,010
Why not?

264
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,123
I hate my voice.

265
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,731
How do you know? You can't hear it.

266
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,362
Listen,  come on.

267
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:12,971
I promise you

268
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,353
it will be okay.

269
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:17,522
Just talk. It's me, okay? Just talk to me.

270
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,420
Please. Please! Hey!

271
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,890
Take that, you kraut bastards!

272
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:32,981
What are you doing?

273
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:34,071
Killing nazis.

274
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,460
Don't hurt your thumbs.

275
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:40,722
Oh! So now you're selling weed and turning tricks.

276
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,491
Girl's gotta support two kids and her brother-in-law.

277
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:46,292
Not after we turn that bakery into a goldmine.

278
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:47,973
Just like the Jesus t-shirts.

279
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,893
And the ostrich farm, huh?

280
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,941
Yeah, you're right. Much better to be a pot dealer.

281
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:54,840
I'm not getting sucked into your bullshit right now.

282
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,832
Okay, tap into your higher power.

283
00:15:57,026 --> 00:16:01,363
If i could tap into my higher power, my fingers wouldn't be numb.

284
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:06,810
Mom! Check this out! This is so cool!

285
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:09,360
Are you going out?

286
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:12,332
Yes, sweety but I'll look at that first thing in the morning, okay?

287
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:13,631
Be good.

288
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:17,162
Hey, buddy! Come hang out with me.

289
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:17,722
Pass.

290
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,880
Is it true what they say

291
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:41,552
that once a white woman's been with a carpenter, she never goes back.

292
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,021
Baby, when I nail something,

293
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,531
it  stays nailed.

294
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:47,631
Wait right here.

295
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,642
I have cancer and jungle fever

296
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:55,410
and tonight one of them is going to get cured.

297
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,500
Hey, sponsor!

298
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:06,721
Hi.

299
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,040
Huh...

300
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,783
I'm really losing it.

301
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,621
I need to talk to you.

302
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:19,373
My girlfriend just broke up with me.

303
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,642
No, no, no, I need to... I need to see you.

304
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:31,213
I'm sitting here with a joint in one hand

305
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,631
and a lighter in the other.

306
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:33,860
And huh...

307
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:36,183
I'm never gonna make it through the night.

308
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:37,033
Please!

309
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,591
Please, I'm begging you.

310
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:46,981
You've got a nice badunkadunk.

311
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,361
Ever happened to you: you live your whole life without hearing an expression

312
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,020
and then your hear it twice in one day?

313
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,671
Would you like some champagne?

314
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:53,951
No, thank you.

315
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,421
Something tells me it's best to stay sober around you.

316
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:57,842
Now why would you say that?

317
00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:59,423
I had to go through a metal detector

318
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,982
but you and your friends came through the back entrance.

319
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:03,273
And that makes me nervous.

320
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:04,480
I make you nervous?

321
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,760
Guns make me nervous, you make me curious.

322
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:09,752
Says the white lady in the black club.

323
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:12,581
What's your story?

324
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,311
I came with Conrad.

325
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:15,800
Are you buying or selling?

326
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,862
I'm a suburban baroness of bud.

327
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:21,283
Nancy.

328
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:22,953
Tusk.

329
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:24,271
Nice to meet you, Tusk.

330
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,831
What do you do?

331
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,171
I'm a businessman.

332
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:28,293
Are you now?

333
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,321
Do you have any kids?

334
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:33,650
I  do.

335
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:35,863
Two boys and a girl.

336
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,403
I have two boys. I'm not with them enough.

337
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:41,301
How do you keep your business separate from your family?

338
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:42,900
They live in Atlanta.

339
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:44,512
Don't you miss them?

340
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,892
I'd miss them more if they were dead.

341
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,270
You got a man?

342
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,463
He died of a heart attack.

343
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:52,703
He was fun.

344
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:54,162
We had a good fit.

345
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:56,890
Now I run around all day but I don't have anyone to talk to.

346
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,570
You're talking to me.

347
00:19:58,678 --> 00:19:59,631
What am I doing?

348
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,721
You're doing what all of us are doing, baby.

349
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,310
You're getting by.

350
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:10,900
Lupita!

351
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,910
Still looking for something?

352
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:15,512
I cleaning.

353
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,512
You wanna help me build a pillow fort?

354
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,021
Okay.

355
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,410
Is nothing to find here anyway.

356
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,333
I get more pillows.

357
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:35,081
Lupita, hurry up!

358
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:51,372
Me and my girlfriend, Vanessa,

359
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:56,373
we loved to get high and have spiritually, passionate,

360
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:57,932
uninhibited sex...

361
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,322
It wasn't even sex. It was better than sex.

362
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:05,030
It was like a tantric mind meld.

363
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,821
Well, it was less mind and more meld.

364
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,322
That's why I have to get wasted, you know, but

365
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:15,833
I know it will just make me miss Valery even more

366
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:21,271
and the pain will be as bad as the sex was good.

367
00:21:21,387 --> 00:21:22,120
I get it.

368
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:25,092
No, I don't think you do. I really loved Veronica.

369
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:26,871
No, believe me, I get it.

370
00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:28,973
Nothing used to make me happier than

371
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:33,773
getting high and having passionate, uninhibited sex.

372
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:34,852
Really?

373
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:37,691
Yeah, in fact...

374
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,032
What?

375
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:42,340
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

376
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:46,630
I can only climax

377
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:48,293
if I'm high.

378
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,171
Mind my head.

379
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:41,662
Oh God!

380
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:44,012
Nanc'! Come here, you gotta check this out.

381
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,862
Not right now, Andy. It's been a long night.

382
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:48,463
No, no, no, I think you need to see this.

383
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:49,840
What are we playing?

384
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:50,881
Terrorists.

385
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:52,023
I'm hungry.

386
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:57,133
You can eat once your oppressionist government releases our prisoners.

387
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:58,973
Do you guys have fruit rollups?

388
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,042
Silence!

389
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:05,272
You American dogs have 24 hours to comply and leave our country!

390
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,502
Or else!

391
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:09,232
You are seriously twisted, Strange Botwin.

392
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,611
Don't say my name, infidel!

393
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:16,822
Hi, mom!

394
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:22,430
What am I gonna do with him?

395
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:25,902
He shot a mountain lion, he wrote a gangsta rap,

396
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:27,882
now he's making terrorists videos.

397
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:29,112
Yeah and huh...

398
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:33,061
I melted Army Man and I peed on the neighbor's kid

399
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,870
and I blew up frogs.

400
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,542
I was young and it was 4th of July and

401
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:43,882
Judah dared me. The point is that little boys do this shit, you know.

402
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,013
Mostly 'cause they're dumb.

403
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,310
Or they want attention.

404
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:49,593
Shane's not dumb.

405
00:23:50,488 --> 00:23:53,783
And the bright side, I think we got a little Scorcese on our hands.

406
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,971
Chicks love this cutting-edge directors. Man!

407
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,723
That kid is gonna get laid by the time he's 11.

408
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:12,751
Sweet dreams.

409
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:15,733
I want a raise.

410
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:33,583
You up, kiddo?

411
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:34,631
Yep.

412
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:39,261
I saw your video.

413
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:42,712
And?

414
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:48,540
And the infidels are ready to meet your demands.

415
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:21,052
I love you.

416
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:23,152
You fucking better.

417
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:59,153
