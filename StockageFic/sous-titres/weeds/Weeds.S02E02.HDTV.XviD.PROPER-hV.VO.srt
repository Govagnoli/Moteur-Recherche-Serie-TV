1
00:00:00,763 --> 00:00:02,514
Previously on Weeds.

2
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:03,971
Hi, I'm Craig Ex. And you are at the

3
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:06,394
Bodhi Sativa caregivers club.

4
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:09,106
Nancy, it's Sanjay. The bakery is on fire.

5
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:11,579
- Oh my God!
- I'm running for city council.

6
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:13,323
I run unoppposed, this is my thing.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,075
You cannot become a lesbian just
because you don't wanna lose weight.

8
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:20,515
My whole life has been leading up
to this, to here, to the rabbinat.

9
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:23,923
I'm writing about what
being a Jew means to me.

10
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:24,813
Come here.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,557
Did I mention I slept with
a DEA agent last night?

12
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,372
- I'm out.
- He doesn't know!

13
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:30,875
You've stepped in some shit

14
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,742
and you're not gonna
track it to my house.

15
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,023
- Hello.
- Peter.

16
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:40,131
I was wondering when I
was gonna hear from you.

17
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,041
You really know how to keep
a guy on the edge of his seat.

18
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:43,950
Peter, um...

19
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,322
I can't do this.

20
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:51,500
I really like you but uh...

21
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:53,780
I can't see you anymore, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:58,373
I'm a widow and I'm just
starting to get back on my feet.

23
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,762
And I can't get involved with
someone who does what you do.

24
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,831
Nancy, nothing's gonna happen to me.

25
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:05,391
You don't know that.

26
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:11,501
You deal with... drug dealers.
I can't get close to you and

27
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:13,862
lose you. I just... I couldn't...

28
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,872
go through that again.
I need to end this. Now.

29
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:19,173
I've been...

30
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,661
hurt too but I'm willing to

31
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:24,090
take the risk with you.

32
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,132
I have very strong feelings for you and

33
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:29,912
what I do is mostly a desk job, Nancy.

34
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:31,983
You carry a gun. I can't.

35
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:34,622
Please don't call me anymore.

36
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:36,181
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,212
- What's this?
- It's for the campaign.

38
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,043
Family picture. Warm. Fuzzy.

39
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:59,403
I put it on the calendar:
Wednesday, early evening.

40
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:02,053
You, me, Isabel.

41
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,471
What about Quinn? Isn't
she a member of this family?

42
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,912
I'm telling people she's
dead. Get the sympathy vote.

43
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:07,612
Celia!

44
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,973
I'm just kidding! Gosh!
Where's your sense of humor!

45
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:12,770
I phoned Quinn.

46
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,103
Offered to fly her back for the photo.

47
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:18,602
And we both agreed it would be
too hypocritical even for me.

48
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:21,261
She sends her love to you.

49
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,063
Wants to know if you'll mail
her some double A batteries

50
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,943
and s'more flavored poptarts.

51
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:29,833
That fucking rat dog
is giving me a migraine!

52
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:32,212
Well, you can count me out too.

53
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,262
Why? You're my husband!

54
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,543
And you're local, I
don't see a problem.

55
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:39,580
Maybe I don't feel
like being a hypocrit.

56
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:42,192
Hopefully by Wednesday, you'll
be back to your old self.

57
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:44,912
You don't want me to
work on your campaign.

58
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:46,822
Why do you want me in your picture?

59
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:49,013
'Cause your tie is
gonna match my dress.

60
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:52,620
Forget it! If I'm out of the
picture, I'm out of the picture.

61
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:55,512
Fine! Fine, it'll
just be me and Isabel.

62
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,910
You take a lousy picture anyway.

63
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:01,442
- Have a nice day!
- Oh, you too.

64
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,970
I don't know why we
couldn't go to Tacos Guacos.

65
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:10,443
I was up for Tacos Guacos.

66
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:13,333
It's too spicy and it
never looks clean in there.

67
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,273
You're a pussy.

68
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,240
There are Mexican things on this menu.

69
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:17,973
Look, they have tortilla soup.

70
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:20,853
It's a bowl of bullshit
with chips scraps.

71
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:22,382
- I hate chains.
- What about In & Out?

72
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,861
In & Out is independently
owned by religious nuts

73
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:27,012
that put biblical citations
on the bottom of the cups.

74
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:29,422
They don't franchise and
they use fresh ingredients.

75
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,183
They cook with Jesus.

76
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:32,970
Yeah, I bet if we went
to the kitchen here,

77
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:34,640
we'd find some guy named Jesus.

78
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:35,942
You're trying to be funny?

79
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:38,633
I am simply pointing out that most
Southern California restaurants

80
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,020
employ kitchen help of Latin descent.

81
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:44,463
And a lot of you name your kids
Jesus. It's a thing with you people.

82
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:45,641
Hey, kids.

83
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:48,462
Sorry we're late. It's Andy's fault.

84
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:49,622
Totally my fault.

85
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,111
Where's Conrad?

86
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:52,783
Yeah, I've been meaning to ask:

87
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,780
is Conrad a popular name in
the African American community?

88
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,153
He's the only one I ever met.

89
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:00,662
He's not coming.

90
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:02,472
He's out. Now...

91
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,700
let me show you what I worked out.

92
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:07,550
I've broken down
everything we need to do

93
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:08,961
and I've assigned you...

94
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,521
Wow! Time out.

95
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,192
The black dude had our genetics.

96
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:13,482
What happened to him?

97
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:14,473
Conrad.

98
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,730
He simply wasn't prepared
to take the next step.

99
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:20,752
Are we?

100
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:23,982
Thanks to a little
incident at the bakery...

101
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,283
I did that.

102
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:26,783
We're fully prepared, yes.

103
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,430
But  we don't have a plant. What do
you mean "He simply wasn't prepared"?

104
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,553
We don't need his plant, we'll
get a new one at the Mohasky Cup.

105
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:34,120
You got us in?

106
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:36,513
They hold that in a
super secret location.

107
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:37,861
I'm  just that good.

108
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,162
It's the promised land of pot.

109
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,030
The Makkah of marijuana.

110
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:43,862
The cathedral of cannabis.

111
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,183
The kingdom of kush.

112
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:48,313
The temple of tea.

113
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,182
In show off, man!

114
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,743
I'm just that good.

115
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,702
There are growers and venders
and clones all over the place.

116
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:55,982
I'll take Doug and Andy.

117
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,401
We'll pick the best one,
we'll start a harvest.

118
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:00,563
Just like that?

119
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,772
If everyone does his job, yes.

120
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,473
Dean, you need to find a grow house.

121
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:08,902
Sanjay, you can start
researching hydroponics.

122
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,773
And you, I need you to get equipement.

123
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,582
Grow lights and fans and all that.

124
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,023
We don't need Conrad or his plant.

125
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:21,733
We can have our own strain growing...

126
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:22,753
next week.

127
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,853
This would be a whole lot
easier if we had the black dude.

128
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:27,473
Yes, well, we don't so...

129
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:29,231
let's move on.

130
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,392
Next!

131
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:37,101
So I wanna grow hydroponic
homemade organic lettuces.

132
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:39,030
Come on, Conrad. Cut the shit, bro.

133
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:39,742
Lettuce?

134
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:43,312
Lettuce. You see what ** been charging for *** shit.

135
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,400
Tyrell, Tyrell. There's money
in there, I'm telling you.

136
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:48,773
Fine, that's how you wanna play?

137
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:52,390
I don't see how you could possibly
make enough to cover your expencies.

138
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,463
Much less make a profit
using this business model.

139
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,881
You ain't making lettuce
or fucking lettuce.

140
00:06:58,027 --> 00:07:00,653
You're funny right now. Is this
how you talk to all your customers?

141
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,683
I do when I shared a bunk bed
with them at the YMCA care.

142
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,411
And even if we didn't go way back, bro,

143
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,983
any loan officer is gonna know,

144
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,937
you wanna grow some booyah.

145
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:10,132
Can you hold it down?

146
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:11,865
Hey, Jim! I got your e-mail.

147
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:14,700
I'll have those loan estimates
to you by 3 pm, buddy.

148
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,211
Hey, Jim, what do you say
we get together after work

149
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,113
*** hockey game, dude. Yeah!

150
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:24,833
Look, brother, I'm just
doing what I need to be doing.

151
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,583
And I'm not gonna risk my job
just to give you a grow loan.

152
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:31,803
Even if you did keep Antoine Griffin from
kicking the shit out of me after campfire.

153
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,550
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

154
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,860
I'm sorry about the loan.

155
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,881
Hey, about a free calendar?

156
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,710
I don't know no... Can
I just get my plan, dog?

157
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,750
Hey, beautiful.

158
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,020
Princeton?

159
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,153
What happened to UCLA?

160
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,542
I got into Princeton.
It's an Ivy League school.

161
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:03,612
But you said you would
go to UCLA and then

162
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:07,100
next year I would go to Northridge
and we would get an apartment together.

163
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,773
You don't get it. This is Princeton.

164
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:15,050
Well, I can't get into
Princeton. I'm not deaf.

165
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,233
Did you just said what
I think you've said?

166
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:24,132
I got into Princeton because
I'm smart and I work hard.

167
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,740
Yeah, well, I'm sure
being deaf didn't hurt.

168
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:41,160
So gozer in Hebrew means a
surgeon who performs circumcism.

169
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:43,371
And my bar mitzvah
seems like GhostBusters

170
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,993
featuring as we all know Gozer the Gozerian.

171
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,502
Coincidence? I don't think so.

172
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,293
Megan!

173
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,951
I don't think she heard you. Megan. Megan!

174
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,821
She's not listening to me either. Are you listening to me?

175
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:54,830
I'm listening.

176
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,011
Your judaism is like Ghostbusters.

177
00:08:58,157 --> 00:08:59,731
It's totally dumb, right?

178
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,260
I'm  going to Iraq.

179
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:02,343
I'm gonna die.

180
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:05,423
I like the part where the Hebrew school
bully locked you in the girls bathroom.

181
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,230
Chepsi Aras.

182
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,461
It was so fucked up.

183
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:10,053
Kids are supposed to get beat
up in the way to Hebrew school.

184
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:11,051
Not in it.

185
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,943
Are you gonna be ready
when Doug gets here?

186
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,100
Yeah.

187
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:20,663
Hey, Nanc', what's the real
story with you and Conrad?

188
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:23,623
There's no story, he just decided
to go in a different direction.

189
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,003
I think you're full of shit.

190
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,382
I think you're not
telling me something.

191
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:28,451
I don't give a flying
fuck what you think.

192
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,280
Celia.

193
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:34,573
Here, Nancy. Sign.

194
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:37,250
I'm dying of thirst.
Do you have a diet Coke?

195
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,740
Never should have worn
these fucking heels.

196
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:41,181
Didn't sleep a whole night.

197
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,441
The neighbors have this
new fucking yappy dog.

198
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:45,813
I wanna drop kick the thing.

199
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:50,180
Hello, freeloading brother-in-law.

200
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,500
You're not Doug.

201
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:56,230
I'm thinking that should
be my campaign slogan.

202
00:09:58,026 --> 00:09:59,240
It's broken.

203
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:01,000
It is? Since when?

204
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,961
I don't know, I called the man.

205
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,623
There are corn sodas in the vegetable door.

206
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,741
That's where they are?
Why would you hide them?

207
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:09,900
I don't hide. I like them crispy.

208
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,462
And you drink too muck caffeine.

209
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,662
I'm sorry about your car.

210
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,240
Do you know who hit me?

211
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,140
Is she one of your maid
friends? What's her name?

212
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,023
Oh, I don't know, we just
call each other maid friend.

213
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:23,303
I go call the ice man now.

214
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:29,491
So, Nancy, I have covered from
Rancho Flora to Rancho Carnay.

215
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,571
So, if you could hit the Hill streets.

216
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:35,272
You know Hill Dale, Hill Bason,
all the way down to Hill Hurst.

217
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,043
I think we're gonna be good.

218
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,032
Did we have a plan?

219
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,630
What do you mean? I sent you an e-mail.

220
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:44,380
I sent you a whole schedule here.

221
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:48,442
Well, anyway, today, we're
canvassing for signatures.

222
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:50,892
I  need like a 100 to be eligible.

223
00:10:50,988 --> 00:10:52,540
Then I thought we'd have
a brainstorming session.

224
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,493
- I could make marguaritas.
- I'm busy today, Celia.

225
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,111
Doing what?

226
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,130
I mean I know you're not going to work.

227
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,820
So you have no excuse.

228
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:07,721
Who's ready to Mohasky?

229
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,451
Oh...

230
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,053
Who let in cancer cunt?

231
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,581
It's cancer tits, Doug.

232
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,941
No wonder your wife
prefers to fuck a pole.

233
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,153
My wife is fucking a Polish guy?

234
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:22,670
I think she's talking about
Dana's stripper class, Doug.

235
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,222
Oh,  the actual pole.

236
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,303
I get it now.

237
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,220
That's funny.

238
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:31,913
But seriously I hate you and
I hope you get hit by a truck.

239
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:35,572
- Why are you here?
- Nancy and I are gathering signatures.

240
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,650
I'm not really free today, Celia.

241
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:42,140
You know what? I know I can kick
your sorry ass. Give me that.

242
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:44,890
Let me show you who the bigger man is.

243
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:47,290
Don't tell me that
you're working for Doug?

244
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,603
I'm not working for anybody,
you're both my friends.

245
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:51,032
You promised!

246
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,201
I didn't promise anything.

247
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:55,133
I'm not gonna get in
the middle of this.

248
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,370
We gotta get going, Nancy.

249
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,332
But where are you going with him?

250
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,802
Small business expo.

251
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,800
I need to find some work.

252
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:06,460
This doesn't have anything to
do with the campaign or anything.

253
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:10,032
Okay, Celia? Please, understand.

254
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,033
So you're really not
gonna help me with this?

255
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:14,101
- I just can't.
- I know.

256
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,891
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

257
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,500
Andy, come meet us in the car.

258
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,420
Here you go.

259
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,283
Good luck!

260
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,461
Mr. Fuckyouson. 110, Eatshit Lane.

261
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:29,110
Oh, that's lovely. That's just lovely.

262
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,093
Hey, Nancy!

263
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:40,973
So glad you could make it!

264
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,993
- Douglas!
- Hey!

265
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:46,500
You're here as an official taster?

266
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:48,862
Me and Andy, we're the
lungs of the operation.

267
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:50,232
Thanks so much for getting us in.

268
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:53,670
You end up with some great
strain, you will return the favor.

269
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,512
Remember, it's all about relationships.

270
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:56,070
Totally.

271
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:58,640
Come on, you guys, let me show
you around. Bring the lungs.

272
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:10,843
Check it out, dudes.

273
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,902
I've died and gone to heaven.

274
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:27,263
I am so happy.

275
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,442
I'm in way over my head.

276
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,342
Just relax, I'll walk you through it.

277
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,983
Thanks, I appreciate it.

278
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,172
No problem, I'll catch you later.

279
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:36,301
Me too.

280
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:55,130
The trichomes on this baby are
so fat and lustrous they sparkle.

281
00:13:55,486 --> 00:14:00,433
This has the musky botanical
smell of hay and autumn leaves.

282
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:01,510
This is the one.

283
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:02,670
This is the one.

284
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:05,861
We're talking yield up to
430 grams per square meter.

285
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,501
We're hawking Sativa
with Afghani Indica.

286
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,743
That last one... bullshit!

287
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:12,933
This is the one.

288
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:16,580
California strain with
White Rhino backcrossed.

289
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,850
This is so the one.

290
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:21,462
Ultimate body high with
giggles and munchies.

291
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,340
Oh, this is the one.

292
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:26,741
I'm glad that our last name isn't Drew

293
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:29,890
'cause you'd be Nancy Drew
and I'd be Andrew Drew.

294
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,411
When did CPR become necrophilia?

295
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,413
Sweet and peppery.

296
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,660
Psycho-active with clarity.

297
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,321
45 kg per plant.

298
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,280
Korea.

299
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:44,513
Jamaica.

300
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,121
Swaziland.

301
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,292
This is just some great shit.

302
00:14:57,927 --> 00:15:00,540
You're gonna be selling
this shit inside of 3 months.

303
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,873
The high is cerebral and clear

304
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,860
but it's relaxant and
social at the same time.

305
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:09,642
It's got this piny earthy scent
like aroma therapy shit going on.

306
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,813
It is a Sativa Indica blend F1

307
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:14,300
but I've taken this mix
up to a F6 on a small scale

308
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:18,183
and I've stabilized the genetics
for seeing sales in the future.

309
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:19,272
I'm thinking ahead, you understand me?

310
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,540
This bitch right here
grow in a sealed green.

311
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:24,502
And ripen real fast
after fourth flower...

312
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:25,781
That's a beautiful plant, man.

313
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:26,720
I'm saying.

314
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:28,212
This is some beautiful shit.

315
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:31,573
I'm so proud of you, man.

316
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:35,631
I remember when you was just this
little stony kid limping behind Heylia.

317
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:37,660
Look at you now! You got your own strain.

318
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,110
What do you call that?

319
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,343
Shit, nigger, you lend me this
money, I'll call it "I like Mike".

320
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,022
'Cause my name is Mike!

321
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,672
I got you, that's beautiful.

322
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,010
So we can do business?

323
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:49,882
No.

324
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:52,343
How you gonna say no, dog?

325
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:53,213
No, man.

326
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,411
I'd love to get you some
seed money but you got...

327
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:57,933
you got some family shit, man.

328
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:00,571
And I can't get in no family
shit, not with Heylia James.

329
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,882
Dude, Heylia ain't got to know
nothing about what we doing.

330
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:05,060
Oh, man, we're in a small town.

331
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,902
We're in an even smaller business.

332
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,412
And if there's one thing we
all know about your aunty,

333
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:12,023
she's up in everybody's everything.

334
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,333
If she don't want you to grow, man,

335
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,880
she probably got her reasons.
Look, man, go talk to her.

336
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,420
Right?

337
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,612
Extend the peace pipe.

338
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,331
Get it? Peace pipe.

339
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,932
Yeah, I get it.

340
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:29,993
Andy!

341
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:33,911
Shh! I'm on a roll. Oh
God! This is so good.

342
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,152
This is so good, Nancy.

343
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:40,220
- What are you writing?
- My essay.

344
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:43,353
Why are you writing
in the girls' bathroom?

345
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,172
Men's room smells like pee.

346
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,043
What?

347
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:55,220
Oh, Andy. You're
right. This is the one!

348
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:58,091
I know, man, this is so the one.

349
00:16:58,195 --> 00:16:59,452
What is it?

350
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,061
Booth 3, jar 6.

351
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:04,653
You gotta buy this,
Nancy. We'll rebrand it.

352
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,182
Call it Holy shit!

353
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,051
Holy shit, yes.

354
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,612
Shh! It's all flowing.

355
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,902
Is this your version of the Torah?

356
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:22,410
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you could say that.

357
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,492
I found it very moving

358
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,213
and thoughtful.

359
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,291
I'm surprised.

360
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,453
Well, I have many layers.

361
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:33,832
I'm like lasagna.

362
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:36,013
Maybe you should never speak

363
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,531
but only write.

364
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,603
You make me nervous.

365
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:42,481
Are  you letting me in?

366
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:43,941
Provisionally.

367
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:53,463
Alright! Alright! Guess who
got into rabbinical school?

368
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:56,133
It's great! Everybody's
getting into their dream school.

369
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,183
Congratulations!

370
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,612
Hey! What's up with you?

371
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:00,733
Nothing.

372
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,661
Come on, come on. Is it a girl thing?

373
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,253
I'm the expert, I saw up the
director of admissions skirt today.

374
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,712
Tell me what's up.

375
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,743
Megan got into Princeton.

376
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:12,130
Oh yeah? Good for her!

377
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,851
It's in New Jersey.

378
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,542
So go in New Jersey.

379
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,641
Just get a van and go, man.

380
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,513
I spent 4 years at Harvard

381
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:23,682
sitting in on classes, fucking
smart chicks, it was awesome.

382
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:25,701
Didn't cost me a dime.

383
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:29,610
I graduated at Magna Cum Loudly.

384
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:33,063
- Does it have to be a van?
- It has to be a van.

385
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:39,101
Come on, Isabel. We're losing the light.

386
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,053
Coming!

387
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,663
Oh, God!

388
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:49,763
- Who are you? Willy Nelson?
- I wanna wear this.

389
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:53,200
- What happened to the dress?
- I still have red on.

390
00:18:54,375 --> 00:19:00,493
This picture is to make me look like
a warm and maternal public figure,

391
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:03,883
not the goddamn poster
parent for PFLAG.

392
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:04,990
Forget it!

393
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,333
I'm not playing dress-up for
your stupid little picture.

394
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,212
No, no, you march back into that house

395
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:10,980
and put on the goddamn pretty dress.

396
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:11,612
No!

397
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,300
It's all a lie.

398
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,020
Dick Cheney has a lesbian daughter.

399
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,980
Yeah, and she's not in
any of the pictures either.

400
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,483
That's politics, honey.

401
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:22,983
And I didn't shoot anybody in the
face, so stop making comparisons.

402
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,303
I'm out of here.

403
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:28,072
Okay.

404
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:33,100
Alright, photographer,
let's go. It's just me.

405
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:42,971
That fucking yappy rat dog!

406
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,721
Come on, baby.

407
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,123
Don't you die on me.

408
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:57,893
Hey, mom, I just wanna let you know

409
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:01,013
next year I'm dropping out of
school and moving in New Jersey.

410
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,701
Okay.

411
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,053
..sales in the future.

412
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,292
This motherfucker right here will grow

413
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:19,851
in a sealed green,
I'm not playing, dude.

414
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,150
You know it will ripen real
fast after fourth flower...

415
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,830
Hey! Will you niggers shut the fuck up!

416
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,963
Man over here trying to talk.

417
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,411
You want a piece of avocado?

418
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,210
Got that good fat.

419
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:33,922
No, I'm good but thanks, man.

420
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,763
Anyway, all you gotta do...

421
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,123
Yeah, man, I heard enough. I'll do it.

422
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:42,001
Look, I gotta let you know that
Heylia ain't on board with this.

423
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,433
Yeah, I ain't afraid of Heylia.

424
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:46,290
I ain't scared of no bitch.
This about money, so...

425
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:53,343
I thought I told you all
niggers to shut the fuck up.

426
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:55,890
I don't like having to repeat myself.

427
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:59,392
Now, take Jacob into the
other room and clean him up.

428
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,080
And if you don't bring
my knife back clean,

429
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:03,330
I'm stabbing all of you
niggers through the heart.

430
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,221
You hear me? You understand?

431
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,851
Anyway, so just so we're clear,

432
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:11,051
you work for me.

433
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:14,861
That mean my money, my
operation, 60/40 my way.

434
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:17,690
You know what? Let me think about it.

435
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:20,002
Hey, this is some shit.

436
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:22,151
Stupid ass bitch don't know
how to take what's offered.

437
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,660
U-Turn, come on, man, we go
a little too far back to...

438
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,030
Yeah, man, I'm not talking to you,

439
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,141
I'm talking about this
stupid ass bitch on TV.

440
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,333
Anyway, go ahead, Conrad.

441
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:32,251
You know, do whatever
you gotta do, man.

442
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,812
You change your mind,
you know where I'm at.

443
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:48,690
I couldn't find a
house. Market's crazy.

444
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:53,230
The hydroponic seminar was
booked 3 months in advance.

445
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:54,831
How's our plant?

446
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:57,910
I think I killed it.

447
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:00,993
I have some good news.

448
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:03,500
You got us equipment?

449
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:05,293
No.

450
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:07,573
But I'm going to the show.

451
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,122
I got called up by the *** Toronto in the morning.

452
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:13,122
- Hey! Congratulations, man!
- Thanks, man.

453
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,571
Your cup of coffee, partner.

454
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:23,143
Oh, I fucking hate chains!

455
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:25,150
So I'm gonna buy a van.

456
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:27,482
And we can get an apartment
off campus together.

457
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:32,873
You can't miss senior year.

458
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:37,222
Yes, I can. I'll take
the GED, I don't care.

459
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:39,230
I just wanna be with you.

460
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,470
You'll have nothing to do.

461
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,583
I'll get a job. I'll
go to junior college.

462
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:46,033
New Jersey must be
full of crappy schools.

463
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,062
I love you.

464
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,663
No.

465
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,301
Oh, check me out.
Making fresh bruschetta.

466
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,550
I think it's pronounced bruscetta.

467
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:09,572
Now what the fuck you know.

468
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:13,522
The Italian guy on Iron
Chef said bruschetta.

469
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,413
You know you're gonna
have to stop saying fuck

470
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,090
around the baby so much.

471
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,680
And you're gonna have to stop
cooking with so much garlic.

472
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:21,543
- 'Cause it gives them gas.
- "You have to do this for me."

473
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:25,503
Well, if you don't like it,
you don't have to hear it.

474
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,363
- But I will watch my mouth.
- "Please talk to me."

475
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:30,170
I don't want my grandbaby first
words being something nasty.

476
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:30,902
"I just need a few minutes."

477
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,802
You want some bruschetta, Conrad?

478
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:37,421
Oh, no. No thanks, I gotta run.

479
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,061
Where the fuck he going?

480
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:47,912
I mean "hell". Where the hell he going?

481
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:49,631
Like you don't know.

482
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,300
You know he's looking for financing.

483
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:53,100
Well, he'll give up soon enough.

484
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:55,931
Ain't nobody around here gonna
back him while I'm around.

485
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,622
Damn, you're cold!

486
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:02,180
I'm not. Doing from
love. Boy ain't ready.

487
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:04,922
Still makes too many stupid decisions.

488
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,551
So you call my ass up 7000 times to
show me the Charlie Brown Christmas tree?

489
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:21,280
- I shouldn't even be here.
- Yes, you should.

490
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:25,330
Please, Conrad. I can't
do this without you.

491
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,720
No shit! That don't change things.

492
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:30,940
Conrad, I swear: he never knew a thing.

493
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:33,061
And I stopped seeing
him. We haven't spoken

494
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:35,290
in over a week.

495
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:39,522
I swear on my children. He had no idea.

496
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:41,122
And now he's out of my life.

497
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,700
And I have a dead plant.

498
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:49,343
And a check for $80,000 and
I'm surrounded by idiots.

499
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:51,890
Where the hell did you
get that kind of money?

500
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:54,450
Sanjay burned the bakery down.

501
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:58,820
Alright.

502
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:06,741
You know, my plant is so
much finer than this one.

503
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:09,382
I know your plant is fantastic.

504
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,740
Unbelievable trichomes.

505
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:14,233
So now you're showing off?

506
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,192
I'm just getting started.

507
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:21,190
So your kid just bit his kid's foot?

508
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:25,161
At a karate match. Totally
random like a sick cosmic joke.

509
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,622
Ever asked what you do?

510
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:30,523
Sure he did and he saw: I ran a bakery.

511
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,142
And when I asked about his work,

512
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:35,032
he came right out and told
me. No weirdness or anything.

513
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:38,011
So how did you break it off?

514
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:38,881
Clean.

515
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:45,620
I told him his work was too
dangerous. I couldn't lose another man.

516
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,630
He understood.

517
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,431
That's pretty good.

518
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:57,983
Conrad...

519
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:02,011
We're a great team.

520
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:05,780
Please, please, trust me.

521
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,613
It's all gonna work out.

522
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,140
Let's do this.

523
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:20,292
Shit!

524
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:25,563
Here we go.

525
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:39,153
I'll get napkins for everybody.

526
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:41,201
Thank you, honey. That's so great.

527
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,461
Icemaker is still broken.

528
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,361
Lupita!

529
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,953
He say he coming, I
don't control the man.

530
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:52,231
We need to talk about that little
bombshell you dropped on me.

531
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,532
- You're not quitting high school.
- I know.

532
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:56,631
Plan's off. Can we
just forget about it?

533
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:58,263
Plan's off? What happened?

534
00:26:58,376 --> 00:26:59,850
Did you have something to do with this?

535
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:01,772
What? No! What are you talking about?

536
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:03,273
- What happened?
- Nothing.

537
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:07,543
Megan and I broke up, okay?
Can we change the subject?

538
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:09,071
We could talk about bird flu.

539
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,040
It's gonna kill everybody.

540
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,581
Let's not talk about
bird flu, sweetheart.

541
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:14,653
Swan flu?

542
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,181
Are you saying there's
flu in these spare ribs?

543
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:18,372
Beef ribs, baby.

544
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:20,861
This Jew boy is off
the other white meat.

545
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,881
- Hello.
- Hey, Nancy.

546
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:25,182
Peter.

547
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:27,933
I'm outside your house
right now and I'm not leaving

548
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:29,931
until I speak to you in person.

549
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:34,082
I'm getting out of the car
and walking to your door.

550
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,903
No, no, just... I'm coming out there.

551
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:38,492
Stay in your car. I'm coming.

552
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,991
There's this kid at my school
who always picks his nose

553
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,940
and he says that if you
don't pick your nose,

554
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:46,033
that your buggers could
back up and block your airway

555
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:48,062
and you could die.

556
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,101
I'll be right back.

557
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:53,123
I can see how that would be true.

558
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:01,181
Peter, I asked not to call me,

559
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:04,450
let alone drive to my house
and I think I was really clear.

560
00:28:04,577 --> 00:28:08,111
I can't see you and I don't
know what you're doing here.

561
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:10,882
When I told you, this isn't
gonna work, I meant it.

562
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:13,971
And I didn't say it lightly
'cause I really do like you.

563
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:16,812
But I can't and I'm not
gonna change my mind.

564
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:20,062
And I'm really kind of
upset to see you here

565
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,582
because it hasn't been easy for me.

566
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:24,722
And frankly I think it shows
a lack of respect on your part

567
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:26,903
'cause I asked you to
stay away and you didn't.

568
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:30,391
So I'm gonna say it one last
time and I hope that you hear me:

569
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,663
please go away

570
00:28:32,986 --> 00:28:36,842
and don't ever call
me or contact me again

571
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:38,223
because

572
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,901
we will never be.

573
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,423
I know you're a drug dealer.

574
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:27,423
