1
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:58,144
This is the magic potion,
boys and girl.

2
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:00,956
Advanced nutrients.

3
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,443
More bud, less stem.

4
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:05,978
And away we grow.

5
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:40,202
- What's up, man?
- I'm good, man.

6
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:43,821
Hey, man. You bring me
the tall creamy present?

7
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,436
Dude, the cream pot got
2 kids and a new husband.

8
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:49,831
I brought you something
better, check this out.

9
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,887
Excuse me. My name is
Vernan and I'm a scorpio.

10
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:54,422
Lacey, me too.

11
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,729
I'd like to get you high.

12
00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:57,463
All right.

13
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,133
Because Conrad and I have
come up with a new strain.

14
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:01,443
We're really proud of it.

15
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:04,773
Actually I'd like a snack of
that *** if you don't mind.

16
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,182
See, it's not that I don't trust you,

17
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,673
it's just that I don't trust Conrad.

18
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,390
Now you're trying to
hurt my feelings, Vernan.

19
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,022
Only she can call me Vernan,
you call me sir.

20
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:14,993
You got a bong up in here, man?

21
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,653
Load it up! Load it up!

22
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,173
That's you. You lit.

23
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,283
All right, let's see what you got.

24
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:30,390
What do you think, Vernan?

25
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,160
Are you responsible for this?

26
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,891
Yeah. Us. Conrad mostly.

27
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:38,033
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's smokalicious.

28
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:40,091
What up, my nig'? What you do, nephew?

29
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:41,193
Hey man, check this out.

30
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,443
My man Conrad pimped
us some new product.

31
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,131
Fantizzletastic!

32
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:46,410
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,532
Hey, look here.

34
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:49,833
I wanna introduce you
to the lovely Lacey.

35
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,653
His partner in crime
and a very married MILF and

36
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,200
that's just breaking my heart.

37
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:55,903
Is that right?

38
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,323
- I'd definitely do you.
- Gee, thanks.

39
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,331
My name is Snoop Dogg by the way.

40
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,450
Lacey, hi.

41
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,233
That's the motherfucking MILF weed.

42
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:05,963
You know what the MILF
weed is, right my nigga?

43
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:09,253
Mother I'd Love To Fuck.

44
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,023
That's MILF weed.

45
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,793
Make a nigga take a toke,
it's the MILF weed.

46
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,512
Make a nigga have a smoke,
it's the MILF weed.

47
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,140
Let's take that in some hoop and
put it down, you know what I'm saying?

48
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,121
Let's go do it.

49
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:23,461
I want you to pump the music up while I talk about this good weed I just bought.

50
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,792
It's called the MILF weed.

51
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,003
It's the good mommy smoking,
it's the MILF weed.

52
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:29,393
Take a toke 'til you're broke,
it's the MILF weed.

53
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,690
Nigga just can't quit,
it's the MILF weed.

54
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,192
Nigga, can I get another hit?

55
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:35,673
It's grown and it's green
like the Hulk when he angry.

56
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:38,161
Break it up, break it up,
smoke it up, tangy,

57
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:40,490
tasty, the way you feel,
the way that it smells.

58
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,790
The way it make a
nigga feel oh so well.

59
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,462
I'ma tell it to you
so you need to know.

60
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,852
We're smoking MILF weed
everyday on the roll.

61
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:50,392
We get it crack-a-lackin'
everytime you see me, doh.

62
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,833
It's Snoop D O double G,

63
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,080
We got the MILF 'cause the
MILF got it all the time.

00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,610
Got weed that keep making
nigga blow his mind.

65
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,913
It's the weed that
feel good, smell good.

66
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,380
It's the weed that you
can't get in the hood.

67
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,871
You gotta have the connect on the set.

68
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,271
Let me get some of that
shit, make it fast, jet.

69
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,662
Give it to me quick,
give it to me fast.

70
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:12,320
I wanna tap you on your white ass.

71
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,663
'Cause you the Mother
That I'd Love to Fuck.

72
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:15,770
Doing good, kids.

73
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:17,731
Maybe you come by tomorrow,

74
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,513
bring us some little
more love, say uh...

75
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:21,902
2 or 3 of those happy packs.

76
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,010
Absolutely...

77
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:25,893
Vern'.

78
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,431
Get the hell out of here, man.

79
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,351
It's a place of business
and I got work to do.

80
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:30,570
You're a bad influence.

81
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:31,592
Oh,  oh, oh.

82
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,371
It was nice meeting you, Lacey.

83
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:34,491
Pleasure, Vernan.

84
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,182
MILF weed? MILF weed!

85
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,353
This shit is about to get wild!

86
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,891
Fantastic!

87
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,290
Really? Let's go make some money!

88
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,190
You got any wig?

89
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,443
Nope, it's mine.

90
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:52,422
Sort of.

91
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:56,753
I'm wearing 500 bucks worth of
human hair extensions from India.

92
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,063
Take a sniff.

93
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,871
There's a faint curry smell to it.

94
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,580
I'm giving and anti-drug
speech at the Grammar school.

95
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,312
And I need you

96
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,312
to be Sober.

97
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:10,241
What?

98
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:11,971
Sober, the sasquatch.

99
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,750
He tells kids to stay off the drugs.

100
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,903
And you think kids are gonna
listen because some idiot's

101
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,072
dressed in a gorilla suit?

102
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:20,032
No, it's sasquatch.

103
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,981
Children love and fear him.

104
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,240
That's ***

105
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,452
Come on, Dean, you're perfect for it.

106
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,320
And if I stop shaving your back,

107
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:30,480
you won't even have to wear the suit.

108
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,532
And now I walk away.

109
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:33,933
Hey, but good luck with that speech

110
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,182
because kids just love being
patronized and lectured.

111
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,900
I hear you wanna close the park!

112
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,910
Where am I supposed to take my babies?

113
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:44,610
What?

114
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:47,141
Where are my babies supposed to play?

115
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:50,852
- Oh, you mean your dogs.
- They're my children.

116
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,733
They need their park.

117
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:56,050
No, real children need their park.

118
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:59,902
Dogs need to take a walk, do
their business and then go home.

119
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:03,100
But the dog park is gated off. The dogs don't bother anyone.

120
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,490
That whole place stinks to high heaven.

121
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,913
It's an eyesore from all
the grass that's been dug up.

122
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:11,303
There's barking and snarling
going on all day long.

123
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,120
And at night when the
dogs finally leave,

124
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:15,891
it's filled with teenagers

125
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:17,820
doing drugs.

126
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:20,260
It is a blight on this community.

127
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:21,923
And  it's going.

128
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,282
Do you know what you are?

129
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,390
You  are a hater.

130
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:27,071
You're filled with hate.

131
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:28,760
And you spread it around

132
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,532
- at dogs, at teenagers...
- And you.

133
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:35,913
Because you call your
pets children, so goodbye.

134
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,703
- Hey there!
- Hey!

135
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:48,673
I'm here. I'm right here.

136
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,180
Sanjay...

137
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,652
Wow!

138
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,861
We doing a little bonus.

139
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,441
For the arson. Not to be
taken as encouragement.

140
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:00,271
- Fine.
- Never again. Okay?

141
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,063
Okay.

142
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:04,171
- Dean.
- Nice.

143
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:07,151
No IRS and no Celia.

144
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,599
People seem to like what we're selling.

145
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,273
- Doug.
- Sweet.

146
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,763
First time somebody's paid me for weed.

147
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,182
Buy a motorcycle,
we could ride together.

148
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,032
You're dead to me.

149
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,461
- I'm out of here. Make sure the...
- Excuse me!

150
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:21,713
What?

151
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,660
- You forgot something.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,962
Yeah, you did. My enveloppe.

153
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,730
You don't get one.

154
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,403
I don't...

155
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:34,570
Wait a second, I don't get paid.

156
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:38,053
Once you reemburce me
for room and board

157
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:41,961
and for a non-refundable
year of rabbinical school

158
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,542
and for the time I bailed
you out when you got busted,

159
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:45,852
not to mention lawyers fees,

160
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:48,573
then you'll be compensated, yeah.

161
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:53,241
Are you joking? I lost toes...

162
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,921
for you.

163
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,183
I was in a raid.

164
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:58,522
I sat in my own pee to save the mother.

165
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:00,732
Back me up here, guys!

166
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:13,061
I'm a contributing member of this team.

167
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:15,531
I cook!

168
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:20,080
Is that how it is?

169
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,152
All right, that's fine.

170
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:24,651
Well, I quit.

171
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:34,760
Cook like a fucking crackhead.

172
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:39,090
Settle, boys and girls, let's all

173
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,201
put on our listening
ears and settle down.

174
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,223
That's better.

175
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:45,511
Now, I'd like to welcome today special guest speaker,

176
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:47,152
councilwoman Hodes.

177
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:54,651
Well, hello, junior citizens of Agrestic.

178
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,320
I am councilwoman Hodes.

179
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:01,933
And I am here today at our
top ranked Grammar school...

180
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,943
to make a very special announcement.

181
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,291
Beginning next week,

182
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,880
all of Agrestic

183
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,310
will become a drug free zone.

184
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:20,921
Okay...

185
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,870
You know how penguins

186
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:28,910
march 70 miles to get
where they're going.

187
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:33,232
Well, drugs are like penguins.

188
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,532
They march from the ghetto

189
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,273
to the suburbs.

190
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:39,560
Now to end this migration,

191
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,333
I will be installing
surveillance cameras

192
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:44,670
and drug free zone signs

193
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,023
throughout Agrestic.

194
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,601
I invite you to bring your parents to the

195
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:52,191
unveiling of our 1st
surveillance camera

196
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,521
tomorrow at the corner of
Hillside and Harper Drives,

197
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:58,741
right accross from what will
soon no longer be the dog park.

198
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,012
4 pm.

199
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,032
And now

200
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:04,041
I would like to introduce
a very special guest

201
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,663
who has an important
message for you all.

202
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:10,653
Sober the sasquatch.

203
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,341
Drugs are wrong!

204
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:25,792
I'm putting my big foot down on drugs!

205
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,172
My big foot!

206
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:30,702
This is not a game, people.

207
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:34,192
Yes, Shane.

208
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:36,631
Point of order: why cameras?

209
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,772
Good question. Because

210
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:43,713
people behave better when they
know they're being watched.

211
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,403
What about our rights to privacy ?

212
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,481
There are more important
things than rights to privacy.

213
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:55,772
I think you're turning
Agrestic into a policed state!

214
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:58,753
Yeah!

215
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,512
Drugs are wrong!

216
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,370
I've seen you drunk at my house.

217
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:13,043
I beg your pardon.

218
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:15,621
Not like the drunken
homeless penguins in the ghetto

219
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,440
but I've definitely seen you drunk.

220
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,313
Well, that's quite enough,
Shane, you can sit down.

221
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:21,470
Isn't being drunk
just like being on drugs?

222
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,060
Isn't alcohol a drug?

223
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,721
You do drugs.

224
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,111
You do.

225
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,701
You do drugs.

226
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:30,661
Drugs are wrong!

227
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:34,190
You do drugs! You do drugs!

228
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:37,482
The councilwoman also likes
her speed and Ambien.

229
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,002
Christ! Let's go!

230
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,661
My sweat smells like peanuts!

231
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,871
You kicked ass!

232
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,320
You took Hodes out.

233
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,911
Props to you, yo!

234
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:10,643
That... was awesome, Shane!

235
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,132
Are you guys...

236
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,300
Shut up!

237
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:17,843
No  way!

238
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,130
Can I see that one, please?

239
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,370
Yeah, that's the Diamond Blossom.

240
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,791
Yeah, the right hand diamond
is very popular these days.

241
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,332
All the stars are wearing it.

242
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:37,570
It's a symbol of independence
and personal reward.

243
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:40,533
Well, I deserve a reward.

244
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,312
I've done very well lately.

245
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,573
How well?

246
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:51,421
Okay, take off that piece of
shit, I've got jewelry to show you.

247
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,761
- Shane, what's wrong?
- You totalled my car.

248
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:25,511
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I didn't see it.

249
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:28,291
I'm not used to
driving this low to the ground.

250
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:30,442
Did tou total your car too?

251
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:31,471
What?

252
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:35,641
No. The lease was up. I just
bought this. Isn't it cute?

253
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,601
No, it's crappy and small.

254
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:40,620
It's environmentally responsible.

255
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:41,920
I liked the Range Rover.

256
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,113
The Range Rover was obnoxious.

257
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,981
There's global warming unless
you want the planet to disolve

258
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:52,191
to one big ocean.

259
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,292
Global warming is just God's will.

260
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:56,830
I liked the Range Rover, this car is gay.

261
00:13:57,116 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't be ignorant just
because it's in right now.

262
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,131
Figure out the planet for a change.

263
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:04,153
What is all this stuff?

264
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,282
Mommy decided to buy
herself a few things.

265
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,292
A lot of things.

266
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:12,210
Yes, a lot of things, I worked
hard, I deserve them.

267
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,320
What work?

268
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,930
I run a family.

269
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:22,882
- You buy me anything?
- No.

270
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,462
Do you really think you deserve
anything after what you did today?

271
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,660
- What did I do?
- You called Celia Hodes a drunk.

272
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:33,210
Another call from my dear
old friend, principal Dodge.

273
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:35,930
I  think I'm on his speed dial.

274
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:38,773
I was making a point.

275
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:41,073
She's trying to make
Agrestic a drug free zone

276
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,980
but I think drugs should be legal.

277
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:46,953
Why?

278
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:49,421
Because...

279
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,841
so...

280
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:55,012
no one gets in trouble.

281
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,503
Nobody is gonna get in trouble. Okay?

282
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,151
Go buy yourself a new car.

283
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:10,181
Awesome.

284
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:13,892
Help me get these bags in the house
and then we can go to the movies.

285
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,031
Really? What movie?

286
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:22,272
How about the Al Gore one about
the total destruction of the planet

287
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:25,881
and the coming
environmental apocalypse?

288
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,472
Cool.

289
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,761
Where is my microwave popcorn?

290
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,291
Now I know I had one left in here.

291
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,103
Heylia, where are our customers?

292
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:39,250
Vernan, Kiki, Nancy,

293
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,032
that guy with the hair lip.

294
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,772
We ain't been moving shit.

295
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:44,502
And I hear there's a
new strain out there

296
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,661
that everybody wants and we ain't got.

297
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,291
Girl, it's the economy.

298
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:50,833
And the medical marijuana clubs.

299
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,030
You know I heard they opened up

300
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,232
one of them drivethroughs in the Valley.

301
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:56,733
No, Heylia.

302
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,463
Look around.

303
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,701
What's missing here?

304
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:06,153
Yo, make sure you get all
that ash off my heel too now.

305
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,612
Yo, this is here is Tanya.

306
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:09,402
Hi.

307
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:11,370
She's studying that cosmonology.

308
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,471
It's cosmetology.

309
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:16,702
Girl, I'll throw this beer on
you if you say something else.

310
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:18,951
So Louis, tell me about that new strain

311
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:20,683
everybody's been talking about.

312
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,800
I ain't Louis no more.

313
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:24,430
And I ain't telling you shit
unless you call me U-Turn.

314
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:26,490
Now Louis is a perfectly good name.

315
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,591
But if you wanna be some
traffic violation, fine by me.

316
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,982
U-Turn, why the fuck
ain't I got this new weed?

317
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:36,583
Now how is it that Mrs.
Heylia James don't know?

318
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:37,701
Look at you.

319
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:41,040
Getting soft in your old age or something?

320
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:45,081
You better mind yourself, Mr. U-Turn.

321
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:46,670
I've seen your gangsta ass

322
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,932
playing violin in
your grandmama's house

323
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:52,172
with a powder-blue blue
suit and wide ass lapels.

324
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:53,430
So stop crying.

325
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,331
Heylia, I don't forget
where I come from

326
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:56,730
but some people do.

327
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:57,853
Go on.

328
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,742
This strain is called MILF. MILF weed.

329
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,423
It's the brand of the day.

330
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,150
And everybody love that shit too.

331
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:07,570
And it's coming from?

332
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:08,621
Come on, man,

333
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,373
why do I gotta be the one
to tell you the way it is?

334
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:12,393
'Cause I started you

335
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,513
and I'll finish you.

336
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,821
And I need to hear it.

337
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,463
So speak the the fuck up.

338
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:18,372
Fine.

339
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,280
It's your boy Conrad.

340
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,150
Him and the white bitch.

341
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,311
They got themselves a real gang.

342
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:25,861
They're farmers now.

343
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,300
I gotta say, they're fucking great at it.

344
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:32,003
Just put your hands out,
send love vibrations to the plant.

345
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,432
That way the person that
smokes it will feel love too.

346
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:36,543
I think the person
that grew my last pot sent

347
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,982
"eat many donuts while
playing with your balls"

348
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,483
vibrations to the plant.

349
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,142
You ain't taking me serious.

350
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,641
Why give it away?

351
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,350
That's Sanjay?

352
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:56,311
I think it's a Jehovah's witness.

353
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,830
We're Shinto.

354
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:02,293
Excuse me. Hello? Hey! Hey! Hey!

355
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,910
It's cool. It's cool.

356
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,013
Heylia...

357
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:17,032
I came to you first,

358
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:18,550
you shut me down.

359
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,312
There ain't no excuses
for what you've done here.

360
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:27,963
I laid out my plans, you laughed at me.

361
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:31,093
We don't grow.

362
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,783
We deal.

363
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,373
That's  what we do.

364
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,503
That's what you do.

365
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:41,591
I'm a grown man Heylia and
you got to see me like that.

366
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:44,591
All I see

367
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,882
is what you went off
with one of my customers

368
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,883
and created a new game behind my back.

369
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,660
You lied to me.

370
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,180
You took business from me.

371
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:02,023
That ain't how a grown man acts.

372
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:06,651
Heylia, I can help you now.

373
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,382
You could retire early.

374
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,490
We could put money aside
for Levan's education.

375
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,642
No, no, no.

376
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,330
You a little piggy.

377
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,991
And what you built here,

378
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,683
it ain't right.

379
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,542
And some day, the big bad
wolf is gonna huff and puff

380
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:25,740
and blown your house down.

381
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:29,552
And when it happens, I don't
wanna be anywhere near you.

382
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,413
You ain't got no faith in your boy.

383
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,660
Didn't you just say he was a man?

384
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,673
See, you can't have it both ways.

385
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,510
You ain't welcome in my house no more.

386
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,743
Not you. Not Barbie.

387
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,180
I don't know you.

388
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,772
Now...

389
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,591
Give me 3 pounds of
that fucking MILF weed.

390
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:59,700
I've got business to take care of.

391
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:15,271
Why has it got to be like this, Heylia?

392
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:19,983
You wanted to be on your own,

393
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,130
you're on your own.

394
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,881
Who's this Barbie girl?

395
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:31,950
Is she hot?

396
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,752
If you will notice above me,

397
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,291
our very first camera.

398
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:43,912
And below it, our drug free zone sign.

399
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:45,743
We're letting these pushers know

400
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,131
that we are keeping an eye on them.

401
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:53,080
Agrestic is now officially
a drug free zone.

402
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,270
Douchebag!

403
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:56,460
What the fuck!

404
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,461
- Go home!
- You hate dogs!

405
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:02,383
Crazy dog freaks!

406
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,412
I am protecting the humans of Agrestic.

407
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,882
Now our cameras will be running 24/7.

408
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:13,032
Give us back our dog park!

409
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:17,000
Well, I can see all the
crazies are out today.

410
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:20,201
Is it true you have a drinking
problem, councilwoman Hodes?

411
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,480
Nancy has no idea who I am.

412
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:28,642
Sucks to never be
seen. Never appreciated.

413
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:32,112
Sucks when the pie gets
eaten right in front of you.

414
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,991
And you helped baked that pie.

415
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:35,303
What pie?

416
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:36,893
It's a metaphorical pie.

417
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,161
- Am I eating the pie?
- Sort of.

418
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,272
You're benefiting from
that pie. But really...

419
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,481
No, no pie for you
either, my young friend.

420
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:49,630
Where's our fucking pie! Life sucks.

421
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,743
Come on now. Life does not suck.

422
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:57,091
Unless you have no job, no girlfriend,

423
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,152
8 toes.

424
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,520
Life sucks.

425
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:03,631
Anyway, your mom knows nothing

426
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,641
about what it takes to be a crime lord.

427
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:08,411
I understand business. I am an entrepreneur.

428
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:10,293
I would be great at it.

429
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:14,563
I mean, I may not be some
brainiac but I know weed.

430
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:16,852
It's a family business for Christ sake!

431
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:18,493
I say forget her.

432
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,162
We start our own business.

433
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:24,432
Except we have no money.

434
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:26,611
Yeah.

435
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:31,030
Was she impressed? Could you tell?

436
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:32,341
What did she think of the place?

437
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:34,781
She never wants to see us
again, Nancy. She was stone cold.

438
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,372
Like acting cold because

439
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,713
she was secretly dazzled
by how well we've done.

440
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,442
What? You need Heylia's approval?

441
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:43,162
- She bought 3 pounds.
- Of the MILF?

442
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:45,361
You don't have to be so
proud of the name, okay?

443
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:46,101
Okay.

444
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:48,813
Why did she buy from us?

445
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:50,871
So that she can sell it to others.

446
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:52,601
That's what she does for a living.

447
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,620
All her customers are
asking for our shit.

448
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,403
You can't sell what you don't have.

449
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:57,372
It's kind of awesome.

450
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,232
- No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

451
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:01,911
She bought our stuff

452
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,300
and she'll buy more 'cause it's good.

453
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,373
She's not gonna stay mad.

454
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:10,320
- She can't.
- You do not know Heylia.

455
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,231
Hi, Shane.

456
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,480
I came to pick up your mom.

457
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:22,830
She's doing laundry with some black guy.

458
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:28,683
Would you tell her
that I'm here, please?

459
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:32,812
What's Conrad doing at your house?

460
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,351
Not a great idea by the way.

461
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,680
Just some old business with
Heylia he wanted to talk about.

462
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:40,012
Heylia James?

463
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:41,652
You're not gonna have
to worry about her.

464
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:42,353
What?

465
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,272
She's being taken care of.

466
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:45,812
No.

467
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,810
We don't need that.

468
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,561
There's really no problem with Heylia.

469
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,150
Really.

470
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:54,580
Well, now it's guaranteed.

471
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:58,733
I thought you said you
didn't care about pot.

472
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,980
That we were under your radar.

473
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:04,442
No, you're under my radar.
And since I'm keeping you there,

474
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:06,270
I gotta show my boss some results.

475
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,351
What do you show him
some other results?

476
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:13,443
Like a crack den or a
methlab or something?

477
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,361
Heylia is gonna lead me
to this guy named U-Turn

478
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,801
who's dealing a lot more than weed.

479
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:22,413
Well, why not arrest him
and keep Heylia out of it?

480
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:26,030
You gotta dig the worms
to catch the big fish.

481
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:27,622
Heylia's been dug up.

482
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:30,011
And I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

483
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:33,372
It's my fun time.

484
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:40,953
I'm thinking tapas. You up for it?

485
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:57,252
