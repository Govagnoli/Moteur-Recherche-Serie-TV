1
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,627
Hi!

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,381
Yeah. Yes, you can help me.

3
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:05,372
You can stop sending
me your catalogues.

4
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,968
Why? Because I'm dead.

5
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,382
Yeah. Yes, that's right.
Judah Botwin is dead.

6
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:14,556
Type it in and quit sending
your shit to a corpse!

7
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:19,831
Lupita, you gotta throw out all the
junk mail that comes for dad, okay?

8
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,585
Okay, Silas. Okay.

9
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:22,554
Good morning!

10
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:24,350
I'm gonna be at
Megan's tonight.

11
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:25,835
You're sure it's okay
with her parents?

12
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,053
Yeah. Are you kidding?

13
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:29,624
Megan's one of three girls.
Her dad loves having me over.

14
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,232
Does he know what you
do with his daughter?

15
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:34,212
Mom! He's really cool.
He's teaching me how to box.

16
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:37,013
Just want you to know
I can kick your ass.

17
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:43,730
Here. Serena gave me this to
give to you from Alejandro.

18
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:45,501
Alejandro?

19
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:48,941
Serena's cousin. What you do?

20
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:49,981
Nothing.

21
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:54,310
First he give you pennies,
now he give you panties. What you do?

22
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:57,632
It must be some mistake, nothing.
Take it away. Take it back.

23
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:18,742
Hey!

24
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:20,622
- The fuck are you doing?
- I just...

25
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,272
Get the hell out of my room!

26
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:29,292
You're late.

27
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:31,612
For what?
Do I have a court date?

28
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:32,862
The bakery.

29
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,572
Oh shit!

30
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,031
Is that today? Kidding!

31
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:39,920
Besides who cares?
It's not even a real bakery.

32
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:41,010
It's a "fakery".

33
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:43,483
Which will be
more than obvious

34
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:46,472
if no one shows up on
the day that it opens.

35
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,933
Now go! You promised.

36
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,931
All right, let me choke down some java.
At what time are you gonna be there?

37
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,391
I'm not sure.

38
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:55,082
I have to take Shane
to school and...

39
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:59,692
go by Heylia's, make a drop to
Sanjay and... Shane, let's go!

40
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,840
How did it go with
Shane's shrink yesterday?

41
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,163
The doctor wants to put
him on anti-depressants.

42
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:06,181
Drugs are not the answer.

43
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:09,700
This from the king of
all things mind-altering.

44
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:14,552
Illegal drugs not this prescription,
antidepressants zombie shit.

45
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,262
That fries your brain.

46
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,161
Weed makes you hungry and happy and
in your case financially solvent.

47
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,672
He bit a kid in
the foot last week.

48
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,572
Oh God! I wish I'd been there!

49
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,943
Andy, it's not funny.

50
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,392
He's 10 years old
and his dad died.

51
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:34,963
Drugging him so he acts like
everything's fine is totally fucked up.

52
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:38,613
When my ferret killed himself
a few years ago, I took Celexa.

53
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,360
I gained 40 pounds,
I couldn't ejaculate.

54
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:42,891
Is that what you
want for your son?

55
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,011
Fuck off!

56
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:46,900
And anyway the
doctor says that

57
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:50,342
it's just temporary 'till his
neurotransmitters realign
themselves or some...

58
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:51,553
shit like that.

59
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,213
See! Even you
don't believe it!

60
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:56,011
Trust me,
those anti-depressants are evil.

61
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,520
He does not need them.

62
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:00,420
Mind your own business,
maybe I wanna be on drugs.

63
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:01,600
Excuse me!

64
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,352
Carrie Phillips
started taking Zoloft

65
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,300
so she wouldn't cut
herself anymore...

66
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:07,760
now she's in a band!

67
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,792
- Can she ejaculate?
- Andy!

68
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:12,931
Okay. Ignore the voice of reason.
Drug your child.

69
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,453
Let him wander through
his youth like a robot.

70
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,823
Yeah, let me.

71
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,093
Come on, mom.
Say yes to drugs.

72
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:29,770
City council approved the sale of
our golf course to Summer Canyon.

73
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,453
I gotta talk to
Doug about this.

74
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:32,360
Why?

75
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:33,893
My green's fee is coming up.

76
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,153
I'm getting cytotoxic chemicals
pumped into my blood stream

77
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:41,003
and you're worried about
the price of putting.

78
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,601
Fuck Apprentice.
You see Survivor last night?

79
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:44,823
With the guy who
eat the chimel*?

80
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:47,051
No, that's Fear Factor.
Survivor's on the island.

81
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,050
Guys! How about concentrating
on this survivor for a minute?

82
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:51,542
We won't be long.

83
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,652
Oh shit! My deposition.

84
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,790
Go. I'll take a cab home.

85
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,311
I  can't just leave you here.

86
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,333
I'll be fine.

87
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,911
I'll call and check
up on you, okay?

88
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:01,983
Okay.

89
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,401
So their reward was 3
crispy cream donuts.

90
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:08,770
Three fucking donuts!

91
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,312
If I'm gonna sit in a tree

92
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:12,820
in the jungle for 2 days
straight with no food

93
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,352
having to take a
shit like an owl...

94
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,131
Excuse me!

95
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:17,052
I want a hell of a lot
more than 3 crispy creams.

96
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,132
I want my own franchise.

97
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,880
- I don't blame you.
- Excuse me, sir!

98
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:20,952
I won't be long.

99
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,970
Two days straight
with no food.

100
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,653
Let's see them do
that on Fear Factor.

101
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:38,061
Need cash for college? Get smart.
Learn about your options.

102
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:42,090
Financial aid awareness month.
It's not too late... apply now!

103
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,413
- Hey, boss!
- I was just about to leave.

104
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:50,161
Sorry. I was cramming.

105
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,721
I lost track of time.

106
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:54,313
Wow!

107
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,940
It  is so good to see you.

108
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,253
What the hell are you doing?

109
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:00,041
Oh shit!

110
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:03,271
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm just really, really baked.

111
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:07,593
And I think you're really,
really pretty.

112
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:10,200
Baked? When did
you start smoking?

113
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,572
Right after I started selling.

114
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:14,562
Oh no! Sanjay, no!

115
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:18,602
No. It's a good thing! It's totally
changed my life for the better.

116
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:20,910
Fuck!

117
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:22,730
Hey!

118
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,293
Forgive me!

119
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,490
Can I help you, officer?

120
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:30,483
- The bag.
- What?

121
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:32,323
Give me your fucking bag.

122
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,992
Please, this was just
a one-time thing.

123
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,170
Really?

124
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:57,492
My surveillance tapes
show something different.

125
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:59,482
-  Tapes?
- Tapes,

126
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,920
pictures,... Shit! I've got a little
dossier on the little Botwin.

127
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,973
Couple of kids.

128
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,253
Nice house in Agrestic.

129
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,332
How do you know this?

130
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,121
I am head of campus security.

131
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,511
Suburban mom builds a
cottage industry on my turf,

132
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:17,420
I'm not gonna know about it?

133
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,362
Do you really think I
am that bad at my job?

134
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:27,052
Oh...

135
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,363
Damn!

136
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,521
Not just quantity but quality!

137
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,753
Are you arresting me?

138
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:37,961
I don't know.

139
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:40,682
I'm not an unreasonable man.

140
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:43,382
Young boys shouldn’t
grow up without a mom.

141
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:45,303
No.

142
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:49,932
My cousin Jesse grew
up without a mother.

143
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:53,373
Wound up in the Internet with his dick
in some granny's ass which is why

144
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:55,065
I'm gonna cut you a break.

145
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,973
I will not take this any
farther if you promise

146
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,514
to never come back on
this campus again.

147
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:01,743
Of course!

148
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:02,733
I mean it!

149
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:05,821
You and your dot-head cohort
ever around here peddling,

150
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,700
I am not letting
you off again.

151
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,193
Get out of here.

152
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:21,410
Can I have my stuff back?

153
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:27,263
- The bag. Not my style.
- Yeah...

154
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,320
I meant my other stuff.

155
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:36,071
Please. I promise I'll
never come back here again.

156
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:38,970
That's... that's all I've got.

157
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,242
That's my mortgage payment.

158
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,580
Otherwise I can't
pay my bills. It's...

159
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:47,842
It's everything I have.

160
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,720
Please. I promise I'll never
come back here again. I'm...

161
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,760
I'm begging you.

162
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:06,262
You've got 5 seconds to
get the fuck off my campus.

163
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,701
Good afternoon, ladies.

164
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:41,463
I would like to start by
thanking all of you...

165
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,951
- Sorry, I'm late!
- Celia.

166
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,180
Would you mind taking a sit?

167
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,072
Why?

168
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,820
Maggie's running the meeting.

169
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:50,800
Why?

170
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,880
Because we need a reliable
and healthy leader.

171
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:56,401
Oh.

172
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:58,620
As I was saying...

173
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,841
it is a frill to
finally lead the PTA.

174
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:05,183
As many of you know, back when
Agrestic was just a golf course,

175
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:08,302
my family was one of the
first to settle this land.

176
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:11,300
So I will do my very
best to make you proud.

177
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:14,671
Now...

178
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:16,002
First order of business:

179
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:19,500
there is a problem
with the gym teacher.

180
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:25,273
He's been spotted working at the ladies
shoe department at Nordstrom’s on
the weekend.

181
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,550
And we all know what
that means, right?

182
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,283
He can get us 10% off?

183
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,901
That's not news.
I've known about it for years so...

184
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,170
You knew?

185
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,782
And did nothing?

186
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,390
Well, there's nothing to do.

187
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:39,092
I disagree.

188
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,781
I don't think it's appropriate

189
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:44,270
for our kids to learn
wrestling from a gay...

190
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:45,723
man.

191
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:48,132
He's gay.
He's not a pedophile.

192
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:49,813
There's a big difference,
you know.

193
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,592
Thank you for your
input, Celia.

194
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:54,682
But your time is up.

195
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,373
Now, ladies,

196
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,403
should Nick
Papanicoloplis be fired?

197
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,652
Like hell my time is up!

198
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:13,410
Now, next up.

199
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:17,672
What you doing back here?

200
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:21,570
I'm so fucked!

201
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,900
That $14,000 supply
I just picked up...

202
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:27,800
I need a refill.

203
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,460
You moved them bricks already?

204
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,252
Girl, you flip this shit
faster than a pooper-scooper.

205
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,151
I didn't move it.

206
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,271
I lost it.

207
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:40,500
Lost it? You got to Galson and
leave them on a shelf
next to the pop tarts?

208
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:41,930
I got busted!

209
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:45,723
Seriously?

210
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:49,871
Yes! By some redneck head of
campus security at Valley State.

211
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:52,142
Threw me in his car and
let me off with a warning

212
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:55,033
but he confiscated all my pot,
everything I have, I'm...

213
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:56,682
screwed.

214
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:00,852
You didn't get busted,
you just got jacked.

215
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:02,922
What are you talking about?

216
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,701
Did you go down at
the police station?

217
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:05,340
No.

218
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:06,961
Did you get fingerprinted?

219
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:07,713
No.

220
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,461
Damn! Girl,
you're as gullible as Kobe's wife.

221
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:14,063
You think a cop's gonna let a
drug dealer go just on a warning?

222
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:16,240
Even a pretty little
white one like you?

223
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,342
Are you sure?

224
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:21,823
500 bucks say your rent-a-cop
was a dealer himself,

225
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:24,801
he just didn't like you dealing
in his redneck part of the woods.

226
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,070
- Motherfucking...
- Let it out.

227
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,791
- ...cocksucking...
- That's right.

228
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:37,033
...son of a bitch
hillbilly stalker asshole!

229
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,102
That's right, baby.
Let it out, come on!

230
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:43,863
Shit eating, dickless,
granny fucking prick!

231
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:45,721
- There you go!
- Granny fucking?

232
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,492
How am I gonna get my stuff back?
Let me borrow a gun!

233
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:50,813
He jacked your brain too?

234
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:53,550
You have to just take your lumps
on this one like everybody else.

235
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,953
You learned a $14,000 lesson.

236
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,172
Hello?

237
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:08,300
What?

238
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:10,651
Oh shit!

239
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,393
Yeah.

240
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,322
No, I'll be right there.

241
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,302
Well...

242
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,863
Looks like I'm not the only
Botwin who got busted today.

243
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,391
You started a fire?

244
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:22,761
It's no big deal!

245
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:25,383
I'd hardly called
arson not big deal.

246
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,412
You started a fire?

247
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,280
As you hopefully know,
it's diversity week

248
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,990
and there have been
several presentations

249
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:33,172
including Moses and
the Burning Bush

250
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:35,291
which your son seemed to feel

251
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,090
lacked authenticity.

252
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,541
Jesus!

253
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:42,141
No, Moses. And he was talking
to a shrub painted red.

254
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,801
It was totally unrealistic.

255
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,463
Fortunately, it was dosed before
it caused any injuries or damage.

256
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,250
Do you know how
dangerous that is?

257
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,342
Hardly at all.
The floor was concrete.

258
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:54,381
And from our fire drills, I knew that
the sprinklers were right above.

259
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,422
And the hose was,
like, inches away.

260
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,641
It was out in seconds.

261
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:01,530
While soaking and terrifying the
presenters from Temple Beth Shalom.

262
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:05,143
You really frightened those nice Jews,
young man.

263
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:06,433
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:09,693
Mrs. Botwin, I'm gonna have
to confiscate the lighter.

265
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:13,113
And I'm suspending
Shane until Monday.

266
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,741
Can  I have drugs now?

267
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,770
How i'm gonna deal with you?

268
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,782
- Easy, Paxil.
- Enough, Shane.

269
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,211
Hey, look!

270
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:27,900
Is it Silas?

271
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:31,020
Silas!

272
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,360
Oh shit!

273
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,423
What is he doing in a
Porsche with a stranger!

274
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:36,582
Hey, mom!

275
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,052
What are you doing?

276
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:39,752
This is Megan's dad.

277
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,953
He's teaching me how
to drive a stick!

278
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:43,781
Hi, Megan's dad.

279
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,661
Howard. Nice to meet you.

280
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:51,081
- You too.
- Later!

281
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:54,362
Bye.

282
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:08,653
God bless Costco!

283
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:09,543
Damn it!

284
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:13,612
Hey, Nanc'! Just in time...

285
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,400
to help me close up!

286
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:17,151
Where the hell
were you all day?

287
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,153
How did it go?

288
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:23,163
We made 17 bucks.

289
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:25,200
But who gives a shit, right?

290
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:29,233
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

291
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,992
What the fuck is wrong with you?
It's a phony bakery.

292
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:35,443
Andy, I just got ripped off

293
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,612
so  I am back to zero.

294
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,222
We are back to zero.

295
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,120
So we need to sell some
fucking pastries pronto

296
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:45,211
'cause I need this phony
business to work, okay?

297
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,671
Lady, we're closed.

298
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:48,600
Good start!

299
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:50,622
Right!

300
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:51,912
Right.

301
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:00,593
Hey! Is Dean ready?

302
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,112
No, he's in the shower.

303
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,410
Nice haircut.

304
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,071
It's a wig.

305
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,950
Oh, right, the cancer thing.

306
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:15,603
Listen, what do you know about the sale
of the golf course to Summer Canyon?

307
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,683
I already told Dean
the deal is done.

308
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,593
We're looking at a
$100 during the week.

309
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,971
$150 on weekends,
carts included.

310
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,852
I don't care about golf.

311
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,033
I'm wondering if the
houses on the golf course

312
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,453
will still be a
part of Agrestic.

313
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:32,490
No. That's Summer
Canyon's problem now.

314
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:34,031
Really?

315
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,260
Yeah, why?

316
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:37,771
Would you care?

317
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,712
- Probably not.
- Thank you.

318
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,340
What? What's wrong?

319
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:48,820
Nauseous. Chemo.

320
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,172
That sucks.
You want some pot?

321
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,342
That's illegal, Doug.

322
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,590
Not for you.
You can even get a medical card.

323
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,282
- Really?
- Yeah.

324
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:00,183
Well, I have the pills for it,
thank you.

325
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,920
Ooh! What did they give you?

326
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:03,981
- Zofran.
- Let me try one!

327
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,160
No, they're $300 a pill.

328
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:07,963
I'll give you 400.

329
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,791
They don't get you high!

330
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,500
It's just for nausea.

331
00:17:11,645 --> 00:17:12,510
Wow!

332
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,811
$300 a pill and no fun?

333
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:16,941
What a jip!

334
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:20,243
I  really like your wig.

335
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,181
- Really?
- Yeah.

336
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,621
Can I pet it?

337
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,221
Knock yourself out.

338
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:30,872
You're a good girl?

339
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,860
You're a good girl, ain't you?

340
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,562
Yes, you are.

341
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,353
Put them back.

342
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:45,931
At least,
give it to the homeless.

343
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,001
This is Agrestic.

344
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,132
You're the only
homeless in town.

345
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,502
Get in the kitchen,
start baking like you promised.

346
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,051
Hey!

347
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,011
Thanks for coming, buddy.
You gotta talk some sense into her.

348
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,372
She's totally delusional!

349
00:17:57,695 --> 00:17:58,973
Nanc', trust me.

350
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:02,440
A bakery is virtually impossible
to run without drug money.

351
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,392
Let me tell you what Amos
was really famous for.

352
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:06,573
What about Mrs. Fields?

353
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,741
- You mean Madame Fields?
- Big whore!

354
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,823
Fuck you both.

355
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,783
In this town the only 12
people that still eat carbs

356
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,250
buy their muffins
at Starbuck's.

357
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:16,851
I don't care! I have bills to pay.
I'm doing this.

358
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,052
Hello.

359
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:24,251
I'm dry. Find somebody else.

360
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:25,690
You're dry?

361
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:26,982
You're dry?
What do you mean you're dry?

362
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:29,742
I wiped out.
Some campus cop at Valley State.

363
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:30,743
What?

364
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,823
Okay, okay.
How do I find this guy?

365
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:33,952
What are you gonna do?

366
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,011
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

367
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:36,222
Buy your pot back!

368
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:37,500
A hundred bucks at a time!

369
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,013
I am not built for this.

370
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,330
I was gonna be a dancer,
not a dealer.

371
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,242
Certainly not a baker.

372
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,733
And I wanted to be Patrick
Swayze in Roadhouse!

373
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:47,691
I will stab you.

374
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:51,053
Get out of my fakery.
I have work to do.

375
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,242
Okay, obviously you're not
thinking clearly right now.

376
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:54,672
You're upset and you're edgy

377
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:56,880
which is making me
upset and edgy.

378
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,063
I'm aiming.

379
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,251
If you throw that,
there'd better pot in there.

380
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,091
- I need a smoke.
- You got any in you?

381
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,403
- No.
- Damn it!

382
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,052
It's in my car.

383
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,182
Forgive me.

384
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:20,543
Your chivalry leaves
a lot to be desired.

385
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,651
Who brings cookies
to a bakery?

386
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:27,721
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:31,653
How can I make it up to you?
I will do anything.

388
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,630
Please, I...

389
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,782
I might be a coward but...

390
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,302
I love you.

391
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,102
God!

392
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:44,652
Start baking!

393
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,751
Good afternoon, ladies!
First order of business is this...

394
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:56,042
No, ladies.
First order of business is this.

395
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:00,993
Maggie... for you.

396
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,122
Oh my goodness!
A welcome gift?

397
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:06,733
Bon voyage present actually.

398
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,591
For you and your children.

399
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:12,070
Bon voyage?
Where are we going?

400
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:14,340
- I hope it's Vegas.
- Open it!

401
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,073
Summer Canyon elementary school
application. I don't understand.

402
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,591
Since your house is
on the golf course

403
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:27,200
which is now part
of Summer Canyon,

404
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:31,242
your children can no
longer attend Agrestic.

405
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,283
What?

406
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,023
Yeah, out of district.

407
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,633
Oh but there is an upside.

408
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:38,411
Their gym teacher:
straight as an arrow.

409
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:43,153
Now, since you actually have to
have a child who attends Agrestic

410
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,292
to be president of the PTA,

411
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,712
I believe the position
is open again.

412
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,781
And I would like to
reinstate myself.

413
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,241
God! I'm feeling
so much better.

414
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:56,812
Excuse me while
I play through.

415
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:59,960
All of those in favor
of reinstating me

416
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:01,570
say "I".

417
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:05,222
I!

418
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,263
I object!

419
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,443
Yeah, well,
take it up with Summer Canyon.

420
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:16,692
Thank you for your input!

421
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,993
Hello! Welcome to
Breadsticks and Scones!

422
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,880
What's the matter?
You don't like my gift?

423
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:34,351
I told you to stay
away from me.

424
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,802
Who is this guy, Nancy?

425
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,430
You want me to kick his ass?

426
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:40,672
Okay.

427
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:42,972
I gave up 15 hits last night.

428
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:45,401
I beamed 4 batters.

429
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,102
And when they charged the mound,
the only thing I could
think about was you.

430
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,590
Sir, if you're not gonna order anything,
I'm gonna have to ask you to...

431
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,060
Forgive me!

432
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,780
You think I'm gonna
be your girlfriend?

433
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,610
Girlfriend? Is this high school?

434
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,841
We do business together.

435
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:02,772
Occasionally, we...

436
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:04,402
celebrate our success.

437
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:05,660
Go away.

438
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:08,170
Look, I'm gonna change your mind.
You're gonna need me.

439
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,031
- For what?
- A lot of things.

440
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,370
I can help you put
up more territories.

441
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,382
I got connections with domestics
who're ready to redistribute.

442
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,321
And most of all I
can protect you.

443
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,681
What do you need me for?

444
00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:21,502
The business has changed,
I can't push my ditch weed anymore.

445
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:24,223
- I need your quality supply.
- I don't have a supply.

446
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,423
I got jacked by some campus
cop at Valley State yesterday.

447
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,421
Then you're gonna need my protection
a lot more than you think.

448
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:41,260
Hey!

449
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,321
Oh! I hope I don't
lose my sex drive.

450
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,451
Enough!

451
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:20,633
Don't need no pills!

452
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:22,773
- Hey, Lupita!
- What?

453
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:25,333
You haven't seen the lighter
that was in my drawer, have you?

454
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:25,921
No.

455
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:30,272
It's kinda in the
principal's office.

456
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,970
- Where?
- At my school.

457
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,673
He confiscated it.

458
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:38,321
You fucking idiot.

459
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:39,952
You're an idiot! Fuck you!

460
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:42,261
That was dad's!
He gave it to me.

461
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,323
What's wrong with you?

462
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,463
Lupita, get some ice.

463
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:49,580
Oh my God!

464
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,563
Goddamn it, Silas!

465
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,693
Don't panic!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

466
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,812
Get the fuck away!
Get the fuck away from my house!

467
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,402
Wait, wait, here.
This is yours.

468
00:24:56,926 --> 00:25:00,743
And I want to apologize for
the other day, Mrs. Botwin.

469
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:04,111
I didn't realize who you were.

470
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,683
I mean I knew who you were,
I just didn't know...

471
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:07,903
who you were.

472
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:12,183
And if you need any protection
on campus or more connections,

473
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm your man.

474
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,490
Whatever you need,
just ask for me.

475
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,811
I'm Cash. That's me.

476
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,632
I need you to get
away from my house.

477
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,513
Right.

478
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:23,332
Okay. And again,
I am so sorry.

479
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:50,332
