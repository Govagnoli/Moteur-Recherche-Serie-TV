1
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:04,033
Foul!

2
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:06,400
Ref, what's the matter with your whistle!

3
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:11,325
You know, you should really
be encouraging Shane and Silas

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,429
to talk about Juda's death

5
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,912
or, down the road, you're looking at two

6
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:17,608
very dysfunctional adults.

7
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:20,285
Shit!

8
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:23,398
I guess he left her pretty well fixed.

9
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,694
I heard there was nothing.

10
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,363
I wonder how she's getting by.

11
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,985
Jesus, Nancy, you weren't
kidding, this stuff is primo.

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,133
You wanna climb in.

13
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,514
Give me a little respect.

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,383
I'm the biggest game in the
private community of Agrestic.

15
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,111
Drugs sell themselves biscuit.

16
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,233
You ain't shit.

17
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:38,692
Her husband is boning the tennis pro.

18
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:41,121
She loved him long time.

19
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:42,150
Dean!

20
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,970
That little cunt!

21
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,353
Mrs. Botwin, can we have sex in your house?

22
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,350
Jesus.

23
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:50,742
I've got everything under control.

24
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:54,862
And 5, 6, 7, 8.

25
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,431
Down, ladies.

26
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,010
And go!

27
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:02,690
Give me shoulders. Give me attitude.

28
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,300
Head down, ladies.

29
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,363
You know about Celia's husband?

30
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,090
Sleeping with the tennis pro.

31
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:10,211
He's homosexual?

32
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,992
Not Victor, the oriental girl.

33
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,660
Helen Chin? She completely transformed my serve.

34
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,660
I hope they don't fire her.

35
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,591
Ladies...

36
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,633
throwing stones in the glassroom.

37
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,493
No, gossiping about Celia.

38
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:21,253
Lovely.

39
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:23,510
Come on, Nancy, it's harmless fun.

40
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:24,802
Probably not for Celia.

41
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:25,832
Oh, please!

42
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,482
Celia wasn't programmed to feel.

43
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,060
Why don't you chat about who
your husbands are fucking?

44
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:31,522
Look, here come girls.

45
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:34,191
You take care, Nancy.

46
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,641
It must be so hard for you being all alone.

47
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:37,793
God bless.

48
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:40,180
Mom?

49
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,302
I thought Blanca was picking me up after school.

50
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,831
Yes, well, surprise!

51
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:50,710
Blanca had to take your sister to the airport.

52
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:51,802
The airport?

53
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,502
Where is she going?

54
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:58,453
Quinn is on her way to boarding school in Mexico.

55
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,311
She didn't say anything.

56
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,343
Yeah, well, not a sentimentalist your sister.

57
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,030
Can we talk about this in the car?

58
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:04,632
But...

59
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:05,620
But in the car.

60
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:06,690
Go and change your clothes.

61
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,660
I'll meet you at the desk. Go on.

62
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,000
The karate class will be
starting in just a minute.

63
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,391
Mr. Saint Denis, so nice to see you.

64
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:14,253
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Botwin.

65
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,133
Shane is doing very well in karate.

66
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:17,693
I'm so glad to hear that.

67
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:20,772
Mom, the lady at the desk says you need to pay.

68
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:21,983
I already checked last week.

69
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:23,643
She said your check didn't clear.

70
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,052
There must be some explanation.

71
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:28,533
Yeah, you don't have any
money in your checking account.

72
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:31,210
I'll go to the desk and straighten
everything out. Go back to class.

73
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:32,153
I gotta pee.

74
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:32,893
Fine, hurry up.

75
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:35,752
Hold up the bell. Remember to hold
up the bell so it doesn't get wet.

76
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:36,390
Mom!

77
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:37,400
Hey, Nancy.

78
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,001
Hi, Celia.

79
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,090
Nancy, hey! Check this out!

80
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,772
Ow!

81
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:50,782
Shit, Nancy! I am so sorry.

82
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,143
What did you just chuck at my face?

83
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:55,012
It's called a roomerang and when you throw it,

84
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,772
it's supposed to come back to you...

85
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,950
when  someone else's face doesn't get in the way.

86
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,023
But I'm not saying you did that on purpose.

87
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,092
Can I have a tissue?

88
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:02,982
Oh, sure.

89
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,772
Doug, we need to talk.

90
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:09,203
Oh, no. No, no.

91
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:10,411
Don't tell me you're dry.

92
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,080
Not dry, Doug. I'm broke.

93
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:13,403
Thank God!

94
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:17,010
Maybe I should save some
money by firing my accountant.

95
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,773
Okay, let's not get carried away.

96
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,231
We should brainstorm on this.

97
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:22,361
Have some dialog, confab, pow wow.

98
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,591
I can't believe I trust you
with my money, you're an idiot.

99
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:26,582
I'm an idiot savant.

100
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:30,290
Say what you want about me personnally
but I'm a great fucking CPA.

101
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,913
You won't let me deposit
cash in my checking account.

102
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:35,503
I'm running all over town paying my bills in cash.

103
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,322
Because I can't have a papertrail of
cash deposits. You gotta trust me on this.

104
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,070
What am I supposed to do? Sell my house?

105
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,633
How about Lupita, your housekeeper?

106
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,943
She's like family.

107
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,030
Besides  her daughter is still
in court reporting school.

108
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:50,641
I started selling so I
could maintain my lifestyle,

109
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,433
not dismantle it.

110
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,883
Well, you're gonna have to sell more.

111
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,561
Nancy, it's the oldest rule in business.

112
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,770
Buy low, sell high.

113
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,861
Did you get it? Sell high!

114
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,393
If you ever make a biz card, you could use that.

115
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:06,343
Doug...

116
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:08,691
Okay.

117
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:09,930
Alright, listen.

118
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,343
I've been working on setting
up a small business loan for you

119
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,511
so you can have the front
to launder money through.

120
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,230
This way you can replenish your
checking account, pay some bills,

121
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,031
and boom! Bob's your uncle!

122
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,591
What is my legitimate small business?

123
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,230
I don't know.

124
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,061
Pick something. Paperwork is all the same.

125
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:24,250
Just  let me know what you want.

126
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:27,210
Could my cover business
eventually become my real business?

127
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:30,330
In this economy, small businesses are fucked.

128
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:31,861
But that would be good for
us, don't worry about it.

129
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:34,481
Just pick something with low inventory. Okay?

130
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm so screwed.

131
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,963
No, stop that! Everything is gonna be great!

132
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:41,891
I'm guaranteeing you at least
7 customers at tomorrow's game.

133
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,691
Oh and if you could be here
by 8, that would be perfecto.

134
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,952
How about a little cash upfront?

135
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,590
Sure.

136
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,940
Ah shit! I'm all taped out.

137
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,183
I'll hit the ATM later. I promise.

138
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:03,113
Nanc', I'd offer to write you a
check but that seems insensitive.

139
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,371
Not to mention unwise because
if you should get caught,

140
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:07,262
I can't have it coming back to me.

141
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:09,390
Silas!

142
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,540
Is there a phone off the hook upstairs?

143
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,160
- Dead!
- What?

144
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:15,865
It's dead.

145
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:17,653
All the phones are dead.

146
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:18,874
Oh shit!

147
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,473
Don't worry.

148
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:26,461
I'll go online and pay it right now.

149
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,700
Why can't I get online?

150
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,550
'Cause DSL is connected to the phone.

151
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:38,003
I'll give you 50 bucks right now if
you don't give me any grief about this.

152
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:40,311
Cool.

153
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,153
Hey, you haven't talked to
Quinn's mom lately, have you?

154
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,980
I saw her at karate.

155
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,371
You didn't say anything to her, right?

156
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:49,303
About what?

157
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:52,322
You know, about how you caught me and Quinn.

158
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:53,580
Why would you think that?

159
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,503
'Cause I haven't heard from
Quinn and she wasn't at school.

160
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,181
I don't know, I just...

161
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:00,832
I don't get it.

162
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:02,150
She didn't say goodbye?

163
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:04,333
Goodbye?

164
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:05,221
What do you mean goodbye?

165
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,161
I heard Celia saying something about

166
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:09,190
Quinn going to Mexico.

167
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,461
Mexico?

168
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,260
I don't know. I overheard.

169
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:16,512
Quinn...

170
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,700
Quinn wouldn't go to Mexico without telling me.

171
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:23,802
I'm sorry, honey. I don't know the whole story.

172
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:25,042
You're sorry?

173
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,081
She's probably been trying to call me.

174
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:31,413
What the hell is the matter for this family
that we can't even have a goddamn working phone!

175
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,383
It's your fucking mess.

176
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:34,690
Silas!

177
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:35,952
Hi, Mrs.

178
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,182
Hi, Lupita. How you doing?

179
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:40,421
I think I have the menopause.

180
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:44,151
I'm thinking I am gonna
have another baby and I cry.

181
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,913
And then I hear: No! It's the menopause.

182
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:48,481
And I say: Thank you, God.

183
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:53,092
So, you no pay me last week.

184
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:54,703
I didn't?

185
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:55,792
You no pay me.

186
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:56,901
Are you sure?

187
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:58,110
You pay me now?

188
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,523
Okay, gracias.

189
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:13,722
Good morning, I am Shane Botwin
and I am 10 years old today.

190
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,833
And I have been told that these
are the people responsible.

191
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:18,002
Turn it off.

192
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,973
To celebrate this, my natal day,

193
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,981
I have asked for the Megatech
radio-controlled blimp UFO combo,

194
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,702
a nightvision binocular

195
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:30,881
and this DVD of Steven Chow
cinematic masterpiece: Shaolin Soccer.

196
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:36,090
I wonder if these so-called parents of
mine have purchased any of these items.

197
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:39,492
Let's see what the alleged
parental units have to say.

198
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:40,533
Honey.

199
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,831
Show him your stretch marks.

200
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:44,131
Show him yours.

201
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:49,601
You know, you were not born
until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

202
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,250
So you, my friend, are not
officially 10 years old yet.

203
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,270
Will you make me pizza eggs?

204
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,512
Hey! We got any leftover pizza?

205
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:00,321
Yes.

206
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,400
Then I will make you pizza eggs

207
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,332
but not because it's your birthday

208
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:11,330
but because I'm feeling a little bit peckish
myself and your mother is not a morning person

209
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:12,812
and I love you.

210
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:13,992
And it's my birthday!

211
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:16,291
And it's your birthday!

212
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,451
Do you think I'm weird?

213
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:18,243
Yes!

214
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:19,470
You're totally weird.

215
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:20,943
But you're our son.

216
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:25,443
You know, I wouldn't trade you in for
any other almost 10-year-old on Earth.

217
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:30,271
What if there's life on other planets and there's
an unbelievable, amazing 10-year-old outthere.

218
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,471
Why would I trade down, man?

219
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,642
To me, you're the best, dude.

220
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:41,433
You are the amazing, unbelievable Shane Botwin.

221
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:46,481
...amazing, unbelievable Shane Botwin.

222
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:51,601
...amazing, unbelievable Shane Botwin.

223
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,240
It's amazing the guy would even
consider pleading not guilty.

224
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,532
Amazing.

225
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:05,121
Part of me thinks he actually believes
his own bullshit which is just scary.

226
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,242
Hey.

227
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:25,121
Do you think it's safe I take two Ambien?

228
00:10:25,378 --> 00:10:26,873
I could really use some good sleep tonight.

229
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:29,080
I think you should take the whole bottle.

230
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:31,750
Funny.

231
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,723
Later!

232
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,011
Dean?

233
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,443
You awake?

234
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,240
Did your hair go to boarding school in Mexico too?

235
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:45,611
I don't know what you're talking about.

236
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:46,961
Where is she?

237
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:51,293
Silas, come over here and
hold this sign so I can staple.

238
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:56,102
Are you so frightened by your daughter's
sexuality that you had to ship her off?

239
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:57,743
Pardon me?

240
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,601
Who told you we had sex?

241
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:05,621
Young men, this is the first time I'm
hearing that you and my daughter had sex

242
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,702
although now that I've been made aware,

243
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:10,890
I'm tempted to bring her home
just so I can ship her off again.

244
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,311
That little slut!

245
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,883
How dare you?

246
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:15,383
Tell me where she is!

247
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,401
Why?

248
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:20,911
So you can fly down to Mexico
and spring her from casa reforma?

249
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,140
I love her.

250
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:24,952
You stuck your penis in her.

251
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,870
That's not love, believe me.

252
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:34,860
If you didn't know about us,
then why is she in Mexico?

253
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,401
That's a private family matter.

254
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,002
I am her family.

255
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,470
God! Poor thing.

256
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,493
Do you really think

257
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:46,303
that my daughter had deep
romantic feelings for you?

258
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:47,891
Is that what you think?

259
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,932
Now, I'm sure that you were a
fun and sweety perversion for her,

260
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:54,200
but the truth is Quinn had a day and a half

261
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:57,123
to get all of her ducks in
a row before going to Mexico.

262
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,703
And she didn't call you.

263
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:04,513
She didn't write or IM or
e-mail you either, did she?

264
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,232
But I'll tell you what she did do.

265
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:09,362
She downloaded 2000 songs into her i-pod

266
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:12,621
and  dyed her hair pink with black on the tips.

267
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,641
Because all that Quinn cares about

268
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,031
is Quinn.

269
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:19,432
She takes after her father that way.

270
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:23,352
Poor schmuck!

271
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:29,470
Oh you poor schmuck, you just played wrong.

272
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,813
That's a boat! Ah ah! Mark that!

273
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:36,021
So wait, a boat is when
the four ends add up to 20?

274
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:38,640
A boat is when I spank this boy's black ass

275
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:41,192
for thinking he hold up with
his three switching bitches.

276
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:42,672
Three switching bitches?

277
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:45,160
That's 15 and a boat is 20.

278
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:47,552
Stop fucking with her, she's
trying to learn the game.

279
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:51,001
Then log off a hot agent chick
suck-ass and you teach her.

280
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,713
I'm betting for rims on ebay.

281
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:57,621
Just like a nigga to buy new Rolls Royce
bucket before he's even got a steering wheel.

282
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,090
You can kiss my ass.

283
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:01,092
I just put a steering wheel in there 2 days ago.

284
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:02,163
Okay, well then.

285
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:05,233
Tennis shoe, pimp.

286
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:08,913
That's 2, honey, and break
out the peppermint lotion

287
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,941
'cause you're going to massage my feet.

288
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,163
What would you have gotten if you won?

289
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,890
She was going to babysit.

290
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,652
What am I gonna tell Rachel?

291
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:18,950
Tell her the truth, baby.

292
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,433
That you're a stanky foot-rubbing loser.

293
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,421
I'll  watch the kids.

294
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:24,271
For nothing?

295
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:25,612
It's his anniversary.

296
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,873
Oh that's so sweet.

297
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,100
How long have you been married?

298
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,723
Since Rachel got big with Shayne

299
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,200
and her daddy told Keyon he'd
all bun if he didn't do right.

300
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:34,391
All bun?

301
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,222
No hum... hotdog.

302
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,332
You know, you need to pay
Vaneeta if she's gonna babysit.

303
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:42,353
If this your business?

304
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:43,723
Everything is my business!

305
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,942
Speaking of business...

306
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:48,313
Yes?

307
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:52,190
I was wondering what your credit policy was.

308
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:53,160
What you think?

309
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,842
This ain't fucking Macy's.
You get what you pay for.

310
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,712
Because I'm a little short this week.

311
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:01,140
But hum...

312
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,403
there are people waiting

313
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:05,561
and I promise I'll come right back.

314
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,872
I don't know. You bet your
sweet ass you'll come right back.

315
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:10,540
You want weed on credit, you
gotta leave some collateral.

316
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,430
You believe this girl?

317
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:12,130
Like what?

318
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,561
You got some nice shoes.

319
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,191
What size you wearing?

320
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,283
How much you need?

321
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,940
An ounce, maybe two.

322
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:18,691
Hell, no.

323
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:20,692
Shoes ain't gonna cover that shit.

324
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:23,693
How about I hold on to that
nice rock you're wearing?

325
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,993
Alright, alright, I'm not unreasonable.

326
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,123
Sentimental value and all that.

327
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:35,122
Leave your car instead.

328
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,321
My car?

329
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:38,191
I'm leasing it.

330
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,660
Then you're really gonna wanna
get it back then, aren't you?

331
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:43,703
How am I gonna get home?

332
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,801
Take Conrad's bucket.

333
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:51,900
White lady in the hooptie.
You gotta let me get a picture.

334
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:52,802
Not  my baby.

335
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:53,970
That's it!

336
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,162
Range Rover for Stony Clover!

337
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:58,023
Heylia, I've been working on that car for a year.

338
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,123
And it still looks like shit.

339
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,670
So, what's it gonna be?

340
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,571
Conrad, give her the keys to the hooptie.

341
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,410
It's a classic.

342
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:15,743
I promise I'll treat her like she was my very own.

343
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:17,362
It only takes Super.

344
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:18,170
You gotta check the water.

345
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,020
Okay.

346
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:20,293
And oil.

347
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,143
Don't you think you should leave those shoes too?

348
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:25,290
Girl, you better get out
before Vaneeta strip you down.

349
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,313
Nice doing business with you guys.

350
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,300
Have a good game!

351
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,840
Hey, does anybody have any
money left to play with?

352
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,033
- Not me.
- No.

353
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,082
Fuck it, then.

354
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,361
Let's get high and make fun
of Dean's ball head, huh?

355
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,163
Celia?

356
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:34,263
Nancy.

357
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:36,392
Hello.

358
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,670
What are you doing out here?

359
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,393
I had to sign some papers

360
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:42,950
in Doug's office.

361
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,291
I followed Dean here.

362
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:50,763
Did you see him?

363
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:54,751
Yes, I did. They were playing poker.

364
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:55,743
Oh great.

365
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:59,081
Now he's gonna come home broke
and stinking of marijuana.

366
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:02,562
I guess that's better than oriental pussy.

367
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,612
Excuse me?

368
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,783
Oh come on, Nancy, I know you know.

369
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:07,440
Everybody knows.

370
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,031
There are no secrets in this town.

371
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,110
Maybe a few.

372
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:11,941
No.

373
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:12,782
None!

374
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,311
You're having money problems,

375
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,100
our children had sex,

376
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,850
Judy Gordon orders oxycontin over the
Internet and has developped quite the habit.

377
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,342
"Jesus loves you" Judy?

378
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:26,553
"Jesus loves you" Judy loves her hillbilly heroin.

379
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:29,832
But you didn't hear that
from me. I don't like gossip.

380
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:31,912
Where is your car?

381
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,163
I don't know I parked...

382
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,393
I think I parked on the
other side of the building.

383
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,893
This place is so confusing.

384
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:43,531
Do you want a lift?

385
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:46,731
No, you know...

386
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,713
not now, you know...

387
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,083
I'd rather walk.

388
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,213
What about you?

389
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,293
You're not gonna sit here
all night though, are you?

390
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,673
Well, I was thinking of
tracking down the tennis whore

391
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,950
and beating her to death with a tire iron.

392
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,973
But I forgot to set my Tivo for The Shield so...

393
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,593
I think I'll go home.

394
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,502
I love Michael Chicklis.

395
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,263
Good night, Nancy.

396
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:11,393
See you, Celia.

397
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,272
Hello?

398
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:21,790
Hello?

399
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:23,840
Lupita.

400
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:25,150
Hola!

401
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,473
You hungry?

402
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,161
I can warm up some pasta.

403
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:29,283
No, thanks.

404
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:32,652
Silas, honey?

405
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,950
He been like that since after school. All day.

406
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,150
He don't eat. He don't move.

407
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,942
Right, ain't this cool?

408
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,981
This is better than Silas' bellarium thing.

409
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,652
Bellarium!

410
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,820
Maybe just one

411
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:51,480
Oh no!

412
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,751
Shane! Shane! Relax! We can fix it!

413
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,331
Shane, look at me.

414
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:59,313
We can fix this. Everything
is gonna be okay, buddy.

415
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,083
You got that, mom?

416
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,520
Dad made it all better.

417
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,200
Silas, honey.

418
00:20:06,977 --> 00:20:08,413
What's going on?

419
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:10,973
I don't wanna talk about it.

420
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:14,761
Silas,

421
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:17,520
I know things have been a
little bumpy around here lately.

422
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,322
She didn't give a shit about me.

423
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:20,331
She?

424
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:21,990
Oh!

425
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:27,170
Honey, of course, she did. She just...

426
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:28,230
No!

427
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:31,220
She just took off without
even bothering to say goodbye!

428
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:36,030
My whole fucking life, people just go away.

429
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:41,542
Mom!

430
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,560
Jesus, Shane!

431
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,990
What happened? I call 911.

432
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,611
Allo? Allo?

433
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:54,242
Fuck, the phone is still dead.

434
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,282
You don't say fucking to your mother!

435
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:01,953
Ma'am?

436
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:03,651
Ma'am?

437
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:04,963
How will you be paying?

438
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,323
Cash.

439
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:09,860
I know what you did!

440
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,241
I know you stole that goat!

441
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,360
Mr. Norman!

442
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:17,141
Goat thief!

443
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,110
Mr. Norman, step back into your line.

444
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:22,050
I know it's the economy, stupid!

445
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:23,812
But that goat didn't belong to you.

446
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:24,951
He was a free goat.

447
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:26,902
Mom, it really hurts.

448
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,112
It's throbbing.

449
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,422
It's throbbing, mom!

450
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:31,862
Back off, nutty!

451
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:36,592
Cry-baby...

452
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm gonna take your free goat and
shove it up straight up your ass.

453
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:45,623
What goat?

454
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:48,042
Woman, you are light!

455
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:51,613
You are lighter than Michael
Jackson, you're so light!

456
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:52,360
Where is my money?

457
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,283
Shane broke his arm last night.

458
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:55,421
Oh...

459
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:58,331
Sorry to hear that.

460
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:00,561
Where is my money?

461
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:03,641
I'll get it, I swear, I need more inventory.

462
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,581
I'll pay everything back.

463
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:06,893
I'm sure you will.

464
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:10,121
But until then it's time to give it up.

465
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:11,341
The shiny bits.

466
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:13,523
You have my car!

467
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:16,051
I can't sell no leased car!

468
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,443
Now, you want more, you got to leave more.

469
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,753
And you got a shitty watch
and you buy knock-off handbags.

470
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,411
It's just business, baby.

471
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,761
Now, I know you got troubles

472
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:26,591
but like my mamma always says:

473
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:27,870
"Tough shit!"

474
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,452
Do you have a cover business?

475
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:30,642
Of course, I do.

476
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,681
Got me a jew in Century City who set me up.

477
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,352
Now, I know he's skimming cream off the top

478
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:37,850
but he makes everything seem real nice on paper.

479
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,581
You're looking at the president and
chief executive officer of Tidy Up, inc.

480
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,281
Got me a van out back and everything.

481
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,451
Maid service?

482
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:45,912
Housecleaning.

483
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,673
I ain't nobody's maid.

484
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:49,643
You ain't no housecleaner neither.

485
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:51,512
You're a weed dealer with a front.

486
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,410
And these are my employees.

487
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:56,290
What do you do if somebody actually
calls to get his house cleaned?

488
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:59,310
Then I refer him to my cousin
Xandra who cleans for real.

489
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:00,301
She don't make shit

490
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:02,623
but Xandra found the Lord so she don't care.

491
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,731
One day, we're gonna all retire
to a beach house in the Carribeans.

492
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:08,393
'Till some rapid god type shit happens

493
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:12,482
and washes everything away in a tidal
wave like those poor fuckers in Indonesia.

494
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:13,923
Not me.

495
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,291
Tsunami. It's called a tsunami.

496
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,593
I love the sound of that word.

497
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,581
Knowing you'll probably name the baby Tsunami.

498
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:24,262
I don't care what you say, that's a pretty name.

499
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:28,360
You are not naming my grandbaby
after some killer wave!

500
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:30,610
And we ain't getting no beach house neither.

501
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,120
I can't stand the sand.

502
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,511
Sand, blood and realty.

503
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,223
They never get rid of.

504
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:41,691
See you all later.

505
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,650
How much you think we'd get for that?

506
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:47,712
Nothing.

507
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:51,341
She'll be back.

508
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,202
Oh shit!

509
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:07,753
Oh you have no idea.

510
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:10,441
Wait, let's not do this here.

511
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:11,111
No?

512
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:12,321
Where should we go?

513
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:13,451
A motel?

514
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:15,461
My poolhouse maybe?

515
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:18,431
How about up my husband's ass?

516
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:23,121
We need to go somewhere where
we can get very, very drunk.

517
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:24,940
I'm a mean drunk.

518
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:26,522
Let's go.

519
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:33,060
He was cute, funny, clean,...

520
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,202
Married!

521
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:35,531
To me.

522
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:38,841
It's not like we're running
off together. It was sex.

523
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,831
Very hot sex.

524
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:44,102
He went down on me for days!

525
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:47,380
Always did excellent work down there.

526
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,461
Piece of shit!

527
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:51,870
Is that what you think?

528
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,000
He's shit?

529
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:58,692
When you stop being cute
and clean and funny at home,

530
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:00,592
and start spending afternoons

531
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,420
with your head buried in
the snatch of a tennis pro,

532
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:07,041
yeah, you're a piece of shit.

533
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:08,381
Are you going to divorce him?

534
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:09,523
Divorce...

535
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,220
He can't support two households.

536
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:16,080
And I am not living in a townhouse again.

537
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:20,241
So what did you do that was so special?

538
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,143
I did everything he ever wanted.

539
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,783
Costumes, roleplaying...

540
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:28,283
I bought a fucking swing.

541
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,361
Listen, most guys cheat.

542
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:34,320
And it's not because the wife
is some horrible, frigid bitch.

543
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:39,203
But it's because they all have
this primal urge to seek variety.

544
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,403
Pieces of shit!

545
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:41,920
Dean is a good guy!

546
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:43,332
You know, shut up!

547
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:45,713
I'm very mad at him.

548
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:49,351
He's just not what I thought he'd be, you know?

549
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:50,432
Which was?

550
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,421
Rich,

551
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:53,282
powerful,

552
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:54,920
faithful.

553
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:59,270
He just turned out to be
another mid-level asshole.

554
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:02,833
That makes me Mrs. Mid-level Asshole!

555
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,871
That's why I'll never marry!

556
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:08,401
No, you just fucked the married and
then I have to watch it on video.

557
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,501
and now I have to fucking deal with it

558
00:26:10,596 --> 00:26:12,762
and I don't like dealing with things.

559
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,342
I much prefer to pretend they don't exist.

560
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:18,833
I'm sorry.

561
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,550
You're a big whore.

562
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:25,201
I think I should go now.

563
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,793
Oh sit your flat ass back down.

564
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,063
You're a good listener.

565
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,152
Thanks!

566
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:34,343
Fuck you!

567
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:36,201
Let's get another round.

568
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,472
Hey, Nancy!

569
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:01,521
Where is your...

570
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,591
Where is your ring?

571
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,253
My ring?

572
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,391
Yeah, your pretty little diamond ring.

573
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:13,161
It's in the shop.

574
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:17,391
Oh! Well, I hope they can fix it.

575
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:22,651
Yes, me too, Celia. Thanks!

576
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:23,661
Yeah.

577
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:46,123
We can fix this. Everything
is gonna be okay, buddy.

578
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:47,303
You got that, mom?

579
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:50,200
Dad made it all...

580
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:05,180
Mom?

581
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:07,251
Yeah, honey? What is it?

582
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:08,682
What happened?

583
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:16,732
I guess when you fell, the camera got smashed.

584
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:19,533
Yeah.

585
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:23,083
Yeah, I guess that's what happened.

586
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:23,952
Yeah.

587
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,293
Don't worry, we'll get another one.

588
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:30,253
Okay.

589
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:44,440
Ambien?

590
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,292
Take them, you need to rest.

591
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,222
What are you gonna do?

592
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:52,341
Nothing. Really.

593
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:55,633
I'm not going to do a thing.

594
00:28:57,177 --> 00:29:00,543
Look, I take one myself.

595
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:09,080
See?

596
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,332
Good night.

597
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:28,402
I am your father, Shane!

598
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:32,781
Join me on the dark side and
together we can rule the universe!

599
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:33,803
Never!

600
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,791
Then prepare to die!

601
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,282
Ah ah!

602
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,221
Get back in here right now.

603
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:45,313
We are not done talking.

604
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,651
Just say good night, dad.

605
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,153
And turn off the camera.

606
00:29:50,978 --> 00:29:52,422
Good night, dad.
