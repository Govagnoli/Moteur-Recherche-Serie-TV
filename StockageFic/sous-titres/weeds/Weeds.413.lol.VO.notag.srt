<i>Previously on </i>Weeds...

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,915
Guillermo Garcia Gomez.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,265
There's a tunnel.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,764
You make a bust, you get Guillermo,
and it never comes back to me.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,391
Why are we focusing on my crew?

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,845
My people don't talk.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,187
When did we decide
you were gonna move your plants?

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,515
Something kind of fell into my lap.

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,942
- Where exactly is this grow room?
- Back of a cheese shop.

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,277
I could get some pot.

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,320
You totally rock.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,323
- Maria and I had sex.
- What?

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,825
- I love him.
- Department of immigration.

14
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,355
We happen to have a daughter out there
who hasn't seen you in over two years.

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,115
I don't know where Quinn is.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,582
She's living in Oaxaca
with a guy named Rudolpho.

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,834
Who are the girls?

18
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:45,480
My daughters.

19
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,921
What am I supposed to do now?

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,340
We'll arrest you tomorrow,
make it look right.

21
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,261
We'll pretend to ask,
and you'll pretend to know nothing.

22
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,264
- If you don't have any plans...
- I'm seeing someone.

23
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,016
Agent Shlatter.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,936
Who is the informant?

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,192
Nancy Botwin.

27
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,105
<i>Si, señor.</i>

28
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:11,172
- My client reserves the right...
- Shut the fuck up.

29
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,845
So, you had no idea that there
was a tunnel in the back room

30
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,521
that was being used
to transport narcotics

31
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,748
from Mexico to the United States?

32
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,139
They kept the room locked.

33
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,916
And it didn't strike you as odd
that strange men were shuttling packages

34
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,405
out of there all day long?

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,494
Of course it struck me as odd,
but I didn't ask any questions

36
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,316
because a paycheck is a paycheck.

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,475
There is no law against being
the unwitting participant in a crime

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,573
if there is no prior
knowledge of said crime.

39
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,393
Thank you

40
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,328
for that fascinating tidbit.

41
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,770
I don't

42
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:03,099
actually turn 18 until 10:47,

43
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,965
so we got another 15 minutes
to break the law.

44
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,167
We really shouldn't
be wasting it by talking.

45
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,405
- Who's that?
- Damn it! He said noon!

46
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,656
- Who said noon?
- Just get dressed.

47
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,243
- Hey, guys.
- This is nice.

48
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,235
- Very nice.
- What are you doing here?

49
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:27,145
Rad told me it was a special occasion.
Your boyfriend's 18th birthday?

50
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,959
Rad, I want you to leave the room
and shut the door behind you, okay?

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,001
Twinkie, smile.
Family-court judge is gonna love this.

52
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,646
Sole custody is the only thing
that makes sense.

53
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:39,585
Rad shouldn't have
to shuttle to Napa

54
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,585
because you fell in love with
some tasting-room tramp from Trefethen.

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,865
- Yeah, I still love my kid.
- Then live near him.

56
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,455
You took the cheese store and the house.
You're not taking my son.

57
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,076
- You left us.
- I left you.

58
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,165
I want to make sure
someone's looking after my son

59
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,147
while you're getting high
and banging 'Nsync.

60
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:57,299
Funny, you were never that concerned
about Rad while you were cheating.

61
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:59,852
Maybe I wouldn't have cheated
if you weren't such a fucking bitch.

62
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,305
That's great. Blame me.

63
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,616
Sorry, dude.

64
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,255
- You leaving?
- I want you out of here right now.

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,745
- Get out.
- I'm her legal repre...

66
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,607
Get out, or I'll fucking
throw you through the window.

67
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,234
It's okay, Dean. Go.

68
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,570
No, it is definitely not okay.
I'm her...

69
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,377
This is a flagrant
miscarriage of justice!

70
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,463
My partner is dead.

71
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:56,815
Oh, my god.

72
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,548
His body was found hanging
on the border fence.

73
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,176
He didn't have a fucking face.

74
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,420
No face?

75
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,223
Who owns the tunnel?

76
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,147
Who owns the fucking tunnel?

77
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,815
You tell me now!

78
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,192
I don't know.

79
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,402
Bullshit!

80
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,656
Who's Guillermo's boss?

81
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,597
Who's the fucking animal
on the other side of the fence?

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,045
I wasn't
on the other side of the fence.

83
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,498
I was on this side.

84
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:37,878
I'm gonna get this guy,

85
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:39,279
with

86
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,621
or without you.

87
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,637
And I'm gonna kill him...

88
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,717
after I kill everyone he loves.

89
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,556
And I'm gonna do it alone.

90
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,695
And if I find out...

91
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:00,526
you made me go the long way,

92
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,929
I'm gonna kill you, too.

93
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,527
He was my partner.

94
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,745
<i>No buso directo.</i>

95
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,208
How muchas tickets do I need?

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,000
First to San Nicolas.
Then to San Cristóbal.

97
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,394
That chicken just sneezed on me.

98
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,814
- Then to Mixtepec.
- All right, what about...

99
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,892
<i>sitio de perdido</i>?

100
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,815
That's where I need to go.
That's where my daughter is.

101
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,995
Give them to your daughter.

102
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,468
Beautiful movie star?

103
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,126
Kathleen Turner.
<i>Body heat</i>. Is it you?

104
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,983
Of course it's me.

105
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,805
But don't tell anyone.

106
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,590
I'm researching a film.

107
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,593
You know, donkey here
was an actor in live show.

108
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,255
- You don't say.
- No, I say.

109
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:15,249
Then he got replaced by a younger
donkey because his cojones...

110
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,895
they grow muy droopy.

111
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,673
Time is cruel.

112
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,053
Hey, mom.

113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,475
You didn't have
to have her deported.

114
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,080
- But you had to screw her, right?
- Yeah, she's hot.

115
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,758
But the I.N.S.?

116
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,175
She wouldn't fuck me.

117
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,575
But she fucked you.

118
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,013
Well, fuck her... and fuck you!

119
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,100
That was really awful, Doug...
even for you.

120
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,855
There are rules among men. Codes.

121
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,755
You don't have sex with
your friend's girl... ever!

122
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,235
- Code breaker!
- You had sex with Celia,

123
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,885
your friend Dean's wife!

124
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,278
So who's the original code breaker,
code breaker.

125
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,255
Me. I'm a code breaker.

126
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,741
Me, too. Me, too.

127
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,203
- Sorry, man.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,706
I really liked her.

129
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:25,001
You didn't really "like her" like her.
She was a fantasy.

130
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,756
You're still too in love with Dana
to "like" like anyone.

131
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,584
Well, you're in love with Nancy.

132
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,197
- I'm not in love with Nancy.
- You so are.

133
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:38,574
Why else would you put up
with all her crap?

134
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,170
The kids.

135
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,789
My brother.

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,450
I don't love Nancy, okay? Shut up.

137
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,775
- You shut up.
- So, you shut up.

138
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:58,287
Hold that thought.

139
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,416
Hi, Silas, son of my dead brother.

140
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:05,323
Where?

141
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,993
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

142
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,090
- I got to go.
- You want to smoke out first?

143
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I can't. Shit's blowing up.

144
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,385
How come you always
have shit blowing up?

145
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,795
Where's my shit?

146
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
I used to. It used to blow up
all the time. Now nothing.

147
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:21,954
Shit just sits there.

148
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,479
That's some tough shit.

149
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:25,869
Shit.

150
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:35,781
Sure it won't get towed?

151
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,455
It's a secure lot.
It'll be fine for a night.

152
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,875
Put the sandwiches in the freezer.
And then as soon as I reach Doug,

153
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,333
we'll move it all to his house.

154
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,168
Happy birthday, Silas.

155
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,462
Holy shit.

156
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,839
That's right. Happy birthday.

157
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,427
I'm such a phasehead.
Why didn't you say anything?

158
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,719
18, right?

159
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,375
- It's not a big deal.
- Sure, it's a big deal.

160
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,433
Could you stop playing
that fucking piano?

161
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,317
- Look who's not in jail.
- Told you I'd be back.

162
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,362
- What happened?
- Nothing.

163
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,571
Asked me a few questions.

164
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,046
Sent me home.

165
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:19,617
I'm just a salesgirl.

166
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:20,994
Sure you are.

167
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,640
Happy birthday, Silas.

168
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,035
Have a good time with Lisa tonight.

169
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,252
Dinner's off. We're off.

170
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,331
- Happy birthday to me.
- What?

171
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:36,802
Well, why don't we all go out, then?

172
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:40,466
How about that Italian place
on Ocean, say 7:00?

173
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,059
I'm gonna go... take a bath.

174
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,595
Mom... remember
that small-business loan we discussed?

175
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,358
It would be a great birthday gift.

176
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,819
Are you gonna back me or not?

177
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,672
- This is a bad time.
- And?

178
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,865
And it's a bad time.

179
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,576
Thanks for giving it some thought.

180
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,971
Hi, it's me.

181
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,715
How was your day?

182
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:17,886
Okay.

183
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,966
I got taken into custody,
questioned, released.

184
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
<i>And?</i>

185
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,145
Had pancakes for breakfast.

186
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,939
Really? What kind?

187
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,150
Blueberry.

188
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,030
What did you have for breakfast?

189
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Yogurt...

190
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,616
and coffee and toast.

191
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,927
Sounds like a nice breakfast.

192
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,029
I'd like to see you.

193
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,630
- I'd like to see you, too.
- Tonight.

194
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,633
Tonight?

195
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,469
I will send a car.

196
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,746
Has to be tonight?

197
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,187
I can drive myself.

198
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,605
You will come.

199
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,024
I said I would.

200
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
<i>Te amo.</i>

201
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,284
<i>Yo también.</i>

202
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,360
Go away, Andy.

203
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,765
Can I come in?

204
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:00,755
I'm coming in.

205
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:15,669
Could you close the door behind you?

206
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,020
- I can see your boobies.
- Good for you.

207
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:22,110
Close the door and sit down.

208
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,689
They're nice.

209
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,609
Bigger than I thought.

210
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:41,781
Thanks.

211
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,045
You want a towel or something?

212
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,783
Two washcloths?

213
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,535
- Andy.
- Fine. Fine.

214
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,320
Are you going to jail?

215
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,667
- I'm not going to jail.
- Why not? Why aren't you going to jail?

216
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,587
- I can't tell you.
- You have to tell me.

217
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,173
I can't. I can't tell anyone.

218
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,316
Could you turn
on the water for me...

219
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,271
- add some bubbles?
- Yeah, sure.

220
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:31,208
I used to be able to rationalize
the things I did, Andy.

221
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:37,307
You were good at that.

222
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,520
Not anymore.

223
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,662
At some point recently,
everything became right or wrong.

224
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,926
Right or wrong.

225
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:05,278
What did you do?

226
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,937
There was this girl...

227
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,707
in a blue dress.

228
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,187
She was so young.

229
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,153
She had this bag
with a butterfly on it.

230
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,196
She kept looking at me.

231
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:24,428
"Dear Dana...

232
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,775
"I can't believe
how different Ren Mar is than Agrestic,

233
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,698
"how fast things move down
by the ocean.

234
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,158
"I saw a surfer once
when I was a kid,

235
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,528
"but now they're everywhere.

236
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,708
"Beach went
and got itself in a big damn hurry.

237
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,575
"Found myself a crappy studio apartment
off the boardwalk.

238
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,284
"It's nothing fancy,
but it does the job.

239
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,071
"I have trouble sleeping.

240
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:53,665
"The bed's too short.

241
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,816
"I have bad dreams like I'm falling

242
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,460
"or I live in Africa
with the monkeys.

243
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,040
"I wake up scared.

244
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,229
"Sometimes it takes me while
to remember where I am.

245
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,867
"Since losing you,

246
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,442
"I've lost all sense
of joy and pleasure.

247
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,219
"Only one thing left to do."

248
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,482
Oh, God.

249
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,008
Legendary!

250
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:00,335
"So fuck you and your lawyers.
Come get me if you want.

251
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,345
"I don't give a shit,
because I'm broke.

252
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,420
"And when you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

253
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,503
"Take care. Doug."

254
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,133
Thank you, Rodrigo.

255
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:14,614
Rudolpho.

256
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:21,983
He seems very nice.

257
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,351
How did you two meet?

258
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,209
He taught at Casa Reforma.

259
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:28,952
Political science.

260
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,986
- Now he's working on his dissertation.
- This is good. What is it?

261
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:36,365
It's a secret recipe from my mother.

262
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,245
- How long have you been sober, mom?
- 17 days.

263
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,261
Good for you.

264
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,124
That's why I'm here.

265
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,550
I am working my steps,

266
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,005
making amends.

267
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,380
I came here to say I'm sorry.

268
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,347
Very, very, very sorry.

269
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:57,472
Really

270
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,055
and truly sorry.

271
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,989
So sorry.

272
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,559
Should I get more specific?

273
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:06,895
I think we're way past that, mom.

274
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:10,231
You know, Casa Reforma was
actually really good for me.

275
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,190
I met this man I love,
and we just...

276
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:15,278
live.

277
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,114
Humbly, simply.

278
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,199
My life has purpose.

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,125
It's very hot. Are you hot?

280
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,614
And I'm just so glad
that you came here to see me

281
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,710
so that I could tell you that

282
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,959
and tie you up and lock you
in a room and keep you there

283
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,630
until I sell your ass
back into suburban slavery...

284
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,716
you fucking bitch.

285
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:38,101
Fucking...

286
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,934
- Shall I call your father now?
- Yes.

287
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:51,064
Tell daddy Dean I want $200,000,
and tell him to be quick with the cash.

288
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,690
Or we're gonna start
sending him body parts.

289
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,739
Revolution is a very sad affair.

290
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,905
But these tears are shed
in the name of greater good.

291
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:03,421
Well, fuck you
and your faggy revolution.

292
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:06,246
I'm taking my money,
and I'm moving to Belize.

293
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,405
San Diego, California.

294
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,953
I need the number of...

295
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,339
a gift store... place.

296
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,615
Gift something.

297
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,341
<i>I have nothing listing
for "gift store" in San Diego.</i>

298
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,720
- <i>Do you have an address?</i>
- I don't have an address.

299
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,798
I just need to get a gift.
If you type in "gift," what comes up?

300
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,519
<i>I need the name of a listing.</i>

301
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:33,140
Please, anything gift.

302
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:35,865
<i>Terrifically Gift Baskets?</i>

303
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:37,765
Do they deliver?

304
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,390
<i>I have no idea, ma'am.</i>

305
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:41,206
<i>Connecting your call.</i>

306
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,135
<i>Terrifically Gift Baskets.
This is Carol.</i>

307
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,365
Hi, Carol.

308
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,690
I need to get a birthday gift
for my 18-year-old.

309
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,215
Can you help me?

310
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,305
<i>We sure can.</i>

311
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,851
<i>What kind of basket
were you thinking of?</i>

312
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,335
Can you deliver to Ren Mar tonight?

313
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:02,415
<i>For an extra charge, we sure can.</i>

314
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
Great.

315
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:06,502
What have you got?

316
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,665
<i>How about one of our theme baskets?</i>

317
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,087
<i>Casino Night,
Chocolate Universe, Gay Paree?</i>

318
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,939
Do you have anything for a son

319
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:19,782
who thinks
his mother's completely failed him?

320
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,130
We can still go
to the restaurant, you guys.

321
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:25,348
It's fine.

322
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,079
Did she even say
where she was going?

323
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:33,708
Why do you even bother asking anymore?
We never get a straight answer.

324
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,419
We have no idea.
We probably never will.

325
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:41,007
- Sometimes I wish she'd get arrested.
- What the hell are you talking about?

326
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,985
At least we'd know where she is.

327
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,010
And, seriously,
isn't it only a matter of time?

328
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,302
What happens when mom gets arrested?
We need to make a plan.

329
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,935
Well, I'm 18 now.
I can be your legal guardian.

330
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,562
- What about me?
- You can still hang out.

331
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,812
Hang out?

332
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,484
I am the adult male figurehead here.

333
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,796
Come on, Andy.

334
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,313
You don't act like an adult.
None of us do.

335
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:06,282
We're all a bunch of babies,
waiting for mom to make the money...

336
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,743
always looking for mommy's approval,

337
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,810
asking mommy's permission.

338
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,690
Shane's right.

339
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,576
She's unreliable.

340
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,278
She's unavailable.

341
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,725
It's time for us to take on
some responsibility,

342
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,754
because, for all we know,
she's going to prison.

343
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,341
- Or worse.
- What do you mean?

344
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,650
Nothing. She's fine.

345
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,931
I'm thinking of buying
some land in Mexico.

346
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,600
Really? With what?

347
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:35,311
I made a few bucks
from the cheese shop.

348
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,525
I'm gonna price it out.
Nothing crazy.

349
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,275
Just a nice little farm
where I can grow pot,

350
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,987
maybe sell to the clubs,

351
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,072
a few customers, but that's it.

352
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:49,511
No stupid expansion.
No stupid mistakes.

353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Small...

354
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:54,893
mellow...

355
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:57,856
so I don't drop dead
of a heart attack

356
00:22:57,981 --> 00:23:01,504
because I'm so stressed from trying
to maintain this bullshit lifestyle.

357
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,384
I got a little cash
from the coyote gig.

358
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,305
- You want a partner?
- I'll take your money.

359
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,865
What about me?

360
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,226
You go to school and be a kid.

361
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,271
- I want to help.
- You can help by not telling mom.

362
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,125
That's not a problem.
I have nothing to say to mom.

363
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:23,805
Let's stop bagging
on your mom, okay?

364
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,901
She has done some less-than-prudent
or thoughtful things, but she's Nancy.

365
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,588
And we love her, all of us.

366
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:34,522
Love...

367
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,362
her...

368
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:40,141
in a mom-loving way.

369
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:46,075
- Not in any other way.
- Of course we love her.

370
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,218
She loves us, too.
But whatever, man. It's useless.

371
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,636
I'm getting a popsicle. Anyone want?

372
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,682
- No, thanks.
- Yes. I would like a popsicle.

373
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,985
<i>Security code 4-8-7, right?</i>

374
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,255
That's right.

375
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,315
<i>Well, great.
We're all set with that.</i>

376
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,787
<i>Now, what would you
like the card to say?</i>

377
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,070
"Dear Silas."

378
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,550
Silas?

379
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,781
S-I-L-A-S. That's my son.

380
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,595
- "Dear Silas."
- <i>Dear Silas</i>.

381
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,049
"Happy birthday.
Happy 18th birthday."

382
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,154
Don't write "um."

383
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:34,915
"I think you're an amazing son.

384
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,241
"I'm so proud

385
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:40,221
"to be your mom."

386
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,009
"Be your mom."

387
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,393
That sounds like bullshit,
doesn't it?

388
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:52,645
"Dear Silas, if you never see me again,
I've probably been murdered.

389
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,225
"Enjoy the dried apricots
and butter cookies."

390
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:57,719
<i>The Sterling Celebration
doesn't come with butter cookies.</i>

391
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:00,235
<i>But if you'd like to add them,
I certainly can do that...</i>

392
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,209
Could you stop talking for a second?
Could you please be quiet and listen?

393
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,803
Just listen.

394
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:07,739
<i>I'm listening.</i>

395
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:09,445
Starting over.

396
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,101
"Dear Silas...

397
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,269
"Thanks for raising yourself

398
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,396
"these past 18 years.

399
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,708
"You've...

400
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,583
"done a great job."

401
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,794
<i>Ms. Botwin?</i>

402
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:42,479
<i>Are you okay, Ms. Botwin?</i>

403
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,442
"Silas...

404
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:07,352
"You are loved. Me."

405
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,105
Sign it "me."

406
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,475
<i>Just "me"?</i>

407
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,493
Yeah, "me."
No, "mom."

408
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:14,447
"Me, mom."

409
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,965
Please, please
get that to him tonight.

410
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,965
And add the butter cookies.

411
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,955
You can charge me
extra for it, okay?

412
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,959
Thanks, Carol.

413
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,013
<i>You take care, Ms. Botwin.</i>

414
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,328
I don't want to believe it.

415
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,176
So don't.

416
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,064
I thought you loved me.

417
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,362
I do love you.

418
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,268
You have made me

419
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,565
so sad.

420
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,294
Well, I think I can make you happy.

421
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:44,620
It's too late.

422
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,641
It's too early to tell,

423
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,171
but it feels like a boy.
