4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,692
Now, that's a real gun
pressed against your head.

5
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:18,502
Real bullets inside it.

6
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:21,241
Look at me.

7
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:24,651
Now, you look way outside
your world right now,

8
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,781
but you need to tell your brain
to tell your mouth to tell me

9
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,618
what you were doing outside
my warehouse with this thing.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,541
- What's your name?
- Guillermo.

11
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:40,781
But that's my name.

12
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,702
How you know my name?

13
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,840
- How she know my name?
- I don't want to die!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,171
- How you fucking know my name?
- She's with me.

15
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,596
Is that right? What's her name?

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,306
It's Celia.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,551
He wasn't talking to you.

18
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,371
She's my backup.

19
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,521
Fucking bitch was supposed
to stay in the car!

20
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:03,440
- Why am I hearing about this now?
- I don't know.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,017
Why didn't you tell me
about not putting drugs in my car

22
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:08,969
or Lento the criminal
or the Tijuana police?

23
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:12,200
Isn't that how it works around here...
nobody tells anybody anything?

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,757
Why she taking pictures?

25
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,247
I don't know. Very good question.
Give me that.

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,972
Why are you taking pictures?

27
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:22,098
Why are you taking pictures?

28
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,422
I was... scrapbooking?

29
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:27,887
Damn!

30
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,176
Nobody hits my fucking crew.
That's my job!

31
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,527
That gun's loaded, <i>Blanca</i>.

32
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:34,889
You hear that, fucko? Gun's loaded.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,308
Back off, man. Back away.

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,760
Celia, get in the fucking Prius.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,440
- No, no, no.
- She fucked up. It's on me.

36
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,863
You damn right it's on you.

37
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,773
I'll take care of it.
Get in the goddamn car now!

38
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,572
Give me the tooth.

39
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,798
Open the gate, please.

40
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:55,201
- This is some sloppy shit.
- Agreed.

41
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:58,314
You make this go away, okay?
We got a date tonight.

42
00:01:58,434 --> 00:01:59,873
- It's done.
- Don't forget.

43
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,280
Always thought the border would be flat.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,258
Total popular misconception.

45
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,780
It's quite the workout.

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,563
Calves feeling the burn.

47
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,363
- Neck feeling the burn.
- <i>Esperen</i>.

48
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,233
All right.

49
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:29,006
Are those pepitas? I love pepitas.

50
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:33,754
Thanks.

51
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,127
<i>Gracias.</i>

52
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:37,817
Looks real, right?

53
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,500
Sure. Much, much smaller.

54
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,024
Pigs can get huge.

55
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:45,890
They had them on a commune
that I crashed at for a while.

56
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,501
There was this girl,

57
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:50,882
and there was this charismatic
leader guy who slept with the girl.

58
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,983
I could make one of you,
with the hair and everything.

59
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,310
How much would you pay for that?

60
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,393
A marzipan portrait.

61
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:00,691
Marzipandy.

62
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,352
Yeah, at least $10.

63
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,543
Did you just say
that you missed your mother?

64
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:34,758
Come here.

65
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,797
¡Vamos, rapido!
¡Vamos, piruja!

66
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,991
Pay your fare, gabacho.

67
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:54,948
Right. Okay.

68
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:56,991
Let's see.

69
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,110
Here we go.

70
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,872
- $6?
- That's like 6,000 pesos.

71
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,341
No, no. Not my
"fall guy" belt buckle.

72
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,054
- This is a limited edition. Very nice.
- ¡Rapido!

73
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,724
- Here you go. That's one of a hundred.
- Get in. Get in.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,262
<i>Hello, phone caller. This is Andrew.
Andrew Botwin.</i>

75
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,105
<i>It pains me we couldn't make
this instant human connection.</i>

76
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:32,657
<i>Leave a message, and while you do it,
imagine me listening to it,</i>

77
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,463
<i>where I might be at the time,
what I might be wearing.</i>

78
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,200
This is me.
Got a little delayed.

79
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,298
I'm on my way now.

80
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,096
I'm thinking you probably don't have
cell reception where you are,

81
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:49,299
so you probably won't hear this
before I reach you,

82
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,587
but it's making me feel better, and
it's preventing me from killing Celia

83
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:55,377
at the moment.
I forgot to open with that.

84
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,371
Celia Hodes is sitting
next to me in the car,

85
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,094
all the way from Agrestic.

86
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,128
How did she get here? I don't know.

87
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:05,236
But when I hear the unbelievably stupid
reason that comes out of her mouth,

88
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,157
I'm gonna fucking kill her!

89
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:10,090
So there may be a dead body

90
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,043
in the car when I get there.
That's just a heads-up.

91
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:14,824
I'll be there soon.

92
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:17,944
And your outgoing message is creepy.
Please change it.

93
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,660
I want my tooth back.

94
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,859
You don't get your tooth back.

95
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,497
I keep your tooth.

96
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,704
I drill a tiny hole in it and wear it
around my neck.

97
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:31,918
I become your god.

98
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,014
I can explain.

99
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,670
- All right.
- Okay.

100
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,639
Explain.

101
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:41,364
Explain.

102
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:44,451
What are you doing with that?

103
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,887
Closets don't get towed.

104
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,395
- Just need a little ventilation.
- Mom doesn't want those in the house.

105
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,460
Mom isn't gonna find out.

106
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,816
Doors stay locked, Lenny's gone,

107
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,818
and no one talks.

108
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,947
- Hey, dude. What's going on?
- Teenage rebellion.

109
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,116
Fuck yeah. Stick it to the old people.

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,912
- What are you doing here?
- I'm eating cereal.

111
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:12,235
I mean why are you here in our house,
Mr. Wilson?

112
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,979
- Where's your family?
- My family left me, buddy.

113
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,349
My life's a toilet.

114
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,535
These cornflakes, they're old.

115
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,417
My asshole is on fire.

116
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,969
I hate myself.
You happy now?

117
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,336
Check this out.

118
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,224
What is it?

119
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:34,945
It's honey.

120
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:38,560
That could have lead in it, or asbestos.

121
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:40,445
You're a fucking downer.

122
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,136
Honey flakes.

123
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,407
Don't you wish you had some?

124
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,744
Inquisitor, ruiner of days,
child of the apocalypse.

125
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,425
Bees. Wait.

126
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:53,297
Bees bad.

127
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,207
Swarm! It's a swarm!

128
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,190
And they put a fucking fire hose
through my car

129
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,232
and shoved me on a cot

130
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:08,005
and then they pulled me
from the rec center,

131
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,099
threw me into an interrogation room,

132
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,393
and you left me there.
All right, granted, you weren't there,

133
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:16,565
but your people were there,
and they lied for you.

134
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,107
And they put me in jail,

135
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,776
where I was abused!

136
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,408
And this man gave me a chance.

137
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:26,032
He is giving both of us a chance here.

138
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:30,059
All he wants is for us
to help him get that...

139
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:33,154
- Guillermo person.
- Get out of the car.

140
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,401
I need a second to take all of this in.

141
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,024
Oh, my God.

142
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:46,096
You put a fucking gun in my mouth
and you need a moment alone.

143
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,316
Okay, be a bigger person, Celia.

144
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:53,616
<i>Imagine me listening to it,
where I might be at the time,</i>

145
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:55,436
<i>what I might be wearing.</i>

146
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,469
<i>Let that guide you.</i>

147
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,049
Andy...

148
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:02,798
It's me.

149
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06,474
I'm back in the desert.
Your cooler's here.

150
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:08,113
You're not.

151
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:16,024
I'm sorry I got here late.
It wasn't my fault.

152
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,799
Actually, it probably was my fault.

153
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,519
In a grand sense,
everything is my fault.

154
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,382
It's all my fault.

155
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,642
Please call.

156
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:32,123
This isn't happening!

157
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:33,923
Nancy?

158
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:41,440
We're gonna figure this out.

159
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,719
It's okay.

160
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:44,626
It's okay.

161
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,906
I forgive you.

162
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,232
I know this is overwhelming.

163
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:55,378
I know

164
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,708
that you didn't mean
to leave me in prison.

165
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:05,111
You hit that...
window-button thing by accident.

166
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,371
- Do you believe in reincarnation?
- I don't know!

167
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,972
- I don't know!
- I do.

168
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,102
You've proven it to me.
You want to know how?

169
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:19,621
Yes!

170
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,882
You've made me a believer because...

171
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:26,116
there is nothing I have done
in this life

172
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:30,143
to accumulate the massive dose
of fucked-up karma

173
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,617
you have brought my way, Celia!

174
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,674
So now it's all making sense!

175
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,831
Being tested for something I did to you
in a previous life

176
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:41,302
because in this life,

177
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:45,171
where I've repeatedly allowed you
to fuck me over a fence!

178
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,631
Whatever I do, you keep coming back.

179
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,275
So...

180
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:55,128
I accept your forgiveness
for my previous crimes,

181
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:59,021
and I want to thank you for bringing me
to a more enlightened state of being.

182
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:02,074
Please don't step on the gas again.

183
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:07,537
And now,

184
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,703
if you so choose,

185
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:11,764
you can get back in the car,

186
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,157
sit silently,

187
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:14,765
let me try to...

188
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:18,284
figure out how to save our asses
on the way to the mall.

189
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,187
Would you like that?

190
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,396
Davenport, Iowa.

191
00:10:36,273 --> 00:10:37,477
Never been there.

192
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,725
Heard it's cold in the winter.
You bring a parka?

193
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,030
Big boats.

194
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:42,022
Ocean.

195
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:44,563
Fishermen.

196
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,732
Dorado,

197
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:47,964
marlin,

198
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,235
shark.

199
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:52,071
In Davenport?
I'm fairly sure Iowa's landlocked.

200
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,184
Tuna,

201
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:55,783
mahimahi. Big.

202
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,234
Where the hell are you?

203
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,178
Outlet mall with Celia?

204
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,725
Guess where I am.
In a pudding truck.

205
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,085
I'll tell you about it later.

206
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,850
You're breaking up.

207
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:17,476
You're breaking up!

208
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:20,975
Sorry.

209
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:23,115
Okay, there. Got it.

210
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:24,445
Good.

211
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,648
How much is the bus to San Francisco?

212
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,442
From San Diego? 83 dollars.

213
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,902
83 dollars is...

214
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,154
1,500 lempira.

215
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:36,198
- Oh, lempira? You're Honduran?
- Si. Yoro.

216
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,191
Yoro?

217
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,079
I love Yoro. I went
to the <i>festival de la lluvia de peces</i>.

218
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:44,679
It actually rains fish!

219
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,856
It cost me 16,000 to get here from Yoro.

220
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,795
Coyote said
it was only going to be 10,000.

221
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:55,048
- He keeps raising the price.
- That's not fair.

222
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:57,845
I mean, a verbal contract
is still a contract.

223
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:00,761
One old lady was too slow.

224
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,391
He left her to die.

225
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,977
He charged us for water.

226
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:08,479
He broke that guy's arm,
and stole his necklace.

227
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,656
We're cargo.
We're...

228
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:13,110
pudding.

229
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,174
No man is pudding.

230
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,919
Mr. Wilson,
we could use your help out here.

231
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:32,612
Yeah, I got some problems in here.

232
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,965
- What's the matter?
- Very allergic to bees.

233
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,425
Face very swollen.

234
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:37,927
It's not worth it.

235
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,387
I got customers.

236
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,681
- I'll cut you in.
- 50%.

237
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,489
- 5%.
- 15%.

238
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,142
And I'm the sprayer.

239
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:48,495
Fine.

240
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,966
On three.

241
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,330
One...

242
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,830
two...

243
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:55,961
three.

244
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:08,544
- So, Captain Roy Till...
- You promised you wouldn't talk.

245
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,703
Stay right here where I can see you.

246
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:23,883
Can you ask that Guillermo
when I can get Pam's car back? 'Cause...

247
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:28,147
Try not to look homeless.

248
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,277
How's the day?

249
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:37,908
I've had worse.

250
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,067
I had a long talk with my...

251
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:42,283
associate.

252
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:43,995
Associate?

253
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:47,270
Damn. You already keep
too many secrets from me...

254
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,672
<i>tortillera.</i>

255
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:50,207
<i>Lesbiana.</i>

256
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,252
That's your girl outside, isn't it?

257
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,463
Celia?

258
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,466
Chewie took that camera over
to Rite Aid.

259
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,379
Must have thought
you were fucking around on her.

260
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,012
Following you everywhere.

261
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,475
She has trust issues.

262
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,521
Man, I've seen bitches like her.

263
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,146
Crazy stalker bitches.

264
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,956
Got her on a leash now.

265
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:15,618
This is yours.

266
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:18,456
This is the front room.

267
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,259
Window displays.

268
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:23,991
Back here, you got two dressing rooms
so the ladies have some privacy.

269
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:26,999
This is the back room.

270
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,103
There's a bathroom,

271
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,081
file cabinets.

272
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:36,649
We'll get you a safe in there
before you open.

273
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:40,572
So this is a front...

274
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,844
- where you launder money.
- It's a maternity store.

275
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:47,097
We sell comfort and fashion
to pregnant women.

276
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,732
- What am I not getting?
- This is your new job.

277
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,035
You work here.
We're making you manager.

278
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:58,067
How am I gonna make runs
if I'm running a store?

279
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:59,227
You don't.

280
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:00,653
We need your face here.

281
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,795
I don't want to work retail.

282
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:05,917
I want to traffic.

283
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,181
I got a family to support.
I put them through hell.

284
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:10,351
I owe them.

285
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,749
I've got to make a killing, all right?

286
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,945
So write it down.

287
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:22,068
Write down
how much you wanna make this year.

288
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:23,801
Just write it?

289
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:38,992
Ask for more.

290
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:44,530
Really?

291
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,033
I got to take it to the man above.
I only take it once.

292
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,934
No runs, no dealing, no more drugs.

293
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,758
You got to be clean,

294
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:04,964
professional.

295
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,608
Hire a staff.

296
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,546
People you can trust.
That's very important.

297
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:13,225
I need this place up
and running in a week.

298
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,016
<i>Blanca.</i>

299
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:20,457
I'm extremely, wildly confused.
You're gonna give me all that money

300
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:23,027
to manage
the San Ysidro maternity world?

301
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,095
I am.

302
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,632
But your...
Your gap-toothed girlfriend out there,

303
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:29,842
she makes minimum wage.

304
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:52,419
<i>Mira, cabrona.</i>

305
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,350
<i>Hombre</i>! Not cool!

306
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,602
<i>¿Que vas a hacer, cabrón?</i>

307
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,522
Shit. That's not a clean knife.

308
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,694
It's a gun, all right.
Let's all just mellow out.

309
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,731
Oh, my God! I shot you!

310
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,036
Oh, my God! I shot you in the knee!

311
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:17,192
I didn't know that I could shoot someone
in the knee. That's so random.

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,589
And yet brutal and life-changing.

313
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,919
I'm sorry, man.
Get the $6 that he took from me.

314
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,755
It's just you were coming at me
and you're such an asshole!

315
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:27,790
- Davenport, Iowa?
- Yeah, yeah. Davenport.

316
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,678
We're gonna get you there. And Marzipan.
You're both coming with me.

317
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:32,012
<i>Vente, vamonos.</i>

318
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:36,350
Who's the fall guy now, Coyote Ugly?

319
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:38,698
I just said that.

320
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,146
Did you guys hear that?
I totally said that.

321
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,635
So...

322
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,082
We've had a trying couple of weeks.

323
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,514
We lost our homes.

324
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:16,611
A bubbie.

325
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,128
But we have this food

326
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,611
and this lovely roof over our heads,

327
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,965
recent bee infestation excluded,

328
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,480
which my father-in-law has offered up

329
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,658
at a ridiculously inflated price.

330
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:37,317
I've had a particularly
challenging last 24 hours.

331
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:39,241
But...

332
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,608
But in the drive-through at Popeyes,

333
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,351
I found myself saying,

334
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,684
"Family combo, please"

335
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,132
and it was a moment of clarity.

336
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,175
What I mean to say,

337
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,464
I was thinking of you today.

338
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,117
Of all of you.

339
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:00,893
In the past,

340
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,413
I've dismissed you as being the kind
of guy you couldn't really count on.

341
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,232
And I was wrong.
You've been a rock for this family.

342
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:08,791
We need you.

343
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:12,181
Andy's friends,
I'd like to welcome you to our country.

344
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,135
I hope you get to stay.

345
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,218
Keep a low profile.

346
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:17,474
Blend.

347
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,072
I've been unavailable to you,
and that's rotten.

348
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,434
I will be more present.

349
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:30,214
You've taken on more responsibility

350
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:33,072
in a time of upheaval,
and it's been admirable.

351
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,696
We still need to talk about the G.E.D.

352
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:38,422
I'm sorry

353
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:40,641
you and Dana are having problems,

354
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:44,859
but you need to find
a place of your own to live,

355
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,407
and you need to seek medical attention.

356
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,059
And... finally, maybe,

357
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,106
possibly...

358
00:19:57,452 --> 00:19:59,873
I think I owe an apology
to the woman sitting to my right.

359
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:02,496
I left her holding a very big bag.

360
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,757
It was not my finest hour.
I'm sorry, Celia.

361
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,709
All of us are sorry!

362
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,586
- Sorry, Celia.
- Sorry, Ms. Hodes.

363
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:10,741
<i>Lo siento.</i>

364
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,676
So, she's going to be staying with us.

365
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,719
We will treat her as family.

366
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,528
You can sleep
in my room tonight, Celia.

367
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,928
Not in the bed.
There's a nice couch.

368
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:27,373
So now,

369
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:30,394
with that, let us enjoy

370
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,734
the wonderful dessert

371
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,571
our new friend, Reyna, has provided.

372
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,638
- Pigs.
- Pigs.

373
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:39,930
Cheers.

374
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,285
What about Till?

375
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:15,250
- Captain Till.
- The widow Scottson.

376
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,195
Or is it Botwin?

377
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,103
You need to back off.

378
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:21,116
Off of Celia. Off permanently.

379
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:22,618
Why would I do that?

380
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,203
Because you have a kind heart.

381
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,009
That's a good one. I like that.

382
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,664
"Kind heart."

383
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:33,923
Okay, sure.

384
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,542
Why the hell not?

385
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,217
You cop for the grow house,

386
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:40,667
deliver me Guillermo Garcia Gomez,

387
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:43,471
- the councilwoman walks.
- I got a better deal for you.

388
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:46,099
You can give me 3 more inches
on my dick?

389
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,810
You can listen and pretend
to be a gentleman.

390
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,647
I can play pretend.

391
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:56,704
You let me buy you a round,
you enjoy drinking it,

392
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:59,986
you remember that the grow house
burned down in the fire

393
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,894
and you have no physical evidence,

394
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:05,369
you forget Celia, you forget me,
you finish your drink, and you go home.

395
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:11,792
I don't know any Gomez.
If I did once, I don't anymore.

396
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:13,495
Not what I hear.

397
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:15,348
In fact...

398
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:18,395
I'd say other than Celia,

399
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:22,680
the one person you and I have in common
that I do know is Peter Scottson,

400
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,680
and I knew him very well.

401
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,880
- Old fucking news.
- Not that old.

402
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:34,083
We did a good job burying Pete.

403
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:35,938
Did you?

404
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,706
You look angry.

405
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:46,654
Captain Till, I didn't come here
to make you angry.

406
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,720
I came here to thank you.

407
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,784
You backed me into a corner,
and it worked. I got out.

408
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,048
Should have done it a long time ago.

409
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,166
I never made a lot of money at it.

410
00:22:57,545 --> 00:22:59,695
The few times I did, I got greedy,

411
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:01,912
found a way to lose it.

412
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:04,386
Got in with the wrong people,

413
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,811
endangered my family.
I was a bad drug dealer.

414
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,766
I know it now.
I'm trying something new.

415
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:11,244
Let me guess.

416
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:13,461
Feeding the homeless?

417
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,947
Nursing AIDS babies?

418
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:19,695
Still too selfish for that.

419
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:22,217
No, Captain Till.

420
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:25,689
I got what the world would call

421
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,701
a normal, boring job.

422
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:29,938
I wake up in the morning,

423
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,514
get dressed,

424
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,315
drive myself to work,

425
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:34,846
put on a name tag,

426
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:38,258
take my brain out of my skull,
and place it in a drawer.

427
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:42,232
I spend the next nine hours
smiling at people,

428
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:44,995
pretending to be interested
in their happiness,

429
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:47,864
tolerating the company of my co-workers,

430
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:49,916
staring at the clock.

431
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:52,726
At the end of the day,

432
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,340
I take my name tag off,

433
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,993
open the drawer, reach for my brain,

434
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,883
pop it back inside,

435
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,141
walk to the employee parking lot,
drive myself home.

436
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:05,238
And it's really, really,

437
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:07,044
really boring.

438
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,374
It looks like I'm gonna be doing it

439
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,827
for a long, long time.

440
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:46,510
Jesus!

441
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:50,158
<i>Abre!</i>

442
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:32,784
What the "f"?
