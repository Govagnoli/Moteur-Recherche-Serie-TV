1
00:00:01,373 --> 00:00:02,731
Previously on Weeds.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,514
I want a raise.

3
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:09,768
Alejandro is full of shit.

4
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:12,051
Because he can't sell his weed no more.

5
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,757
'Cause your Mrs. is doing it.

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,994
Shane shot a mountain lion, he wrote a gangsta rap,

7
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,179
now he's making terrorists videos.

8
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,556
I have cancer and jungle fever

9
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:23,891
and tonight one of them is going to get cured.

10
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,303
You have a husband!

11
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,445
You got a man?

12
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,053
He died of a heart attack.

13
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:29,474
Crap!

14
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,221
Who would do this?

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,293
Pennies?

16
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:34,451
Somebody mad at you, girl.

17
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,640
He's got a karate tournament.

18
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:59,633
Good morning, I'm Andrew Botwin.

19
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:02,921
On behalf on myself and my absent father

20
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:07,111
who's at the final table of the Foxworth 2005

21
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:09,970
pot-limit hold 'em classic...

22
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,121
Good luck, dad.

23
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:16,503
Judah was what the world would call

24
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:17,580
a man.

25
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:18,570
Jesus!

26
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:22,021
A man who...

27
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,203
did things.

28
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,242
He was an engineer,

29
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:27,433
a husband,

30
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,851
a father.

31
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,823
I'm not any of those things.

32
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:37,882
He was my brother and he's buried next to my mom, my uncle Sully.

33
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:41,562
Two away from Walter Matthau.

34
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,792
And well,

35
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,973
one day, I'll be buried here too.

36
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,821
And some time after that,

37
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,820
not very long actually,

38
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:54,813
I'll be completely forgotten.

39
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,370
I'm next.

40
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,500
Fabulous!

41
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:05,801
So what are you doing today?

42
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,632
Straightening up around the house.

43
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:08,863
Where's Blanca?

44
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,090
Saturday, Dean.

45
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:13,042
What about you?

46
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:13,983
Golf.

47
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,882
Where's Isabel?

48
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,713
Camping with her friend Peggy.

49
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,373
- Is that right?
- Hmm-hmm.

50
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,373
I fucked a black man.

51
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:33,043
This house still reeks of Judah.

52
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:36,041
All you gotta do is touch the wall and you can feel it.

53
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,912
It's bringing me down, Doug.

54
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:43,101
Well, if it means anything, you really got me with your speech.

55
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,520
Sometimes God's words are inside me.

56
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,180
You wanna smoke out?

57
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:48,650
Is the Pope polish?

58
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,351
- German.
- Right.

59
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:52,733
Make yourself at home.

60
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:55,391
Hey, Lupita. Order some pizzas from Mitch's.

61
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:57,993
Do I look like his fucking maid?

62
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,272
Pepperoni.

63
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:03,082
Stress queens, secret stash.

64
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,260
She keeps her pot with her tampons?

65
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:07,121
The box where men fear to trend.

66
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,491
You got that right.

67
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,271
What the...

68
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,502
What's the matter?

69
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,342
What the fuck!

70
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,711
Rodents.

71
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:24,813
Still don't understand why I can't stay at home.

72
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,321
I don't want you home alone.

73
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:29,462
I wouldn't be home alone. Lupita's there. Uncle Andy's there.

74
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:30,482
Megan's there!

75
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,140
Quit it!

76
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:33,843
You're up, Shane!

77
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,671
Is that who Shane is fighting?

78
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:38,561
Yes.

79
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:40,223
He's a lot bigger than me.

80
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,350
That means you'll be quicker.

81
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm not so sure about that.

82
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:44,962
He's a yellow belt just like you.

83
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:47,290
Now get out there and be Agrestic!

84
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:49,281
Yes, go! Kill!

85
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:06,893
F ight!

86
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,811
So... unbelievably sorry.

87
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:20,372
Shane has never done anything like this in his life.

88
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:22,321
We had a 3-hour drive here.

89
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,843
I forgot to pack crackers, he has low blood sugar.

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,451
We just came from his father's unveiling.

91
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:29,870
Do you know what that is?

92
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,351
An unveiling... it's a...

93
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:34,050
it's where they unveil the...

94
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:35,633
gravestone.

95
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,112
It's a Jewish thing.

96
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,152
I know, you think "she doesn't look Jewish".

97
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:46,052
I come from Walestock actually.

98
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,560
Lots of coalminers in Wales.

99
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:49,980
Not a lot of Jews.

100
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,073
I'm not Jewish, my husband is huh...

101
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,112
dead now.

102
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:55,152
He was Jewish.

103
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,463
Here's my number.

104
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:03,270
If I have to pay for it, I would be thrilled to pay for it

105
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,943
'cause I feel just awful about this.

106
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,501
Will you please say something?

107
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,592
It's  not my kid.

108
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:15,272
Just kidding. I'm Peter.

109
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,931
Isn't that the way it works around here?

110
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:23,621
Fuck somebody else, get a haircut!

111
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:27,103
Don't worry, the chimo will do the job soon enough, darling.

112
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:28,810
No! No, I'm sorry but no.

113
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:30,470
Chimo is not gonna be another excuse

114
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,841
for you to act like a selfish fucking bitch.

115
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,413
Selfish?

116
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:37,862
This from Ellen Chin's personal racket swallower?

117
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:40,813
And I am sorry but no, you may not use Ellen Chin either.

118
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,331
I have paid for Ellen Chin.

119
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:44,973
Wow! Look who's finally grown a sack!

120
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,353
Did you hear that?

121
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,102
- No!
- Lupita!

122
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,193
- No.
- Must be lonely inside here.

123
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:51,333
In the wall?

124
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,553
Yeah, it's gotta be dark in there.

125
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,570
Deep  space.

126
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,991
Friendless like an empty train tunnel.

127
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:59,273
Rats don't need light. I think they got radar.

128
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:01,673
Man, I use to love trains.

129
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:04,910
I always wanted to be the train conductor with the little hat and all.

130
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:06,660
But somewhere...

131
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,741
I don't know where...

132
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,223
I got derailed and end up a bean counter.

133
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,783
With no hat.

134
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:14,811
No hat.

135
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:16,920
No hat.

136
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,630
Do you think there's rat's spit in here?

137
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:26,952
Like plague rat's spit? Are we smoking plague?

138
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:31,943
As soon as we lit it up, it was safe, sterilized.

139
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,211
His name was Conrad.

140
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,351
I am not interested in names.

141
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,631
What I am interested in, wife of mine,

142
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:43,202
is why you gave away all your clothes and half of our furniture!

143
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,971
But I could give a swollen rat's ass what that guy's fucking name is.

144
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,965
Good! Get it all out!

145
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:51,203
We should have had this conversation months ago.

146
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:52,954
- Years ago!
- 14 years.

147
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,853
We've been married for 16.

148
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:57,383
Yes, but I liked the first two.

149
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:59,942
That's before you grew a gut, turned into a robot

150
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,320
and bought this ridiculous house.

151
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,363
We got a super deal on this house.

152
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:07,361
You have got to be kidding me.

153
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:08,111
What?

154
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,382
- Look around!
- What?

155
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,083
Lupita, get back at the wall!

156
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,031
- No!
- Why not?

157
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,792
Because you say Mr. Judah stay in the wall.

158
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,693
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.

159
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:20,930
That's a metaphor.

160
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,863
Hey! Wonder if rats like peanut butter.

161
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:27,383
In Santa de Poluca, we had a ghost,

162
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,663
senor Flores.

163
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:31,131
And he stayed in the telephone lines.

164
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,751
There are cross lines. You were listening to other people talking.

165
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,273
No, no, no, we could hear him whisper

166
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,073
and all the time he said...

167
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:45,172
"Where are my pants?"

168
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:46,210
Why did he say that?

169
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:48,441
Because he died without his pants.

170
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,241
I'm going to die without my hat.

171
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:53,913
Andy.

172
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,981
Andy! He's coming towards you!

173
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,751
Ow! Mother of God! Damn it!

174
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,602
- Look up.
- What?

175
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:08,061
- Look up.
- Fine! So what?

176
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,482
There's no roof.

177
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:14,902
It's an atrium, it's supposed to bring in light.

178
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,513
When it's raining, Dean,

179
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:21,562
and I'm in the bedroom and I want a cup of tea,

180
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:26,221
I have to put on rubber boots so my sleepers don't get wet

181
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,410
on the way to the kitchen.

182
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,691
When the Santa Annas come over the hill in the afternoon

183
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,393
and our neighbors are all outside

184
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:35,630
feeling the wind in their hair,

185
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:37,620
do you know what I do?

186
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:41,093
I open the dining room door.

187
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:44,130
I open the living room door.

188
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:49,132
I then open the bathroom praying that my husband isn't sitting there

189
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:51,603
taking one of this monstrous shits.

190
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:55,232
I do this so that the air conditioning

191
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:58,493
can fake the sensation of flowing oxygen

192
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:03,783
into our stuffy, claustrophobic open air atrium,

193
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:07,512
a room where plants come to die.

194
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:13,251
This is the dumbest fucking room ever built.

195
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:14,953
Isn't it nice

196
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:18,123
of Tim and Peter to invite us out considering everything?

197
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:19,353
Shane!

198
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:21,751
Silas!

199
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:24,113
- Great.
- Sure.

200
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:28,383
So, Silas, is that one of those sidekick pagers?

201
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,273
Hmm-hmm.

202
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,741
Silas has a hottie back home.

203
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,290
This guy totally want to bone my mom.

204
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:36,441
Remarkable machines. Little 0s and 1s vibrating through the air

205
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,300
beamed back and forth by satellite. An age of wonder...

206
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:43,060
Done so much for the lost art of dinner conversation, hasn't it Silas?

207
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:43,911
Yeah.

208
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,610
Okay, Tim, what grade are you in?

209
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,810
- I'm in fourth grade.
- The same as Shane.

210
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,803
You look a little big for fourth grade. Were you held back?

211
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:53,303
Ow!

212
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:06,992
Is the white lady home?

213
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,170
Did you see her big car in the driveway?

214
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,641
- No.
- Well then no.

215
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:11,823
Lupita, right?

216
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:12,711
Yes.

217
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,040
You're Serena's friend.

218
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:16,561
And you're the dealer. The shithead.

219
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:18,641
I love a woman with a mouth.

220
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:21,273
I want you to use it to give your lady friend a message.

221
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,171
You tell her the business that she's in

222
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,213
is the business that she needs to get out of.

223
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,971
You tell her Agrestics are one motero down.

224
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:30,300
You tell her that all real nice.

225
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:33,282
And you give her this.

226
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,210
Pennies?

227
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,551
Oh my God! Finally!

228
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,183
You're the pizza guy?

229
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,742
Do I look like a fucking pizza guy?

230
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:49,600
Is he getting the pizza?

231
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,192
Nancy, what do you do for a living?

232
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,650
Peter, what do you say

233
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:02,281
in keeping with this strange spirit, let's just say that we don't

234
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,752
ask each other the usual

235
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,560
standard questions.

236
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,220
Ah. Okay.

237
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,793
Sounds like fun.

238
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:14,603
Stamps!

239
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,880
Licking kind or self-adhesive?

240
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:19,633
Self-adhesive, I love self-adhesive.

241
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,921
- Favorite body water
- Mono Lake.

242
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,431
- Yours?
- My bathtub.

243
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,620
- Favorite fight song?
- University of Michigan.

244
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:29,671
My father went to University of Michigan.

245
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,473
How does that go again?

246
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:43,943
We were at my dad's grave today.

247
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,212
Oh...

248
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:47,763
Well, that's uh...

249
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,610
- Are you married?
- No.

250
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:50,793
- How come?
- Shane!

251
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,791
It's a long story.

252
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,370
- Are you a fag?
- Shane!

253
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:55,961
Ow! It was just a question. Don't kick me again.

254
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,430
Apologize right now.

255
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,322
Sorry.

256
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,411
That's okay. I think Shane is just having a little fun.

257
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,172
Shane's on fire today, aren't you?

258
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:03,541
Sounds like he had a rough morning.

259
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,332
You're very understanding!

260
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:06,741
Thank you, Peter.

261
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:08,351
- How old are you?
- Tim!

262
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,921
Not polite to ask a woman's age.

263
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,520
- Is that your real nose?
- Tim!

264
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,751
So, why aren't you married again?

265
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,601
Shane!

266
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,020
She  was cheating on me, okay? It broke my heart.

267
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:23,082
Ripped a hole in me from which you could see tiny angels weeping.

268
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:25,243
Eat your pasta.

269
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:37,952
All right.

270
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:41,842
Son of a bitch!

271
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:05,002
It's a nice motel.

272
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,210
We stayed here last year.

273
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,413
We?

274
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,132
Tim and I.

275
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,971
My son. Your son ate his foot.

276
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,442
Jesus! I'm sorry about that.

277
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,441
That was so fucked up.

278
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:22,863
Shane seems like a good kid.

279
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,890
- He really adores you.
- You think so?

280
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,242
That's nice to hear.

281
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,351
Jesus! I'm sorry. I'm having a day.

282
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,871
- You wanna talk about it?
- It's not safe at home.

283
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:39,512
What?

284
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,592
Nothing, I'm sorry.

285
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:47,260
Someone threw pennies at my car.

286
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,731
Nicked up the paintjob.

287
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:49,731
Yikes!

288
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,612
Yikes?

289
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,432
Who says yikes?

290
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,642
I guess I do.

291
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:04,803
And then that fucking rabbi this morning

292
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:09,452
who looked at us like we weren't Jewish enough, that pissed me off so much.

293
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:12,452
And  you know what, Peter?

294
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,653
Maybe, we're not Jewish enough.

295
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,922
But I'm not Jewish. Judah was fine with that.

296
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:23,503
You're cute.

297
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,302
Okay, that was stupid.

298
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,843
That was bad!

299
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,631
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:37,511
That's okay.

301
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,790
No, no, no, not okay.

302
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:46,792
You might be like a great guy but I'm in no way ready for this.

303
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:48,691
I'll see you later.

304
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,172
With the black guy...

305
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,711
was it good?

306
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:03,801
Very.

307
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,002
Dios mio!

308
00:17:45,418 --> 00:17:46,382
We're back!

309
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,030
Lupita, who's the guy outside in the crappy car?

310
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:54,170
What the fuck!

311
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:55,062
You said fuck!

312
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,790
I was in my room all night.

313
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,833
Move it.

314
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,060
Doug!

315
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,650
Doug!

316
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,183
Nancy...

317
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,161
Hey!

318
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:11,250
Where's Andy?

319
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,061
Andy!

320
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:23,631
- Hi!
- Jesus! Put... Put your...

321
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:24,671
What?

322
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,260
- What did you...
- Your johnson.

323
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:29,850
Oh!

324
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,331
Thanks.

325
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:35,013
Hey, how did we do at the tournament?

326
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,333
I brought shame to my elders.

327
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:38,612
That happens sometimes.

328
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:40,802
Mrs. Nancy, I have to talk to you.

329
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,522
Not now, Lupita. Doug!

330
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:43,352
Doug!

331
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:44,400
Here! Doug's here.

332
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,243
Doug, you will drive yourself home.

333
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,203
- Ahhh...
- Ahhh is not a word, Doug.

334
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,953
Now  is a word. You will go home to your wife

335
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,102
and you and I will never discuss why there's peanut butter

336
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:54,943
all over my house.

337
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,003
Shane!

338
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,003
Stop eating off the floor, go to your room, you're grounded.

339
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:03,060
There was a rat in your tampon box.

340
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,362
You know, Dany uses Flow Stop too.

341
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,500
Now, Doug!

342
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:08,830
Ow!

343
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,992
Why is it always hitting with you?

344
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,891
Only 4 hours, not even one day.

345
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,013
- Mrs. Nancy.
- Not now, Lupita.

346
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:17,570
- Good night, Andy!
- I love you, man!

347
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:18,800
I love him.

348
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,272
Awesome!

349
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:28,121
- Mrs. Nancy!
- What is it, Lupita?

350
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,250
This!

351
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:32,921
Where did you get that?

352
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,152
From the man outside in the car.

353
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,882
Silas, go to your room.

354
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,853
- Why? What did I do?
- Go!

355
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,873
I'm going out. When I come back,

356
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,670
this place better be fucking spotless.

357
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:50,542
The broken glass, the peanut butter, the dead rat, all of it.

358
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,341
Andy, you better be somewhere where I can't see you.

359
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:56,531
Lupita, if I'm not back in 45 minutes, call...

360
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,450
- Call who?
- I'll be back.

361
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,560
Stay the fuck away from my house!

362
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:48,992
Someone's very, very upset. Hello, pretty housewife!

363
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,123
Hey, watch it! You're gonna bring down the Blue Book value.

364
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,193
It's a $1000 paintjob you fucked up.

365
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,331
Don't worry about it. We'll just take it out of the money you owe me.

366
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,970
- I don't owe you shit!
- I think you do, Nancy.

367
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,542
You sling into my territory, you owe me rent.

368
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,360
Alejandro, isn't it?

369
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,221
Hmmm, she knows my name, my heart is racing.

370
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,540
Delivers late.

371
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,662
Doesn't answer calls.

372
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:15,073
Says it's shit from Humbolt when really it's Yancton.

373
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:18,473
Your customers had such nice things to say about you.

374
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,841
Sling into Agrestic, slinging up in Valley State,

375
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,060
slinging in the office park of Warner Center.

376
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:27,070
The fuck you think you are? Al Pacino?

377
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:29,490
Know your place, lady white.

378
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:30,592
I'm not going anywhere.

379
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,752
Then we got a problem.

380
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,972
I guess we do.

381
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,453
What do you wanna do about it?

382
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,210
A black guy.

383
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:54,982
Conrad.

384
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,093
Is that his name?

385
00:21:58,218 --> 00:21:59,160
Yeah.

386
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:03,600
Was he bigger than me?

387
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:08,612
Nope.

388
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,413
That's a fucking BB gun.

389
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,143
My nephew had the same one.

390
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:25,780
Don't point that there!

391
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:27,653
This dick does nice work.

392
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:29,182
I'd hate to see it full of holes.

393
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,111
- That's not funny.
- It's nothing personal

394
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:34,881
'cause this was unexpected but it's never gonna happen again.

395
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:36,661
- Okay, Manolo?
- Manolo?

396
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:38,041
You stay away from my family.

397
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:39,690
You stay away from my house.

398
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,691
You quit with the fucking pennies.

399
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:42,710
Okay?

400
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:52,822
Shit!

401
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:02,651
Fuck.

402
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:06,331
What the fuck are you doing!

403
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:33,572
Yes?

404
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:35,861
Hey, hmmm...

405
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:37,863
It's Peter.

406
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,651
Is this a bad time?

407
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:43,341
Is this a bad time?

408
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,003
Where are you?

409
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:48,460
I'm in my car at the punishment light.

410
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,771
Punishment light?

411
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:55,531
It's this street and it's a light

412
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:58,420
and if you don't make it, you sit forever.

413
00:23:58,796 --> 00:23:59,453
Ah...

414
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,712
It makes absolutely no sense.

415
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,503
There's no cars. No one's trying to cross.

416
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:08,071
It's just put there to make you fucking miserable.

417
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:11,861
Right. So then I'll make this quick.

418
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,363
I've been thinking about you.

419
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:19,661
And I know you're not in a place right now.

420
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,052
I'm probably not either.

421
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:28,903
But I liked meeting you and I would really like to see you again.

422
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:31,460
Maybe even without the hostile offspring.

423
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:36,181
Look...

424
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,741
that's...

425
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:39,630
lovely.

426
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,171
And you know...

427
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,311
I'm... not...

428
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:57,380
I'm not ready to get...

429
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:03,682
intimate... just yet.

430
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:07,252
I get that. I completely get that.

431
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:12,721
I just wanted you to know when, if ever, you're ready,

432
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:14,670
I'll be here.

433
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,102
- Okay, Peter.
- Great.

434
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:20,530
And thanks for...

435
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,291
understanding.

436
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:26,392
Absolutely.

437
00:25:57,785 --> 00:26:00,393
