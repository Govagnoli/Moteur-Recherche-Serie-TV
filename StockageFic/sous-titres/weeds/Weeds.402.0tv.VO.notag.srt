00:00:05,517 --> 00:00:07,101
Previously on Weeds...

2
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:09,763
This was not what I had in mind.
Those are people's homes.

3
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,931
FEMA's gonna set them up
at the Marriott.

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,559
It's time to move on...
We take you off the sales floor.

5
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:17,854
- Traffic?
- You'd bring in lots and lots of mota.

6
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:21,191
That house belongs to Celia.
Celia Hodes.

7
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:23,985
She ran the whole thing.

8
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,820
They're all lying!

9
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:27,697
Please help me.

10
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,821
We're going to Ren Mar and see Bubbie.

11
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:33,370
- She's somewhere far, far away.
- The nurse was fired.

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,311
A family member called
and said he was taking over her care.

13
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,916
Dad, it's your family.

14
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,377
Who the hell are you
bursting in here like this?

15
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:43,546
- Why are you always such a prick to me?
- I'm just not sure you're mine.

16
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:45,215
- Are you on the run?
- Yes.

17
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:48,035
That at least I can wrap my head around.

18
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,677
Weeds - 4x02

Relecture : Jesslataree, San-A

21
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,900
Bubbie...

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,152
Who knew?

23
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,866
Nice dress, Mom.

24
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,201
We should have done this years ago.

25
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:57,304
Burn down the house
and move to the beach?

26
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:00,269
We can hear the ocean.
How great is that?

27
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:04,388
That's Silas watering his pot plants
in the shower.

28
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:05,422
Silas!

29
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:23,855
The hair...
Identity crisis, new start... I get it.

30
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:25,455
More importantly, the plants.

31
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:28,618
They need to grow somewhere else,
out of this house, now.

32
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,654
- What are you so paranoid about?
- I'm paranoid about Len.

33
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:34,407
- He wants to be called Lenny.
- If Len sees those,

34
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,160
he might flip...

35
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,621
or steal them or smoke them...
We just don't know.

36
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,120
The bottom line is...
we don't shit where we eat

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,676
or eat where we shit.

38
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:46,044
Either way, words of wisdom.

39
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,255
Then where am I supposed to put them?

40
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,847
Figure it out, young botanist.
Just get them gone.

41
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:54,886
Where are you going?

42
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,141
I need to buy a bed skirt.

43
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:03,355
- I want to go shopping for a bed skirt.
- You don't know what it is.

44
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,203
- It's like a dust ruffle.
- How do you know what a dust ruffle is?

45
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,191
All gay boys know what a dust ruffle is.

46
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,152
Silas.

47
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,444
I'm a big fag, so you can suck my dick.

48
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:15,007
- Please, can I come with you, Mom?
- No, honey.

49
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,069
I need some alone time,
and you just told your brother

50
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,036
to suck your dick. Gross.

51
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:23,164
- Where are you really going?
- I just told you... errands.

52
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,732
Dressed like that?

53
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:28,379
Good morning.

54
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:32,325
Len.

55
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:33,716
Lenny.

56
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,637
How long does it take Portnoy up there
to finish his business?

57
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,974
- Use the downstairs bathroom.
- I don't like the toilet in there.

58
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:44,060
It's got a padded seat.
It's like taking a shit on a mushroom.

59
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,450
I've taken a shit
on mushrooms... And on...

60
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,065
a mushroom, actually.

61
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:50,692
Of course you have.

62
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,903
Bonnie and Clyde, I don't know
what you two are running from.

63
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:56,149
And you know what? I don't care.

64
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,266
Why don't you just give me
$300 in cash right now,

65
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,702
and the subject is dead?

66
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:23,823
Nice doing business with you.

67
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,389
I'm doing something
potentially illegal today.

68
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,225
What sort of potentially
illegal activity

69
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:37,505
are you engaging in in that dress?

70
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:41,159
- I got a page. He gave me an address.
- Who? Your john?

71
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,889
Guillermo.

72
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:47,782
"Psychotic gangster,
burned down Agrestic"?

73
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,722
Do you want to keep living
with your father?

74
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:52,808
It's work.

75
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,665
It's fine.

76
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,498
- Keep your cellphone on.
- In case of injury or imprisonment?

77
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,249
In case I need something
from the supermarket.

78
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,750
Like a rape kit? I don't think
they sell those at Ralph's.

79
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,767
- It's work. It's fine.
- Okay, have a good day at the office.

80
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,593
Maddy Shaheen. I'm the public defender
assigned to your case.

81
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:23,120
- Am I getting out now?
- Sit tight a little while longer.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,995
- The charges won't stick.
- Oh, good. Thank god.

83
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:28,873
No one saw you drive the Escalade
into the convenience store,

84
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,543
so we're totally cool.

85
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,453
- Escalade?
- It's says "Escalade."

86
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,159
That's what came through the window,
unless it was a Highlander

87
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,979
or one of those big Lincoln things.
What is it? A Navigator?

88
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,885
- What are you talking about?
- Felicia Harken?

89
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,014
- Celia Hodes.
- Hodes. Okay. Right. Hodes.

90
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:46,790
Any relation to Dean Hodes?

91
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,363
The loser who was constantly
hitting on me in law school.

92
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,764
No. No relation.

93
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:52,397
Here we go.

94
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:54,315
No, that is not it.

95
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,658
Are you retarded?

96
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,419
I'm just disorganized.
You don't have to be a bitch about it.

97
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:02,483
Here it is.

98
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,310
You're not getting
out of here anytime soon.

99
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:09,540
I pose a bigger threat
to the public than someone

100
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,208
who drove a car through a store window?

101
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,744
Antidrug crusader caught
with grow house?

102
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,913
You're fucked like a stray dog
in Chinatown.

103
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,019
I shouldn't be in here.

104
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,100
The toilets are metal.

105
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,000
Anyway, your hearing date's in 3 weeks.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,018
You were on city council,
so if you slept with any cops or judges,

107
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:33,660
it's time to call in the favors.
I'll be in touch, Sally.

108
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,481
- Celia.
- Yeah. See ya.

109
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:38,187
Felicia?

110
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,374
Hey, Blanca.

111
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,560
You said you had a job for me?

112
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:56,626
I do.

113
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:06,179
- And good morning to you.
- You need to get that fixed.

114
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,347
Obviously.

115
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,379
You're gonna take a little drive
for me today, Blanca.

116
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,351
Go down to TJ,
get that brake light repaired.

117
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:14,479
In Mexico?

118
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,148
Cheaper labor there.
I know a good garage.

119
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,906
Once you get over the border,

120
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:21,360
take any left off Revolución
and follow the river,

121
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:22,880
Paseo de los heroes,

122
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:26,407
and look for the beer-can/horsehead
thing hanging outside.

123
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:29,202
- Beer-can/horsehead?
- Yeah, it's on the wall.

124
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,145
- And that's it?
- No.

125
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:34,618
I also want you to go to a farmacia,
get me some inhalers...

126
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,124
Ventolin and Aerobid.

127
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:38,284
Ten each. No, fifteen.

128
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:40,588
Don't get me Flovent.
It gives me a rash.

129
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,369
Ventolin and Aerobid.

130
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:46,647
Can you give me the address
of this place? I'll put it in my GPS.

131
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:53,046
Just follow Paseo de los heroes
and look for the horse.

132
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,852
Use your eyes,

133
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:57,115
spoon-fed americana.

134
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,770
There's $10,000 in it for you
if you don't fuck it up.

135
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,250
$10,000!

136
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:05,780
No, no. Cash on delivery.

137
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,597
That's for the inhalers.

138
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,623
I almost forgot.

139
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,706
We got you a present.

140
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:19,794
Wait. What is that?

141
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,672
Be gracious when somebody
gives you a gift.

142
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:25,675
- I don't really do this kind of thing.
- That's good luck, man.

143
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:28,094
Don't fuck with good luck.
Just say, "thank you."

144
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,308
How thoughtful.

145
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,960
And really... stuck on there.

146
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:37,603
Thank you.

147
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:39,051
You'll be fine. Just...

148
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:41,990
smile and just act like you do.

149
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,932
You know, you're gonna come back.

150
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:46,737
This money's gonna jump into your purse.

151
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,198
Be a good day for Blanca.

152
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,051
What am I really doing?

153
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,342
The money doesn't like it
when you ask questions.

154
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:59,256
It gets very sad
and wants to crawl away.

155
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:01,715
Off to Mexico.

156
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,600
¡Viva Zapata!

157
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,049
I'm gonna be at the track until 4:00,

158
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:09,552
so you boys are basically on your own.

159
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:11,721
Just check the monitors,

160
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,016
keep an eye on her feeding tube,
and check her diaper for deposits.

161
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,101
And roll her in the afternoon.

162
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:20,605
That's so she doesn't get bedsores.
Few minutes on each side.

163
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,008
It's a shame you boys never got
a chance to know her.

164
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,607
You can blame your mother for that.

165
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,990
- Now, you, Alan Ladd.
- Shane.

166
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,075
- And Klaus.
- Silas.

167
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,183
If either of you boys

168
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:38,743
have any big ideas about going
through my things while I'm gone,

169
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:40,279
you can forget it.

170
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,293
It's all rigged
to blow your fingers off.

171
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,253
So stay out of my stuff,

172
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,923
if you ever want to handle
your little shmeckies again.

173
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:51,449
Now, I don't believe in wireless phones.

174
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:55,134
So if something goes wrong,
you can page me at the track.

175
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:59,101
And, if she dies on your watch,
it's your fault,

176
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,438
got it?

177
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,775
She does that sometimes.
It's not necessarily bad.

178
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,321
- It sounds bad, Grandpa Lenny.
- It's not.

179
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,491
And when your uncle Andrew

180
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,139
crawls out of that rattletrap van
out there,

181
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,832
tell him I expect to be reimbursed
for everything he eats...

182
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,779
and tell him he's a thief,

183
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,127
and that he still owes me $20,000.

184
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,630
I got to go. Bye.

185
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,026
You're on first watch.

186
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:40,324
Guess who finished the monster po' boy
at the Gumbo junction.

187
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:42,838
5 feet of fried-fish goodness!

188
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,799
And it was free 'cause he ate
the whole thing in under an hour!

189
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,193
People sang and threw beads.
It was awesome.

190
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:50,736
Why are you here? Where is Dean?

191
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:54,585
He's down in the lobby hitting on some
frumpy chick who dug him in law school,

192
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:58,411
and he wanted me to let you know
he's sorry there's no money for bail.

193
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,288
You fuckers ratted me out.

194
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,114
That might be another reason
why he's staying in the lobby.

195
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:04,644
Where's Nancy?

196
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,795
- Who? That nice widow?
- She should be in here, not me...

197
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:09,160
Nancy!

198
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:12,040
My cellmate, Chita,

199
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:15,303
says that she's gonna
make me her special girl.

200
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,388
I have to get out of here now.

201
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:20,308
It's good to make friends, Ceil.
Bridge the divide.

202
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:24,145
"Why can't we all just get along?"
I like your hair.

203
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,546
I couldn't decide, but I just did.
I mean it's nice off her face, isn't it?

204
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,336
- It's youthful.
- My life is in danger.

205
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,468
Come on.

206
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:34,483
You're probably safer in here
than you are in town.

207
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,114
People are outraged.
Your house burned to the ground,

208
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:39,910
but people still spray-painted
"hypocrite" in the charred remains.

209
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,013
You have to get me out of here.

210
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,506
This is a nightmare.

211
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,208
And it should be Nancy's nightmare,
not mine.

212
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,887
- She does look scared, Doug.
- I am, baby.

213
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:52,840
Mommy is terrified.

214
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,427
Then maybe this is a good time
for us to go.

215
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:59,266
I don't want you getting all upset.
This must be really hard for you.

216
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,811
- No.
- Please, please.

217
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:03,587
I don't want to be
anybody's special girl.

218
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,602
Visitation is over. Come on.

219
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,758
Help me. Help Mommy.

220
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,533
Hola!

221
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:34,434
Yo quiero una brake light para...

222
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:36,812
this car.

223
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:41,028
Guillermo.

224
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:45,226
Una brake-light especial. ¿Habla inglés?

225
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,363
I need to get my brake light fixed.
Guillermo sent me.

226
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:52,695
Hybrid?

227
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,686
Yeah, hybrid car.

228
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,683
Got to save those fossil fuels...

229
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,896
dead Iraqi children.

230
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,829
- What's wrong with that car?
- Broken taillight.

231
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:11,127
You know, I'm still under warranty.

232
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,087
I really don't want to blow that.

233
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:16,298
So when you're fixing my light, if you
can just make sure everything's back

234
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,467
where you found it.
While you're in there,

235
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:21,562
can you override the thing that stops me
from doing GPS while I'm driving?

236
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:24,181
- I heard you can do that.
- That's illegal.

237
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,483
Una hora, you come back, eh?

238
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:36,008
An hour. Great.

239
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:38,220
I need a bag.

240
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,874
Small planet. I'm doing my part.

241
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,413
¿Dónde esta la farmacia, por favor?

242
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,810
Farmacia Maxima.

243
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:08,735
End of street, red sign.

244
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:11,542
End of street, red sign. Gracias.

245
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,053
Mucho bueno. Gracias.

246
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,320
10 minutes, that's my limit.
After 10 min in the same room with him,

247
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,330
- I want to kill or be killed.
- Shane's in there...

248
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,708
Just staring at Bubbie's machines,

249
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,702
scared to death
she'll kick on his watch.

250
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:30,623
Lenny's a master at giving kids
age-inappropriate tasks.

251
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:34,207
I'm surprised he didn't have Shane
drive him to the track.

252
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,588
- He says you're a thief.
- Who did?

253
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,388
Lenny. He said you...

254
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,375
stole 20 grand from him.
And he wants it back.

255
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:44,744
Unbelievable.

256
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,183
Unbelievable. You know what?

257
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:50,074
You're better off without a dad.
It fucks you up.

258
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:52,936
You're better off.
At least you can be your own person now.

259
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,990
I didn't mean that. I don't mean that.

260
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,938
I like your hair. I did that, too.

261
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,329
Tried to give myself a mohawk
using my mom's lady shaver.

262
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,118
- You're damaged.
- I was born into it.

263
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:11,607
Hola.

264
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,260
Terrific. So, it's done?

265
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,753
Finito?

266
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:20,673
30.

267
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,677
- 30 what?
- Dollars... for the light.

268
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,268
You're charging me.

269
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:30,087
Guillermo?

270
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,411
What do I do, now?

271
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,122
You go home. Have a nice day.

272
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:39,787
Miss.

273
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:41,295
- ¿Guitarra?
- No.

274
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:43,878
- Diet Coke?
- Yeah.

275
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,635
- Jarritos.
- Diet Jarritos?

276
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,764
- Iced latte?
- Okay. I get for you, Miss.

277
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:55,907
It's $3.

278
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,519
$3.

279
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,428
Do you have change for a $50?

280
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,459
¿Cambio?

281
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:03,452
Nobody have.

282
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:09,636
- How much?
- It's two for $30, but for you, $25.

283
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,410
¿Guitarra? Yeah, guitarra.

284
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,010
Do you have a red one?

285
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,048
Mellow out, Jesus.

286
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:43,208
Hey, Miss. Una mas latte, señora?

287
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:45,057
God, no. No mas.

288
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,976
Baño. Is there a baño around?

289
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,857
- Toilet?
- No, no baño.

290
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,455
But there is a Jack in the Box

291
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,929
on the other side in San Ysidro.

292
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,598
Gracias. Perfecto.

293
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:23,376
Turn around.

294
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:27,435
Fine. Enjoy the show.

295
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,533
God.

296
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,170
Not you.

297
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,346
Hi, sweetie.

298
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:07,404
Where are you?
I've tried you like 50 times.

299
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:10,022
I was in a parking garage.

300
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,256
- What is it, honey?
- Isabel texted me.

301
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,219
Did you know Mrs. Hodes is in jail?

302
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,760
- What?
- She got busted for a pot house.

303
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,471
Your pot house, Mom.
She's ratting you out.

304
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:21,849
Fuck!

305
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,809
Yes, Mom. Fuck.

306
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,738
Honey, I'm kind of busy right now.
Don't say fuck.

307
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,689
- Are we safe?
- Of course we're safe.

308
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,149
- I think we should change...
- Got to go.

309
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:32,841
Have your passport ready.

310
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,900
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

311
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:40,850
No passport?

312
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:42,995
I didn't know.

313
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,836
- So, what were you doing in Mexico?
- There's this skin cream...

314
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,495
fade cream, actually.

315
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:51,920
Probably poison,
but definitely effective.

316
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:56,563
- All this way for skin cream?
- Yes. My skin is very important to me.

317
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,385
It's the first thing people see.

318
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,746
Is that alcohol, Ma'am?

319
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:04,850
No, Sir. That's my urine.

320
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:06,746
I see.

321
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,620
You mind unlocking your trunk?

322
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:19,998
Okay.

323
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,137
Thank you very much.

324
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:27,137
I'm gonna need you to pull over
to the second inspection area.

325
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:37,090
Doug says everyone fingered Celia.

326
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:41,116
Then he started giggling
'cause he said "fingered,"

327
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,275
which leads me to believe he's high.

328
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,550
But he's almost always high,

329
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:48,515
so I believe
the information is reliable.

330
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:50,032
There's Mom.

331
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:57,030
How'd it go at the track today, Dad?
Catch a few winner no?

332
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,071
No? Not one?

333
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:02,104
Shocking.
How many races were there? Nine?

334
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,267
Anything? Did you blow the whole $300?

335
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:08,789
I bet your grandpa
doesn't have $5 left in his wallet.

336
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,904
Can't pick a winner to save his life.

337
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,184
August 14th, 1983.

338
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:16,588
- And away we go.
- Kentucky Mistress...

339
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:20,438
Lady's a Charm,
Please Pass the Salt... winners.

340
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:22,255
Not one... three.

341
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:25,712
That trifecta
was the overlay of the century.

342
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:29,059
I clocked their workouts
for four months.

343
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,104
You clocked your shits for four months.

344
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:33,907
I asked that prick over there

345
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:36,663
to pedal his little bicycle,
which I bought him,

346
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:40,153
up to Del Mar
and throw down $100 on a sure thing.

347
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,909
- Father of the year.
- What the fuck does he do?

348
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:44,241
He pockets it.

349
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:48,620
Goes out and buys himself
some "Star Trek" piece of shit.

350
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,889
- It was Boba Fett.
- I don't even know what that means.

351
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:53,278
Ganef!

352
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:56,817
I trusted you, and you lied to me.

353
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:59,734
"Oh, Dad, the horse lost."

354
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:02,335
They did lose every other time.

355
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:05,336
You never won.

356
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,691
That trifecta was a fluke.

357
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:09,648
That's the beauty of gambling.

358
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:13,639
You lose, you lose,
and then you win big to make up for it.

359
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:17,190
You stole my win-big.
You destroyed the beauty.

360
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,036
What the hell were you doing,
sending two kids to the track

361
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:21,550
to place your bets, anyway?

362
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,879
- Judah would have never...
- The whole thing was Judah's idea!

363
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,586
Lower your voice.
You'll agitate your Bubbie.

364
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:29,352
Bubbie was in on it, too!

365
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:32,100
She told us we should take your money,
we should go down to the boardwalk

366
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,292
and have some fun. "He'll never win,"
she said. "He's a schlimazel."

367
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:37,189
- She never said such a thing.
- She did!

368
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:39,578
- She did. Tell him, Bubbie.
- Leave her alone.

369
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:41,173
She's a bag of broccoli.

370
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,467
- If Judah were alive today...
- She's trying to talk.

371
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:46,053
- ... were alive today, what?
- She's trying to talk!

372
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:53,930
Geharget mach.

373
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,483
- What did she say?
- Something about target.

374
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,883
Idiot.

375
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:05,159
It's Yiddish. She speaks Yiddish.

376
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:08,658
- What does it mean?
- It means "kill me."

377
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,694
You see what you've done?

378
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:16,750
- Could I just...
- Stay back behind the line.

379
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:33,141
You think there's a tiny,
little immigrant stuffed in my lipstick?

380
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:36,061
Joke.

381
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:39,741
You didn't laugh
'cause I was redundant, right?

382
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,006
"Tiny, little."

383
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,868
Bingo! This one is mine, boys.

384
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:01,503
Would you like to explain to me why
you have drugs hidden in your vehicle?

385
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,177
Welcome back, Blanca.

386
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:10,722
Took you a while.

387
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,621
I see you got some souvenirs.

388
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:16,458
They tore the car apart,
couldn't find anything.

389
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:18,871
- Your guys are good.
- Good at what?

390
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,040
They're in the engine.

391
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:22,440
Am I right?

392
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,025
What's in the engine?

393
00:25:24,912 --> 00:25:26,018
The drugs.

394
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,560
Who said anything about drugs, man?

395
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,469
- Where are my inhalers?
- Right. The inhalers.

396
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:34,792
They were confiscated.
Apparently, I needed a prescription.

397
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:39,249
You buy a prescription for 10 bucks
from the guy in the farmacia.

398
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:41,629
I ask you for one thing.

399
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,044
You know how much a Ventolin costs here?

400
00:25:44,164 --> 00:25:44,971
Shit!

401
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:46,782
Mira.

402
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:53,025
- What?
- It's a camera,

403
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:55,861
like "Taxicab Confession."

404
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,878
This was to see
how you did with the border cops.

405
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:02,592
- We're gonna do postgame later.
- You were recording me?

406
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,639
Edit down a highlight reel.

407
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,464
No, wait. You were recording me,
and there's no drugs?

408
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:11,865
- The car was clean?
- It kind of smells like pee.

409
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:15,708
So, what, you're just...
fucking with me?

410
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:19,382
This is bullshit.

411
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,190
You think those guys
who flew into the towers...

412
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,686
that was their first time
on an airplane?

413
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:28,590
It's practice.

414
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,637
Go home and think about
what you did wrong.

415
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,965
Tomorrow, we review the tape.

416
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:40,912
Do I get paid for that, too?

417
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,815
You lucky you getting half.

418
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,775
You lost my inhalers.

419
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,171
I think I'm starting to believe you.
