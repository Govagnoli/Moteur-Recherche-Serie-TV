1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:01,288
Previously on Weeds.

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,855
I've been giving some thoughts to my cover business.

3
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:03,972
What do you think about a bakery?

4
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:05,394
These will satisfy your munchies

5
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:08,777
and give you a long lasting, all body high.

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,007
I'm ready to take orders.

7
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,143
Fuck it! I'll take it all.

8
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:14,768
Last week's buy, this week's buy, my ring, my Rover.

9
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,336
You're still short for all the shit you're gonna wanna take this week.

10
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:18,071
I'll be back.

11
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:19,925
I don't like dealing with things.

12
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,443
I much prefer to pretend they don't exist.

13
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:23,154
Megan!

14
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:24,243
Hey, Megan!

15
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:26,193
Megan! Can you hear me?

16
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:28,502
That deaf girl down on Dewey Street.

17
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:11,230
Fire! Fire!

18
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,120
Mom, what are you doing? There's a fire!

19
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,980
If there's a fire, I'll run. Okay?

20
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:19,740
Otherwise I'm gonna bash in the smoke alarm with the broom handle.

21
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:25,841
Andy?

22
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:28,741
Sorry, Pants, I was trying to surprise you guys.

23
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:29,691
Uncle Andy!

24
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:30,491
Hey!

25
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:34,803
Yes, I'm digging the love!

26
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,363
I missed you!

27
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:37,590
So how was Alaska?

28
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,533
Alaska was so beautiful.

29
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,331
In the summer, you can party all night.

30
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:45,861
Then it got dark and I met this psycho girl who tried to bring me up on charges.

31
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,212
How did you get in here?

32
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,022
I'll swear I'll pay for the window.

33
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,302
I didn't wanna wake you.

34
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:53,303
I'm joking! I'm joking! I'm joking!

35
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:56,220
You guys wanna help me make breakfast?

36
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:58,212
Silas, I need you squeezing the oranges.

37
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,833
Shane, I need you making the coffee.

38
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,393
Sorry about the grease fire.

39
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:02,813
That bacon really spits up.

40
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:06,521
Shane, go get a broom so I can bash your uncle Andy with it.

41
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:10,392
Come on, Nancy Pantsy! I'm making eggs Florentine.

42
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:11,573
Don't call me Pants.

43
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:12,613
Pantalones?

44
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,081
Oh shit, you?

45
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,311
Hey, Lupita!

46
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,403
I know you missed me. How about a hug?

47
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:20,202
I'm no cleaning up his mess.

48
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:22,290
Uncle Andy, did you bring us anything?

49
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,233
Of course!

50
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:24,111
Look who you're talking to.

51
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,230
Go get my duffle in the guest room, the black one.

52
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:28,140
Not the green, okay? Stay out of the green.

53
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:29,753
Guest room? Guest room?

54
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,462
I guess I could sleep with Lupita.

55
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:35,081
I do love the fiery latinas.

56
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:37,840
Know this, Lupita,

57
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:39,201
until you learn to love me,

58
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,670
I've got enough love for both of us.

59
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,380
How did you and Judah emerge from the same woman?

60
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:46,160
I know.

61
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,861
What family gets blessed with not one but two studs?

62
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,612
Okay, everybody gather.

63
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,930
First,

64
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:54,010
young Silas,

65
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:55,660
that is for you.

66
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:56,842
Awesome.

67
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,020
So, does it work?

68
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,180
Yeah, for about another 3 weeks,

69
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:02,382
then you're gonna wanna scratch off the serial number and get a new service plan.

70
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,990
Okay, for mamma,

71
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:08,590
What's that?

72
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:10,860
For your neck, right?

73
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:12,383
You're always talking about how your neck hurts.

74
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,092
- Andy, this is...
- Take it.

75
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,190
For my neck, of course.

76
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:19,850
Thank you. Lupita.

77
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,650
I'll put it in your bedroom, next to the little one.

78
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:24,740
What about me?

79
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,913
Oh... I don't...

80
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:28,563
Oh!

81
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,173
Best for last!

82
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:30,902
No way!

83
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:32,280
No! No way !

84
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,601
Come on, I'll teach him how to use it.

85
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,882
Shane  Li, hand it over.

86
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:35,640
Andy!

87
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,683
I'll hold on to those 'till we're in a better space.

88
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:39,231
Who's hungry?

89
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:40,733
Everybody, go sit down!

90
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,061
Andy...

91
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:51,960
how long are you planning on staying?

92
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:53,652
Don't worry, I'll help out.

93
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:54,882
How long?

94
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:58,242
Just 'till I figure some things out.

95
00:04:58,346 --> 00:04:59,143
Like?

96
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,231
I don't know.

97
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:01,793
My life.

98
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:03,250
Sure.

99
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:04,943
That.

100
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:08,613
Good to see you, Pants.

101
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:10,413
It's good to be a family.

102
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:12,513
Come on, let's eat!

103
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,090
Hey, buddy! What are you doing?

104
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,881
Just IMing my girlfriend.

105
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:20,741
You don't need a credit card for that, do you?

106
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:21,833
No.

107
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,731
Real  girlfriend. Megan. She's deaf.

108
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:29,101
Deaf Megan. She cute?

109
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:31,583
Yeah, she's totally cute.

110
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,021
Yeah.

111
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:37,332
She doesn't look deaf.

112
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:38,510
She can't hear anything?

113
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,370
That's what deaf means.

114
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:43,800
Man, how did you get so smart at what? 16?

115
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:47,812
Took me years to learn slightly defective chicks are the way to go.

116
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:50,281
I once went out with this chick with a baby arm:

117
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,371
insane in the sack.

118
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,001
Plus, when she grabbed my dick with her little hand, it looked gigantic.

119
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,952
So how you talk to her?

120
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,420
We just mostly hang out and stuff.

121
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:02,852
You should learn Braille.

122
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,273
You mean sign language?

123
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,451
Whatever.

124
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:06,530
What's this?

125
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:07,813
That’s  mine.

126
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:10,192
Chris died for your sins!

127
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,020
Is that a joke?

128
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,160
Yeah, on me.

129
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:14,583
That's what happens when you outsource to fucking Malaysia.

130
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,263
8-year-olds in a sweatshop can't spell for shit.

131
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:20,760
See, I was trying to jump on board the whole red state Jesus thing.

132
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,453
The Fashion of the Christ.

133
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,021
I end up with 3000 of these.

134
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:25,580
Totally useless.

135
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,720
Because if there's one thing I learned about the Christ crowd,

136
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,561
absolutely no sense of humor.

137
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,703
Should have gone after the jew market.

138
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:34,840
At least we can take a joke.

139
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:39,083
Come on, Shane.

140
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:43,033
Look who's here.

141
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:46,352
Baby, it's "the early bird gets the worm".

142
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,590
Not the weed.

143
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,662
Need to read up on your Bartlett's.

144
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:51,565
My brother-in-law took the kids to school.

145
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,223
I thought I'd get a jump on the day.

146
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,344
Want some oatmeal?

147
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,823
No, Andy made eggs Florentine.

148
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,911
Andy?

149
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:02,901
When that fancy cooking trouble get back in town?

150
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:03,803
This morning.

151
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,321
I woke up and there he was.

152
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:10,090
Sort of like crotch crabs, only not as treatable, huh?

153
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:11,800
I forgot you know him.

154
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,650
I've been hoping to forget him.

155
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,640
How did Andy and Conrad meet?

156
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:18,191
I never got a straight answer out of either of them.

157
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:19,990
They worked at circuit city together.

158
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:21,462
Got caught stealing together.

159
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:22,681
Got fired together.

160
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,380
They go way back.

161
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,383
Never should've let that boy work retail.

162
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,083
You're gonna need to come back later

163
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:30,080
'cause we ain't got in everything you ordered yet.

164
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,913
I've got 17 food orders to fill.

165
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:34,191
Listen to Betty Cracker.

166
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:37,140
You got bunches of that crap last time.

167
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,282
You're out already?

168
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,473
I've got some but not enough for what I need to make.

169
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,081
My crowd loves to eat their smoke.

170
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:45,371
I could hook you up with a little schwag if you're really crazy.

171
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:47,121
Oh shit!

172
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:50,060
I still have the gourmet fuck up in my kitchen.

173
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,871
I'm never gonna get anything done.

174
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,031
Oh fuck!

175
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:54,492
I'm fucked!

176
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,683
You got a nasty mouth when you stress.

177
00:07:58,295 --> 00:07:59,570
You've got a pen?

178
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:02,570
I'ma give you a number.

179
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,041
And you say I said it is okay for you to call.

180
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,653
Who am I calling?

181
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:09,620
The Candyman.

182
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,831
Wear sporty shoes.

183
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:34,253
Megan89: Are you home?

184
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:37,183
Yeah.

185
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,303
Me too. Sore throat.

186
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,670
Bummer.

187
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,072
What are you wearing?

188
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:47,601
Take it off.

189
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:48,540
Okay.

190
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:54,252
I tried to spread the word.

191
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,242
I ate here everyday, invited people.

192
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:57,701
"It's too ethnic!"

193
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,993
"It's too spicy!"

194
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,651
"Those people don't wash their hands!"

195
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,023
What the fuck is wrong with these morons who go to

196
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,923
wait an hour in line in some

197
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:08,152
fucking crappy Olive Garden

198
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,483
and let a treasure like this go out of business?

199
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,500
I can't take it.

200
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,871
Doug, why are we here?

201
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,373
Did you taste the Saag Alu?

202
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,212
It's to die for.

203
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,542
And then be reincarnated and to die for again.

204
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:21,610
Why aren't you eating?

205
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,980
I told you I ate already.

206
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:23,883
Where?

207
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,253
The Olive Garden.

208
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:26,823
I wouldn't take a dump in the Olive Garden.

209
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,240
I like the hot artichoke spinach dip.

210
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:30,893
I can't even look at you.

211
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,031
Okay, enough! Enough!

212
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:35,321
I'm sure the Saag Alu is delicious.

213
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,440
Well, that's incredible.

214
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:40,063
Tell me this doesn't kick artichoke dip's ass!

215
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:42,742
Tell me more.

216
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:47,372
Are your nipples hard? Come on!

217
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:52,601
Like shooting stars. Now you.

218
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:57,162
No, more of you. Are you touching yourself?

219
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:03,441
I'm parting the lips of my blushing vagina.

220
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,341
Yes! Good.

221
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:14,063
Keep typing!

222
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,940
What do you think about this place as the bakery?

223
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,973
I mean, location is pretty good.

224
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:22,700
Kitchen's already set up.

225
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,462
If you make something mediocre enough,

226
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:25,933
You may even make a go at it.

227
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,020
Legitimately.

228
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,442
Let me think about it.

229
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,531
Here you go, Mr. Wilson.

230
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,201
20 orders for you.

231
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,902
Remember to let them cool before you put them in the freezer.

232
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,861
Mr. Bani, where will you go?

233
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:42,163
We just bought in a Olive Garden franchise close by.

234
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,233
You must come visit.

235
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:45,511
Fuck Agrestic!

236
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes, sir.

237
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:47,400
Okay.

238
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,492
Pay when you're ready.

239
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:51,702
When are my treats coming in?

240
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:52,971
I'm having a little trouble

241
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,753
getting my kitchen to myself lately but

242
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:56,820
I'll let you know.

243
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:16,932
Hey, Lupita. I was just thinking about you.

244
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,863
It's for you.

245
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,191
Wipe your hands.

246
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:34,682
Yeah, this is Andy.

247
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,853
Hey, Shane!

248
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,351
Really?

249
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:41,421
Awesome!

250
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:44,472
Yeah, I'll bring the shirts.

251
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:46,931
Let's say 15 minutes.

252
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,322
Okay...

253
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,083
Make it 20.

254
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:50,830
Okay.

255
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:56,401
Get your original "Chris died" t-shirts. Right here! Yeah!

256
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,502
Only 10 dollars! Have your money ready!

257
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,153
Here you go!

258
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:01,582
It's one size fits all. It's gonna shrink a little bit.

259
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:02,483
Oh yeah!

260
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:05,431
Okay, that's for you.

261
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:06,322
Uncle Andy.

262
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:08,071
What? What? What? Hang on.

263
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:08,871
Uncle Andy!

264
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:11,173
Now remember, kids, Chris loves you.

265
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,531
- Uncle Andy!
- What?

266
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:13,702
It's  the principal.

267
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:17,011
Oh shit, man! We were just heating up.

268
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:18,432
Excuse me.

269
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,753
Look, kids, Chris has risen.

270
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:22,630
Wait!

271
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:30,792
Oh no!

272
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,860
Have you all seen these?

273
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,620
They're all over the school!

274
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,022
And as a christian, I must say

275
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,981
I am deeply, deeply offended. It's profane.

276
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:46,593
Has anyone talked to the principal about this?

277
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:47,470
Who's Chris?

278
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:48,380
Where's Celia?

279
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,791
I bet she'd have something to say.

280
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,991
It's 10 minutes after, maybe we should start without her.

281
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:53,922
Does anyone know how?

282
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:55,060
Well, I think we need to

283
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:57,583
and I think the first order of business should be these shirts.

284
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:58,903
They're funny.

285
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,650
Excuse me?

286
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:05,613
I think you're making way too big a deal about it. It's a joke.

287
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:09,082
We do not joke about our Lord, Jesus Christ.

288
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,880
It's a stupid t-shirt.

289
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,272
We should ignore it.

290
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:20,333
Only one man died for my sins, Nancy, and his name wasn't Chris.

291
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,131
Well, it sort of was, wasn't it? Like a nickname?

292
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:26,802
If we make a big deal about it, in a week, it will become a full-blown trend.

293
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,881
They're  kids, it will become cool.

294
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,883
Principal Dodge! Have you seen these blasphemes?

295
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:32,920
Yes, Maggie, I have.

296
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:34,642
Are you gonna do something about them?

297
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:35,692
I'm about to.

298
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:37,803
Mrs. Botwin, would you mind coming into my office

299
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:40,212
to discuss your son's little t-shirt business?

300
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:41,630
Shane was selling them?

301
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,390
Yes.

302
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,820
With some guy in a van who sped off.

303
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,192
I'll never talk.

304
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:48,882
Hey!

305
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:51,500
What do you like better?

306
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,341
"Jesus say relax"

307
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,582
or "I'm too sexy for my Lord"?

308
00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:57,761
How about "Asshole ditched my 10-year-old".

309
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,633
I admit it. I panicked. That guy had a whistle!

310
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,902
They wanted to suspend him.

311
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:04,993
For what?

312
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,451
If Shane wants to believe in Chris

313
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,262
and they try to suspend him for it...

314
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,311
Wow! That's freedom of religion!

315
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,883
That's like the first commandment.

316
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,073
We can nail them on that.

317
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:17,160
I don't think Chris is protected under freedom of religion, Andy.

318
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,641
In fact, the angry christian moms

319
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:23,062
I heard from in the PTA were pretty offended by it.

320
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,553
Well, that's so intolerant.

321
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:27,793
I mean, what would Jesus do?

322
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:32,433
Religious bullshit aside, you don't wanna know

323
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:35,432
how far I had to crawl up the principal's ass

324
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,372
just to keep you two out of trouble.

325
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:43,100
Not to mention, the unbelievable amount of shit I'm gonna get from those

326
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:46,331
hypochristian bitch moms tomorrow.

327
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,092
I was just trying to pitch in,

328
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:51,603
earn a little money.

329
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:53,702
I saw an opportunity to help the family and

330
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:54,633
I took it.

331
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:55,350
Really?

332
00:14:55,397 --> 00:14:57,003
It was for the family, huh?

333
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,251
Where's the money?

334
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:03,462
Don't  worry, I'll use it towards family expenses.

335
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:04,513
Hello?

336
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,892
I gotta cover my other expenses.

337
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,643
Yeah, I did call.

338
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:07,943
Thanks for getting back to me.

339
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,450
Can you hold on a second, please?

340
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,662
Go away, I have to take this call.

341
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:13,793
Who is it?

342
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,332
None of your business. Get out of here.

343
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:16,872
Why? You got a boyfriend?

344
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,530
Isn't it a little soon? Maybe I should take my vibrator back.

345
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:20,711
Fine, Angry!

346
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,422
God! Keep the vibrator!

347
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,770
Thanks for getting back to me... um... Candyman.

348
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,283
You're the Candyman?

349
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:43,222
Yes.

350
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,110
You're getting any exercise?

351
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:46,241
Excuse me?

352
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:48,052
If you're not committed to personal fitness,

353
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,311
I can't in good conscience sell to you.

354
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:52,972
I wouldn't say Heylia is in the best shape.

355
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:54,821
Heylia is a lazy fat-fat

356
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:58,461
and I'm hoping to put her in a diabetic coma so I have no problem selling to her.

357
00:15:58,835 --> 00:15:59,523
Why?

358
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:00,701
Scare her.

359
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:04,062
Some people never learn until their life is on the line.

360
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:09,861
You know what you are?

361
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,222
What am I?

362
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:12,320
Skinny-fat.

363
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,382
And what are you gonna do about that?

364
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,651
We're gonna start exercising right away.

365
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,923
Don't humor me. I'm very serious.

366
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:22,031
I used to weigh 314 pounds.

367
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,783
Wow! Congratulations!

368
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:25,523
The key:

369
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,083
exercise.

370
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:30,083
You know, I'm not buying for personal use.

371
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:33,852
Are your customers just a bunch of Fatty McFat-fats?

372
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,752
Well, they're smokers

373
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:38,260
but it stands to reason that if they

374
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:41,510
eat rather than smoke, they'll just be able to breath easier,

375
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:44,103
should they decide to exercise.

376
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,281
It's a reasonable assumption.

377
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:49,522
And I hope you'll take it upon yourself to encourage them to do so.

378
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,502
Of course!

379
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,301
And I'll take everything you have.

380
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,282
Really?

381
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:53,893
Yeah.

382
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,360
And?

383
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:58,231
And I will make a greater effort to exercise.

384
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,452
No, no.

385
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,202
And I will exercise.

386
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:04,481
Yes, you will.

387
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:10,472
Great! Dumb and Dumber reunited.

388
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:13,230
Man! It's good to see you!

389
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:14,513
You smell really good.

390
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:17,220
You better get the fuck off me, dude. What's wrong with you?

391
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:20,590
What? Can't a straight man admire the stink of another handsome straight man?

392
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,111
Not unless you're in prison.

393
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,101
Is that where you've been?

394
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:24,281
Close. Alaska.

395
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:25,803
What about you? What have you been up to?

396
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:26,972
Same old, same old, dude.

397
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,680
Just dealing, growing,...

398
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:29,702
doing a little pilates.

399
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:30,451
No!

400
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,013
I love that shit, man!

401
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:35,502
Stretch you out, dude. Give you power, make you feel good as hell.

402
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:36,282
Hot instructor?

403
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,762
Ass like a peach, dude. You just wanna bite that shit.

404
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,123
Nice! Nice...

405
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:43,553
So... Conrad, man, can you help me out with a little?

406
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:56,013
It's a lot of weed, huh?

407
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,782
You got the money?

408
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:01,122
For that much? I don't...

409
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,960
Great! Lady Saltine sends her little errand boy with no scratch.

410
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:06,471
Nancy?

411
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:10,102
Yes, she only paid for the half order she picked up this morning.

412
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,801
And that's the other half.

413
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:15,643
You got my money, boy genius?

414
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:28,751
So huh... Nancy's getting pretty big, huh?

415
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,462
Fucking kingpin.

416
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,321
What's so funny?

417
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,362
What? Oh... huh... Conrad does pilates.

418
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:47,753
Okay. Where was I?

419
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,531
I'm surrounded...

420
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,990
You're surrounded by the enemy.

421
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:53,130
The enemy edges in, closer... closer...

422
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,403
then when they're just inches away, you invoke the Dong-Hai defence.

423
00:18:58,526 --> 00:18:59,613
What's that?

424
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:04,163
You protect your dong, and you swing like your life depended on it.

425
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,100
Cool!

426
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:09,963
I need to talk to you, you fucking perv!

427
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,272
All right, go practice that.

428
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,970
What are you talking about? Did that loony chick from Alaska call?

429
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,960
No, I'm talking about what you did to Megan today.

430
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:20,773
Who's Megan?

431
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:22,490
Megan! My girlfriend!

432
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,900
Told her to take her clothes off when she IMd.

433
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:26,491
Oh that Megan!

434
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:28,940
Yeah, I did that for you, bro'. You should be thanking me.

435
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:29,622
What?

436
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:30,721
That girl really digs you.

437
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,710
No shit! She's my fucking girlfriend.

438
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:35,283
But you haven't got into her panties yet, have you?

439
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:36,563
That's none of your business!

440
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,502
You know why?

441
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,171
'Cause you're afraid to make all the big moves

442
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,931
'cause she's all handicapped and shit.

443
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:43,401
But that's what you need to learn, buddy.

444
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:46,450
You gotta treat them like everybody else and then

445
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,830
it'll pop right open like a can of Pringles.

446
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,243
So...

447
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,103
So, she's ready, man, you gotta go for it.

448
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:55,960
You're gonna see her tonight?

449
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:57,313
- Yeah.
- Well...

450
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,951
Silas, check me out!

451
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,251
You better be right.

452
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,593
Trust me, man.

453
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:07,332
It's good to go.

454
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:15,780
Hey Pants!

455
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,092
Please tell me I didn't hear

456
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:22,850
that you had cyber sex with a 15-year-old deaf girl.

457
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:24,122
Absolutely not.

458
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,543
I want you out tonight.

459
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:26,263
Really?

460
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,090
'Cause you know I was just cooking dinner.

461
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:29,372
I want you out. Now!

462
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:30,371
Don't you wanna hear my menu

463
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,463
'cause I've got some really great recipes over

464
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:36,643
at my friend Conrad's joint earlier today.

465
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,762
Pot roast, corned beef hash,

466
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,252
tonight though I'm gonna go italian with little baked ziti

467
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:45,161
and a big plate of spaghetti marijuana.

468
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,640
You sneaky piece of shit!

469
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,153
Calm now, Nancy Pants!

470
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,711
Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black.

471
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:56,512
What did you do?

472
00:20:56,606 --> 00:21:00,242
Well, I went to my old friend Conrad to catch up on old times.

473
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,700
You remember Conrad, don't you?

474
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:03,211
He's a pot dealer.

475
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:06,370
He's the one you're supposed to call if you ever need a little puff.

476
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:14,230
And much to my surprise, I was handed a giant bag of weed

477
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,533
and told it was for you.

478
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,840
Where's my stuff?

479
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:20,321
So, I thought "Wow!

480
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,450
Either Nancy's got a big problem

481
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,323
or Nancy's got a lot of friends."

482
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:28,672
You've been making friends?

483
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,373
Where's my stuff?

484
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:32,872
Don't worry, it's safe.

485
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:49,080
Don't worry? Everything you touch turns to shit.

486
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:54,233
I'm family. We'll work it out.

487
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,693
I really want you to leave.

488
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:01,553
Look, the way I see it is

489
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:04,590
you're in way over your head here, you know.

490
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:06,813
You've got a house, you've got bills,

491
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:09,640
you're a mommy, dealing is a fulltime job.

492
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:12,762
You need some help, Nancy Pants.

493
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:16,132
Don't call me, Pants.

494
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:19,032
Judah called me Pants, not you.

495
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,883
Yeah, I miss him too, Nancy.

496
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:23,980
Whatever you think about me, Judah was my brother.

497
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,993
And I loved him.

498
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,092
And I have your back.

499
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:34,131
Now, I'ma go inside and I'ma finish cooking dinner for the family.

500
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:37,503
I'm making stoned crabs.

501
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:40,601
Sorry, I had to make that last one, I was working on them all the way home.

502
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:44,470
Hey.

503
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:47,250
You look hot in that leotard.

504
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:14,180
Take it off.

505
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:18,740
Perv Jr?

506
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:24,743
Come on you want to.

507
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:33,211
Your uncle was smoother.

508
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:01,251
I have cancer.
