00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,055

They think he's cool ever since he took up your cause.

13
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,202

16
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:29,779
Bad timing.

17
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:31,422
Its dad's birthday for fuck's sake !

18
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,400
We're married.

19
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,932
It's a business arangement.

20
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:36,431
What was that ?

21
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:37,840
I don't know !

22
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:42,221
Your boys at the DEA do they know about me ?

23
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:43,617
Probably not you're a small type

24
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,429
I thought we were under your radar ?

25
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,485
YOU are under my radar.

26
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:48,867
And since I'm keeping you there,
I gotta show my boss some results.

27
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,913
Don't Move ! NOBODY FUCKING MOVE !

28
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:53,598
This is a house of worship.

29
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,337
Did you tell Heylia yourself or
did you have your boy Conrad do it ?

30
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:57,463
You just wouldn't listen.

31
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:00,045
You went all, with one of my customers

32
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,234
and created a new game behind my back.

33
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,333
She's not gonna stay mad !

34
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:05,755
You do not know Heylia.

Weeds saison 2 épisode 10
" Mile Deep and A Foot Wide "

37
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,060
All starts here.

38
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:08,356
Under beautiful blue sky.

39
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:12,984
Yes Ma'am. No it ain't. Yes it is

40
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,498
This is where you find out who you are.

41
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,354
You gotta push.

42
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:21,213
Or you're gonna get pushed.

43
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,837
So which one do you think
gonna win ?

44
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,436
The fat one.

45
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:27,676
He got more leverage.

46
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:31,400
Unless the other one bites him,
or (this ain't anyone's game?)

47
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:36,738
I got here as soon as I could, this is not off the freeway.
You make a left...

48
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:37,871
We don't know you.

49
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:38,365
As you...

50
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,386
Sit your pretty ass on over there
and stare off somewhere else.

51
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:48,477
You wouldn't want the good men parked over in the chabby
thinking you something other thant what you look like

52
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,994
Bitchin' way over her head.

53
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:53,480
Yeah ! That's what happens when you get raided.

54
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:58,829
You get two white boys, in an Impala
following you everywhere you go.

55
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:03,033
(laughs)
But she don't have to worry about that.

56
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:04,697
Do she Levin ?

57
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,402
No she don't !

58
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,946
Cause she went off and
married herself a DEA agent !

59
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,581
Yes she did shipped off some Armenians
and started farming. Can you believe that ?

60
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,244
Can you believe that ?

61
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,451
I had no choice.

62
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,952
And I warned you about the bust.

63
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:22,709
Am I supposed to say thank you ?

64
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,035
You shut me down.

65
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,332
I ain't nothing comin' in now.

66
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:30,973
We can help you to get bio
or you get yourself up and running again.

67
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,370
Oh she did not just said that.

68
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,392
You took away my livelihood.

69
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,864
You think your help will make that right?

70
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,400
No. That's just the Bitchin' way over her head talkin'.
What do you want me to do Heylia ?

71
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,495
You start by talking to you husband.

72
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:49,938
Look you're gonna have to do whatever it takes.

73
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:57,170
And if that means you got to sit on his face
with roses up your snatch 5 nights a week,

74
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,503
you're gonna do that.

75
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:01,401
Help me ! Who the fuck are you ?

76
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,985
Hey Vanita, what happened to that child? umm...

77
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,093
Nancy something like that ?

78
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,226
.... Ain't that that white Bitch that thought that she was somethin' ?

79
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:11,091
Yeah, where she head now ?

80
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:13,638
She gone now. Vanished.

81
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,515
- What ?
- Nobody seen her since.

82
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:19,033
Oh man ! Those poor little boys !

83
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,364
Losin' both their parents !

84
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:24,074
Ain't that somethin' ! Can you imagine ?

85
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,501
Okay stop it !

86
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,694
I will stop everything.

87
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:34,027
I am Heylia Turner James.

88
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,442
And I know where you grow.

89
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,754
And I know where you live.

90
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:42,746
And both you, and Conrad on the clock.

91
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:44,504
To make this thing right.

92
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:46,896
Tick fucking tock.

93
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:48,962
Come on lil' girl.

94
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,152
Captain Too

00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:01,261
Scottson.

96
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,131
Sit down.

97
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,767
I'm re-reading your report.

98
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:10,627
I gotta tell you Pete. First time through it
gave me the shits and giggle so good.

99
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,421
I had elamonade it. (?)

100
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:16,196
All nine pages. I'm gonna put them
up on my wall over there.

101
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:20,097
And everytime I might have a crap day,
I'm gonna read about you.

102
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:21,776
and your muslim prayor meeting.

103
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:22,898
Suspects were tipped off.

104
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:23,601
Oh you think ?

105
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,902
Tell me agent,

106
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,763
Where is the next big bust ?

107
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:29,849
Our lady at the crack pipe or temple Beth meth ?

108
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,353
Surveillance is continuing.

109
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:32,757
Mike and Robin are in the Impala.

110
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:34,121
And we still have wire tapes.

111
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,760
And we're gonna wait around
for the woman's food stamps to run out.

112
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,569
She's an open door to U-Turn,
I need some slack here.

113
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,044
Shuman needs Mike and Robin.

114
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,377
- Captain.
- You got hosed Pete.

115
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:45,202

00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,384
Yes sir.

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,435
It's my anniversary today.

118
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:50,862
He forgot.

119
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,863
He forgets a lot of things.

120
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,912
17 years.

121
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:03,866
How long have you and ... ?

122
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:04,422
20.

123
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:06,134
18.

124
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,153
22.

125
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,013
I'm not cool with numbers.

126
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,459
You're an accountant.

127
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,107
Different. Those are guy numbers.

128
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,512
Years married, that's girl maths.

129
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:22,097
I'm ceased with guilt,
are you ceased with guilt ?

130
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:23,485
Ceased.

131
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:33,414
Good girl, good girl, good girl !

132
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:35,018
Oh we shouldn't be doing this.

133
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,571
You're right.

134
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:38,582
We have families.

135
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,617
Children.

136
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,948
Beautiful children.

137
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,850
This would destroy them.

138
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:52,149
(Legendaryyyyyy)

139
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,695
She thinks I can make Peter disappear.

140
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:59,998
Peter wants her in jail,
me out of the business.

141
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,263
Silas wants to skip college and be like me.

142
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:07,675
I think Shane knows what I do.
I can't even look at him in the face.

143
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,551
- I've never been to China.
- Sit down.

144
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:10,843
She threatened to kill me !

145
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,392
(?) motherfucker (?)

146
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:13,847
Give me your hand.

147
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,097
Breathe.

148
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:16,788
Look at me.

149
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,020
What are you doing ?

150
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:19,371
A Korean girl taught me this.

151
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,030
Keep breathing, and look at me.

152
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,337
I don't know what to do.

153
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:34,296
I'm out of moves.

154
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:35,808
Baby.

155
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,082
You never had any.

156
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:41,037
Moves mean you think things through,
you have been reacting.

157
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:45,831
That feels good.

158
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,225
You ready to get in the back seat ?

159
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:48,641
You ready for Conrad's plan now ?

160
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,265
You out.

161
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:53,904
I'm out.

162
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:59,075
You don't dug yourself a better mile
deep in the foot while and you ain't look to back up on your ... home. (?)

163
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:00,626
You out.

164
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:10,001
You go to him.
You tell him you love him.

165
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,587
Tell him you out after this office.

166
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,734
You get your money back.

167
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:15,646
Heylia James gets wiped off his board.

168
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,501
I take the equipment and disappear.

169
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,278
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,998
No I don't ... really wanna hear this.

171
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,445
No listen ! You've been a good friend.

172
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:29,978
This ain't no drive at miss Daisy.
I ain't about to feed you no Thanksgiving pie.

173
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:34,774
If thinks work out with Peter,
you get your money.

174
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,608
We're done.

175
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,305
You love him ?

176
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:46,813
Who ?

177
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:48,486
Agent wonder bread.

178
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:52,227
I'm not sure.

179
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:53,909
You think you could ?

180
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:57,948
You're out ?

181
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,151
The hour suck.

182
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:02,094
There's no health insurance.

183
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,763
It's a bad job for a danger junkie.

184
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:08,457
And that's you.

185
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,739
I admit I have a problem,
I'm going cold turkey. 

186
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:12,814
I'm sceptical.

187
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,074
Let me convince you.

188
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:15,544
Come to dinner tomorrow night.

189
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:16,902
You with my family.

190
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,294
Your sons ?

191
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:19,841
I don't know how thrilled they'll be.

192
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:20,841
They are good kids.

193
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:21,851
I know that.

194
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,521
And you're amazing.
Eat with us !

195
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,787
Heylia walks, Conrad leaves.

196
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:29,367
We make a go of it.

197
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:30,472
Dinner ?

198
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,816
My place. Bring your tooth brush !

199
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:35,310
I'm staying the night ?

200
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,565
Peter is my boyfriend.

201
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:40,694
He makes me happy.

202
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,263
Just your boyfriend ?

203
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,893
And he's in some sort of law inforcement I hear ?

204
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:47,459
So we can all feel safe.

205
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,064
I've invited him over for dinner tomorrow night.

206
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,341
It needs to go well.

207
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:53,519
Can I invite Gretchen ?

208
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,480
Absolutely !

209
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,818
What is this we're having ?

210
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,440
It's paella.

211
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,381
Great ! It's pretty !

212
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:02,989
I want you to make this again tomorrow night.

213
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,093
We don't have to eat the same thing I can make ...

214
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:07,269
No no no, I want you to make this.

215
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:08,532
(You got it?) !

216
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:10,429
Kat !

217
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,141
Did you lost your cat ?

218
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:15,412
I'm Kat, you're Nancy, right ?

219
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:16,306
I am.

220
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,839
There's a ... smell.

221
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:20,232
Grip jelly ? (?)

222
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:22,661
No ! It's... fish.

223
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:24,621
Oh that's me ! That's me !

224
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,117
It's sockeye salmon.

225
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,013
If you want (?)

226
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,598
No, I'm good. Who are you ?
What do you want ?

227
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,765
Is ... Andy here ?

228
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,708
Mom, uncle Andy's choking !

229
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:36,783
Come on in !

230
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:40,446
I've been eating nothing but sockeye salmon
for the past 47 hours

231
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:44,008
the map (?) said it took 33 which is bullshit !

232
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:47,836
I mean who's that boy ? You must be Shane.
Hi. Hug hug.

233
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,611
(?) your car or

234
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:52,315
You're the crazy chick from Alaska
who tried to kill my uncle ?

235
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:54,074
That is a great story !

236
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:54,980
Hi Silas !

237
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:56,554
You drove here all the way from Alaska ?

238
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,247
Yeah I borrowed some salmon
from the fishery.

239
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,232
That means she stole it.

240
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,700
The man at the 7-Eleven
gave me a case of Red Bull

241
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,435
And that mean she stole it.

242
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:06,428
And that's all I've been eating and drinking
for the past 47 hours, I feel great !

243
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,538
I drove and I drove and I drove,
till I get the innerstate 5.

244
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:14,385
and that's a straight line for 1211 miles

245
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,469
But I knew a shortcut,
hi !

246
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,865
Hi !

247
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,191
How did you find me ?

248
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,854
I read about your toe accident
online, Google.

249
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,741
I missed you so much.

250
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:28,962
I'm tired.

251
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:31,840
XXX is not beautiful.

252
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,323
I wrote a book.

253
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:37,164
And she is ...

254
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:39,102
Gone by tomorrow.
Promised.

255
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,106
Thank you.

256
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:44,346
How was your day?

257
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,217
How was my day ?

258
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:50,583
It was well.

259
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,469
How was your day ?

260
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:56,880
Isabelle had a call-back for voice over (?).

261
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:58,475
I didn't like the material.

262
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,087
AH !

263
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,509
I stopped by Doug's office but he wasn't there.

264
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,655
I'm still trying to patch things up.

265
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,912
Good luck with that !

266
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,070
Dean, we have to talk !

267
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:16,357
Just a second !

268
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,714
No, I mean we have to talk !

269
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,422
What is this ?

270
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:27,725
Happy anniversary !

271
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:30,295
You thought I forgot, didn't you ?

272
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:33,303
I thought you forgot.

273
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,112
It's lovely.

274
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,062
Thank you.

275
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:51,007
Anything for me ?

276
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,176
"Permafuck"

277
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:57,961
" A journal of spirit rape ".

278
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:00,613
Yes, it's about us.
And our time in Alaska.

279
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,882
You're not gonna like everything you read,
but I wrote the truth.

280
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,157
And Bump Chuck was very upset with you.

281
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:07,854
Who is Bump Chuck ?

282
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,005
He's my boyfriend.

283
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,942
He read my memoir and he wants to kill you Andy.

284
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,322
But don't worry I ditched him in Bakers field.

285
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,262
I don't think he followed me.

286
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,522
Big Eskimo guy ?

287
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,187
The correct term is inuit

288
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:21,870
Is that him ?

289
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,748
No !

290
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,910
He is much bigger than that.

291
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:31,036
Your orange juice.

292
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,680
Can I .... please ?

293
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,340
Sure !

294
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,276
Alright let's stay focused here.
So you wrote a book about us ?

295
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:42,020
Yeah and I just need you
to sign a letter that says that

296
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:46,063
everything in the memoir
happened in the real life.

297
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,831
Okay so I just have to sign something
and then you.. then you go away ?

298
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,492
And you can read that in the van.

299
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:52,155
In the van ?

300
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:53,272
After I fuck you !

301
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:55,297
Yeah.. No no no no no.

302
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:59,223
Bump Chuck is an old XXX he beats people  ..
but he's a premature ejaculator.

303
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,633
I can't have sex with you.

304
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:04,318
You (?) man that made me come.

305
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:06,982
No no no, I can't.

306
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:15,629
April 28th, 2005, 5:26 PM, Ketchikan, Alaska

307
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,132
Women's bathroom, Deer Mountain Hatchery

308
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,080
We'll take the check.

309
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:30,435
Yeah I don't know when I stopped really loving Dean.

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,298
The only reason we're still together
is 'cause of the kids.

311
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,526
You know once Isabel graduates...

312
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,520
Turn the TV.

313
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,981
It'll take your mind off your troubles.

314
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:51,702
God that feels good !

315
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,011
...

316
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,365
I have tapes in my bag.

317
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:17,867
Porno ?

318
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:19,431
Better !

319
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,340
We'll have Gretchen home by nine.

320
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,299
She's a great kid.

321
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:27,915
So enters ...

322
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:29,769
... the eldest son !

323
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,195
Where have you been ?

324
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:35,107
It's 5:30 I thought dinner was at 5:30

325
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,820
Dinner was supposed to be at 5:30,
but you're uncle didn't show up to make it, so...

326
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,263
...we're making it ourselves.
Hey Silas !

327
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,333
Hi !

328
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:44,025
What's with the outfit ?

329
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,108
Just an outfit !

330
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:47,217
You wanna help out ?

331
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:51,002
I'm not exactly a gourmet here.

332
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,305
Call me when it's ready.

333
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,520
So this guy is your mom's boyfriend or something ?

334
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:02,693
I guess so.

335
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:04,762
My mom has got a boyfriend.

336
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,400
Your two parents are divorced ?

337
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:07,986
Separated.

338
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,291
My dad's got an appartment.

339
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:11,947
I see him on the week ends.

340
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:13,593
What's that like ?

341
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:14,921
I don't know.

342
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,250
We go to the movies, when they ... off.

343
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,399
Mostly says he's sorry, stuff like that.

344
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,609
Sounds awesome.

345
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:24,374
Back

346
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,810
Punishment ?

347
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,289
The Alphabet backwards.

348
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:35,335
z, y, x, w, v, u, t, s, r, q, p

349
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,629
Just ... not as good as last night.

350
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,839
Yeah, the thing about paella is
you have to watch it pretty close
or it turns into a ...

351
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:45,011
Sticky ... of crap ?

352
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,691
The thing with paellas,

353
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,111
You have to be here in order to cook it,

354
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:50,320
and some people weren't here.

355
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,539
So, Peter, I think your paella is great !

356
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,744
I tried my best.

357
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,923
In fact, I'm gonna have me some more.

358
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,520
Anybody else ? Gretchen ?

359
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:00,923
Oh, no.

360
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,749
Thank you.

361
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:05,961
Silas, get your elbows off the table.

362
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,896
Hum, I don't wanna make this awkward,
but I wanted to apologize for coming by last week.

363
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:14,238
Your mother told be that you were
having a party, in honor of your father.

364
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:15,927
Yeah that pretty much sucked.

365
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,870
Silas, don't be a brat and
get your elbows off the table.

366
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,738
I wanted you two to know that,

367
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,163
I respect the memory of your father.

368
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:28,491
We've heard the speech :
I'm not hear to replace him, I just want to sleep with your mom.

369
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,888
Your mother asked you several times, Silas.

370
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,843
You're gonna let him do that ?

371
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,165
Show some respect.

372
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:53,514
Gretchen, this isn't how we usually act,
I apologize.

373
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,051
She's right, we usually have dinner
at the dining room table,

374
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:58,668
we usually don't eat the same thing
two nights in a row,

375
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:01,804
we don't use cloth napkins,
we put our elbows wherever the fuck we want !

376
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:02,509
Pull ...

377
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,396
We don't dress up like
we're going to some movie premiere,

378
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,328
What are you, on your 8th glass of wine ?

379
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,000
You could use some boundaries, son.

380
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:13,017
Okay, dinner's over.

381
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,430
Silas go up to your room.

382
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,486
Andy, would you drive Gretchen home ?

383
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:18,704
I would like to, I'm a little hum...

384
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,384
He's too stoned to drive !

385
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:21,233
I'll take her.

386
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,429
Silas, you're not going anywhere !

387
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,175
I'll drive her home.

388
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,272
Er, I don't know you.

389
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:27,135
He's a police man.

390
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,313
I don't know him.

391
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,723
You don't know Silas either !

392
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:31,794
He's Shane's brother.

393
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,258
Alright, I'll drive her.

394
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:35,902
You've had too much to drink.

395
00:18:39,004 --> 00:18:39,855
Sorry mom.

396
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,707
No.

397
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,004
You're right honey.

398
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,708
No need to apologize.

399
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,955
Gretchen, Silas will drive you home.

400
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:52,091
Silas, there and back, this is your last drive.

401
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:56,389
- Peter.
- Yeah ?

402
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,672
I'm sorry about what I said about the food.

403
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,238
I'm gonna go feed the cat.

404
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,084
Dinner with the family.

405
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,014
I can't believe they let you have this stuff.

406
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,210
This is awesome !

407
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:27,481
You think the Agrestic police force
has the budget for someone to monitor these things ?

408
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:30,967
No, no one sees these except me.

409
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:35,060
There !

410
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:36,832
Oh, that's Kate Valenski.

411
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,034
Martin's wife ?

412
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:39,230
- Yeah.
- Jesus !

413
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:42,345
I know, can't be anymore than 75 pounds now,

414
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:45,010
Monday to Sunday, vanishing away

415
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:49,413
Wait, I think something good is coming up.

416
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,396
Better than the guy shiting
in the mail home ?

417
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,967
Better ! Wait for it. Wait for it !

418
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:55,911
There !

419
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,153
Is that Litman ? Naked ?

420
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,577
Around at 10 o'clock, every evening !

421
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,590
I haven't had any complains yet.

422
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,851
That's cause everyone's inside molesting their kids.

423
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:06,839
Dark !

424
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:09,718
Well 3 hours of Agrestic going wild
will do that to you.

425
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:14,349
Has it been 3 hours already ?
Oh shit. Oh shit !

426
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,430
This is better than porn.

427
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:22,428
Yeah well, better enjoy it while you can,
some fucking low life stole two of them already.

428
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:23,360
The cameras ?

429
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:26,931
And the free-drug zone signs,
and the sasquash costume.

430
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:28,500
You're pissin' of a lot of people Celia.

431
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,922
Yeah that must mean that's working.

432
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:31,355
Hey !

433
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,360
Thanks for the dick.

434
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:34,440
Sure thing

435
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:40,080
Promise you'll change my name.

436
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,846
I promise.

437
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:45,205
Good, here you go.

438
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,158
Unite victims everywhere, make millions.

439
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,630
You're not gonna read it ?

440
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:51,181
No, no, I'm gonna go to bed.

441
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:54,034
Sleep in the van,

442
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:55,607
You gotta be up the morning.

443
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,077
Okay? Give my best to Abumb Chuck.

444
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,186
I drove half a continent to see you Andy.

445
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,824
Well you've got your signature,
so god speed.

446
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,703
Have you ever been fishing in Baha ?

447
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:07,881
In Baha ?

448
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,528
No, I...

449
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,285
You don't understand, I have a thing here.

450
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:16,090
I'm helping my sister-in-law.

451
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:18,065
I'm taking care of these kids.

452
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,470
I'm getting my shit together.

453
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:23,601
That would be lovely,

454
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:26,528
if you truly believed it.

455
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,018
What are you doing ?

456
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,604
Do you realize how many felonies we've commited ?
I'm publishing the book as fiction.

457
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:34,930
Then why are you here ?

458
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,643
I'm going to save you Andy !

459
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:30,249
Hey!

460
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:32,639
You look good.

461
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:37,933
Are you okay ?

462
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,138
Yeah !

463
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:41,372
No.

464
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,066
Not on this side.

465
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,572
I thought you sleep on the left side.

466
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,238
I do, just not in this bed.

467
00:22:46,913 --> 00:22:47,963
Okay.

468
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,012
I see.

469
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:50,759
Thanks.

470
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:00,676
Candles are nice.

471
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:01,787
it's calming

472
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,521
You're incredibly sexy.

473
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:13,356
We have to be quiet.

474
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,000
Of course.

475
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,554
Why did you do that thing ?

476
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:37,979
To his elbow ?

477
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,615
This didn't work out so good.

478
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:44,542
No ! It's just...

479
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,355
the first time I invite somebody over.

480
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:50,484
And we rushed things a little ?

481
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:52,657
Oh, maybe just the

482
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:55,114
sleep over part.

483
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:56,984
But I'll call you.

484
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,523
Thanks for trying.

485
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:17,815
It's me.

486
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:19,522
Everything's right ?

487
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:22,341
Everything is not alright,
Conrad's plan did not work out.

488
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:24,642
Then we got some problems.

489
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:25,665
We sure do !

490
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:27,635
Talk to me.

491
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:32,373
He has walked out of my front door 5 minutes ago,
and I don't want him

492
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,739
ever coming back.

493
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,715
Did he do something to you ?

494
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:38,861
No no it's nothing like that, it's just ...

495
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:44,815
I forgot myself.

496
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:49,720
Agent Wonderbread is not my husband.

497
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,480
He isn't ?

498
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,673
Not in this lifetime, I do not love him.

499
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,731
And I'm never gonna love him.

500
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:56,953
He don't know that right ?

501
00:24:57,203 --> 00:25:00,163
No, I left it okay, I think.

502
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:02,936
You're going to have to play like that for a little while long.
Are you cool with that ?

503
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,881
Oh yeah, I think I can do that.

504
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,665
Meet me at the house tomorrow, alright?

505
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:09,505
Okay.

506
