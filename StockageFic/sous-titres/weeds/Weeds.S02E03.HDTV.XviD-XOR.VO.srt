1
0-1:59:59,234 --> 00:00:00,823
Previously on Weeds.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,038
Conrad, this is Celia.

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,553
I fucked a black man. Conrad.

4
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:05,764
Where's Conrad?

5
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:08,579
Hey, I've been meaning to ask:
is Conrad a popular name in the

6
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,075
African-American community?

7
00:00:10,118 --> 00:00:12,511
You don't get it. This is Princeton.

8
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,703
I can't get into Princeton. I'm not deaf.

9
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:17,715
Did you just say what
I think you've said?

10
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,299
Megan and I broke up, okay?

11
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,459
Basically, my whole life
has been leading up to this,

12
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:22,720
to here, to the rabbinat.

13
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,876
I think you're full of shit.

14
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:27,024
Are you letting me in?

15
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:28,330
Provisionally.

16
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,624
You should run for City Council.

17
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:32,259
Doug would lose his mind.

18
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:36,105
I have a dead plant
and a check for $80,000.

19
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,558
You need to find a grow house.

20
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:39,146
Where the hell did you get that kind of money?

21
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,828
Sanjay burned the bakery down.

22
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,742
What do you do exactly?

23
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,475
I'm a DEA agent.

24
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:46,071
Don't ever call me

25
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:47,935
or contact me again.

26
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,329
I know you're a drug dealer.

27
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:12,195
So stupid.

28
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,304
Come on, Nancy.

29
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,080
Let's talk.

30
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,672
There are only 400 DEA
agents in the entire world.

31
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,025
Stupid.

32
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,596
And it's our job to go after
every single drug dealer.

33
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,090
So stupid.

34
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,343
Crystal meth labs in Colorado,

35
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,444
heroin exporters in Afghanistan,

36
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,040
cocaine growers in Colombia.

37
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,234
So unbelievably fucking stupid.

38
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:43,384
So when I come accross a
suburban widow dealing dime bags

39
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:46,381
to bored housewives, I like
to flatter myself by thinking

40
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:49,193
that I have more important
things to do with my time.

41
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,067
Professionally speaking.

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,045
No offense, Nancy, but
you're way below my radar.

43
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:59,129
Small patatoes, teeny tiny
fish in a deep narcotic sea.

44
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:02,460
So, I'm thinking, if
you're well enough,

45
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,813
we grab a bite to eat,

46
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,308
get a nice bottle of wine,

47
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,389
try to figure this whole thing out.

48
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:14,330
You could be trying to set me up.

49
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,393
- I'm not.
- How do I know that?

50
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:17,650
You just have to trust me.

51
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:18,855
Trust you?

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,196
You're a DEA agent.

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,870
Natural enemies.

54
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:27,656
We're like that story, the
scorpion and the turtle.

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,997
- The scorpion and the frog.
- Turtle.

56
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:31,523
Turtles have hard shells.

57
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,636
How can the scorpion
sting through a hard shell?

58
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,549
Sting 'em in the neck.

59
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:36,855
Repeat.

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,680
Stop being cute.

61
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,622
How long have you known?

62
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:46,533
After we first met,
when you blew me off.

63
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:50,470
I sort of snooped
into your life, sorry.

64
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:53,520
Wasn't hard to figure out.
It is my job after all.

65
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:56,052
Are you wearing a wire?

66
00:03:57,063 --> 00:04:00,137
How do I check for a wire?

67
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:03,745
Oh God! I love your chest.

68
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:10,621
God! I'm completely freaking out.

69
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:17,908
I love this wine. Don't
you love this wine?

70
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:21,038
You're adorable when you're looped.

71
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:22,912
I'm not looped.

72
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:29,957
The alcohol flushes me. It gives a natural blush.

73
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,643
All girls look better with blush.

74
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,605
At least, that's what
my sister told me.

75
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,724
Jill?

76
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,474
You're good.

77
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,231
Okay, let's say I quit.

78
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:44,229
Quit everything and got a job at
Nordstroms. Would you let me go?

79
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,777
I don't wanna let you go.

80
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:48,497
Can't you just pretend
you don't know what I do?

81
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,793
- Yeah, I could.
- No, you couldn't. Scorpion.

82
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,959
What if this is all an act
you put on to nail dealers?

83
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:59,490
Take them to dinner
and profess my love?

84
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:02,339
That's how I took down
the Santiago brothers.

85
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,762
Still no way I can trust you ever.

86
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:06,306
Never ever.

87
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:08,222
Never say never.

88
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:11,859
I've had a little
time to think this out.

89
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:12,787
And?

90
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,711
I am a man with a plan.

91
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:16,953
A man. A plan.

92
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,813
A canal Panama.

93
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,204
- What?
- It's a palindrome.

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,963
It's the same backwards as
forwards like Madam I'm Adam.

95
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,204
We're going to Panama?

96
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,273
We're going to make this work.

97
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,564
Rise and shine, little girl.

98
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:43,244
What?

99
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:46,086
School is not till 8.

100
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,856
Yes, but boot camp is at 6.

101
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,530
Boot camp?

102
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:53,721
Yeah, you don't wanna be the
fattest girl at fat camp this summer.

103
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:55,027
Do  you?

104
00:05:55,627 --> 00:05:59,381
Okay, you guys, we begin now!

105
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,257
Feel it in the chest!

106
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,800
Left arm, pull!

107
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,483
Feel  it in the back!

108
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,539
Yeah, I'm gonna be in the car.

109
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,928
Okay, okay, here we go. Jump!

110
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:12,528
Uno, dos, three, four, ...

111
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:15,818
Do you want to join us?

112
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,985
- Me?
- Just you.

113
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,277
Not, it's not for me. It's for my daughter.

114
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,135
I have a tape that I do at home.

115
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:27,708
No looky lose, just dooey does.

116
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,960
Yes, well, I've only paid for her.

117
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,821
So, go into your stuff.

118
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:35,142
Muy bien.

119
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:38,792
I've seen your posters.

120
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:39,808
What?

121
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:42,577
You know de... campagna.

122
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,748
- My campaign posters?
- Yes.

123
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,849
And to be winner, you must be thinner.

124
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,432
I don't have time for this.

125
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:53,193
And at $40 an hour, neither do you.

126
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,420
Talk to the muscles!

127
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:58,865
Yeah, fuck my muscles.

128
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,344
You'll live to be 110 years old.

129
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:04,446
I'm 75 and I look 21!

130
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,108
I just had this outfit drycleaned.

131
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,467
- You okay, mom?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,646
- He bullied me into this!
- No Ricardo's fault.

133
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:18,039
I went through chimo.

134
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,431
- Oh, I went through chimo!
- Oh, me too!

135
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:21,788
Yeah, well, I had radiation.

136
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:23,610
- I had radiations.
- So did I.

137
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:24,918
Plus I'm low blood sugar.

138
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,929
- Type 1 diabetis.
- Type 2 for me.

139
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,753
Oh, fuck you both!

140
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:32,543
Sweetheart, don't worry. Your
mom is gonna be just fine.

141
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:35,590
Please... That bitch
will outlive us all.

142
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:37,038
- I heard that.
- Good.

143
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,810
Alright! We're here to exercise.

144
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,159
We're not here to
stand around. Come on!

145
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,546
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

146
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,084
We're encoutering some turbulence.

147
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:56,940
We'd like you to return to your
seat and fasten your seatbelt.

148
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:57,677
Thank you.

149
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:23,425
Hey, shalom! Hi.

150
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:26,750
I'm doing an article
for the school paper.

151
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:28,528
Mind answering a few questions?

152
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,072
We don't have a school paper.

153
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,065
No, it's more of a prototype really.

154
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:36,280
Anyway, you're married?
Dating? Living in sin?

155
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:39,221
Not since my lover was killed.

156
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,664
Dead lover you say.

157
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,667
He was my commanding
officer in the Israeli army.

158
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,990
Fucking Hamas suicide bomber piece of
shit blew him up in a pizza parlour.

159
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:52,585
That is so awful. The whole
Middle East thing, I mean... why?

160
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,267
Anyway, since hunting
down Zev's murderer,

161
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,700
I've sort of been
concentrating on my studies.

162
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:00,141
Well, grief takes us strange places.

163
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,435
You've lost someone
close to you as well?

164
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:08,204
My brother Judah dropped dead
while jogging with his young son.

165
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:11,383
We were really close.
We were like brothers.

166
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:14,244
Judah... it's a beautiful name.

167
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,396
It means the praised one.

168
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,173
What's the story behind Yael?

169
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,897
It's from the Book of Judges.

170
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,084
Yael invites a leader of
the enemy army into her tent,

171
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,325
gives him milk to drink,
when he falls asleep,

172
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,752
she hammers a tent
stake through his skull.

173
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,616
I love judges.

174
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,050
Guess my parents expected
big things from me.

175
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:36,061
In that case, how about I take
you out to dinner some time?

176
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,698
No milk, a little wine maybe.

177
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,431
To say thanks for
everything you've done.

178
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,396
I  have a policy never to date students.

179
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,115
- Just commanding officers, huh?
- I was following orders.

180
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,029
Come on, I just...

181
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:48,180
I just wanna say thanks...

182
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,294
for saving me from
being a victim of a

183
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,155
road side bomb in downtown Baghdad.

184
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,235
Okay.

185
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:58,825
Fine.

186
00:09:58,952 --> 00:09:59,682
Fine.

187
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:23,227
Hi, everyone! Sorry I'm late.

188
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:25,078
Rough day at the office, dear?

189
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,905
I had some stuff to take care of.

190
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,056
- Stuff?
- What kind of stuff?

191
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,101
What do you do now
that the bakery is gone?

192
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,684
I'm looking for a small

193
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:35,127
business to invest in, I look.

194
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,292
Today, I looked. I might
look again tomorrow.

195
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,257
You make this big deal
about family dinner

196
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:44,307
and then you show up late
after disappearing all day.

197
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,076
Yeah, well, I'm here now so...

198
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,522
give me a break.

199
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:50,634
Do we have any aspirin?

200
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,662
Too many aspirin can
give you bleeding ulcers.

201
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:58,140
Thanks for the tip,
Shane. What's for dinner?

202
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:02,696
Lamb and couscous and ratatouille. Why don't you pull up a seat?

203
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:07,778
Goddamn plumbing! This
house is built like crap.

204
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:10,018
It's gonna cost me a fortune.

205
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,426
So how was everyone's day?

206
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:22,349
- Okay.
- Okay.

207
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:23,374
Okay.

208
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,236
...that's okay in Hebrew.

209
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,100
How was your day, Nancy?

210
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,486
Okay. It was okay.

211
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:57,414
I fucking miss you.

212
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,982
I miss you too.

213
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:04,081
Are you going to stop being an asshole?

214
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:10,202
If we only have a few months
together, I wanna make them count.

215
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,392
Really count.

216
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:17,584
I want us both to remember this
time for the rest of our lives.

217
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,487
Starting now.

218
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:08,207
Fucking pipes!

219
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,894
Anyway, someone's been
flushing socks down your pipes.

220
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,845
Socks? What kind of socks?

221
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,378
Tube socks. Those with the stripes.

222
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,997
You  have a son, say
around 11 or 12 years old?

223
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,659
He's probably been flushing
his jerk socks down the toilet.

224
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:23,776
Jerk socks?

225
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,875
He make the man salsa
in the sock then flush.

226
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,472
I never went through this with Silas.

227
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:31,472
Silas used T-shirts and then tied them

228
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,372
at the bottom of the laundry.

229
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,429
You or your husband
oughta talk to him.

230
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,060
Otherwise I'll be back
here in a couple of days

231
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:39,552
to snake out your pipes
all over again. Thanks.

232
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,508
Me or my husband...

233
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:46,021
If only Shane would have started
whacking when Mr. Judah was alive!

234
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:52,719
What have we done? Peter.

235
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,479
So  what was it you wanted to talk about?

236
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,685
You know how the...

237
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:09,812
plumbing's been screwed
up in the last few days?

238
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:10,599
Yeah.

239
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:13,183
Turns out uh...

240
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,294
Someone's been...

241
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,572
flushing their socks down the toilet.

242
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:20,289
- Socks?
- Socks.

243
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:21,024
Oh.

244
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:24,406
Any idea who might be doing that?

245
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,621
Lupita?

246
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,534
Why would Lupita flush her socks?

247
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:29,975
'Cause she's too lazy to wash 'em?

248
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,167
Shane, have you been
flushing your socks?

249
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,914
No!

250
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,346
It's okay if you have.

251
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,412
I haven't.

252
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:49,171
Shane, have you noticed any
changes in your body recently?

253
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,807
What tiny changes?

254
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:54,425
- You know, changes.
- I'm getting taller.

255
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:59,068
- No, down there changes.
- Down there?

256
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:02,807
With your penis, Shane. Have you
noticed any changes with your penis?

257
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,133
What's wrong with my penis?

258
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,575
Nothing, that's just it,
it's perfectly natural.

259
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:07,832
What's perfectly natural?

260
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,121
Stuff that comes out when you rub it.

261
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,426
I have to go to school.

262
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,214
Go.

263
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,994
- Talk to Shane about jerking off.
- I'm all over it.

264
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,701
What am I looking at?

265
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:37,703
Gated community. Ain't
no cops driving by.

266
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:39,006
Now discreet exterior,

267
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,589
decent square footage,
access to power lines.

268
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,819
We trust the landlord?

269
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,884
We trust him to stay far away.

270
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:47,938
Mr. Avakian has been a
client of mine for years.

271
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,393
Retired to Arizona.

272
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:52,015
As long as we pay rent on time
and swear we're not Turkish,

273
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:54,168
- we are golden.
- Not Turkish?

274
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,975
Armenians hate Turks. Some Armenian genocide thing or something.

275
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,346
Just never order Turkish coffee
in an Armenian restaurant,

276
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:01,930
they'd fucking take your head off.

277
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:05,311
That's a great tip considering
all the fine Armenian dining I do.

278
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,788
Don't knock it. Nice Pastrami
sandwich, some fattoush salad.

279
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,282
It's nothing to sneer at!

280
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,919
Now you been eating some weird shit.

281
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,979
That's right, I heard you
guys ain't adventurous eaters.

282
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,338
No, that's just not true.

283
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:17,020
'Cause real men eat the sushi.

284
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,412
Okay, I don't need to be a
part of this conversation.

285
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:21,096
I just don't eat nothing
called "fat tush".

286
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:22,823
I'm sure you've had "fat tush" before.

287
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,414
No, see another stereotype.

288
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,191
Wait, wait, wait, I
know there's a joke here.

289
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,429
Enough! Call Mr. Avakian and
tell him we'll take the house.

290
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:31,703
It's really happening.

291
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,385
- It sure is.
- I feel good.

292
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:35,647
I'm not scared.

293
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,703
Don't make sense not to
be just a little scared.

294
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,230
Well, I'm not. Not even a little.

295
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,542
Baby...

296
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,263
do you know about the evil eye?
You need to stop talking like that.

297
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:48,565
Good, good. Good, good, good.

298
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,947
Avakian wants to know
if he has to paint.

299
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:53,269
Negative on the paint.

300
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,430
It's ours.

301
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,295
Listen up, people.

302
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,595
Now that we're stepping
up, we gotta watch our shit.

303
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:02,111
Growhouses get busted for like

304
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,496
girlfriends who want revenge,

305
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,461
ex-wives who don't get
their alimony check.

306
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:08,609
It's fucked up personal shit that
will get you popped everytime.

307
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:11,420
So we tell no one...

308
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,295
about this place.

309
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:14,411
We're clear?

310
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:15,956
Sorry, I'm late.

311
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,421
What did I miss?

312
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:20,142
Uh, Conrad just said something.

313
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,289
Conrad...

314
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,880
Here.

315
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:27,605
What's this?

316
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:30,137
Filed papers for my campaign.

317
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,410
Notarize them, send them in.

318
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:35,182
Charge it to the office Fed Ex
account, save everyone a few bucks.

319
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:37,285
Yeah. Sure.

320
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,359
You're the Conrad who fucked my wife.

321
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,422
Oh, terrific!

322
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,521
Um...

323
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,587
Look, man, I don't have to say I...

324
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,578
Alright, you know what...

325
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:56,401
No, no, fair is fair.
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.

326
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,522
You get one free shot.

327
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:15,688
Wait!

328
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,287
I need time to plan.

329
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,831
What the fuck!

330
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,781
Yo! Ain't no planning.

331
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,392
You hit me now or the
offer is off the table.

332
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,886
I never hit a man before.

333
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:28,961
And...

334
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,116
I'm not good under pressure.

335
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,801
You have to let me take a raincheck.

336
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:36,128
You're taking pussy to a
whole new level right now.

337
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,423
Please...

338
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,047
you did bang my wife.

339
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:44,879
Fine. Just no sucker
punches to the stomach.

340
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:47,690
That's how Houdini died and
I ain't going out like that.

341
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:50,652
Jesus!

342
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:54,039
I'm surrounded by
the fucking Lost Boys.

343
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:56,740
Alright listen closely, I'm
not gonna beat around the bush.

344
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,404
Your little body is changing,
it's all good, believe me.

345
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,810
Problem now is...

346
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,445
everytime we jerk the gherkin,

347
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,900
we end up with a lot of unwanted
sticky white stuff everywhere, right?

348
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:11,393
Right! So, first order of business...

349
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,976
No more socks.

350
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,116
They're expensive, gumming
up the works plumbing-wise.

351
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,418
You might be thinking to
yourself "but Uncle Andy,

352
00:19:18,513 --> 00:19:19,862
what do I do with all that pearl jam

353
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,826
if I can't spew it
in the mystery sock?"

354
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,715
Glad you asked.

355
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,903
You can have a lovely time tugging
the tiger in the shower each morning.

356
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,327
That eliminates the
need for a goo glove.

357
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,226
But the day is long,
masturbation's fun,

358
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,065
so unless we wanna take
4 or 5 showers everyday,

359
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,940
we're gonna need some
other options here.

360
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:37,506
So let's start with the basics.

361
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,907
Tissues. Perfectly acceptable
backstop for all that creamy italian.

362
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,957
It can be rough and dry on
such soft sensitive skin,

363
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:49,036
not to mention that can stick to
your dick head like a fucking band-aid.

364
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,686
Aouch!

365
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,304
From  there we move on
to more lubricated ***,

366
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,594
specifically bananas.

367
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,230
Step 1: peel the banana.

368
00:19:57,323 --> 00:20:00,846
Step 2: slip the peel
over your Andy Johnson,

369
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,045
start pitching.

370
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,666
Now for extra credit, warm up
the peal in the microwave...

371
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,831
Not too hot!

372
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,048
Serious yowza.

373
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,151
Also olive oil, moisturizer,

374
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,961
honey, spit, butter, hair
conditioner and vaseline

375
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:13,593
can all be used for lube.

376
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,428
In my opinion, the best lube...

377
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:16,307
is lube.

378
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,836
So save your allowance.
Invest in some soon.

379
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:19,815
Alright, moving on.

380
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,450
When you tug your
Thomas on the toilet...

381
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,703
shoot right into the bowl.

382
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:27,310
In bed, soft t-shirt,
perhaps a downy handtowel

383
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:30,179
if you're very horny and you
don't mind tossing after tossing.

384
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:34,167
There's no such thing as polishing
the raised scepter of love too much.

385
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:37,686
It reduces stress. It
enhances immune function.

386
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,939
Also: practice makes perfect

387
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:42,371
so work on your control now
while you're a solo artist.

388
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:45,650
You'll be playing some long
happy duets in the future.

389
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,481
Alright, class dismissed.

390
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,358
Hey!

391
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,845
Homework.

392
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:00,847
Still using that anti-bacterial soap?

393
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,062
It's good for the baby.

394
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,978
Fucks up the baby's immunities.

395
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:05,662
It don't fuck up the baby's immunities.

396
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:08,383
Girl, that child needs
to get germs and bacteria

397
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,398
so he can fight 'em off
and develop antibodies.

398
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:14,204
Keep killing everything around him and
his immune sytem is gonna be for shit.

399
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,356
Wind up living in a fucking bubble.

400
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,544
Actually, she's right. Overuse
of anti-bacterials can lead to...

401
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:21,747
Not your baby, stay out of this.

402
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:24,180
Yeah, stay out of it. I've got this.

403
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:26,743
Trying to turn my
grandbaby into a bubble boy!

404
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:27,908
And I ain't having it.

405
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:32,810
Ooh! Lord! It's him. That's
him. Quick, give me that weed.

406
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:33,890
What's going on?

407
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,432
The prince of pies.

408
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,676
- What?
- It's him. He's here.

409
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,220
I said get rid of it.

410
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:41,175
Time to melt Snowflake.

411
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,048
- What?
- Alright.

412
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:44,352
That's her.

413
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:45,898
The money.

414
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,728
Good afternoon.

415
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:56,163
Hi. I'm Nancy.

416
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:57,790
Okay.

417
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:01,797
I brought you a bean pie, Heylia.

418
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:06,061
Oh, Joseph! Aren't you lovely!

419
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,123
I've never had a bean pie.

420
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,457
Lucky you!

421
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:14,422
So, how much do I owe you?

422
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,717
That will be $24.

423
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,465
Do you have any more? I'll buy one.

424
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:20,345
I'm out.

425
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:23,595
Best be going now.

426
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:27,289
You know, I was just
about to take my exercise

427
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:30,330
so why don't I walk next door with you.

428
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,154
That would be lovely.

429
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:34,248
Nice meeting you, Joseph.

430
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:35,791
Okay.

431
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:39,908
What was that about?

432
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,013
That was about the
mountain coming to Mohammad.

433
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:43,469
He barely acknowledged my presence.

434
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:46,230
You're the white devil girl.
He's Nation Of Islam.

435
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,190
Y'all two ain't never having coffee.

436
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,256
Now, do me a favor.

437
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,717
Please take some of his
fucking little pies with you.

438
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:57,301
What's in a bean pie anyway?

439
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,224
Ground up white babies and nutmeg.

440
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,898
Hmm. My favorite.

441
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:25,948
What happened to you?

442
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,699
Pulled a muscle in
my cooze in bootcamp.

443
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,572
Alright? Happy you asked.

444
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,812
So, what brings you by, Celia?

445
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:36,253
I know that you're
depressed, I'm here for you.

446
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:37,778
Me?

447
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,821
I am here to pull you out of it.

448
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,692
- I'm not depressed.
- Bullshit!

449
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,028
Your business burned down.

450
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,363
Kids... busy with their
lives of their own.

451
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,411
Brother-in-law feeds off
of you like a parasite.

452
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:50,665
You haven't been laid
in God knows how long.

453
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,412
And you haven't been
to PTA in over a month.

454
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:55,679
What are you doing?

455
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,593
I'm fine, Celia.

456
00:23:58,245 --> 00:23:59,834
So what do you do all day?

457
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,312
- Things.
- What things?

458
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:05,307
Okay, you didn't hobble over here

459
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:08,645
with your icky vagina just
to chase my blues away.

460
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,901
What do you want?

461
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:12,104
Please, work on my campaign.

462
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:15,673
Please! Doug is a
turd, Pam is an idiot.

463
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:19,328
You just keep me company. I
don't even care who you vote for.

464
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,495
I have a broken crotch,

465
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,985
you need to get out of
the house, it's win-win.

466
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:24,471
Please!

467
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:28,889
Just say yes. You know if you don't,
I'll never stop harrassing you.

468
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:29,625
Fine.

469
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,880
Fine.

470
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:34,480
- Hi, Mrs. Hodes.
- Hello, Shane.

471
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,961
How do you get your kids to eat fruit?

472
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:39,023
Shane's been on this
whole banana kick lately,

473
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,265
maybe he needs potassium, I don't know.

474
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:46,188
Well, I'm gonna go
home and ice my beaver.

475
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:50,644
See you next Tuesday.

476
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:57,172
Hello.

477
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:58,389
Hey there.

478
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,232
Just thinking about where we
were less than 24 hours ago.

479
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:11,027
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

480
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,452
We're encoutering some turbulence.

481
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:15,262
We'd like you to return to your
seat and fasten your seatbelt.

482
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,149
Thank you.

483
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:19,152
We'll get you something
to wear when we land.

484
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:24,164
No one but us has to know about this.

485
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:25,042
Our secret.

486
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:27,322
- Strictly business.
- Strictly business.

487
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:30,634
This means they can't make
you testify against me?

488
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:33,264
They can not make me
testify against you.

489
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:35,637
And I get to hang on
to the certificate.

490
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,644
The certificate is all yours
to do with it what you will.

491
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,488
Anything else?

492
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:44,295
I need to be home in
time for family dinner.

493
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:46,580
Howdy, people!

494
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:50,237
Y'all are gathered here
today to join these two...

495
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:51,962
hound dogs

496
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,436
in holy

497
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,958
matrimony!

498
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,342
Do you trust me know?

499
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,860
When you did this with the Santiago
brothers, did they wear white?

500
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,842
