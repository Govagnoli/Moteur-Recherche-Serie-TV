2
00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:04,396
U-Turn, why the fuck ain't I got this new weed ?

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,614
the strain is called MILF Weed

4
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:08,275
It's the brand out on the date.

5
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,293
I totally kick ass !

6
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:11,888
What does kicking ass entail ?

7
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:13,908
A girlfriend ! But that's not all !

8
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:16,247
I'm gonna be the class speaker for graduation.

9
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:17,436
He doesn't know what I do.

10
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,053
Keep clinging to that raft.

11
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:20,753
You are new to the neighbourhood.

12
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,506
This is to say goodbye.

13
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:26,720
<i>Dozens were arrested, including drug king pin, Aaron Kashishian. </i>

14
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,265
Our very first camera !

15
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:30,659
This is better than porn !

16
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,473
Some fucking low-life has stolen two of them already.

17
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:37,225
And the drug free zone signs,
and the Sasquatch costume.

18
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,559
DRUGS ARE WROOOOOOONG !!!

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,529
I'm Kat, is Andy here ?

20
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,656
How did you find me ?

21
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:44,225
You must be Shane, hi, heart, hug.

22
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,302
You're the crazy chick from Alaska who tried to kill my uncle ?

23
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:52,096
Abumchuk is very upset with you,
he read my memoir and he wants to kill you Andy.

24
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,988
Peter and I are technically married,

25
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,553
It's a business arrangement, pure and simple.

26
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:57,795
Silas.

27
00:00:57,835 --> 00:00:58,540
Go away.

28
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:01,337
Come on, you can't stay locked in there for ever.

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,594
You go to him, you tell him you love him.

30
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,931
You tell him you out after the office,
you get your money back.

31
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:11,020
Heylia James gets wiped off his board,
I take the equipment and disappear.

32
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:13,771
Did you tell Heylia yourself or
did you have your boy Conrad do it ?

33
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,113
I gave you the Armenians !

34
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,833
I gave you the Armenians !

35
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,440
This is just not fucking working.
This isn't working.

36
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:23,324
Agent Wonderbread is not my husband.

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,593
I do not love him.

38
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:26,947
I'm never gonna love him.

"little boxes"
performed by Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice

41
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,901
You should be careful

42
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,184
The human body is very flexible.

43
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:36,057
Yeah but your small intestines can get tangled
and eventually explode and ...

44
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,278
Shane ! Leave Kat alone.

45
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:39,284
Kat, please leave my house.

46
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,535
Are you trying to act in lesbian vampires ?

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,386
What ?

48
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,166
Pussycat havin' her nose bleed

49
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,764
They ... shark week... and rubian diamond.

50
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,140
Are you asking if I'm having my period ?

51
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,514
We're cycling together isn't that cool ?

52
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,091
Weew ! Andy !

53
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,816
Why is your lunatic girlfriend still in my house ?

54
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,378
Oh don't worry if no one claims her
in the next few days I'll have her put down.

55
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:03,029
Silas where were you ?

56
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:06,021
Give me your car keys.
Give me ! Your car keys !

57
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:11,300
I think not wanting to hear your mom have sex with a narc
is a good enough reason to stay out all night.

58
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,156
Nothing happened.
Mom kicked him out after 15 minutes.

59
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:14,904
Shane !

60
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:16,921
talk about the fastest gun in the West.

61
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:17,500
Silas !

62
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:18,674
Shark week.

63
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:19,820
Shane !

64
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:22,866
Peter !

65
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,073
... you've brought many... oranges !

66
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,686
I felt bad for the orange guy.
it's hard day, not a lot of traffic.

67
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,697
Plus I felt bad about last night.

68
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,408
It was kind of ... awkward !

69
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:36,939
It was !

70
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:39,299
This is our ...

71
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,286
adjustment period... of time.

72
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,201
So you're okay with where we are ?

73
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:46,358
As a couple.

74
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,401
Of course !

75
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,979
Feeling good ?

76
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,255
Feeling great !

77
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:52,713
Great !

78
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:53,796
That's great !

79
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,131
Yeah !

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,914
So how long before you retire
and I get you all to myself ?

81
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,376
Soon !

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,174
I can't wait.

83
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,134
You and me.

84
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:06,929
You and me.

85
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,229
You want some orange juice ?

86
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,663
Fresh squizzed ?

87
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:20,081
No.

88
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,310
Bye.

89
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:31,182
Thank you.

90
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,953
We can't keep doing this.

91
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,260
You're right.

92
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,015
Let's mix it up a little.

93
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,429
You get on top of me.

94
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,260
But don't face me this time.

95
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:59,906
No I mean we can't keep fucking in motel rooms.

96
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:03,522
I gotta be honest with you, I'm not
that comfortable having sex in public places.

97
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,162
I'm too tall.

98
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:11,238
Why are we still sneaking around
behind the backs of people we don't even love anymore.

99
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:12,477
That's how cheating works.

100
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,474
Hey let's play some more surveillance videos.

101
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:16,585
No we can't.

102
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,476
Drug free zone band had finally stolen my last fucking camera.

103
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,294
Is that what we sound like ?

104
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:30,639
Listen to that !

105
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:34,022
That is so fucking hot !

106
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,076
Would you leave Dean ?

107
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,875
What ?

108
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,733
Would you leave Dean ?

109
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:45,531
Would you leave Dana ?

110
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,542
If I left Dana would you leave Dean ?

111
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,119
If I left Dean would you leave Dana ?

112
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:50,716
Dana doesn't like sex.

113
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,010
She's a fool to reject you.

114
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,847
You are an awesome lay.

115
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:04,818
So let's do it.

116
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,169
I'm sick of living in a fuckless marriage.

117
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,063
And with what you have between your legs,

118
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:15,646
it's a waste !

119
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:21,685
It's like having this great big boat and no lake to sail in it.

120
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:25,141
Be my lake.

121
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,703
Chill the fuck out, there's a lot of people in front of you.

122
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:35,380
Oh yeah if you're talking that kind of money
I suppose we can move you on.

123
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,393
Right on man

124
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,266
9 o'clock this morning our stash was valued about 300 Gs.

125
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:47,112
But the market's just making the bull one offer,
we just hold off for say

126
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:49,402
another week ?

127
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,942
we should have half a million easy.

128
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,936
Do you think that you can ... agent Wonderbread alone for one more week ?

129
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,975
.... Ruby's in town.

130
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:00,735
Who ?

131
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,543
Never mind, I ... alone.

132
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:03,898
It'll be over.

133
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:06,661
He brought me oranges this morning.

134
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:11,492
Half a million, huh ?

135
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,482
A fucking shame.

136
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,431
What viagra was for fathers,

137
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,150
MILF weed could have been for us.

138
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,128
Yeah, fucking shame.

139
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,016
I'll use my cuts to start my own grow house.

140
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,211
I did it once,

141
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:25,557
I'll do it again.

142
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,248
Better.

143
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey gang !

144
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,444
I'm glad you're both here.

145
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:35,269
I'm starting my own hedge fund and I'm looking for investors.

146
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:36,675
You should come look at this.

147
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:42,968
Did you know that there are amazing opportunities
to be add in the exploitation of emerging third world countries ?

148
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:49,163
With 370 billionaires in this country
and 40 millions of people living beneath the poverty line.

149
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:52,434
Wake up 7 eleven, this is the fucking third world.

150
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,190
How do you know that stuff ?

151
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,470
The daily show.

152
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,255
Oh my god !

153
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:03,456
- On the fucking ground.
- Fuck you, motherf...

154
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:05,492
What the hell are you doing ?

155
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:08,436
No more games, no more bullshit.

156
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,945
I want the marriage certificate.

157
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:11,405
What ?

158
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:16,850
I want the certificate or your boyfriend here
is going to be just another dead nigger drug dealer.

159
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,281
It's too late, I sent it to the XXX record.

160
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:24,977
My wife ?

161
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:29,272
My wife !

162
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:31,639
Why are you doing this ?

163
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,644
Because I'm agent Wonderbread.

164
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:44,354
Alright fuck it.

165
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,381
Fuck the marriage certificate,
here is how we gonna play it.

166
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:49,173
Now.

167
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:54,444
Take your last harvest, get a single buyer,
make a quick deal and then hand all the cash over to me.

168
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,346
Every goddamn last penny.

169
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,914
And then I want you to make every effort to ensure,

170
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:02,695
that I'll never see you again.

171
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,742
All of it ?

172
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,720
If you prefer prison,

173
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:14,920
to giving up you payday I will take you down.

174
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:18,365
And if I got to, serves me right.

175
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,363
Because I let anything XXX for you.

176
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,546
And you fucked me !

177
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:30,768
See you soon.

178
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,458
Give me your fucking phone.

179
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,442
You hear me now motherfucker ? You hear me ?

180
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,901
Did you sleep in the guest room ?

181
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,369
No.

182
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,934
Where were you ?

183
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:14,575
Fucking Doug.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,066
What do you do now ?

185
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:16,941
Me.

186
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:19,928
Celia what the hell are you talking about ?

187
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,408
I'm leaving you.

188
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,365
The marriage is over, I want a divorce.

189
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:27,776
I'm having an affair.

190
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,324
With Doug.

191
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:38,139
It's official, you've lost your mind !

192
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:41,605
Where do you think that I've been, all these nights ?

193
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,021
Why do you think that I've been so... happy ?

194
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:50,625
Doug Wilson ?

195
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,463
I think it's best if you move out.

196
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,779
I hear the oakwood in Burbank is very nice.

197
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:56,284
Doug hates you !

198
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,485
Doug loves me, now.

199
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:02,566
Unbelievable.

200
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,848
Why? You are so the kind of guy that stuff happens to !

201
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,492
Who's gonna tell Isabelle ?

202
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,115
We'll tell her together.

203
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,961
<i> I wanna live with dad ! </i>

204
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:21,148
How do you spell "hypocrisy" ?

205
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:23,050
This is boring.

206
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:24,361
Shane,

207
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:26,064
I have to go out

208
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,330
somewhere for a couple of hours.

209
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,702
Lupita's in her room,

210
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,213
Andy is ... some place.

211
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:34,274
Are you okay ?

212
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,239
I'm fine.

213
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:37,610
You look anxious.

214
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm fine.

215
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,887
Hi Mrs. Botwin.

216
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,249
Oh hi Gretchen.

217
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,519
Shane's right, you look anxious.

218
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:45,449
I'm fine.

219
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:46,885
I'll be home soon.

220
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,293
Your mom's weird.

221
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:53,090
I know.

222
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:33,612
How do you spell " XXXmore " ?

223
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:34,726
Who cares ?

224
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,716
Let's get drunk !

225
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:38,776
Drunk ?

226
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,550
Hey guys !

227
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,524
Hi Kat !

228
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,546
Hi !

229
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,067
I'm Shane's girlfriend.

230
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,424
Oh lucky you !

231
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:52,077
It's our one week anniversary.

232
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,380
Oh my gosh I'm so happy for you guys,

233
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:59,306
The first week is so hard ! But if you
haven't slept with someone else by now,

234
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,530
it's a pretty good sign.

235
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,177
Hey buddy,

236
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,285
your mom gave me orders, we gotta go to the mall and pick you a graduation suit.

237
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:13,482
I'm coming.

238
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,007
I can take this to lot of places.

239
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:17,954
I come to you out of respect.

240
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,663
Respect my ass !

241
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,803
You came to me cause you're in trouble.

242
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,949
Yes, yes I am.

243
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:29,937
And despite the fact that you threatened

244
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:33,808
to kill me and orphan my children,

245
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,577
You're still the only person
I can make this offer to that I trust.

246
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:37,707
Hold on !

247
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,270
Come on ! Let's go ! Don't be late !

248
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:47,711
Don't look at me like that I know your momma now.

249
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:50,968
So what you got to say ?

250
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,003
Buy our harvest.

251
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:59,476
Bargain basement prices, walk away
with 6 months worth of the best shit in town.

252
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:01,076
Double, triple your investment.

253
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:03,580
And who am I supposed to sell it to ?

254
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,241
These kids here ?

255
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,409
I know your game is shut down.

256
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,317
Take it back east.

257
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:13,103
You're always talking about buying a place next to your sister's in Detroit.

258
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,052
Oh ! So now I'm supposed to traffic accross state-lines !

259
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,527
Ain't that genius ?

260
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:23,564
Take a business it took me 20 years to build
and just pick it up and move it some place else.

261
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:28,155
You tell me you get into the shake-down for Mr Federal Agent ?

262
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,508
Well good, welcome to the fucking party !

263
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,976
Conrad know you come to see me ?

264
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:37,792
No. Are you buying or not ?

265
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,220
You too like them big companies pumpin toxic shit in the air

266
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:46,821
and then actin' all surprise when ice-caps melt and hurricanes drown the world.

267
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,659
Fuck you, I drive a Prius.

268
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,354
Hey Vanita,

269
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:01,527
Conrad ended up to his bold fucking head.

270
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,460
Oh we goin' to jail.

271
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,712
She's just so awesome !

272
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:06,602
Uncle Andy ?

273
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,257
Do you love Kat ?

274
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:11,244
No ! No no !

275
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,135
Then why are you with her ?

276
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,858
She makes me crazy.

277
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,697
And she makes me crazy.

278
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,828
Will you stop hitting on my boyfriend ?

279
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:21,251
Hold him too tight and he'll turn into dust.

280
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:22,653
Bite me !

281
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,776
Alright, gloves off !

282
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:25,739
You wanna piss me ?

283
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,398
It's all fucked up, and it's never boring.

284
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,481
You know, look at this.

285
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,376
See that scar ?

286
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,722
She stabbed me with an icicle
when she thought I kicked one of her spirit animals.

287
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,602
What's a spirit animal ?

288
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,705
Who the fuck knows ? 10 stitches.

289
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,421
But she keeps me on my toes.

290
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:45,793
All 8 of them.

291
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:47,218
When I'm with her,

292
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:48,359
I'm alive.

293
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:50,123
It's him.

294
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,227
We better go at the back, it's him.

295
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:53,050
Who ?

296
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:53,989
Abumchuk.

297
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:55,333
The Eskimo ?

298
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:01,589
He's big.

299
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,427
Yeah, he wears a size 15 mukluk.

300
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,459
It's go-time.

301
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:05,748
Um, we're gonna take this one !

302
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,030
Who are you ?

303
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,133
I'm a business-woman.

304
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:19,946
What do you want ?

305
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,426
Something you want.

306
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:23,885
Pussy ?

307
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:27,595
Even better.

308
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,071
Yo U-Turn !

309
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:41,694
Which which one is he ?

310
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:46,600
See if you can guess.

311
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:49,435
Lose the shirt !

312
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:53,683
(Check ball)

313
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:01,644
What you want from me, man?

314
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,401
I'm looking to sell about 30 pounds of sexy mama.

315
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:05,530
That's a big move.

316
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:06,933
Interested ?

317
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:07,788
Rejected !

318
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:09,021
Alright.

319
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:11,222
Man, I'm talking about your weak ass-suck !

320
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:13,030
I'll take some.

321
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:14,091
Ball !

322
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,270
Let me ask you something !

323
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:19,388
Why all bitches gotta be so fucked up you crazy shit ?

324
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:25,486
Well, um.

325
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:28,478
I don't know, um... it's not easy.

326
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:32,536
Being a girl, you know we have a lot of... issues.

327
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,998
Fuck that bullshit !

328
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:35,881
Okay.

329
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:39,368
You know all enough and that's the deal
it's on the table, are you heavy enough to handle it ?

330
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,395
Do I look like I'm heavy enough ?

331
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,336
You know this bitch what the fuck light me on fire ?

332
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:51,527
What did you do ?

333
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:53,134
I ain't do nothing !

334
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,149
I fucked her sister.

335
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,841
She only tried to... to let you how hurt she was.

336
00:17:59,036 --> 00:17:59,985
Hey I got hurt too !

337
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,294
Skanky fuck her sister gave me crabs.

338
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,553
That must be uncomfortable.

339
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:06,729
It's like a motherfucker !

340
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:07,371
Lil' help !

341
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,887
So how much ?

342
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:15,231
Why so cheap ?

343
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:17,592
We like you.

344
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,304
Are you in ?

345
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:21,330
Yeah I'll take it.

346
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,870
Get the cash, I'll call you with an address.

347
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,318
The deal go down tomorrow afternoon.

348
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,419
What the fuck is that ?

349
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:31,401
Dap ?

350
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,074
It's what my son's taught me.

351
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:36,397
Say Dap again.

352
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:37,811
Dap

353
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,360
That fuckin' tinkles me.

354
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:41,328
Yeah me too, man !

355
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,554
Shut the fuck up, Marvin !

356
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,575
The motherfuckin' laid nigga.

357
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,654
It's a pleasure doin' business with you.

358
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,414
Hey !

359
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,967
Won't you take your shirt off ? Come ball with us.

360
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,560
It's tempting.

361
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:02,394
I wouldn't want Marvin's girlfriend to get the wrong idea though.

362
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:08,331
Damn, Conrad ain't tapping in that pussy that's one dumb nigger.

363
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,781
38 fucking pounds of MILF tomorrow afternoon.

364
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:15,608
Now where you (put) to get that kind of money by tomorrow ?

365
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,062
Nigga we got guns !

366
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,562
They ain't got no army fuck you XXXX

367
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,396
God !

368
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:24,235
I feel

369
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,608
so liberated !

370
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,015
Did Dean freak out ?

371
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,832
He was just

372
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,426
sad.

373
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:36,683
Poor schmuck.

374
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,139
How did Dana take it ?

375
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:42,958
She would have been devastated.

376
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:47,585
"Would have been" ?

377
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:50,672
I was going to.

378
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,639
Yes.

379
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:53,652
I remember the plan.

380
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,999
But I, I just, I couldn't.

381
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:58,867
But hey, wait you know, we can still see each other !

382
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,657
I mean the sex is fantastic.

383
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,658
And look at the bright side, one of us
doesn't have to go sneaking around anymore !

384
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,717
Lucky you !

385
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:08,215
You didn't do it ?

386
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,172
You're mad, aren't you ?

387
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:10,057
You didn't do it !

388
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,084
Oh you are mad !

389
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,513
Why the fuck didn't you do it ?

390
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:17,629
Because you're a fucking spineless motherfucker !

391
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:18,749
That's why !

392
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,882
Okay okay, you know Dean used to talk
about the terrible things you've say to him.

393
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:23,252
The horrible way you treat him.

394
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:26,377
Dana won't fuck me but she's a sweet heart,
it's nice to live with sweet.

395
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,417
You're not sweet.

396
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:29,849
I think this is a non-smoking room.

397
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,219
Actually I don't think it's smoking in any hotel room in the state of California.

398
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,809
Okay now that's exactly what I was talking about.

399
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:46,903
<i> Yeah </i>

400
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:47,832
It's me.

401
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,303
<i> Tomorrow, 3 o'clock, at the Grow House. </i>

402
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,847
Just you, and me, and your friend, right ?

403
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,635
You and me and the money.

404
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,461
Oh I want you to bring your friend along to.

405
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,301
Why ?

406
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:01,914
It just wouldn't be fun without him.

407
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,114
I'll see you tomorrow sweat heart.

408
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:12,323
You need to get out of here before tomorrow.

409
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,135
Oh fuck !

410
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,006
It's Shane's graduation, I can't do this !

411
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,294
You're gonna re-schedule with U-Turn ?

412
00:21:23,774 --> 00:21:24,563
Worst

413
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:25,721
Mother

414
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:27,572
Ever.

415
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:30,580
Go to your boy's graduation.

416
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:32,390
I will make this shit happen.

417
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,909
No, you need to get on a bus and go now.

418
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,611
You need to take that duffle bag and

419
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:38,413
I'm stayin' !

420
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,161
Think about re-locating yourself.

421
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,104
I'll see you tomorrow.

422
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,516
Oh stop being such a drama-queen !

423
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,708
You know you're not going anywhere.

424
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:34,859
What about yesterday ?

425
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,068
I didn't mean it.

426
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:37,982
So you didn't have an affair ?

427
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,695
No, I did. We did.

428
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,797
But it's over.

429
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,053
I'm over it.

430
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,341
Well maybe I'm not.

431
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:47,019
Oh stop, you're totally over-reacting.

432
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,409
You know that you're not going anywhere.

433
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,006
That's right, I'm not.

434
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:51,851
You are.

435
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:56,640
No, I'm not.

436
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:57,837
Yeah, you are.

437
00:22:57,972 --> 00:22:59,512
Your bags are packed.

438
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,162
You are no longer welcomed in my house.

439
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:03,151
I'm done.

440
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:04,196
Dean !

441
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,406
Done. Finished.

442
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:07,577
Good bye !

443
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,492
I'm not going anywhere !

444
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,668
Use your car key.

445
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:15,080
I suggest you hire a lawyer.

446
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,305
I've been thinking it might be a good idea to ...

447
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:20,881
live ...

448
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,401
somewhere else !

449
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:23,900
For a while.

450
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:24,843
You know,

451
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:27,623
get a fresh start.

452
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:28,570
Flee.

453
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,364
Relocate.

454
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,247
Okay ?

455
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:32,500
What does

456
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,584
everyone think about that ?

457
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:36,931
I'm up for it !

458
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,424
Andy get rid of her.

459
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:42,186
I'm a part of this family.

460
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,902
Just because you are crazy and we're crazy does not mean we're related.

461
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:49,438
I'm gonna grow on you, you'll see.

462
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:51,903
Wait in the van.

463
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,182
This isn't about Abumchuck ?

464
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,526
Actually no.

465
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:56,865
Who are we fleeing from, then ?

466
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,122
It's not Abumchuck.

467
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,390
About Abumchuck,

468
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:02,930
he's not really my boyfriend.

469
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:05,295
Please don't make me guess.

470
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,515
Don't worry he's ...

471
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,010
just this bounty hunter.

472
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,535
I did something illegal.

473
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,890
Can Kat come with us ?

474
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,111
No !

475
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:18,813
So why we gotta blow town ?

476
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,042
You're now not cool with what you're doing anymore ?

477
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:28,471
I'm just thinking we should explore
the notion of perhaps living somewhere else.

478
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:29,485
Costa Rica.

479
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,361
You are a drug dealer.

480
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,909
Yes Shane.

481
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:49,152
I grow and sell Marijuana.

482
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:52,683
It's organic.

483
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:54,876
It's therapeutic.

484
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,074
It's of the earth.

485
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:58,697
Like...

486
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,127
tomatoes !

487
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,995
Yeah, like tomatoes.

488
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:07,582
Fuck this.

489
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:13,468
You go in your room and lock the door one more time...

490
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:14,913
Not a good time to leave big guy.

491
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,625
Fucking XXX with him ?

492
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,792
Am I still gonna have my graduation party tomorrow ?

493
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:23,727
Yeah !

494
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:28,055
Might have to double as a going-away party.

495
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:33,640
What she gonna do ?

496
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,315
I'm as curious as you are.

497
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:42,622
Silas.

498
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:44,240
Unlock this door !

499
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:35,037
RRRRR DRUGS ARE WROOOOOOOOOONG !!!
