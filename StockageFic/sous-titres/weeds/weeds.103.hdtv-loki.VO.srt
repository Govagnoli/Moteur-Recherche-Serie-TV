1
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,603
Previously on Weeds...

2
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:09,167
She said your check didn't clear.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,495
You don't have any money in your checking account?

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,104
You no pay me last week.

5
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:13,808
I'm broke.

6
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,566
I've been working on setting up a front to launder money through.

7
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:19,231
Could my cover business eventually become my real business?

8
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:21,702
Good luck! Small business is fucked!

9
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:24,270
You want weed on credit, you gotta leave some collateral.

10
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:25,733
How about I hold on to that nice rock?

11
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:27,255
I need more inventory.

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,573
Leave your car instead.

13
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:29,514
My car?

14
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:30,743
I'm leasing it.

15
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,501
Then you're really gonna wanna get it back.

16
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:35,512
I'm so screwed.

17
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:30,842
This is Janet Yamamoto live from West Hills.

18
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,020
In the past few days,

19
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:34,870
wildlife officials have been swamped with hundred of phone calls

20
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:39,683
from Agrestic residents who have reported seeing a large tan mountain lion.

21
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:40,913
I haven't seen Chester...

22
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,050
that's my cat...

23
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,040
in two days.

24
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:47,890
I don't know though. Would a big cat eat a smaller cat?

25
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:49,943
I mean, isn't that cat cannibalism?

26
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,601
Department fish and game officials have been called in

27
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,311
but so far they've had no success in capturing the animal.

28
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:58,401
In the meantime, a dangerous predator runs free.

29
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:01,770
Agrestic... a community living in fear.

30
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,623
Back to you and the studio, Joany.

31
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:04,703
Thank you, Janet.

32
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:07,130
I'm going to the market. Any request for dinner?

33
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,171
Steak!

34
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,411
You've been sneaking food!

35
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,061
I haven't!

36
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,080
I swear!

37
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:18,212
Well, then congratulations...

38
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,481
you must be pregnant.

39
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:24,441
I have to go get dressed for school.

40
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:26,630
We can't cut into the art program.

41
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:29,112
Kids need drawing and shit, good for motor skills.

42
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,340
No! Hell, no! We're not cutting into football for it!

43
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,573
Screw the pansy art fags!

44
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:35,833
Let 'em paint banners for the football team. Kill two birds with...

45
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:39,361
Listen, I got somebody here, we'll finish this up in the next counsellor meeting.

46
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:41,252
Your turn to bring the vodka.

47
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,050
Okay, you too.

48
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:45,602
Yes, yes, I fucked your wife.

49
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:47,450
Yes, I fucked your mother.

50
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:48,852
Okay, bye.

51
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:50,823
Nancy!

52
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:54,761
I'm such a phaser. I totally forgot you were coming.

53
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:56,851
Don't smoke it all at once.

54
00:02:58,256 --> 00:02:59,720
What? What's wrong?

55
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm flush.

56
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,130
What do you mean you're flush?

57
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:04,933
I'm cool, I'm stocked, fat, no needy more weedy.

58
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:08,451
I only sold you a quarter last week you couldn't possibly have any left the way you smoke.

59
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,490
I burnt through that days ago.

60
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:11,861
Check this out.

61
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:14,863
What is this?

62
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,521
My medical marijuana card.

63
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,901
I got a note from a clinic doc for a hundred bucks,

64
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:21,272
went down to the pot store and, mamma,

65
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:25,782
I was houm!

66
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:29,380
It's a weed wonderland, Nancy.

67
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:30,991
It's like Amsterdam, only better

68
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,700
because you don't have to visit the Anne Franck house and pretend to be all sad and stuff.

69
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:36,782
See this lollipop?

70
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:37,531
It isn't...

71
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:41,050
Yes, I'm getting high right now. You can't even tell.

72
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,802
How is this possible?

73
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,793
The genius of prop 215:

74
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:46,932
medical marijuana for sick people.

75
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:50,250
And seriously, who couldn't use a little medicating, right?

76
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,532
My friend's friend's friend gave me the address of the clinic

77
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:54,672
and I went down there and I loaded up.

78
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:55,750
God!

79
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,501
I love California.

80
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,261
I can't wait to tell the poker guys about it.

81
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,672
The one buzz killer is you can only buy 8 ounces a visit.

82
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:04,652
That's half a pound!

83
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:06,363
Well, they allow you to make 2 visits a day but

84
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:09,792
you know, with all the traffic on the 110, it's practically impossible.

85
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,722
Are  you fucking with me?

86
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,572
No, no, it's all true. I don't kid about my weed.

87
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:17,412
I need the address.

88
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:18,631
Nanc', you're a pot dealer.

89
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:21,431
Why would you take advantage of a medical provider when you already have the connections?

90
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,090
This is greedy!

91
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:23,280
Douglas!

92
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:24,311
Okay, fine.

93
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:26,573
As long as you're braving the traffic,

94
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:29,143
Would you mind picking up a dozen more lollipops for me?

95
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:30,832
Wild cherry.

96
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:05,603
Hi there!

97
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,300
Welcome, I'm Craig X

98
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,973
and you are at the Bodhi Sativa caregivers club.

99
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:11,960
How can we care for you?

100
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:12,663
Hi.

101
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:13,591
I'm...

102
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:16,191
kind of new at this.

103
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:19,093
A virgin! Don't worry I'll be gentle on you. Come on this way.

104
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,462
The first thing you wanna do when you come to the club is check out the big board.

105
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,933
On the big board here, we have all the prices and strains

106
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,110
and they do change daily.

107
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,720
Hey,  Billy, how's the anxiety?

108
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:28,710
Alright, cool.

109
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:30,121
What was I saying?

110
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:31,632
The big board.

111
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:32,480
I got spaced.

112
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,610
And on this big board, we got two specials today.

113
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,470
This week, you wanna check out the Grand Daddy Perp. It's actually purple.

114
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:40,400
Indica sativa blend, the flavor is... belissima.

115
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:42,491
Second, we got the Here's Johnny.

116
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:43,453
The king of late night.

117
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:47,022
You don't wanna be messing with this before the sun goes down, it will knock you out.

118
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,342
In the other room, we got the clones...

119
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:50,810
Hey, how is it going? I see the arthritis is getting better, huh?

120
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:51,813
Yeah, you know it, man.

121
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:52,600
Oh cool.

122
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:53,911
Huh... what was I saying?

123
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:54,381
Clones.

124
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,361
Oh yeah, you hear that dial tone? My clones are off the hook, check this out.

125
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:01,442
We  have the most beautiful clones.

126
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:04,672
They're 10 dollars a piece and ours are guaranteed female.

127
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:06,093
Should get you started.

128
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,733
And over here we've got the food section.

129
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,912
Hey, Mrs. Rapapor, nice to see you.

130
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:12,591
You look beautiful, we got your sponge cake in back, okay?

131
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:13,600
Go ahead and get that.

132
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:14,512
Thanks.

133
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,721
She's got diabetes.

134
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,841
We make her spleen and steady sugar.

135
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:18,833
What was I saying?

136
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:19,502
Eatables.

137
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,533
Eatables! Okay, look at all this great stuff we have:

138
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:26,062
infusions, goo's, kifs, kif oils, hash oils, hemp oils,...

139
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:28,080
You look a little overwhelmed.

140
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:29,361
Where does all this come from?

141
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:32,831
A combination of our patients themselves and some very compassionate farmers

142
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,061
doing God's work.

143
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,193
And it's all legal?

144
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:39,815
Well, we operate under the guidelines of Health and Safety code 11362.5.

145
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,903
Douglas!

146
00:06:42,273 --> 00:06:43,714
I just couldn't stay away!

147
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,992
It's the beauty of this place: you don't have to, man.

148
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,020
Welcome back!

149
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:51,772
I love it here! So much!

150
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,432
He's suffering from depression.

151
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,070
Nanc'!

152
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,460
Hey, any more Steven Hawking? I wanna be wheeled out of here.

153
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,171
Oh yeah, I'll hook you up, come on, let's go.

154
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:02,832
What did I tell you, Nanc'?

155
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,430
You sold me shit!

156
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,320
I ain't here to sell you flowers!

157
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:07,603
Let me rephrase:

158
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:10,552
you sold me bullshit!

159
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:12,861
Skunk weed!

160
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:14,653
And I can't move it.

161
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,221
And I want a refund.

162
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,480
And I want an ass like Beyonce's.

163
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,571
And neither of us getting what we want.

164
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:26,951
I just went to this place, this store. It was like the whole foods of pot.

165
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,181
Listen to her.

166
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,892
By everything, she discovered the cannabis club.

167
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:32,503
Welcome to the party, baby!

168
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:35,601
It isn't a party, it's a nightmare. How can I compete with that?

169
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:38,213
Well when you figure it out, you let me know.

170
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:41,283
Fucking weed boutique sent my business off... how much business off again?

171
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,121
17%.

172
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:43,541
17%!

173
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:45,823
What's the world coming to when they legalize weed?

174
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,343
Ain't no goddamn morals left!

175
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,052
So don't come crying to me 'cause I've got my own troubles.

176
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,552
Anything else you want from me?

177
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:56,682
I want everything on this list.

178
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,542
Yeah, we got the Blue Miss and the White Widow but huh...

179
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:06,541
you're gonna have to wait on OG Kush.

180
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:08,492
That shit sold out quick.

181
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:11,952
Can't believe you've been selling me schoolyard crap this whole time.

182
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,340
Get what you ask for.

183
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:17,241
And you never knew enough to ask for the Cold Brain.

184
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:18,842
Well, those days are over.

185
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:23,562
We got ourselves a regular Pablo Escobar up in here.

186
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,491
What's wrong?

187
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,580
Serious shit calls for serious cash.

188
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,060
And your cash got a sense of humor.

189
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,112
But that's all I got.

190
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,903
Then that's all you get.

191
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,873
You can use that skunk to cook.

192
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:52,441
Then it is skunk.

193
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:40,872
Here, kitty, kitty!

194
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:11,660
So Julie googled "how to give a blowjob"

195
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:15,232
and she came across this website that teaches girls to deep throat.

196
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:18,031
Oh yeah, deaf Megan can do that.

197
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:24,880
Denis Kling says her mouth is like a dirt devil.

198
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:27,702
Daredevil?

199
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:29,943
He's blind, not deaf.

200
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,271
I don't think he sucks dick at all.

201
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:33,613
He's a superhero.

202
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,151
You're done.

203
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:43,183
Hey, Megan!

204
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,161
Can you hear me?

205
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:47,963
Megan!

206
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,451
Hey! Come on!

207
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:53,130
Hello?

208
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:55,210
Megan!

209
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:56,750
Megan!

210
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,692
It's funny!

211
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:03,793
Hey, hey, hey!

212
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,011
Come on!

213
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,292
The fuck are you doing?

214
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:36,692
Megan!

215
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,350
What kind of crazy bitch are you?

216
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,911
I don't think I've put enough in the popcorn balls.

217
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,281
You got enough TLC in them balls to keep Stevie Wonder in.

218
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,733
Thanks for talking me through this.

219
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:50,583
You know what?

220
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:54,063
Gives me real sense of accomplishment working with over-privileged white women.

221
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,351
You enter in a whole new level.

222
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,872
We're talking about bigger buyers,

223
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,622
that means bigger risks, right?

224
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:02,453
Hm-mmh.

225
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:05,373
Thing is, I like you.

226
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,930
And I really don't wanna see you end up dead, you know what I mean?

227
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:09,590
Dead?

228
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,250
Relax, I'm just fucking with you.

229
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,243
Adorable.

230
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:13,711
No, seriously, how you doing?

231
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,411
Well, the popcorn is taking forever but...

232
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:17,071
No, no, fuck the popcorn.

233
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,491
How you doing?

234
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,530
Me?

235
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:24,391
If this doesn't work out, I could end up being the oldest Gap employee in Southern California but...

236
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,302
You're a hustler you're gonna do just fine.

237
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,563
I wish I shared your confidence.

238
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:31,822
God! That smells amazing!

239
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:33,703
That means it's ready. Take it out!

240
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:34,360
Now?

241
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,152
Take it out right now!

242
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:36,961
If you don't take it out now, it's gonna burn, I'm serious.

243
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:37,901
Oh... Bye!

244
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:39,631
Yo?

245
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,481
Ow!

246
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,313
Shit!

247
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:56,201
Mom! I did it! I shot the mountain lion!

248
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:57,083
Great!

249
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:59,121
Go get ready for bed!

250
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:08,132
Fuck!

251
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:11,280
God!

252
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:12,881
Shit!

253
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:16,892
Now begin your cut-and-paste collage and remember no dirty words.

254
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,713
Mrs. Heimler!

255
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:31,601
Yes, Isabelle?

256
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:33,351
I have to go to the bathroom.

257
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:35,852
Well, when Billy comes back from the bathroom, you can go.

258
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:41,711
Mrs. Heimler!

259
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes.

260
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:45,583
I have to go to the bathroom now!

261
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:47,731
Well, you know the rules, Isabelle.

262
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,412
But please!

263
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,252
Very well. Go!

264
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,300
I tried!

265
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,853
It's cool. It's all cool.

266
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,582
Honey,  you couldn't help it.

267
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:51,752
These things happen.

268
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:55,453
Hopefully, not too often, but they happen.

269
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:01,750
One day, you are gonna look back on this and...

270
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:05,473
well, it will still be painfully embarrassing but...

271
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:07,931
it will make for a terrific story.

272
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:13,782
I had to throw my underpants into the woods.

273
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,513
They call me "shit girl" now.

274
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,862
And that's part of the story!

275
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:24,520
Good night, sweety.

276
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:26,821
Good night, dad.

277
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:33,290
I'm worried about Isabelle.

278
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:35,782
Maybe we should take her to the doctor tomorrow,

279
00:16:35,817 --> 00:16:37,821
make sure she doesn't have some kind of stomach flue.

280
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,560
Please, she's perfectly fine.

281
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,662
She shit herself in school. How is that perfectly fine?

282
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:46,163
She shit herself because she's a little piggy.

283
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:51,062
And the truth is I found a chocolate stash in her room the other day.

284
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:54,001
So I just switched it out with laxatives.

285
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,023
What? It was a good plan.

286
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,113
I mean, maybe next time she'll think twice about

287
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,821
scarfing down a entire bag of chocolates.

288
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:05,730
I mean, come on, I eat the same laxatives everyday in reasonable amounts

289
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,931
and I don't shit over myself.

290
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,021
I mean, look, I don't mean for this to happen,

291
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,500
I was just hoping for some nice, loose duties.

292
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:15,622
Clean the girl out a bit, you know.

293
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,012
Are  you out of your fucking mind?

294
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,843
What? Calm down.

295
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:22,261
This is absolutely child abuse.

296
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,123
You should be arrested. I should call child protective services

297
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:26,611
and have you arrested.

298
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:28,411
Don't be such a drama queen!

299
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:30,301
They called her shit girl!

300
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,091
Lot better that fat girl.

301
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,302
How could you even imagine doing such a thing?

302
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:35,353
You know, excuse me,

303
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,430
excuse me, for wanting my daughter to be thin

304
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:41,013
and attractive so that the world is her oyster.

305
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:43,153
I know that you think she's beautiful, Dean

306
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,602
but this is America,

307
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:48,083
it is cold and cruel out there for fat girls.

308
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:52,030
No, no, no, no.

309
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:56,032
I hope our children survive you.

310
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,101
That which doesn't kill us makes us stronger.

311
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,893
Isabelle! Breakfast!

312
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:19,410
Coming!

313
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:32,593
Feeling better, sweety?

314
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,123
I am now, daddy.

315
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,773
You really should lock your front door.

316
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:52,243
I do lock it but Lupita leaves it open

317
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,531
so she doesn't have to dig for her keys.

318
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:55,931
Drives me insane.

319
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:59,083
Their subtle revenge for having to clean our toilets.

320
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:01,402
I still say we've got the better end of that deal.

321
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:02,820
Here.

322
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,002
I'm posting these in the neighborhood.

323
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,180
Tell you, I have a good mind

324
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,872
to stay in a hotel until they catch that cougar.

325
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:13,160
A little part of me is hoping that it will mow Dean

326
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,832
and I wouldn't wanna miss that.

327
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,410
"What to do if you meet a mountain lion."

328
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:20,411
Give the mountain lion some room.

329
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,350
Don't make eye contact.

330
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,793
Talk to the lion softly.

331
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:27,381
Are you sure this isn't "what to do if you date a mountain lion?"

332
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,743
I have a lot to do, Celia, so...

333
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,733
Have you ever had sex with a woman?

334
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:34,463
Excuse  me.

335
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,080
I think I'd like to try it.

336
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:37,260
With who?

337
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:38,101
Anyone.

338
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:40,523
I don't care. I'm sick of men.

339
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:42,380
Maybe I missed my calling.

340
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,480
What if I was supposed to be a dyke?

341
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,743
Just made a wrong turn by mistake.

342
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,783
It would explain the hell of a lot.

343
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,340
Here's the thing.

344
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,681
I really wanna fuck around on Dean.

345
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,712
But the thought of having to put one more cock

346
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:59,351
into my mouth is just too depressing.

347
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:02,260
I'm not sure a vagina would be any kind of improvement for you.

348
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,512
Maybe you're right.

349
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:04,892
Truth is, pussy...

350
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:06,583
really skeeves me out.

351
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,953
That whole mirror investigation thing we did when we were young,

352
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,323
truly a rude awakening.

353
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:15,722
Speaking of pussy...

354
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:19,001
somebody killed the Holderman's cat

355
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,903
and it was not the mountain lion.

356
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,221
Alyson is losing her mind.

357
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:27,102
She thinks it's somebody trying to send her messages or something.

358
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,061
It's probably just the kids though.

359
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:33,171
How did the...

360
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:34,873
How did the cat die?

361
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,012
I'm not sure. Why?

362
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,280
I think I might know the kid who did it.

363
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:44,110
Friend of Silas'.

364
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:47,142
You know, I read somewhere that killing small animals

365
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:49,681
is the first sign of psychotic behavior.

366
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,391
You should really tell the parents

367
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,872
so they can rush that little sociopath into therapy

368
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:56,280
before he starts tooling around Agrestic in a white van

369
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,291
with blacked out windows.

370
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,561
I really have to get going. You have to go.

371
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,501
Have you ever had sex with a woman?

372
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,263
- None of your business.
- Come on, tell me!

373
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,052
Okay, I slept with a woman in college...

374
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,900
- How was it?
- It was boring.

375
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,132
Well, maybe you didn't do it right.

376
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:13,502
She said I was the best she'd ever had.

377
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:15,371
What are you doing friday night?

378
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,453
These will satisfy your munchies

379
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,971
and give you a long lasting, all body high at the same time.

380
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,020
Not to mention the fact,

381
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,293
you're saving your lungs.

382
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:30,280
There's no residual odour for your wife to smell.

383
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,751
So you're saying that everything in there is loaded with...

384
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:33,682
It sure is.

385
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,002
But it's not all I'm offering.

386
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,003
For all of you old school smokers in the room,

387
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:39,343
I've also brought

388
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,511
some wild and wonderful

389
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,262
Indica Sativa blends.

390
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,260
Organic or hydroponic.

391
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:48,503
Hairy, sticky, delicious!

392
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,311
To smoke.

393
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:50,833
Here.

394
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,652
Help yourselves to some samples.

395
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,522
So?

396
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,362
Fuck me!

397
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,072
That is awesome!

398
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:08,393
I think I could exist off nothing but this for the rest of my life.

399
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:09,532
I'm glad you like it.

400
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:12,542
So, here's my final pitch, guys:

401
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,001
the clubs are fun and all.

402
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:14,872
But with me,

403
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:17,891
you get great shit right here in town.

404
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:19,221
I know what you like,

405
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:21,053
make sure it's there when you want it.

406
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:23,020
you don't have to schlep into the city to get it.

407
00:22:23,127 --> 00:22:23,973
But most of all,

408
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,822
I don't Xerox your driver's license

409
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,293
and put your name in a state controlled databank.

410
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:29,792
What?

411
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:32,061
I'm in a databank?

412
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:33,083
You sure are.

413
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,441
So when your wives find out and divorce you,

414
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,583
they'll get custody of your children

415
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:40,060
'cause their over-priced attorneys will be able to prove

416
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,371
you're nothing but a bunch of irresponsible potheads that can't be trusted.

417
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,772
I'm in a databank?

418
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,943
Celia would have a field day with that.

419
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,512
I'm in a databank?

420
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,682
I'm up for counsellor re-election.

421
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,072
I cannot be linked to any pot clubs.

422
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,113
Any of you guys know any good hackers?

423
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:57,822
Maybe you should have thought of that sooner?

424
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:00,573
I'm ready to take your orders.

425
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:01,840
Fuck it!

426
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:03,073
I'll take it all!

427
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:21,560
MY MAID THINKS I FUCKED A SMURF.

428
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,521
Your bullet don't look right.

429
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,643
It's sage.

430
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,033
Don't smell like sage.

431
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:51,922
Obviously, menopause's affected your sense of smell.

432
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,782
I don't smell with my coochy.

433
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,060
No!

434
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,450
It's got raw eggs in it!

435
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,350
So?

436
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,280
Salmonella is on the rise so no.

437
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:09,122
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about.

438
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,552
Am I in trouble?

439
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,672
The mountain lion you shot.

440
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:18,583
Did it have a collar around its neck?

441
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:20,263
No.

442
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:24,801
Did it make kind of a miaowing sound?

443
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:28,493
It kind of yelped when I shot it but...

444
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:32,061
mountain lions don't miaow, mom, they kind of sound like...

445
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,510
Shane...

446
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:40,951
Did you shoot the Holdermans cat?

447
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:41,472
What?

448
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,483
No!

449
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,411
I shot the mountain lion. Right in the eye.

450
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,363
Why?

451
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:49,431
Because that's what dad would have done.

452
00:24:58,017 --> 00:24:58,981
Come here.

453
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:06,670
I'm very

454
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:08,612
fond of you.

455
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,722
I'm very fond of you too.

456
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,453
I want

457
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,271
the BB gun.

458
00:25:17,027 --> 00:25:18,561
But I need it for protection!

459
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:19,412
No.

460
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:23,252
I think I'm gonna take over that role for a while.

461
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:26,672
But if you play your cards right,

462
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:29,770
you might get it back by the time you graduate law school.

463
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:32,152
This sucks!

464
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,123
Yeah.

465
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:38,443
But imagine how the mountain lion feels.

466
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,921
Go watch Telemundo with Lupita.

467
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,163
The hell are you doing?

468
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,253
I'm a little backed up.

469
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:02,662
A lot backed up.

470
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,730
I haven't shit in 3 days.

471
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:07,473
I'm like...

472
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,691
a bloated African famine baby.

473
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:11,282
Wow!

474
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:14,013
Could it be Newton's third law of motion?

475
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:15,611
Or lack of motion in your case.

476
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:17,941
Illustrated right here in our bathroom.

477
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:22,563
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

478
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:25,110
What are you talking about?

479
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:26,582
Karma, baby.

480
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,990
Fuck you and your karma.

481
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:31,643
Fine, shit on my theory.

482
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:34,970
Oh but wait, you can't so I guess that makes me right, huh?

483
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:42,361
It takes care of last week's buy, this week's buy, my ring, my Rover.

484
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,540
You surprise the shit out of me, girl.

485
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:46,522
I thought for sure you was gonna end up broke.

486
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:47,991
Living in a trailer park.

487
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:51,443
Having to score sack for your kids, put food on the table.

488
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:53,683
So, I see somebody got their bling back.

489
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:55,623
Does that mean we're doing alright?

490
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,500
Car keys, please.

491
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:02,873
What? I said "please"!

492
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:04,350
Yes.

493
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,220
You are very polite, Snowflake.

494
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,070
But your scratch only covers last week's buy and the ring.

495
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:13,053
You're still short for all the shit you're gonna wanna take this week.

496
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:16,203
Looks like you've got yourself a business decision to make.

497
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:18,080
The strange...

498
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:19,822
or the Range?

499
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:24,882
I'll be back.

500
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,721
Don't let the dog eat your cute little ass on the way out!

501
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,063
Thanks for everything, Conrad.

502
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:38,341
That cornbread recipe you gave me really saved my cute little ass.

503
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:47,090
You gave away my cornbread recipe?

504
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,532
And she put weed in it?

505
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:53,023
Oh hell no! You don't put weed in my cornbread!

506
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:54,260
No, no, no, hold up now!

507
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:55,960
Get your ass here to take an ass-whooping.

508
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:57,582
You know ain't nobody scared of you.

509
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,342
You're a dumbass motherfucker if you ain't scared of me!

510
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:39,940
Bitch!

511
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:20,513
