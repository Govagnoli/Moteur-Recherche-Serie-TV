1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:01,908
Previously on Ugly Betty...

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,233
Killer poncho.

3
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:04,611
Thanks!

4
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:06,794
- I'm Betty Suarez.
- Hi, Betty.

5
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:08,548
I'm your new assistant.

6
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:11,227
I got the job because Bradford
Meade didn't want his son

7
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,111
to be tempted to sleep
with his assistant.

8
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,882
Nepotistic son of a bitch
gives my job to his...

9
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,308
His son.

10
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,870
So the question is,
how do we get to Bradford?

11
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:22,615
We use Daniel.

12
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:23,899
Who is this?

13
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:26,731
He's a man of many,
many secrets, Daniel.

14
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:28,032
Dig a little deeper,

15
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:31,643
and you may find he's capable
of practically anything.

16
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:35,192
Excuse me, sir.

17
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:37,492
You know,
I think I was here before them.

18
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,310
This is a party for my boss.

19
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,660
Daniel Meade--
I'm his assistant.

20
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:49,741
No, I am, I am. Here, look,
I have--I have my xerox card.

21
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,693
It's here somewhere.
I know I have it.

22
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,993
They don't just give
these to anybody.

23
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,993
Oh, see, she knows me. Amanda!

24
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,873
- Right this way.
- Amanda!

25
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:01,090
Sweetheart, why don't you
come back on monday night?

26
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:03,270
That's when we let anybody in.

27
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:11,213
Oh! Here, look, I found it.
My--my xerox card.

28
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:15,163
I'm standing outside Vamp,
Manhattan's hot spot de jour,

29
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:18,911
and it's nothing but trendy and fendi
here for Daniel Meade's cover party,

30
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:23,090
as we celebrate his first issue
of "Mode" hitting the stands.

31
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,851
More than a few eyebrows
were raised on the catwalk

32
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,132
when Meade was chosen to
replace the late Fey Sommers

33
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:32,582
over seasoned creative
director Wilhelmina Slater.

34
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:36,411
Miss Slater, this way!
Wilhelmina, hi! You're gorgeous!

35
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,003
What'd I miss?

36
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:40,913
"The Times," "Page Six," "The News"--
they've been all over Daniel.

37
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:43,601
Heidi Klum is a no-show,
Isaac's in the back getting sloppy,

38
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:46,923
oh, and... wait till you see
Veronica Jensen's face-lift.

39
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:48,591
Lawsuit!

40
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:52,912
Look at them, falling all over
themselves trying to get a quote.

41
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,312
As if he actually knew
anything about fashion.

42
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:58,430
The man went to Vera Wang's spring line,
gave her a high-five.

43
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:01,723
# But I can't seem to #
# get you over here #

44
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:05,262
# To help take this off, #
# baby can't you see #

45
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:08,030
# How these clothes
are fitting on me? #

46
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:12,773
# Dance! #
# Dance dance revolution #

47
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:15,533
# Keep ya body movin' #

48
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,973
# Now first things first... #

49
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,452
Hi.

50
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,552
Walter, what are
you doing here?

51
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,251
Okay, my turn.

52
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,971
Betty, check it out.

53
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,291
Actually, I think, uh,

54
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,762
I'm the one that should be
asking the questions here.

55
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:41,850
Like, what were you doing out at
some club with your boss till...

56
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,940
9:45?

57
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,413
Well, it was a party
for his first issue.

58
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:48,513
And why am I explaining
this to you, Walter?

59
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,110
We're not even dating anymore.

60
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,651
Yeah, and whose fault is that?

61
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,353
Well, you're the one
who dumped me for Gina.

62
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,970
For just two days,

63
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,691
and it takes longer than
that to digest corn.

64
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:02,021
As beautiful an apology as that is,
Walter, I think we're over.

65
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,663
Come on.

66
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,692
Betty, look what I brought you.

67
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,932
This game's been on
back-order for two months.

68
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:10,173
Couldn't even use my discount.
Full price.

69
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:11,622
So I'm supposed to
forgive you because

70
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,303
you couldn't use your
employee discount?

71
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,073
Walter, go home.

72
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:19,733
I would,
but we're in the middle of a game here.

73
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:21,253
Yes!

74
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,943
Okay...

75
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,973
now  I'm gonna go home.

76
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,873
Full price!

77
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:50,412
July issue. Black lace push-up bra,
red mesh thong.

78
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,772
See, I never forget a face.

79
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,143
Careful, Daniel,
I think she's only 12.

80
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:57,113
Hi, dad.

81
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,683
I see that you've
been mingling.

82
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,052
Are you talking to anyone
who actually matters?

83
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,612
I've done 40
interviews already.

84
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:07,942
Look's like my first
issue's a home run, huh?

85
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,860
Yeah, you pulled it off.

86
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,951
Christy Benson from "New
York Minute" seems to think

87
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,081
I did a little more
than pull it off.

88
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:15,603
You're the editor
of "Mode," Daniel.

89
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,012
"Mode" sells "Mode."

90
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,702
Mr. Meade,
can we get a 2-shot with Daniel?

91
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:23,043
A couple more, sir?
This way. Thank you.

92
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,831
Well, if that wasn't
a cover shot--

93
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:32,941
media mogul Bradford Meade and his son,
the shining star.

94
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,541
The issue's a big hit, Daniel,

95
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,651
and your brother really
would've been proud.

96
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,180
Well, I'm not so
sure about that.

97
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,840
What did I do, anyway?

98
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:42,443
"Mode" sells
"Mode." Right, dad?

99
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:44,523
You remember the yacht?

100
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:46,543
Your dad throws this
party to introduce Alex

101
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:48,212
to the entire fashion community

102
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,641
as the new editor of "Hudson."

103
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,182
He walks in with a black
pinstripe Armani jacket,

104
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,993
white tuxedo front shirt

105
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:56,742
and polka-dot boxers.

106
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:00,751
That picture ended up in almost
every newspaper in the country.

107
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,242
Circulation went up 38%.

108
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,662
That is an editor.

109
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:05,741
Well, you should've
told me that, dad.

110
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:08,322
I would've gladly
dropped my pants for you.

111
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:12,300
Oh,  sorry.

112
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:15,220
Maybe it was insensitive of
me to mention him tonight?

113
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:19,040
This is Daniel's party,
but, uh, Alex is such a...

114
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:21,132
tough act to follow.

115
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:25,013
So was the club amazing?

116
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,263
They say people wait in line for,
like, three hours just to get inside.

117
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,571
Some even more.

118
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:31,061
You're home early.

119
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:32,451
I checked your homework.

120
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,791
Was there any famous
people there?

121
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,333
Did you bring me a matchbook?

122
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,612
Justin, I forgot.

123
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,562
Well, what about the bathroom doors? Do
they really fog over when you push a button?

124
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:41,713
Justin, I...
didn't have to use the bathroom.

125
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:44,303
Okay, Justin, 
go get ready for bed.

126
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:48,592
And by the way,
I read your boss' first issue.

127
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:53,772
A little bulky, but good balance of
style, accessories and puff pieces.

128
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,453
You didn't get in, did you?

129
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:02,123
I have to go e-mail Daniel
his itinerary for tomorrow.

130
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:03,653
Síentate.

131
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:06,251
Why do you do this
to yourself, hmm?

132
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,943
I keep telling you,
those places aren't for people like us.

133
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:12,712
Hilda, please, just... don't.

134
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,633
Okay.

135
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:21,190
Okay,  look, if this is so
important to you, let me help you.

136
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,730
- How?
- How?!

137
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:26,152
I am the top-selling Herbalux
sale associate in my district,

138
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,300
and all because I know
how to sell myself--

139
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:31,580
the hair, the face,
the clothes.

140
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:34,223
You gotta look it to be it.
That's the Herbalux way.

141
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:37,330
Thanks, but I don't think so.

142
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:41,231
Betty, mama...

143
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,290
you wanna fit in
with these people?

144
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,085
I got news for you--

145
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,759
they're not gonna change.

146
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,651
Mnh-mnh. You have to.

147
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,643
I'm gonna get chocolate sauce.

148
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,100
Hey.

149
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:36,833
Good morning to you, too.

150
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,482
You know what the doctor said.

151
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:40,303
You already threw
away my cigars.

152
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,041
- One lousy cup of coffee--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,120
Have you been going to medical
school on your lunch hour?

154
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:47,162
Dad, you have to take this more
seriously. This is your heart.

155
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,163
- Have you taken your pill?
- I only have a few left.

156
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,563
- I'm trying to make 'em last.
- Dad, take it.

157
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:52,740
We'll get a refill.

158
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,062
All right, I'm taking it,
I'm taking it.

159
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:58,220
You know, I actually think I'm making
some headway on this H.M.O. thing.

160
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:00,652
I finally got a real person
on the phone yesterday

161
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,461
instead of some
stupid recording.

162
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,751
I had to wash it
down with something.

163
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,713
You didn't stay
long last night.

164
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:26,230
No, sorry.

165
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,702
I had to wake up early for
the conference call to Milan,

166
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,402
and then go over
the kiera shoot proofs, and then

167
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:33,793
approve the models
for the Paris spread.

168
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:35,303
It's 9:15.

169
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:39,251
Well, someone's got to hold this
magazine together, Bradford.

170
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:41,991
I mean, Daniel is trying,

171
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:45,642
but, uh,
some people are just naturals.

172
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't worry.

173
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,170
I've got his back.

174
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:04,220
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

175
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:06,701
Well, don't you look... sweaty?

176
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:10,113
I've been in the archives.
Daniel wanted all these back issues.

177
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,330
Mm-hmm. Well, we missed you
at the party last night.

178
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:17,132
What happened,
sale at the 99 cents store?

179
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:20,401
No, I... I couldn't get in.

180
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,630
Are you serious?
Oh, you poor thing.

181
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,273
Those jerks at the door...

182
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:29,020
all they seem to care
about is appearance.

183
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:34,043
Look, it's all about appearance.
That's all Alex did to "Hudson."

184
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:37,462
He changed the font, the layout,
hired some trendy photographers,

185
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,832
and my father thinks
he's some kind of hero.

186
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,873
I can do these same
things to "Mode."

187
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,412
But, Daniel,
your first issue was a big success.

188
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:46,332
My nephew loved it.

189
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:48,331
It wasn't my issue,
and you know it.

190
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:51,121
I mean, Wilhelmina chose every designer,
every article.

191
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:54,660
I just signed my initials
to lots of memos. I...

192
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,231
That's gonna change.

193
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:01,712
Set up a staff
meeting for monday--

194
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,112
all department heads,

195
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,903
and work around my
father's schedule.

196
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,051
I want him there, too.

197
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,920
Two words-- fa boo.

198
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:13,291
It's for that breast
cancer thing at the plaza.

199
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,991
And who's the lucky "plus one"?

200
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:17,620
The senator's in town.

201
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:19,513
I thought breast
cancer was pink.

202
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:22,952
It is, but alzheimer's went
better with the outfit.

203
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:26,312
What? I'm supporting.
That's what counts.

204
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:27,700
Zip me.

205
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:29,340
What do you want, anyhow?

206
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:30,681
Conference room,

207
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,413
and it's good.

208
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,920
So here are all the models
that Alex worked with,

209
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,831
and  I found that font
style that he used.

210
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:41,131
Um, also, I brought all of
these photographers' books.

211
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,793
This one right here--this is
my favorite. He's amazing.

212
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:46,783
He's shot everyone from, like,
Madonna to the Dalai Lama.

213
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,803
Yeah, this is
Vincent Bianchi...

214
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,861
and he'll never work for us.

215
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,852
Well, why not?

216
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,242
When he worked with Alex,
they got in this huge blowup.

217
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,723
He thought Alex was a fraud.

218
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,943
Alex thought he was some
temperamental artiste.

219
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,193
He vowed never to work for
Meade Publications again.

220
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,843
But, Daniel, you're not Alex.

221
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:05,010
Look, if my brother the
wunderkind couldn't make it work,

222
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,443
I seriously doubt
I'd be able to...

223
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:11,941
Look, let's just, uh,
see who else is here, huh?

224
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,162
Tweedledee and Tweedledumpy have
been in there for two hours

225
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,693
going over back
issues of "Hudson."

226
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:23,071
Now... he's trying to actually
rip off his own dead brother.

227
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:26,862
Oh, my god, it couldn't be any
easier if I gave him the gun,

228
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:29,333
and he aimed it at his foot.

229
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:40,153
The police released Fey Sommers' car
to a scrape metal yard a week ago.

230
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,913
How come it's taking you so
long to find out where it is?

231
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,641
Location info is private,

232
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:48,670
and there's over 142 salvage
yards in the Tristate area alone.

233
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:51,291
Why don't you just go back to your
big building and make magazines,

234
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:52,681
and let me do what I do?

235
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:55,363
Well, you better do
what you do quickly.

236
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:58,260
The grease monkeys in these garages
can't spell their own names,

237
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,021
but it won't take much
for them to figure out

238
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:02,652
the steering was tampered with.

239
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:06,180
And I don't care how good
you think your work is.

240
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,481
What are we drinking to?

241
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:17,633
To a father who
realizes his child

242
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:19,721
will never compare
to the one he lost

243
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,840
and to a son who knows
he'll never measure up,

244
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:25,182
no matter how hard he tries.

245
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:28,973
It's practically shakespearean.

246
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:31,873
As long as there's this wedge
between the two of them,

247
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,053
their relationship is doomed.

248
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:37,532
Daniel's time at the magazine--
and ultimately, the company--

249
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,963
will be limited.

250
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:44,601
Well, perhaps it's time I drive
that wedge a little deeper.

251
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,471
What would Daniel think
if he were tipped off

252
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:51,481
as to what his dear old
father were capable of?

253
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,960
Hey, what if we shrink
the magazine down

254
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:06,613
so women can fit it in
their purses easier?

255
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:15,473
See, now Alex
would've made that.

256
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:18,472
He should be the one here doing this,
not me.

257
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,122
At least my father
would be happier.

258
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:22,100
If your father didn't think
you could do this job,

259
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,520
then why would he
give it to you?

260
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:30,053
Is this...
kung pao chicken or--or orange beef?

261
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:34,372
Well, after five hours, Daniel,
I-I don't really think it matters.

262
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,531
You know what next saturday is?

263
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:40,522
The Harvard/Yale game. Biggest
college football game of the year.

264
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,523
You want me to try
and get you tickets?

265
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:43,601
You know,
every year since we were kids,

266
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:47,090
my father would take Alex to that game.
It was their--their thing.

267
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,893
He never once invited me.

268
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:56,291
You know,
I actually thought after Alex died,

269
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,911
he was gonna ask
me to go, but...

270
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,411
It's okay. I'm used to it.

271
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,151
Every parent has
a favorite, right?

272
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,192
Well, you know, my dad doesn't.

273
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,821
Sure, he does.
I mean, they all do.

274
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:16,050
Sometimes it's, uh, something small,
but you can see it, you know?

275
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:21,061
They, uh, smile a little brighter
when one of you walks in the room...

276
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,783
laugh a little louder when
one of you tells a joke.

277
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,093
Good morning!

278
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,360
Justin, you are not
gonna make me late today!

279
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:42,902
What time did you
get in last night?

280
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,491
I don't even remember. 

281
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,742
Daniel's going through a bunch
of stuff with his father...

282
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,062
Justin!

283
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:54,132
What?

284
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:59,202
Hilda, do you ever think about

285
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,551
dad and us and,

286
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,832
you know, if he has a favorite?

287
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,371
Yeah, I think so.

288
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,551
- You.
- You.

289
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,880
Come  on, you're right up
there between Tito Puente

290
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:12,180
and his nose hair clippers.

291
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:14,912
I am gonna kill that kid.
Morning, papi.

292
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,921
You didn't get in
till 3:00 last night.

293
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:18,390
Why they keeping so late?

294
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,712
Well, my boss is trying to make
some changes at the magazine,

295
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,241
and I still have to go through
these photographers' books.

296
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,113
Well, they're
working you too hard.

297
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,762
You tell 'em you want a raise.

298
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,052
Okay, dad.

299
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,650
Vincent Bianchi?

300
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,551
Yeah, he's really amazing.

301
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,702
So he ended up making it
as a photographer, huh?

302
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,652
Damn, I always thought that
kid would end up in jail.

303
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,013
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:39,482
Vinnie Bianchi--
he grew up over on Grand.

305
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,710
His family owns
Astoria Lemon Ice.

306
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,451
He grew up four
blocks from here?!

307
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:46,782
Yeah, his old man's always going
on about his kid's pictures.

308
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,370
He's got a bunch of 'em hanging
up on the wall in there.

309
00:15:49,385 --> 00:15:51,471
Dad, I have to go.
Um, I love you.

310
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,323
I love you, too.

311
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:57,083
Put down the coffee!

312
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:06,230
Hello? Hey, someone!

313
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:10,061
Someone get that!

314
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,332
Anybody else work here?

315
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,601
Bianchi gallery.

316
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:21,442
Hi, um,
I'm not sure if you can help me,

317
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,620
but I'm trying to
reach Vincent Bianchi.

318
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:26,162
- You got him.
- Oh, um, okay.

319
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,592
Wow, I wasn't expecting this.

320
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:30,840
Um... I thought I was gonna
have to leave a message.

321
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:33,102
You wanna call back?
I could let the machine pick up.

322
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,231
No! No, no. Um, no.

323
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:39,201
Okay, um, Mr.
Bianchi, I am a really big fan of you.

324
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:43,180
That cover shoot you did for "Rolling
Stone"-- wow, that was amazing.

325
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:45,461
Oh, thank you.
You have excellent taste.

326
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:46,693
How can I help you?

327
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,143
Well, actually, I'm calling about your
availability for a magazine shoot.

328
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:53,353
Um, you gotta go through my
rep for that--Sheila Cordova.

329
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,332
She handles me for
print work, okay?

330
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,020
You know, you and I--we went
to the same high school.

331
00:16:58,035 --> 00:16:58,951
Huh?

332
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:02,143
Queensborough High, right?
Class of '93?

333
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:04,290
- Do I know you?
- No. No, no.

334
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:05,803
We didn't go at the same time.

335
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:09,291
Actually, my name is Betty
Suarez--class of 2002--

336
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:12,683
but it turns out that you and me--we
grew up, like, four blocks from each other.

337
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,251
I live off of Roosevelt.

338
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,362
You're a Jackson
Heights girl, huh?

339
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:17,501
You don't say.

340
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:20,030
And I practically live
at Astoria Lemon Ice.

341
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,251
You know that doughnut
place two blocks down?

342
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,482
That's where I grew up.

343
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:27,270
I-I worked there every summer in
high school, and it burnt down.

344
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,262
Now it's a deli.
It's a pretty good one, but...

345
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,592
Not as good as Sal's,
though, huh?

346
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,321
On 87th? Oh, my gosh,

347
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:35,692
like, the best sausage and pepper
hero on the eastern seaboard.

348
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:38,043
Mmm, yeah, just the smell of
those things would get me high.

349
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:40,150
I haven't thought about
those in a long time.

350
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,693
So, Betty Suarez, okay,
you got me hungry...

351
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,860
and curious.

352
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,100
What is this job you wanted
to talk to me about?

353
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:49,370
Well, I work at
"Mode" magazine,

354
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:53,132
and my boss, Daniel Meade,
was wondering--

355
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:54,543
Hello?

356
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:58,253
The senator will be picking me up
here for the luncheon on monday.

357
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:02,133
Before then, I want my
commendations framed and hung--

358
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:04,381
avanti-classical gold
with a white matte.

359
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:05,291
White matte.

360
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:08,963
Put the clio and the women in
publishing on the credenza.

361
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:10,143
Call phillip.

362
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:13,463
Order two dozen cherry
black calla lilies

363
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:15,093
for the coffee table.

364
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,342
Those are his favorites.

365
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,361
Marc!

366
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:29,813
# ¿Por qué me dijiste #

367
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:32,283
# Que tú me amaba #

368
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:35,162
# ¿Por qué me
dejaste triste... #

369
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:39,872
# ¿Por qué me dijiste #

370
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:42,512
# Que tú me amaba? #

371
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:47,872
#¿Por qué me dejaste
triste y abandonada? #

372
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:04,071
- Bradford Meade.
- I found it--

373
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:06,001
Bayonne Salvage Yard.

374
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:07,133
Did you get rid of it?

375
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:09,082
That's not gonna be
as easy as I thought.

376
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:09,883
Why not?

377
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,012
Open your e-mail.

378
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,851
I sent you a little present.

379
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:19,342
"You can own fashion guru
Fey Sommers' death car."

380
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,023
A sick punk's selling it
to the highest bidder.

381
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,803
See, I'm trying to get
the magazine to attract

382
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:32,723
a hipper,
more fashion-conscious woman.

383
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,443
So they were out of poppy seed. 
I got you onion.

384
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:38,423
Okay, you're at the newsstand,
500 covers in front of you...

385
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,752
which one of these grabs you?

386
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,440
Bathing suit. It's fresher.

387
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,750
Definitely, and neon is in.

388
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,223
I really like the gown.
It's very Cinderella.

389
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:50,450
Yeah, listen, could you get
some cream cheese for that?

390
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,153
So...

391
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,072
I'm  trying to get this font.

392
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:57,183
I was trying to go for
something cool and sexy.

393
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,652
Daniel Meade.

394
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,523
Who's calling?

395
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,232
Betty?

396
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,841
Vincent Bianchi's
on line three...

397
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:12,962
for you.

398
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,592
Really?

399
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,782
Hello?

400
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, you did. I'm so glad.

401
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,492
Well, you know, I just--
I thought that

402
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:26,112
it was probably a while since
you've gotten down to Sal's, so...

403
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:28,201
Are you serious?

404
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:32,302
Oh, my god, that would be
so wonderful, Mr. Bianchi.

405
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:35,250
Okay, Vincent.

406
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:39,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, that was--that was
my boss who picked up. Hold on.

407
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:42,223
He said he loved the sausage and
pepper heroes that I sent him.

408
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:44,261
He thought I had cojones.
I'll explain later.

409
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,343
Just go pick up the phone.

410
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,441
Well...

411
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,803
I don't really
know what you did,

412
00:20:57,816 --> 00:21:00,802
or how sausage and
peppers helped, but...

413
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:04,431
thank you,
and we're having lunch on monday.

414
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,231
Well, would you like me
to set up a reservation?

415
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,813
Yeah, um, actually, see if you
can get us a table at Madison Six.

416
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,420
And, uh, make it for three.

417
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,483
He asked that you come along.

418
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:15,801
What?

419
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,401
Wait, wait, wait,
he asked for me?

420
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:20,312
Oh, and, uh,
maybe we could both...

421
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,840
dress up a little on monday?

422
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:30,421
I think he meant
natural fibers, sweetie.

423
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,423
Come on, Christina,
there's gotta be something.

424
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,322
A sweater or a jacket?

425
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:40,331
I can't walk in there
looking like me.

426
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,733
You look fine.

427
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:44,511
But you're not Vincent Bianchi.

428
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:47,121
He's expecting one of
these "28th floor girls."

429
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,502
And since when did you want
to look like one of them?

430
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:49,693
They're not even real!

431
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,602
Real women snort
when they laugh,

432
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:54,053
they've got fat asses,
wobbly upper arms

433
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,680
and get P.M.S.

434
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,782
I thought you wanted to
run a magazine someday,

435
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:00,693
not spend 12 hours a day wondering
about what your hair's doing.

436
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,651
Yeah, but this job is the only
chance I have of ever getting there.

437
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,532
I was in Daniel's
office earlier,

438
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:07,853
and he wanted the
opinion of a "Mode" girl.

439
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,941
He didn't look at me.

440
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,533
So you honestly think that
I have any future here

441
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:15,310
if I don't at least
try to change?

442
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:17,953
Never mind.

443
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,621
Betty, what are you doing?

444
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,341
What's going on?

445
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:39,160
I work in an office
full of glamazon women

446
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:42,211
who are all 6 feet tall
and perfectly waxed.

447
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,300
That's what's going on.

448
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,632
"Glamazon"?

449
00:22:47,648 --> 00:22:49,473
Never mind.

450
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,423
Hey, come here.

451
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:58,063
Since when does that kind
of stuff get to you?

452
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:00,313
Hey.

453
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:03,982
Amor, you are so beautiful.

454
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:06,772
Dad, stop.
Please don't even try that.

455
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:10,423
- And you have such a big heart--
- And stop it with the "big heart."

456
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:14,830
The speech didn't work when I was
cast as a rock in the school play,

457
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:18,023
or when I was sitting at home
with you and mom on prom night,

458
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:20,131
and it's not gonna
work now, so...

459
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,941
Betty, you'll always
be my special girl.

460
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:25,011
You know that.

461
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,721
Just so you know,

462
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:36,373
you were a really
terrific rock.

463
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,370
Dad, don't forget
to take your pill.

464
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,043
Okay.

465
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:47,873
See?

466
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,612
Shut up.

467
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:52,430
Just help me.

468
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,841
She has a 2:00 with Choli.

469
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:05,141
I have a 2:00 with Jean-Luc.

470
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,333
Mama!

471
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:10,911
Choli...

472
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:16,711
So what are we thinking today?

473
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:20,200
Something befitting
an editor in chief.

474
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,922
No... you get the job?

475
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:26,643
Soon. Very soon.

476
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:29,532
So do you think you could
really make me look like this?

477
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:33,342
Honey, you sit back and relax
and let Choli do her thing.

478
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,573
We gon' need the big tweezers.

479
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,830
Thank you.

480
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:13,543
Perfect.

481
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:15,671
Are you sure I look like this?

482
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:18,950
Baby, you look better.

483
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:29,973
# Ladies up in here tonight #

484
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,570
# No fightin' #

485
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:34,061
# We got the refugees in here #
# No fightin' #

486
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:37,762
# No fightin' #
# Shakira, Shakira #

487
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,933
# I never really knew that
she could dance like this #

488
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:42,270
# She make a man want
to sing spanish #

489
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:43,853
# ¿Cómo se llama? #
# Sí #

490
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,062
# Bonita #
# Sí #

491
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,590
# Mi casa, su casa #
# Shakira, Shakira... #

492
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:48,943
Betty?

493
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,470
Dude, how could you have
broken up with her?

494
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:53,662
She--she's hot.

495
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,001
Me?

496
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,740
Really?

497
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,682
Thank you!

498
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:04,123
# All the attraction,
the tension #

499
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:06,422
# Don't you see, baby,
this is perfection? #

500
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:09,730
# Hey, girl,
I can see your body moving #

501
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:11,481
# And it's driving me crazy #

502
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:14,611
# And I didn't have
the slightest idea... #

503
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:16,212
Penthouse, please.

504
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,832
Yes, sir.

505
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:30,922
Oh, Mr. Meade! Hi.

506
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:34,892
How are you?
I'm Betty, Daniel's assistant.

507
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:38,111
Oh, yeah, yeah. You look...

508
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:40,090
taller.

509
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:41,791
Thank you.

510
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:45,213
# Reading the
signs of my body #

511
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,703
# And I'm on tonight #

512
00:26:46,717 --> 00:26:48,300
# You know my hips don't lie #

513
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,360
# And I am starting
to feel you boy #

514
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,770
Excuse me. I'm going to have
to call you right back.

515
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:57,690
# Oh I know I am on tonight #
# My hips don't lie #

516
00:26:57,706 --> 00:27:01,760
# And I'm starting to feel it's right #
Betty? Oh, ho.

517
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:05,063
I think I just found
my new screen saver.

518
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:08,483
Daniel Meade's office.

519
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,293
Excuse me. Who's calling?

520
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:14,542
Um, just one second.

521
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:16,593
Yep?

522
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,993
Daniel, there's a woman on line
two who won't tell me her name,

523
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:21,163
but she says she wants to talk
to you about your father.

524
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:24,243
Oh, just get rid of her.
No. Uh, wait.

525
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,580
Daniel Meade here.

526
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:28,640
Hello, Daniel.

527
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:30,872
I just finished
your first issue.

528
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,311
You should be very pleased.

529
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:34,633
Who is this?

530
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:37,753
Oh, that's not
important right now.

531
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:41,900
The real question is,
how well do you know your father?

532
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:43,193
Excuse me?

533
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,202
Do yourself a favor.

534
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:49,553
Ask him what he's been up to
at the Bayonne Salvage Yard.

535
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:57,131
What the hell is
that supp--whoa.

536
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,613
Look at you.

537
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:03,590
Yep. You told me to dress
up for our lunch today.

538
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:06,950
Yeah, and dress
up you did. Yeah.

539
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,500
Um, you know what? I was thinking
maybe we should call Madison Six,

540
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:11,843
see if they have a
table in the back,

541
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:14,970
just so we can have a little
privacy with Bianchi.

542
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,200
- Okay.
- Great.

543
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,733
Have you seen her yet?

544
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:35,493
Yes, I did,
and it looks as if Queens threw up.

545
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,890
He should be quite impressed.

546
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:45,892
Ooh! Someone got
their hair did.

547
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:50,760
So I'm pitching we go
for an entire redesign.

548
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:53,373
Splashier colors,
bolder looks...

549
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:55,441
overhaul the entire layout.

550
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,282
It can be a whole new "Mode."

551
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:59,412
Stop using, you know,
the same old models.

552
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:02,381
Get cutting-edge photographers,
more interesting writers.

553
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:07,431
I mean, do we really need another
editorial on eating disorders?

554
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:14,541
Now... I happen, uh,
to be having lunch today

555
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:17,563
- with Vincent Bianchi to discuss--
- Vincent Bianchi?

556
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:19,811
You expect him to do
a spread for "Mode"?

557
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,623
You know his history
with the company.

558
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,330
Your brother couldn't
work with him.

559
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,603
Why do you even try?

560
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,142
Because he's one of the best,

561
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:32,770
and I think I can persuade
him to consider it.

562
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,781
Daniel, I for one,
think it's wonderful

563
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:38,140
you've taken such
initiative at the magazine,

564
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:40,493
but some of these changes
you're suggesting...

565
00:29:40,507 --> 00:29:42,720
uh, let me put it this way.

566
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:45,852
Uh, sometimes change
is a positive thing,

567
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,572
and then sometimes, well,
they can spin out of control.

568
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,381
You start with a
simple redesign,

569
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:53,532
and all of a sudden,
before you know it,

570
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:58,572
you're talking about bold new
colors and a daring new look,

571
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:02,312
and the truth is,
you haven't really improved on a thing.

572
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:05,001
- Wilhelmina--
- I'm just saying,

573
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:07,232
change isn't always
for the better.

574
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:11,881
In some cases, it can make
a bad situation even worse.

575
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:35,181
This is the ladies room.

576
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:37,640
I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

577
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:39,611
It's just another
day at "Mode."

578
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:42,293
You can't listen to a
thing Wilhelmina says.

579
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:46,283
- She's a jerk.
- No, Daniel. I'm the jerk.

580
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,441
Thinking that fake
nails and a new hairdo

581
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:52,622
could actually make a
difference on someone like me.

582
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:54,512
Okay.

583
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,390
Yeah, look... um...

584
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:02,291
I-I don't know what I'm
supposed to tell you.

585
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:05,321
This is the way
this place works.

586
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:07,493
It is a fashion magazine.

587
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:09,173
Appearance--

588
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,152
it means something here.

589
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:12,933
I know.

590
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:18,860
Listen, I know you're going to feel
a whole lot better after our lunch.

591
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:21,251
You can order
anything you want.

592
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:22,921
No, I'm not going.

593
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:25,632
What? No, no. You have to go.

594
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:27,130
Betty, Bianchi
wants to meet you.

595
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,382
You're the whole reason this
lunch is even happening.

596
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:31,591
Daniel, he doesn't
even know who I am.

597
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,152
Just take Amanda.

598
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:36,213
It's like you said--appearance
means something.

599
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,360
She'll fit right
in at Madison Six.

600
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,561
Betty, come on.

601
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:42,503
Daniel, just go.
You're gonna be late.

602
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,292
And don't forget the proposal.

603
00:32:03,996 --> 00:32:07,523
About time.
How long does it take to put on makeup?

604
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,302
Well, I also had
to fix my hair.

605
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,573
Thought you were Amanda.

606
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:15,713
I didn't know you'd
be joining us.

607
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,143
Afraid I might botch things up
with Bianchi if I were on my own?

608
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:24,233
Let's just say that I had a sudden
craving for the quail at Madison Six.

609
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:29,822
Okay.

610
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:32,232
Betty Suarez is here.

611
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:34,002
Shall we?

612
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:51,912
He called.

613
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:54,342
He's running late
to pick you up.

614
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:58,213
Well, a senator's life can
never be called his own.

615
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:02,510
Be sure to meet him
downstairs to escort him up.

616
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:10,441
Vincent. Daniel Meade.
Sorry we're late.

617
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,821
Ah, no problem.

618
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:15,411
Just killing time, trying to figure
out what these five forks are for.

619
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,730
Bradford Meade.

620
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:18,483
I remember you, yeah.

621
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,300
And this is Betty Suarez.

622
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:23,282
Ho-la.

623
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,250
The quail here is excellent.

624
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:50,603
Quail! Could you hear 'em
in the old neighborhood,

625
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:53,492
if they saw us in
a place like this?

626
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:57,141
Oh... carbs. No.

627
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:05,530
But, uh, who cares about carbs
when you're from Queens, right?

628
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,971
Excuse me. I'm going to need a
very large glass of wine, please.

629
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:15,691
Is this color peach or salmon?

630
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:18,051
Marc! Marc, will you cover
my phones for me, please?

631
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,652
- Daniel forgot the proposal--
- Oh, I'll bring it to the restaurant.

632
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:22,132
No, I'll take it to him.
It's my job.

633
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:25,111
Oh, come on. They won't even let
you past the host at Madison Six.

634
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,313
Ah-ah. Just let me. I got it.

635
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:29,460
Marc, give it to me!

636
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,243
I can't hit your boss,
but I can hit you.

637
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:34,552
And everybody knows I'm from Queens,
so I will do it!

638
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:37,323
Thank you.

639
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,993
So none of the girls
looked like you

640
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:47,560
when I went to
Queensborough High.

641
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,692
Hey, does Mrs.
Rodriguez still teach there?

642
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:54,642
I'm gonna say...

643
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,360
she died.

644
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:14,703
So you're still just
a creative director?

645
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:17,660
Yes, daddy.

646
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:20,291
Shall we?

647
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:29,733
So, uh, we feel
this holiday issue is our chance

648
00:35:29,748 --> 00:35:33,012
to try something really out
there for our feature spread.

649
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:36,353
4-page pullout. You would have
total carte blanche, of course.

650
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,822
So what does your
old man do, anyway?

651
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,133
Investment banker.

652
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:44,292
Your father's an investment
banker... Betty?

653
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:48,693
Oh. I mean, yeah.
That was always his dream.

654
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:52,751
You know, if he ever
made it out of the Bare-Rio.

655
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:54,152
What?

656
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,702
- Okay, that it's it. It's over.
- Daniel...

657
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:58,912
Look, I can't keep
doing this, dad.

658
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:00,691
I'm sorry, Mr. Bianchi.

659
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:01,842
Are you ready to
hear the specials?

660
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:03,263
Actually, could you hold
off on the specials?

661
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:06,762
I'm about to blow a very,
uh, big deal here.

662
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:08,770
Mr. Bianchi...

663
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:11,492
this is not Betty Suarez.

664
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,462
Hmm?

665
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,273
No kidding.

666
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:20,142
Come on. Give me some credit.

667
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:23,760
This girl's never been within 10 feet of
a sausage and pepper hero in her life.

668
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,521
He is so right.

669
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,512
So where's the girl I
talked to on the phone?

670
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:28,841
She didn't want to come,

671
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:30,442
and it's my fault.

672
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,683
And she was looking forward
to meeting you very much.

673
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:36,422
But because we're all caught
up with some stupid image,

674
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:39,300
I made her feel insecure about
fitting into a place like this.

675
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:42,230
He's my boss. I just need to--I
need to take him the envelope.

676
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:44,091
He's right there.
It's just 10 feet in.

677
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:47,161
I can't imagine why you
thought she wouldn't fit in.

678
00:36:47,847 --> 00:36:49,611
Look, here he comes.
He'll tell you.

679
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:52,101
I'm so sorry, Mr. Meade.
She says that she's with you.

680
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:53,281
She is.

681
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,481
Look, sir. You just--you
forgot the layout proposal.

682
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,512
There's someone I want you to meet.
Come here.

683
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:04,042
Now this must be Betty Suarez.

684
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:06,541
Mr. Bianchi. Hi.

685
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:08,262
It's really an honor.

686
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:09,731
Really.

687
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:11,753
Look, Mr. Bianchi,

688
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:15,091
between your fight with my brother and
what we just tried to pull off here,

689
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,310
I'm sure there isn't a reason in
hell you'd want to work with us,

690
00:37:17,346 --> 00:37:20,063
but I gotta say, I--

691
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:22,751
I think it'd be a great
opportunity for both of us.

692
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:25,091
You would have free rein
to call your own shots.

693
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,223
I give you my word.

694
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:29,111
Actually, I give
you Betty's word.

695
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,240
She's the only one who's been
straight with you so far.

696
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:39,311
You know,
you're nothing like your brother.

697
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:42,490
No. I'm not.

698
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:46,083
I'm not Alex.

699
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:49,552
I'll leave you
with the proposal.

700
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,533
Mr. Bianchi.

701
00:37:54,178 --> 00:37:56,132
Here you go.

702
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:57,943
Thanks.

703
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:07,852
Excuse me.
Could I get a matchbook, please?

704
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:10,360
My nephew is never
gonna believe this.

705
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:12,043
Awesome. Thanks.

706
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:19,760
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

707
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:22,883
I should have insisted you
come to lunch with me today.

708
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:25,773
Well, Daniel,
I'm sorry that I backed down.

709
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:29,242
I mean, I should not have let
Wilhelmina get to me like that.

710
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:32,121
Look, fake nails or not,
you came through for us, Betty.

711
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:34,223
Bianchi was only
there because of you.

712
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:37,451
I guess you really do
have cojones, huh?

713
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:41,120
So I'm going to go.

714
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,813
- He's doing it.
- We got him?

715
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,101
We got him.

716
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,183
His one stipulation is that
he answers only to you

717
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,502
and to no other "blowhards."

718
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:57,333
Okay.

719
00:38:59,055 --> 00:39:03,881
Betty, uh, please send
an e-mail to all creative.

720
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:08,432
"Vincent Bianchi will be shooting
our december feature spread."

721
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,731
Shut up!

722
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:13,020
Right away, sir.

723
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,672
Congratulations.

724
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,531
Thank you.

725
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:25,703
Dad, I got a weird
call from some woman.

726
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:29,561
She said to ask you about
Bayonne scrape yard.

727
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,933
Mean anything?

728
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:33,972
I haven't the foggiest.

729
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,882
Must be some kind of crank.

730
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:40,451
I've never even
been to Bayonne.

731
00:39:56,517 --> 00:40:00,550
Vincent Bianchi will
be shooting december?

732
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,462
He got him?

733
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:04,043
Damn!

734
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,080
Hey, look who's home
in time for dinner.

735
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,981
What happened to your makeup

736
00:40:34,995 --> 00:40:36,740
and your nails?

737
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:38,231
It was kind a long day.

738
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,491
They didn't fire you, did they?

739
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:40,692
'Cause I'll go down there.

740
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,282
No, dad, they didn't fire me.

741
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:46,462
In fact, because of me,

742
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:49,972
we landed Vincent Bianchi
for a big magazine shoot.

743
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:51,542
That's a big deal?

744
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:52,960
I could've gotten you that kid.

745
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:55,511
Yes, dad,
it's kind of a big deal.

746
00:40:55,527 --> 00:40:58,810
It's a really big deal.

747
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:01,300
Well, in that case...

748
00:41:02,598 --> 00:41:04,220
I'm very proud of you.

749
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:06,003
Thank you.

750
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,410
And you know what?

751
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:13,223
If it wasn't for
Hilda's makeover,

752
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:15,343
none of it would
have even happened.

753
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:17,250
Hey, how about that?

754
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,313
Ah, my two girls.

755
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,940
Betty, it's all set up.

756
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:24,753
Where you going?
We're about to eat.

757
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:27,562
Hilda, this is one club
they can't keep me out of.

758
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:29,683
# Dance revolution #

759
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:32,700
# Keep ya body movin' #

# Now first things first #

# Ain't no time to rehearse #

762
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:41,652
# Put your back foot forward #
# Now switch your tail in reverse #

763
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,062
# Slide to the side #
# But you gots to do it right #
