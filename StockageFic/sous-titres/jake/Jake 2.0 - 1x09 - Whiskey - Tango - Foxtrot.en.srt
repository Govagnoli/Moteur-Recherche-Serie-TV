1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,350
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,330
until a freak accident
transformed him

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,550
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,760
Millions of microscopic computers

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,580
interface with his biochemistry

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,740
and make him stronger and faster,

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,470
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,920
They give him the power to control

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,810
technology with his brain.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,900
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,180
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,470
He is the ultimate

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,340
human upgrade.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,030
Just, um... get me
the undersecretary,

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,640
okay?

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,360
You do that, and nobody
else gets hurt.

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,190
That's not going to happen

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,150
until you start giving
me some hostages.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,220
No, don't play diplomat with me.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,370
I've been working in this
office for over ten years,

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,660
and I am tired of being lied to

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,560
by the government.

23
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,550
There's another door to that office.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,450
Looks like it was patched over.
If I can get into the office

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,950
- next to it, I can take him out.
- You're not going to take anyone out.

26
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,580
The snipers will be in
place in three minutes.

27
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,400
We could all be dead
in three minutes.

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm warning you -

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm not feeling very patient today.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,580
Get me the undersecretary,

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,500
or somebody's going to lose a life.

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,410
- Kyle!
- No!

33
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,330
Sal, that's not gonna happen

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,450
until you start showing
some good faith.

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,450
Okay, you give me what I need...

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,990
I'll give you what you need.

37
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,520
Month after month
I bled for this lying,

38
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,720
double-dealing government.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,770
He did it.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,480
You're welcome.

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,440
Did I or did I not give
you a specific order?

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,490
- Yeah, but...
- You think you're something special

43
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,210
- because you've got powers?
- No...

44
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,150
Well, I've got news
for you - you're not.

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,040
You wait for backup and you follow
orders just like everyone else.

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,620
It's called discipline,
and it saves lives.

47
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,620
- That's all I was trying to do.
- Oh, yeah?

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,320
Did you know the wall
would break that easy?

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,360
That his assault rifle
didn't have a hair trigger?

50
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,320
That he didn't have explosives
hidden on his person?

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,610
Jake, you've been enhanced.

52
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,700
You can do some pretty
spectacular things,

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,730
but that's not what this
job is really all about,

54
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,730
and if you don't learn that,

55
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,730
somebody's going to get hurt.

56
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,660
I didn't go through
channels, General.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
I figured you'd want
to know immediately,

58
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,350
and I didn't want to waste any time.

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,310
You did the right thing.
Open the vault.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,840
Sir,

61
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,730
I have been sole custodian

62
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,470
to the Hades 13 tactical
mini nukes for six months.

63
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,650
Not once on my watch
has there been a defeat,

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,960
a glitch or any discernible
violation of security.

65
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,880
Just show me what's wrong

66
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,870
- What are you doing?
- Just watch the countdown, sir.

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,410
Disengage that explosive.

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,260
I'm requesting that The General
observe the countdown.

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,210
And I'm giving you a direct order.
Disengage that explosive.

70
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,730
Now!

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,100
What just happened?

72
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,020
It's a decoy, sir.

73
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,940
Somebody stole one of my nukes?

74
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,580
Jake and his nanites may be
the center of this unit,

75
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,660
but he's got a serious
discipline problem.

76
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,070
Are we talking about a phase
or something more permanent?

77
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,870
Oh, permanent enough if he gets
himself or someone else killed.

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,980
Apparently, there's
no "we" in nanites.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,720
Well, I'm not surprised.

80
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,680
A few months of NSA
field work is no cure

81
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,830
for a childhood full
of James Bond movies.

82
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,880
Well, I think we better find a cure.

83
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,850
There's someone you need to meet.

84
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,740
General Freewald.

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,550
Tank Buster. It's been awhile.

86
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,650
I served with The General
in the first gulf war.

87
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,510
Your boss was the best
helicopter driver in the force.

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,230
And absolutely lethal
with a rocket launcher.

89
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,090
Agent Kyle Duarte.

90
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,120
You trust this man?

91
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,730
Hoo-ah.

92
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,080
Agent Duarte.

93
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,240
Well, Tank Buster,

94
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,160
the day has finally come -
I'm actually glad

95
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,970
you traded in your Blackhawk
for a desk at the NSA.

96
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,290
- Well, that makes me nervous.
- And well it should.

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,510
Fort McClelland serves
as a repository

98
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,760
for our arsenal of Hades 13
tactical mini nukes.

99
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,470
- What happened?
- Stolen.

100
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,400
One of your nukes is missing?

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,650
Fort McClelland is 100% secure.

102
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,700
Nothing happens there
I don't know about.

103
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,070
That leaves only one explanation -

104
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,210
One of the members of the wolf pack

105
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,170
stationed at my base
has turned traitor.

106
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,280
Traitor? In the wolf pack?

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,280
Aren't they the most
elite in special ops?

108
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,200
Well, that's the official story.

109
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,540
What they are is a semi-autonomous
black ops squad.

110
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,530
They do things the U.S. Government
really isn't supposed to.

111
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,500
We give them a job,
the wolf pack gets it done.

112
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,740
No questions asked.

113
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,340
And a member of this
team has a Hades 13.

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,320
Have you alerted CID?

115
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,900
CID is a joke.

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,160
So is JAG.

117
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,180
I give them a call,
they send me two nitwits in khakis

118
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,690
to stumble over every
obstacle on the base.

119
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,540
This job needs to be done covertly.

120
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,480
Any indication that we know
the weapon is missing,

121
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,100
and our traitor vanishes.

122
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,670
I know how they think.

123
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,230
I used to be a member
of the wolf pack.

124
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,170
Before I turned sane.

125
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,100
You want this thing done,
you'll have to do it my way.

126
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,200
I'll mobilize every asset I have
around the world to find this device,

127
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,940
but I will need to put
someone on the inside.

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,540
I'm already with you.

129
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,460
The wolf pack is
expecting a new recruit.

130
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,460
I've delayed his arrival.

131
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,610
That leaves an opening for your man.

132
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,550
There's only one catch.

133
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,000
These men operate at the
highest standard of strength,

134
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,930
endurance and agility.

135
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,960
Your agent is going
to have to pass muster

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,930
or he will be made.

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,510
I believe I've got your man.

138
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,880
You did say he could
use some discipline.

139
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,990
- Jake.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,110
- Jake.
- Hmm?

141
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,060
No.

142
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,370
The body is a temple - even
a nanite-enhanced one.

143
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,800
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,420
Am I acting like I'm too good to
follow orders like everyone else?

145
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,510
It's true? I'm becoming THAT guy?

146
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,680
No, but...

147
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,380
I'm still glad that Kyle
read you the riot act.

148
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,490
Why, because you like
to see me humiliated?

149
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,460
Because I'd like to
see you alive, Jake.

150
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,010
You know, I bet he told Lou...

151
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,010
"Jake's grandstanding."

152
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,070
"Jake's chewing gum. Jake..."

153
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,790
Has a new mission.

154
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,770
Get up to speed.

155
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,280
So you want me to join the Wolf Pack.

156
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,280
Great mission. Really.
There's just one small thing,

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,990
and it's not that I think
I'm special or anything,

158
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,260
it's just that, well... Uh...

159
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,700
I don't really do well
with teams or packs.

160
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,770
Especially in uniform. Jocks,

161
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,770
frat guys, marching bands.

162
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
They eat people like
me for breakfast.

163
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,580
Are you done?

164
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,840
You're going to learn
to become a soldier.

165
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,280
I have someone standing
by to train you.

166
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,930
Yeah? Who's the Yoda-like miracle worker
that's going to make that happen?

167
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,790
Well, Timmy's not going to be
playing the violin any time soon.

168
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,950
That is the most pathetic

169
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,950
field kill I have ever seen.

170
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,840
You will never leave your weapon

171
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,800
in, on, or around the enemy.

172
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,340
- Do we understand each other?!
- Yes, ma'am.

173
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,830
For the last time, Jake,
the correct answer is 'hoo-ah'.

174
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,400
'Hoo-ah' means 'yes',
'thank you', 'please',

175
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,400
'pass the ammo', 'praise the Lord'.

176
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,840
Do you understand?
When in doubt - hoo-ah!

177
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,380
Hoo-ah!

178
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,800
You don't have to yell
it all the time, okay?

179
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,210
Now if anybody asks you
about your past missions,

180
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
or people you've served with,

181
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,230
you go no further than 'hoo-ah'.

182
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,310
These men aren't going to trust you
until they've tested you, Jake.

183
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,770
And even then you're not going to sit
around talking about your feelings.

184
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,310
And don't worry - I'm not going
to open up to these psychopaths.

185
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,250
They're not psychopaths, Jake.

186
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,060
These men are highly competent,

187
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,060
connected and skilled soldiers.

188
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,710
They don't have to salute.

189
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,300
They don't have to wear
their hair or uniforms regulation.

190
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,640
And they don't have a problem
operating in a morally gray area.

191
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,170
So how come you never
joined the wolf pack?

192
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,310
They don't take women.

193
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,180
The NSA does.

194
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,070
So are you ready to do this?

195
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,610
Sure.

196
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,860
I mean, hoo-ah.

197
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,710
- Hit me.
- What?

198
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,290
Hit me!

199
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,090
Hope you don't have
any plans for tonight.

200
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,700
Let's go, soldier, move it,
move it, move it.

201
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,640
Let's pick up the pace.

202
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,490
We've got some time to keep here.

203
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,250
Come on, soldier, you're
moving like pond water!

204
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,180
Move it! Move it!

205
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,310
Sergeant first class
Mitchell Gant, wolf pack.

206
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,110
Do you need to see my papers, or...?

207
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,690
- Uh, sergeant, we're not the wolf...
- Hoo-ah!

208
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,320
they are.

209
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,730
Company, clear the square!

210
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,600
Hey, man. How ya doing?

211
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,250
Captain Hartman?

212
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, at ease.

213
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,280
You must be Gant. Nice knowing you.

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,360
- Got some papers for me?
- Uh, yes, sir.

215
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,260
Cool.

216
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,930
Why in the name of hell

217
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,050
are you giving me up as
your commanding officer?

218
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,480
You ever salute me in the open again

219
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,630
and I will exsanguinate you,
understood?

220
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,670
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you "sir" me.

221
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,390
You want me dead?
Is that what you want, huh?

222
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,380
Get up and answer me.

223
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,100
The pack is your mother, and
the pack is your father, kid.

224
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,060
From now on, everything that you need

225
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,920
you will get from us.

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,910
That is, of course, if you can

227
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,900
manage to cut it here
for more than 30 seconds.

228
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,620
Think you can do that?

229
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,830
Think you got what it takes?

230
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,880
Hoo-ah.

231
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,760
Drills are up. Move out!

232
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,450
Welcome to hell.

233
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,900
I want every dealer and informant

234
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,670
in the world arms market
tracked down and interrogated.

235
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,070
If Hades 13 is in play, I want
to know who, where and how.

236
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,630
You are also to put
all of our field agents

237
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,730
monitoring the sale of nuclear
equipment on high alert.

238
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,600
If anyone buys a radiac meter
anywhere in the world,

239
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,360
I want someone with NSA creds

240
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,180
standing by to ask why.

241
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,040
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,220
Good. You know the drill.

243
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,220
In god we trust,

244
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,080
all others we monitor.

245
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,160
I have a special mission for you.

246
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,120
Let's go! Keep up!

247
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,900
Move your ass! Move it!

248
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,980
Hoo-ah.

249
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,140
Get him over that wall.

250
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,120
Sixty-two!

251
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,320
Sixty-three!

252
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,640
Sixty-four!

253
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,280
Sixty-five!

254
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,600
Sixty-six!

255
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
Sixty-seven, sixty-eight

256
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,200
sixty-nine, seventy

257
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,380
seventy-one, seventy-two

258
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,630
seventy-three, seventy-four

259
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,610
Well, I guess you could
describe it as summer camp...

260
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,180
ten-mile runs...

261
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,130
I've never been this
tired in my entire life.

262
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,320
Hey, the nanites aren't going

263
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,250
to burn out or anything, are they?

264
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,840
No.

265
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,710
No, they're-they're doing fine.

266
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,290
Oh, good.

267
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,040
What about you? Are you scared?

268
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know what I am.
These guys are crazy, but...

269
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,480
I think they may be
starting to respect me.

270
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,900
Oh, crap. I'm late, I got
to get back to the barracks.

271
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,220
Bye

272
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,500
Gant!

273
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,940
That's some fine work out
there today, my friend.

274
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,910
You're the man, Gant.
Sierra Hotel, all the way.

275
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,430
Hey.

276
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,180
Thanks.

277
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,550
USDA choice,

278
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,330
hard ass.

279
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,410
You're going to do us proud.

280
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,240
Thanks, man.

281
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,790
You impressed every man in this unit.

282
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,640
Thank you.

283
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,080
You're welcome. Good night.

284
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,030
Good night.

285
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,700
Stop the car.

286
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,180
You're lucky you weren't on an
actual mission, Agent Foley.

287
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,810
If the wolf pack thought you were
slowing them down in battle,

288
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,810
they'd just pop a slug
in your kneecap.

289
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,600
Well, I guess lucky in your world
mean being tortured all night

290
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,690
by a bunch of jingoistic mesomorphs.

291
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,870
Sir.

292
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,040
I trust Louise Beckett with my life.

293
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,440
I hope that trust
hasn't been misplaced.

294
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,980
You and me both.

295
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,050
Louise Beckett is not
someone you let down

296
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,980
without serious consequence.

297
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,790
You know how she got
the name Tank Buster?

298
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,540
Let me guess - she blew up
a bunch of tanks in the gulf.

299
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,750
Tank was a man.

300
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,000
Piloted a Black Hawk
in your boss' outfit

301
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,720
and had no end of crap to give her

302
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,330
about being black, being female,
being attractive.

303
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,300
You name it, he had a slur.

304
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,260
And Beckett put up with everything,

305
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,100
until tank bugged out
on a hostile encounter

306
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
a little faster than he should have.

307
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,530
Left Beckett all alone
to weather the fire storm.

308
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,660
But one night,

309
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,760
tank went to the CO,

310
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,240
begged to be taken off
the flight rotation,

311
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,580
confessed he acted
in a cowardly fashion

312
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,830
and spent the rest of
the war behind a desk.

313
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,590
And he never said a mean
thing about anybody

314
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,480
ever again.

315
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,140
What'd she do to him?

316
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,880
Nobody knows.

317
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,020
That's why I'm warning you.

318
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,380
Don't give Louise Beckett
a reason to dislike you.

319
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,850
Someone here to see you.

320
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,260
So, you're undercover, too.

321
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,070
None of our intelligence assets

322
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,330
can place Hades 13
in the arms market.

323
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,470
Our informants in the terrorist
underground have nothing,

324
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,770
so the most plausible
scenario right now...

325
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,790
Is that the weapon's
still on the base.

326
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
- You have to find it.
- How?

327
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,990
The wolf pack carry field laptops.

328
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,060
Traitor may have used his to uplink
with someone about the bomb.

329
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Now, you have to go through
the wolf pack's duffel,

330
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,880
interface with their gear

331
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,840
and copy down their
communications logs.

332
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,240
Okay,

333
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,000
am I going to do that before or after
the monkeys fly out of my butt?

334
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,050
Kyle...

335
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,040
don't send me back
in with those guys.

336
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,510
If the Hades 13 in detonated,

337
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,510
a lot of people are going to die.

338
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,990
Jake,

339
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,020
there are no half
measures on this one.

340
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,470
You have to find the discipline

341
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,470
and commitment to take
this all the way.

342
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,310
- Is that an order?
- Yes.

343
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,480
All right.

344
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,090
I need some nerve gas and a funnel.

345
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,370
I don't know, but I've been told...

346
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,370
I don't know, but I've been told...

347
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,670
Wolf pack men don't sing no songs!

348
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,830
Wolf pack men don't sing no songs!

349
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,450
Oh, the little crap hound!

350
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,580
Wolf pack men is where it hurts!

351
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,500
Wolf pack men is where it hurts!

352
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,350
Shut your hole and...

353
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,310
That the worst your little sorority
bitches could come up with?

354
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,940
What kind of mongolian
goat manure in your skull

355
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,440
made you think I'd follow a woman
like you into battle, huh?

356
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,460
Get my eat tool.

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,670
Who in the name of sweet god almighty

358
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,840
put all these holes
around my barracks?

359
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,450
Someone could trip and
fall into one of these.

360
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,460
That's just plain unacceptable.

361
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,610
Listen to me, you little ass clown.

362
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,540
You listen to me good. I want

363
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,710
each and every one of these holes

364
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,320
off my base by sun up,

365
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,220
or you will suffer the kind of pain

366
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,130
you only ever hear tell of.

367
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,650
Hoo-ah.

368
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,350
Hoo-ah.

369
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,090
Lights out in five minutes!

370
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,530
What?

371
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,530
Nothing.

372
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,120
You clocked your CO,

373
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,960
and instead of beating
the snot out of you,

374
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,210
- he made you dig holes?
- Yeah.

375
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,750
It's supposed to impress upon me
the fact that I'm so retarded,

376
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,750
I don't even merit
army-grade punishment.

377
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,360
As you can see,
the shame is unbearable.

378
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,760
Yeah.

379
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,380
Well, that's the last of them.

380
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,640
I'll upload the data to Lou
from the main complex.

381
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,700
- Mm-hmm.
- This was clever, Jake.

382
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,760
But that nerve gas is going
to wear off real soon.

383
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,110
There's still a traitor in this unit,

384
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,240
and these laptops may not be
enough to snuff him out.

385
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,300
Well, being clever had
nothing to do with it.

386
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,370
This is just Phase One.

387
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,630
You sure you know what you're doing?

388
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,290
Kyle, now is not the time
to second-guess me.

389
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,510
You asked me to become one of
these men, that's what I'm doing.

390
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,250
What exactly do you have in mind?

391
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,850
That's on a need-to-know basis.

392
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,450
Six hours ago, you were telling
me not to send you back here.

393
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,790
Now you're General Patton?

394
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,520
You gave me a specific order
to take this all the way.

395
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm taking it all the way.

396
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,780
Sergeant, stop the vehicle.

397
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,370
No five-mile run today, gentlemen?

398
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,700
Gant...

399
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,910
you magnificent bastard!

400
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,140
You see what you pulled off?

401
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,750
How the hell did you do that?

402
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,910
Let the man have his sec he's
got the huevos to pull that,

403
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,980
god only knows what
he'll do in the field!

404
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,030
Looks like we found ourselves
a tactical mastermind!

405
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,620
Hoo-ah!

406
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,440
You took your beating like a man,
and you gave as good as you got.

407
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,320
Hey, everyone gets tested, Gant.

408
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,140
No exceptions. Nothing personal,
huh? Nothing personal.

409
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,320
What do you say, Lawrence?
What do you say?

410
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,880
You think it's time we give young
Mitchell here an initiation?

411
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,260
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah?

412
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,460
- Initiation? Initiation?
- Initiation!

413
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,400
Hang 'em up! Hang 'em up!

414
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,850
Initiation! Initiation!

415
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,640
Initiation!

416
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,400
Down the hatch.

417
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,920
Hey, hey! Can't you knobs
take a direct order?

418
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,010
I said shaken, not stirred!

419
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,110
Hey, now that we know
each other so well,

420
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,700
how about we make this
cub part of the pack?

421
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,050
Hoo-ah!

422
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,910
The real initiation, Gant.

423
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,270
Come on, get this off! Let's go!

424
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,030
Ho!

425
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Oh, yeah!

426
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,290
Come on, Gant!

427
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,040
Carve it in! Don't pass out!

428
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,860
Carve it up! Open your eyes, Gant!

429
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,460
Take it, Gant. Take it! Look at it!
Don't close your eyes!

430
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Take the pain! Look at him bleed!

431
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,400
Come on!

432
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,850
Take the pain! Take it!
Take it like a man!

433
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,690
Come on! Come on!

434
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,730
Right! Arms in!

435
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,790
Hoo-ah!

436
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,500
We ran through crypto and data
analysis on those logs you sent us.

437
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,720
I think we might've
found our traitor.

438
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,030
We know that a member of
the wolf pack leased a jet.

439
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,820
It's waiting for him somewhere in the
Florida Keys. We don't know where yet.

440
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,440
He also bought equipment
to handle nuclear material.

441
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,240
Now our guess is

442
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,300
he's moving Hades 13
out of the country.

443
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,210
Well, is he selling the bomb,
taking it to a buyer?

444
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,590
We don't know yet. Make the arrest.

445
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,050
Take the soldier straight
to General Freewald.

446
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,050
Interrogate him and
get those answers.

447
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,890
How's Jake?

448
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,300
Easy!

449
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,060
I'm not sure.

450
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,900
What do you mean?

451
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
He's one of them now.

452
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,170
We need to get him out of
this as soon as possible.

453
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,090
Oh, he'll get out. As soon as
I have the traitor and the bomb.

454
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,980
Right.

455
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,720
Oh, yeah.

456
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,230
So... now that Gant's been branded,

457
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,210
I'd like to propose a toast.

458
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,920
To absent friends.

459
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,840
- To absent friends.
- Aubrey?

460
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Hey, Gant...

461
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,100
we don't mention that
name around here.

462
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,810
No, Lawrence.

463
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,720
Gant might as well
know why he's here.

464
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,500
The pack was asked to deal with an
afghan warlord in the Chaiko Valley.

465
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,970
This puke had some bio-weapons,

466
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,000
left behind by the Soviets.

467
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,870
It was simple -

468
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,100
snatch and grab the bio-weapon.

469
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,830
Next thing you know,
we're in a hard firefight

470
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,620
through the local village.
Aubrey took some shrapnel.

471
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,970
General Freewald sends orders

472
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,440
not to jeopardize the bio-weapon.

473
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,190
To forget...

474
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,370
Aubrey and get out of there.

475
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,220
Two days later,
al-Jazeera shows a video

476
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,370
of Aubrey being torn limb
from limb in the streets.

477
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,140
One of the Wolf Pack.

478
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,960
We let him die.

479
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,080
So... a toast...

480
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,880
Sergeant Ken Aubrey,

481
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
General Wesley Freewald.

482
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,870
- Oh, forget that, man.
- No, no.

483
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,660
Let's give acknowledgment to the man

484
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,760
who made us dishonor
ourselves and our brother.

485
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,900
May he meet with all the
advancement and commendation

486
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,330
that he deserves... in hell.

487
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,270
- Hoo-ah.
- Hoo-ah.

488
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,270
Hoo-ah. Hoo-ah.

489
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,280
Hey, hey, I didn't know
she was married, I swear.

490
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,280
Shut up and keep your
hands behind your back.

491
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,800
We're going to walk out
the back door real quiet,

492
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,680
and you're going to tell
General Freewald

493
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,430
who you're working for and
where you hid the Hades 13.

494
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,600
We understand each other?

495
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,100
Well, you got to be on the pipe
if you think I'm going to do that.

496
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,850
Oh, okay.

497
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,770
Well, let's see what
the wolf pack does to you

498
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,790
when they find out
that you're a traitor.

499
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,510
- Take me to the General.
- That's what I thought.

500
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,260
You acquitted yourself quite well,
Agent Duarte,

501
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
but this is an internal matter now.

502
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,630
A question of honor.

503
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,170
This man and I need to
settle our affairs in private.

504
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,960
With all due respect, General,

505
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,740
you called the NSA,

506
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,450
and I'm not about to leave you alone

507
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,390
with a member of an elite
assassination unit.

508
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,570
A unit I used to head, Agent Duarte.

509
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,380
But have it your way.

510
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,210
Just remember

511
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,470
what happens in Fort McClellan
stays in Fort McClellan.

512
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,260
Are we clear on that?

513
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,090
- As a bell.
- Good.

514
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,250
You know,

515
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,930
in antiquity, when a field commander

516
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,830
found a traitor in his midst,

517
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,570
he had the authority to shoot

518
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,570
the lying sack of crap on site.

519
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,270
Well, you gave the
wolf pack the order

520
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,450
to leave Ken Aubrey in Afghanistan.

521
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,360
Does that mean I can shoot
you on site... sir?

522
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,220
I did what was necessary.

523
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,830
You were carrying
a lethal bio-weapon.

524
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,510
It's safe return was top priority.

525
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,310
That was the mission.

526
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,310
Our man was top priority.

527
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,310
Aubrey was still alive.

528
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,570
And you would've killed
every man, woman and child

529
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,510
in that village to him back.
Aubrey did his duty.

530
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,510
What the hell do you know about duty?

531
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,610
You were one of us.

532
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,660
The wolf pack never left a man behind

533
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,570
until you gave that order.

534
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,690
All right

535
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,860
You have something
that belongs to me.

536
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,050
Now, the way I see it,
you have two choices -

537
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,130
hand it over or die.

538
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,470
Fine.

539
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,750
The Hades 13 is...

540
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,620
All right...

541
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,210
the keys to the cuffs.

542
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,890
Please.

543
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,000
Hoo-ah!

544
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,050
It was a hairy fur ball that night.

545
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,200
Bodies flailing everywhere.

546
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,130
Didn't know which way was up.

547
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,050
Couldn't fight your way out.

548
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,000
All we could do was give in.

549
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,820
And give in, we did.

550
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,970
- Unbelievable.
- Son...

551
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,800
you never visited
a Panamanian whorehouse?

552
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,140
I can neither confirm nor deny

553
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,200
that I have ever been to Panama.

554
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,640
Hoo-ah!

555
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,400
Heads up!

556
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,340
Can I help you, officer?

557
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,300
He's not an officer.

558
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,800
His name is Agent Duarte,

559
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,170
and he's a spook for the NSA.

560
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,280
I take it this man has
knowledge of our operation.

561
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,680
Yeah, Freewald called him in to
find out who took the Hades 13.

562
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,860
You're all in on it... aren't you?

563
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,220
- What's he talking about?
- Quiet, Gant.

564
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,220
What about the General?

565
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,180
Well, my guess is they won't
find his body till dawn.

566
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,250
Agent Duarte apprehended
me in the club.

567
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,680
I decided to turn the situation
to our advantage,

568
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,670
find out how much he
and the General knew.

569
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,910
Oh, and frankly,

570
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,930
not sorry about Freewald.

571
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,980
Understood.

572
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,940
All right, mount up.
We're pushing our timetable.

573
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,760
Hall, Burns, Stern -
you're on weapons detail.

574
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,570
I want the entire pack
ready to bug out in 20.

575
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,290
We move the Hades 13 out
of the country tonight.

576
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,740
Get up!

577
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,000
Just make sure this piece of garbage
tells us everything he knows.

578
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,300
Now, who else knows?!

579
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,310
I told you.

580
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,270
I report to Freewald.

581
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,930
I'm working alone.

582
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,660
I don't believe him.

583
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,410
I concur.

584
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,290
What do you have to say
for yourself, Gant?

585
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,290
You are the first leader of a wolf
pack to leave a man behind.

586
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,540
- Aw...
- You followed a bad order

587
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,060
and you know it,
but I didn't judge you

588
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,550
when I volunteered to serve
under your command.

589
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,440
Now, one of your officers
has murdered a General.

590
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,000
An agent of our government
is bleeding on this floor,

591
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,490
beaten by your hand,

592
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,350
not by any standard of human
and military decency.

593
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,890
I should put a bullet in your skull
no matter what the consequence,

594
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,200
but instead I am standing here

595
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,370
NOT JUDGING!

596
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,990
So if you want to be
responsible for the death

597
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,680
of another one of your brothers,

598
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,540
have the courage of your
convictions and pull that trigger,

599
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,370
otherwise I respectfully
suggest you judge me

600
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,410
by my deeds, sir.

601
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,930
All right, have it your way, Gant.

602
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,850
You kill the man.

603
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

604
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,210
- You got to finish him off.
- Shut up and give me the cuffs now.

605
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,650
Now!

606
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,540
What are you doing?

607
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,070
Tape!

608
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,200
This man deserves a slow...

609
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,900
and painful death.

610
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,210
You think he merits
a soldier's death,

611
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,170
you give it to him yourself.

612
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,430
Gear up!

613
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,180
Moving out!

614
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,950
Woo-ah!

615
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,100
If the wolf packs can sneak that
weapon out to the Florida Keys,

616
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,750
I want an ambush waiting with all
the fire power we can muster.

617
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,600
So you find me that damn airstrip.

618
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,330
Director Beckett,

619
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,330
it's coming from Agent
Duarte's field phone.

620
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,970
Get a fix on Kyle's
location. Find Jake.

621
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,960
We need to get into that base.

622
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,850
Scramble covert team, have
a chopper meet me at the helipad,

623
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,890
and tell them to stow
an extra set of body armor.

624
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,270
- I'm sorry, Director, are you...?
- I'm handling this myself.

625
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,390
Gant.

626
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,920
This team's been operating under
a cloud of shame for too long.

627
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,260
You want the opportunity to be
part of the wolf packs' redemption?

628
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,220
I consider it an honor.

629
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,230
Hades 13 tactical mini nukes.

630
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,940
Ever seen one of these go off?

631
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,670
No.

632
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,110
But that's all about to change.

633
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,100
We have a jet waiting
for us in the Florida Keys.

634
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
So we're headed for Afghanistan?

635
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,470
We've got connections in every town
and village and near to Karachi.

636
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,650
In less than three days,

637
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,250
infiltrate Afghanistan
through the Paki border

638
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,820
and deliver the Hades 13
to the Chaiko Valley.

639
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,200
There's a helicopter standing by.

640
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,310
Get us out of there
before she goes off.

641
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,890
and takes out the Chaiko Valley.

642
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,040
Yeah. Every one of those animals -

643
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,370
it's a joy to torture
my boy Aubrey to death.

644
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,100
Hey, general, welcome to the party.

645
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,070
As you requested.

646
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,440
No one searches the General's traspo.

647
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,880
Stern, load up the weapon.

648
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,910
Here's we go.

649
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,910
Um... I say we stay off
the main roads.

650
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,710
Just get to the...

651
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,580
Lock and load!

652
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,230
Put your weapons down
and surrender now!

653
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,100
I knew it.

654
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,950
That weapon is not leaving this base.

655
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,120
I disagree. Hall?

656
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,320
All right. All right. Stand down.

657
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,500
Nice throw. You want to cut
his heart out for me?

658
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,820
It's my pleasure.

659
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,700
Down! Everybody down!

660
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,600
Drop your weapons and hit the deck!

661
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,320
Freeze!

662
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,610
On your face! Get down!

663
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,880
Put your hands where I can see them!

664
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,830
- Kyle?
- He's all right, he's alive.

665
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,710
- Yeah!
- Mannick!

666
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,630
Attend to this man.

667
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,880
Lou, thank you.

668
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,610
Hi.

669
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,930
Hey.

670
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,460
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,660
Don't be.

672
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,470
You did what you had to.

673
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,990
It was necessary.

674
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,520
We're proud of you.

675
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,480
I know it was tough.

676
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,110
Yeah, was tough.

677
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,910
- But also way too easy.
- I know.

678
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,090
We all got that inside, Jake.

679
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,220
It's a matter of how we use it.

680
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,270
Lou told me to, uh...

681
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,880
smuggle in some beer.

682
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,710
Love that woman.

683
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,540
Here. Take it.

684
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,020
Thanks.

685
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,700
- You going to be all right?
- Yeah.

686
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,120
I heal fast, I guess.
