1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,040
Previously on Jake 2.0:

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,380
I'm Jake Foley, tech support.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,220
I see you're still at the NSA.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,010
We got a problem.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,980
You see how the nanites have positioned

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
themselves along his
central nervous system.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,000
This guy can interface with technology.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,880
He's like a universal remote,

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,110
and every one of his body
functions is enhanced.

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,810
I've just been authorized
to create a special ops team

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,660
with you at its core.

12
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,540
- Jake.
- Sarah.

13
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,340
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,310
Oh, I'm just researching some case law.

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,520
Privacy issues, e-mails, NSA stuff.

16
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,560
Well you're not going
to get anywhere today.

17
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,950
It-it's Sunday. The library's closing.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,490
Oh, man.

19
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,490
I just ran all the way across town.

20
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,360
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,180
Ugh, soybeans.

22
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,240
The farm bill.
I thought I told you this.

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,690
Oh, right, right, right.

24
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,090
Well, uh, I'm free.

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,090
You wanna, you want
to go get some coffee?

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,070
Sure, yeah.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,980
Great. Okay.

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,550
Oh, my god, that was horrible.

29
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,060
I've never seen a human
being that shade of green.

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,880
All right, look. In my defense,

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,750
it was the first time
I'd ever tried tequila.

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,280
You picked a hell of a place to do it.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,750
Lincoln fought a war
to preserve the union,

34
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,470
and you thanked him
by puking on his shoes.

35
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,490
Yeah, he never looked
at me the same after that.

36
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,060
Oh, we were better with beer.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,870
Mmm. Grown up a little bit
since then, huh?

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,660
You did. You definitely have.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,590
You think?

40
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,400
Yeah, you seem more confident.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,610
Especially lately.

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,880
I don't know,
I can't really put my finger on it,

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,850
but you're just different.

44
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,050
Well, I've been
working out a little bit.

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,910
Can't tell.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,750
Oh, man.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,460
Oh, come on, you
set me up for that one.

48
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,360
So you can tell.

49
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,550
Um... not really.

50
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,670
I'm just kidding.

51
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,940
What's happening?

52
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,670
Base, come in.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,050
Base, we are under attack.

54
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,240
Base, come in.

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,500
- They're jamming the signal.
- What do we do?

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
Nothing. The glass is
completely bulletproof.

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,960
The body is a zinc-alloy steel.

58
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,370
They're not getting in here.

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,070
Come on.

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,790
We got to get out of here.

61
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,720
Do not open that door.

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,960
We can't do resist it.

63
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,030
- I'm getting out.
- No!

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,560
Give it to me.

65
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,610
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Security Clearance:

67
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,950
Low. Very low.

68
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,350
Then one day, it all changed.

69
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,360
Now, I can do things
I've never dreamed of.

70
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,750
I've been upgraded.

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,900
I have these powers.

72
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,980
Life just got real interesting.

73
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,240
Okay, go left on the next street.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,840
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Here we go.

75
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,310
Okay, Jake, you're pushing
too hard, all right?

76
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
No, no, no. I'm about
to make the Eiffel Tower.

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,060
No, no, no. I think that
we need to take a break.

78
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,080
No, no, no, no.
I'm almost to the Eiffel Tower.

79
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,850
Jake, the purpose of this exercise
is not winning the game, okay?

80
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,740
Yeah, right.

81
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,780
Come on.

82
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,830
No, okay, I'm going to turn it off.

83
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,920
No, no, no, no. Hold on,
hold on. There it is!

84
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,740
Almost there. Come on.

85
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,690
There it is, there it is. Yeah,

86
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,530
Oh yeah, I won it!

87
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,350
Hhmm... I beat the game.

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120
Oh, yeah, you broke the machine.

89
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,680
Um, see, the purpose
of the whole exercise

90
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,590
is not to win the game, it's to learn
how to control the nanites,

91
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,660
and, you know, just for your info -

92
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,590
not controlling the nanites.

93
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,570
- I'll buy the NSA a new one.
- Oh, well...

94
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,070
somebody's in a good mood today.

95
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,160
Yeah, I had a good weekend.

96
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,620
- Yeah, really?
- I had a date.

97
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,520
Sort of. Uh, I don't know -

98
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,470
it kind of seemed like a date, I think.

99
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,980
A sort of, kind of date. That, uh,

100
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,880
sounds intriguing.

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,740
- Yeah.
- Uh, who's the girl?

102
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,620
Sarah. We went to
Georgetown together.

103
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,970
She never really gave me
the time of day,

104
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,930
but yesterday at lunch...

105
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,870
I don't know. It kind of seemed like
things might be changing, you know?

106
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,760
That's good. My advice to you -

107
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,140
don't push too hard.

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,020
It was a perfectly orchestrated attack.

109
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,910
What were they after?

110
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,770
John Ramsey, senior engineer for GDLS.

111
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,050
He was transporting
preliminary schematics

112
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,050
for a next generation composite tank.

113
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,580
Plastic and glass fiber.

114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,120
It's as strong as what we've got,
but 70 percent lighter.

115
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,620
They can be flown in
just about anywhere.

116
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,390
So who are we looking for?

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,250
There's been increased
chatter on echelon

118
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,380
indicating possible
Chinese involvement.

119
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,750
How long since you've
had contact with Mei Ling?

120
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,670
Two and a half years.

121
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,370
I can't help you.

122
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,730
Kyle,

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,860
she is our most senior double
agent in Chinese intelligence.

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,360
If there's anyone who could
confirm their involvement,

125
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,820
let alone help us get this
thing back, it would be her.

126
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,600
There must be someone else
who's been handling her.

127
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,340
No one she's been nearly
as forthcoming with.

128
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,580
The schematics are on
an encrypted laptop.

129
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
They have to be physically
removed from the country

130
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,750
in order for their techs to decode it.

131
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,130
It could be smuggled by diplomatic
pouch at any moment, Kyle.

132
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,610
Are you ordering me to do this?

133
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,330
Once you've determined
the meeting place,

134
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,670
we'll get a team in
there and monitor...

135
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,620
No. No.

136
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,610
You want me to talk to her,
I talk to her alone.

137
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
No, Kyle, it's protocol.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,780
It's for your safety as well as hers.

139
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,870
This woman reads a room
better than anyone I know.

140
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,620
She can sniff out any agent.

141
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,220
Not necessarily.

142
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,220
They call this art?

143
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,800
You must be in trouble.

144
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,960
And why do you say that?

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,750
You called.

146
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,140
I'm sure you know the Chinese have
stolen something very important to us.

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,930
We want it back.

148
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,800
A statement was issued.
We've formally denied...

149
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,330
That means nothing.

150
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,330
It's all I know.

151
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,590
So, tell me...

152
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,590
when did you become such a patriot?

153
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,510
Two and a half years ago.

154
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,890
I'll give you the exact date

155
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,740
if you don't remember.

156
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,840
I remember.

157
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,230
I'm prepared to offer you full asylum.

158
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,600
Five years expenses.

159
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,710
Why should I trust you?

160
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,710
Because this is work, Mei Ling.

161
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,970
I've never failed you there.

162
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,360
Full asylum, and two million dollars.

163
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,360
That's a lot of money.

164
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,400
You have a lot to make up for.

165
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,450
I need to get authorization.

166
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,460
I'd suggest you work quickly.

167
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,650
The schematics are
being held in the archives

168
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,300
within the secure corridor
at the embassy.

169
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,580
It's scheduled to be taken out

170
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,510
tonight by diplomatic pouch.

171
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,540
How do we get it?

172
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,730
There's a reception
beginning at 8:00 pm.

173
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,410
You'll be my guest.

174
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,710
You haven't changed.

175
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,170
Neither have you.

176
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,200
So, you and Mei Ling

177
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,220
kind of have this
casablanca thing going on.

178
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,210
Which is none of my business.

179
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,480
It's just... I can sort of relate.

180
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,390
See, I'm having this situation
with someone from my past...

181
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,170
right, you don't care.

182
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,110
So I guess you're going
to that party tonight.

183
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,770
Absolutely not.

184
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,770
Lou, those were her terms.

185
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,770
Kyle, you're no longer a field agent.

186
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,400
Your cover was blown.
Anything you do out there's a risk.

187
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,110
Well, you had no problem
sending me out there this morning.

188
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,670
D.C. is not the field.

189
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,870
That embassy is sovereign territory.

190
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,380
You get caught inside, you're on
your own. There's nothing we can do.

191
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,370
Once those schematics
leave the country...

192
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,710
then there's nothing we can do.

193
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,860
We have other agents who
can perform this operation,

194
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,050
ones who wouldn't be as valuable
to the Chinese if they got caught.

195
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,020
I don't think that's possible. Uh...

196
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,240
I heard everything that they said, and

197
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,240
she only wants Kyle.

198
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,270
To-to do this.

199
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,690
Do you trust her?

200
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,260
I trust her enough.

201
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,880
Well, this is all kind of sudden,
don't you think?

202
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,170
I mean, the nanites
are really sensitive,

203
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,390
and it's not like you mastered control,

204
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,520
you know, that's fine in the
video game, but this,

205
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,780
this is the Chinese embassy, okay?

206
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,720
They have guns and guards

207
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,490
and, and foreign languages.

208
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,280
I mean, anything could go wrong. Jake,
have you really thought about this?

209
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,610
Diane, this is my first mission.

210
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,780
I'm nervous enough,
you're really not helping.

211
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,580
Yeah, sorry.

212
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,760
Mei Ling Wong has arranged
an invitation for me

213
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,640
under the name Felix Garay,
Venezuelan Oil Executive.

214
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,710
At 10:00 pm in the main ballroom,

215
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,800
she'll give me a security card.

216
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,230
It'll allow me access to
the main secure corridor.

217
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,160
Now, at this point, we have
to get Mei Ling out.

218
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,210
If they trace that card
to her, she's dead.

219
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,970
How do we get her out?

220
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,340
Catering truck. Agent
De Grasso will be the driver.

221
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,830
The secure corridor is located
in the basement of the embassy.

222
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,700
Once I'm down there, I'll be
out of range for thermal imaging.

223
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,820
Getting there from the main ballroom,

224
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,770
I'll encounter security cameras here,

225
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,180
here... and here.

226
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,160
Security guards change shifts at 10:30.

227
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,670
That's where Jake comes in. Diane?

228
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,210
Diane?

229
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,110
Yes. Jake, Jake will interface

230
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,920
with the security
recording devices, and,

231
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,680
uh, rewind them thirty minutes,

232
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,550
temporarily disabling
them in the process,

233
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,340
so when Kyle's on the move,
the hallways will appear empty.

234
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,670
The main security office
is located here,

235
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,420
just off the main ballroom.
How close does he have to be?

236
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,110
Uh, well, based on our tests,

237
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,280
I'd say no more than, uh, 30...

238
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,140
- 30 feet.
- Great, great.

239
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,140
So what's my cover?

240
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,060
Uh, I speak a little Spanish, so maybe
I can be another oil executive.

241
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,830
Wait. But... oh no, 'cause we,

242
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,250
we can't be together uh... royalty?

243
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,510
Too obvious? Okay...

244
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,400
billionaire software mogul...

245
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,570
Jake... we create the cover.

246
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,640
Oh, right. Right, sorry, of course.

247
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,020
So, uh, what do you have in mind?

248
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,270
Hors d'oeuvres?

249
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,730
They don't serve themselves.

250
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,570
We've added markers to our
agent's heat signatures.

251
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,480
This way our satellites
can distinguish them

252
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,260
from the other guests at the party.

253
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,270
That's Kyle and Jake in the ballroom,
and De Grasso by the van.

254
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,670
Oh, no...

255
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,470
I got data streaming
in from his nanites.

256
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,380
What the problem?

257
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,260
He's really nervous.

258
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,640
Thank you.

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,720
Oh, uh... thank you.

260
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,640
Don't mention it.

261
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,010
Stop and go. Stop and... go...

262
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,950
Thank you.

263
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,720
Jake!

264
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,880
Sarah. Hey...

265
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,600
Okay, this freaking me out.

266
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,600
I keep running into you everywhere.

267
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,690
Yeah, that's... that's crazy.

268
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,050
Must be fate.

269
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,690
So what are you doing here?

270
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,300
Um...

271
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,450
you know, just another invite.

272
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,250
Heard they had good food.

273
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,740
Oh, the wild mushroom tart is fabulous,
you have to try one.

274
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,890
Oh, you know, I've had a whole tray.

275
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,360
Jake. You look great.

276
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,320
Ah, it's a rental.

277
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Well, you certainly fill it out well.

278
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,630
I told, I told you I was working out.

279
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,210
Look, uh, look...

280
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,200
I don't know who,
who he's talking to, but,

281
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,070
his, his blood pressure is rising

282
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,830
and his heart rate is increasing.

283
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,830
His adrenals are activated. Lou...

284
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,640
Lou, is there any way maybe
that we can pull him out of this,

285
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,120
because, I, I don't know,
I, I think this is not good.

286
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,640
Diane. The mission
hasn't even started yet.

287
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,400
Okay, yeah.

288
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,330
Are you nervous?

289
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,360
What? Ah, no. No, no, no,

290
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm having a great time, this is,
you know I missed this last year,

291
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,730
and it's, this is good.

292
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,480
You think?

293
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,360
You're not having fun?

294
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,270
Fun?

295
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,980
You know why I'm here, Jake?

296
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,180
Congressman Williams.
The Agriculture Committee?

297
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,390
My fun involves lingering
around the background,

298
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,430
waiting for the right moment
to make small talk,

299
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,680
in the hopes he comes
aboard for the Farm Bill.

300
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,410
Truth be told,
I'd rather be anywhere else.

301
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

302
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,570
I'm sorry... talking your ear off.

303
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,310
One glass of veuve clicquot too many.

304
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,740
- Uh...
- What are you doing?

305
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,040
Uh, nothing. Nothing, it's just so

306
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,020
crowded over there.

307
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,940
Hot, you know, uh,

308
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,270
you, you wanna go dance? Let's dance.

309
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,420
How have you been?

310
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,100
Well, I haven't danced in a while.

311
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,010
I couldn't tell.

312
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,850
Now you're just flattering me.

313
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,850
Is it that obvious?

314
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,770
About as subtle as that
dress you're wearing.

315
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,020
Does it look familiar?

316
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,980
Hong Kong.

317
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,620
Impressive.

318
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,930
And I wasn't even wearing
it for very long.

319
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,780
Look at those two.

320
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,780
I mean, get a room.

321
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,730
Maybe they're just
caught up in the moment.

322
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,680
Yeah...

323
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,070
that happens.

324
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,840
Right now,

325
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,170
if you had to choose,

326
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,810
me or the mission...

327
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,280
At the bar, directly
behind me, is a waiter.

328
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,650
He's an agent.

329
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,660
He'll escort you to the catering truck

330
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,500
and get you out of here.

331
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,580
Mei Ling, you have to go.

332
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
Now.

333
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,650
Oh, incoming. There's your mark.

334
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,020
Oh, whoa! Why'd you do that?

335
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,240
Do you know what? It's,
it's nothing that can't wait.

336
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,930
Just for... just for right now,

337
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,860
I want to forget about work
and have some fun.

338
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,680
Okay. What'd you have in mind?

339
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,980
I want to feel like we did in college.

340
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,100
You know, I want to... get a six pack

341
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,770
and go to the Lincoln Memorial,
and not worry about anything at all.

342
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,870
What do you think?

343
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,020
Uh... I think that sounds...

344
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,690
perfect.

345
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,830
Okay. Come on, let's do it.

346
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,840
Uh... I, I can't.

347
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,920
Why?

348
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,440
Excuse me. I need a refill.

349
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,740
You're, you're a waiter.

350
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,710
Yes, he is.

351
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,310
And let's make it a double this time.

352
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Can I get a rye on the rocks?

353
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,460
Make it a double.

354
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,530
- Was that really necessary?
- Yes, it was.

355
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
Jake, you can't afford
to get distracted.

356
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,670
Well, I wasn't the only one
who was being distracted.

357
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,500
You still have feelings for her?

358
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,660
- That's irrelevant.
- Is it?

359
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,090
You know what - it's time.

360
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,030
Let's just finish this.

361
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,830
Jake's in place.

362
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,080
Kyle's on his way.

363
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,290
Jake...

364
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,080
What are you doing?

365
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm, uh...

366
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm not exactly sure
how to explain what I'm doing.

367
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,140
You're moonlighting.

368
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,570
You're making a little
extra money on the side.

369
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,900
Jake, you don't have to
pretend with me.

370
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,090
Sarah...

371
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,260
I'm an undercover agent.
I'm here on a huge mission.

372
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,470
That's hilarious, Jake.

373
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,270
Okay, when are you getting off?

374
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,560
Uh...

375
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,520
l-l-less than an hour.

376
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,130
Right. Lincoln Memorial.

377
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,580
- I'll get the beer.
- Okay.

378
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,950
What are you doing?

379
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm quitting.

380
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,600
He's in.

381
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,530
Telephone. Agent Wallace.

382
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,700
Lou Beckett.

383
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,170
What do you mean, she never
made it to the safe house?

384
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,140
Where's the driver?

385
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,590
Oh, no.

386
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,320
Good job.

387
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,240
Unfortunately,

388
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,390
you made the wrong choice.

389
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,450
It will help you be more honest.

390
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,690
I know how difficult
that could be for you.

391
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,640
You could've gotten out.

392
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,770
You could've been free from this life.

393
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,180
I am out.

394
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,680
Delivering you is my final mission.

395
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,680
Don't do this, Mei Ling.

396
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,960
It didn't have to be like this.

397
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,080
Two and a half years ago,

398
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,170
we could've made a life together.

399
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,110
Two and a half years ago...

400
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,610
you would've been dead.

401
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,510
We have a situation
at the Chinese embassy.

402
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,510
Yes.

403
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,370
I understand.

404
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,080
Jake is still on the grounds.

405
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,380
What's happening?

406
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,740
Mei Ling never made
it to the safe house.

407
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,040
I can't reach Agent De Grasso.

408
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,650
Kyle was supposed
to check in ten minutes ago.

409
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,770
His intel on our mainland agents

410
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,160
is far more valuable to the Chinese
than the schematics.

411
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,730
Well, but he's an experienced agent.

412
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,870
I mean, he would never...
say anything.

413
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,340
When they're through with him,

414
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,260
he won't have a choice.

415
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,240
Ms. Beckett.

416
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,180
Agent De Grasso's dead.

417
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,440
Jake, you listen to me.

418
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,180
You need to get out of there now.

419
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,400
I can't. There's guards everywhere.

420
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,300
Your cover hasn't been compromised.

421
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,550
Just act casual.
Walk through the front gate.

422
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,480
We'll have a team
waiting there for you.

423
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,390
Where's Kyle?

424
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,520
We haven't heard from him yet.

425
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,110
What?

426
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,110
I can't just leave him here.

427
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,350
Jake, Kyle's an experienced agent.

428
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,340
If he has any problems,
he can handle it.

429
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,400
Okay. Okay.

430
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,010
Now, you just stay on the phone.

431
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,970
You're just talking to a friend.

432
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,110
I don't believe you.

433
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,160
We intercepted a message.

434
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,090
Chinese intelligence suspected
you were working with us.

435
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,160
They had snipers waiting
outside the Hotel in Seville.

436
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,820
If I had shown up there...

437
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,130
if I'd even shown up in the city...

438
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,530
they would've killed you.

439
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,310
I did what I did...

440
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,710
to save your life.

441
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,270
You're lying.

442
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,870
Mei Ling, listen to me.

443
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,830
Why do you think I'm here?

444
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,650
Why do you think I'm doing this?

445
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,310
To get you out once and for all...

446
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,970
so that we can be together.

447
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,420
I love you.

448
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,590
It's too late.

449
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,960
You're almost there.

450
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,570
Yes... she didn't want the glass.

451
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,990
She wanted the whole bottle. Yeah.

452
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,120
Wait a minute.

453
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,390
We're not getting anything out of him.

454
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,130
- I hear him.
- What?

455
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,960
I hear him. It's Kyle. He...

456
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,770
he's in the basement.

457
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,170
- It was a setup.
- What?

458
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,150
They wanted Kyle all along.

459
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,100
This whole thing was a setup.

460
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,160
Jake, you need to get out
of there right now.

461
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,310
Uh...

462
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,120
hello?

463
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,780
Where are you going? Jake, you-you-you're
not heading towards the gate.

464
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,660
I'm, uh, I'm losing you.

465
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,350
Jake.

466
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,230
All you have to do...

467
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,730
is give me names.

468
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,920
I see.

469
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,930
Oh, my god.

470
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,270
He's gone. Look at this, he's gone.

471
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,500
Seventy-five thousand volts

472
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,270
of electricity.

473
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,540
Are you sure?

474
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,480
You go ahead.

475
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,000
Enough?

476
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,720
You go to hell.

477
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,760
No worries, I've all night

478
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,200
Hey!

479
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,980
Come on.

480
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,930
What are you doing?

481
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,900
I'm getting you out of here.

482
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,570
No... Jake. Jake.

483
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,300
There's no way out.

484
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,210
Sure there is.

485
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,300
I want you to stab me in the throat.

486
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,610
As hard as you can.

487
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,730
- What?
- Jake, listen to me.

488
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,820
They make me talk,

489
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,660
people will die.

490
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,170
This is what being
an agent is all about.

491
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,250
Now, do your job.

492
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,840
My job...

493
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,360
is to get you out of here.

494
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,830
Now, come on.

495
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,920
Jake, there's no way out.

496
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,790
I can't see anything.

497
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,570
You've got to trust me.

498
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,760
Look. Look!

499
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,250
They're alive.

500
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,920
How are we doing this?

501
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,460
Those new Cadillacs,

502
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,490
they're completely computerized, right?

503
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,430
Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,140
Go. Go, now.

505
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,610
Come with me.

506
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,460
I can't.

507
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,310
You must go now. Go.

508
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,790
Are you going to open the gates?

509
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,960
Nope.

510
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,340
Thank you. Thank you.

511
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,080
They're out.

512
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,180
That fear thing...

513
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,540
it never goes away.

514
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,380
Bali.

515
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,260
On the beach.

516
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,600
She was wearing a white dress...

517
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,470
no shoes.

518
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,890
Georgetown.

519
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,890
Freshman year.

520
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,300
I have no idea what she was wearing.

521
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,560
I just remember her eyes.

522
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,890
D.C.

523
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,290
She held a gun to my head...

524
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,420
then she kissed me.

525
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
I never kissed her.
