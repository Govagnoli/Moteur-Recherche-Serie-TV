1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,020
Previously on Jake 2.0:

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,990
I'm Jake Foley, tech support.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,950
I see you're still at the NSA.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,190
Oh, my god.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,910
We got a problem.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,860
You see how the nanites
have positioned themselves

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,620
along his central nervous system?

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,590
This guy can interface with technology.

9
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,740
Every one of his body
functions is enhanced.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,690
I've just been authorized
to create a special

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,730
ops team with you at its core.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
So what's my cover?

13
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,480
Jake.

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,300
Sarah.

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm an undercover agent.

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,530
That's hilarious.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,090
Mr. Carano has instructed
me to ask for $5 million

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,630
as a good faith down payment.

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,870
That will put you in first position
to buy some of the micro semtex.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Or...

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,710
if you like, all of it.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,300
For how much?

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,200
$20 million.

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,200
Payable upon delivery.

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,870
Let's say you don't want
anyone to suspect

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,280
that you're interested in
blowing up a particular target.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,180
Say...

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,540
you don't want to draw
attention to yourself

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,690
by dropping off a small package

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,500
or a backpack,

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,420
that cries out to any security guard

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,450
with half a brain, "I'm a bomb."

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,140
And finally,

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,750
let's say you don't want
to mess with any timers or

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,990
faulty wires or

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,210
an ignition switch
that's less than reliable.

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,460
In that case, this device
will prove extremely useful.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,850
That's me. Jake Foley,

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,810
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance:

40
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,740
Low.

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,320
Very low.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,530
Then one day,

43
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,300
it all changed.

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,270
Now, I can do things
I've never dreamed of.

45
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,690
I've been upgraded.

46
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,620
I have these powers.

47
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,570
Life just got real interesting.

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,140
Sat ops confirms Agents Foley

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,250
and Duarte have confiscated weapons.

50
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,440
I say again, Operation
Canada Goose is complete.

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,630
You all right?

52
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,470
I'll live.

53
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,620
Yeah, a whole lot of
other people will, too.

54
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,710
How'd you know it was this truck?

55
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,810
I interfaced with
the driver's cell phone.

56
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,830
My Serbo-Croatian's pretty
minimal, but I thought

57
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,850
he said something about
his mother's cheese gun.

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,330
So in our report,

59
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,210
we'll just say you heard
the word "gun."

60
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,900
Ri-i-ight. Let's go to work.

61
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,490
Let's go.

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,100
Hey, Jake.

63
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,100
Hi, Karen.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,800
Your newspapers were
starting to pile up,

65
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,710
so I thought I'd take them
in while you were away.

66
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,850
Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot
to stop delivery.

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,230
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- So how was the vacation?

68
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,300
Good. Uh, you know,
those cruise ships

69
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,160
are great for getting away from it all.

70
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,160
I thought you went to Yellowstone?

71
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,060
I did...

72
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,390
by way of Panama.

73
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,490
You went to Panama and
Yellowstone in six days?

74
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,930
There wasn't much to see in Panama.

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,130
The main thing is it was relaxing,
but I'm pretty tired right now.

76
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,020
Were you in a fight?

77
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,800
Uh, no, no...

78
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,750
I was trying to get something
out of my carry-on

79
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,800
and you know how they say that you're

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,340
luggage shifts in flight? Well,
they're really not kidding.

81
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,670
Kind of big for a carry-on.

82
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,020
Well... good night, Karen.

83
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,100
Hey, Sarah, it's Jake.

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,880
I guess we're still playing phone tag.

85
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,680
But this time it's my fault.
I was on a cruise to Yellow...

86
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,810
uh... Panama.

87
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,580
Yeah, yellow Panama.
It's on the coast.

88
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,850
It's a little touristy. But, um...

89
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,610
well, that's pretty much it. So...

90
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,610
you're it.

91
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,910
That was lame.

92
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,910
Well, cumbersome maybe.

93
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,450
Was that Sarah?

94
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,790
Her machine. In person
I'm even more cumbersome.

95
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,710
Hazard of the job.

96
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,660
Can't tell them what you really do. They
always feel you have something to hide.

97
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,200
Hope you like the single life.
It's what most of us end up with.

98
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,410
- That's good to know.
- Come on, we got something.

99
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,790
This morning we received word from

100
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,290
Filipino Intelligence
that Ruben Carano

101
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,310
is less than 36 hours from completing

102
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,050
a multi-million dollar deal with

103
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,820
the terrorist group Soledad,

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,060
for 100 kilos of
compressed Micro Semtex.

105
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,120
Soledad - they're the ones
that blew up that nightclub.

106
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,190
And two Embassies
within the last year.

107
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,160
Micro Semtex is ten times more
powerful than its namesake.

108
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,630
An amount the size
of a nine-volt battery

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,150
has a fragmentation
pattern of 100 yards.

110
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,630
It's on the United States
list of banned weapons.

111
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,790
- So where's Carano now?
- We don't know.

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,250
He's wanted in nine countries
for illegal weapons sales.

113
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,080
That includes chemical.

114
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,030
This guy will sell anything to anyone.

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,730
And he's very shrewd
about his movements.

116
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,640
He's only been spotted once
in the last three years -

117
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,470
by Interpol in Vienna.

118
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,470
Carano stays out of sight

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,890
and makes the deals with
his right-hand man -

120
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,500
Alonzo Reed.

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,510
Reed and the Soledad
operatives slipped out

122
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,240
of the Philippines
after their meeting.

123
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,170
They could be completing
this deal anywhere.

124
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,910
What about Carano's family?

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,850
His wife's deceased.
He has two brothers

126
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,770
and a daughter - all civilians.

127
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,370
Let's put our overseas agents on alert.

128
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,440
This is an opportunity to get
Carano and the terrorists.

129
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,270
Where do you want me on this?

130
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,800
I do speak pretty fair Espanol.

131
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,220
Corner of Fourth and Mass.

132
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,180
Oh.

133
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,830
Carano's daughter has an
art studio at Adams Morgan.

134
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,830
Her name's Theresa.

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,740
On the off chance that her
father attempts to contact her,

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,130
- we want somebody there.
- It'll be like a stakeout?

137
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,300
You want me to just watch her?

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Yeah. Think you can handle it?

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,060
Following a girl around for hours?
It'll be just like college.

140
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,220
I'm kidding about that.
I'm totally kidding.

141
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,360
Jake, you can't have
any contact with her.

142
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,150
- Understood?
- Yes, understood. Absolutely.

143
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,620
Good.

144
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,490
No contact.

145
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,460
Just like college.

146
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,700
Okay. Here we go

147
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,610
0900 hours.

148
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,540
Subject is wearing a white tank top.

149
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,680
Looks like she's cleaning a painting.

150
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,970
Looks like water she's using,
I don't know.

151
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,530
- It's kind of behind her.
- Jake, just watch her, okay?

152
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,590
Yeah. Right.

153
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,430
Copy... over.

154
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,620
Oh, damn.

155
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,830
- What now?
- Meter maid.

156
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,220
So what? Just do that nano thing.

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
I can't. It's mechanical.

158
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,500
Uh, I'm here.

159
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,310
Uh...

160
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,630
um... I don't suppose
you make change?

161
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,300
Right. Okay, just...

162
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,150
I'm going to be right back.

163
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,770
I got it.

164
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,580
Uh... thank you very much. Thank you.

165
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,760
That's... you're very...
good samaritan.

166
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,790
You're welcome.

167
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,890
I'm sorry. Here, let me,
uh... let me pay you back.

168
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,150
Don't worry about it.
It was 50 cents.

169
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,690
No, it was a really nice thing
you did. I really feel like I should.

170
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,100
- Here.
- That's a twenty.

171
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,530
Yeah. Well, the ticket
would have been fifty.

172
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,280
So I figure you saved me thirty.

173
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,250
I am not going to take
your last twenty.

174
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,540
No, no, it's okay, really. You can buy
yourself some new paints or something.

175
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,210
How do you know I paint?

176
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,930
I... uh... well,

177
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,770
because the paint all
over your shirt there,

178
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,300
and I know there's a lot of
art studios around here -

179
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,000
so, you know, put two and two together,
figured you must be an artist.

180
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
You're right, sort of.

181
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,170
The painting I do
is mostly restorations.

182
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,740
Oh, restorations, restorations.
Wow, that's...

183
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,720
that's really interesting, isn't it?

184
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,350
It is. I mean, when I tell
most people what I do,

185
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,210
they have no idea.

186
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,080
Well, well, most people.

187
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,310
Yeah, well, restorations
are really important,

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,300
'cause they make things...

189
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,290
like new, I'd guess you'd say.

190
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,320
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

191
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,820
Not really, no.

192
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,570
Would you like me to show you?

193
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,850
Okay.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,690
I think we've got a problem.

195
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,730
See how the light plays on the water?

196
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,510
Yeah.

197
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,630
The only way to really get
that hue is to crush lupine.

198
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,300
Sometimes the most beautiful things

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,340
are hidden behind years of neglect.

200
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,810
You peel away the layers
of dirt and grime,

201
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,160
and suddenly, there it is:

202
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,570
The artist's true intention.

203
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,850
So here I am, talking on and on

204
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,850
about myself. What do you do?

205
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Um... I-I, actually, I'm...

206
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,010
kind of into restorations, too.

207
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,600
- How so?
- I restore computers.

208
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,130
"I restore computers"?

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,510
I, I, I repair them.

210
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,340
I repair, work on them,
that kind of stuff.

211
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,350
How do you run into the mark
after the first hour?

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
He didn't try to pick her up, did he?

213
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,240
Sounds like she picked him up.

214
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,960
Mostly bluetooth,
network and operability,

215
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,180
that sort of thing - it's not
really creative like this.

216
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,010
Well, coming up with answers

217
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,010
to problems, that's creative.

218
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,990
I never really thought of it like that.

219
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,780
Maybe you should.

220
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,050
By the way, I'm Theresa Carano.

221
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,530
Oh, I'm... Alan...

222
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,530
Alan Hergott.

223
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,520
- Hergott.
- Yeah, it's an old family name.

224
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,620
My great-grandfather,

225
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,760
he actually left Prussia and...

226
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,670
brought the name with him,
here to America...

227
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,310
long line of Hergotts.

228
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,320
So you always this
nervous around women?

229
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,650
Uh... yeah, pretty much.

230
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,330
She's making him nervous.

231
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,340
I think it's time we got
"Alan Hergott" out of there.

232
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Oh, wow! Look at this!

233
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,980
This is, uh, still

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
wet. Sorry.

235
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,340
It's okay. It's not quite done.

236
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,660
So, did you always know
you wanted to do this?

237
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,690
Pretty much. I was a business graduate

238
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,300
at Brown first.
International economics.

239
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,630
- It was so dull.
- Then you transferred to art?

240
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,750
No, I graduated and
then switched to art.

241
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,790
Bet that didn't make
your family too happy.

242
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,810
My father's a practical guy.

243
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,010
Really? How so?

244
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,880
He didn't want me to be
like the other women

245
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,200
in the family, dependent on a man.

246
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,470
Yeah, my dad didn't want me
to be dependent on a man, either.

247
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,410
Especially him.

248
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,990
Oh! Look at that. That looks dry.

249
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,260
It's one of mine.
It's a self-portrait.

250
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,720
Oh... then...

251
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,230
- I guess that makes you the...
- Self?

252
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,650
Oh... look at the time.

253
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,810
Oh, yeah, I totally forgot
I have this meeting

254
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,050
with the guys over at TrelCorp.

255
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,070
Yeah, they're still trying to get
by with Centrino processors,

256
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,940
if you can believe that.

257
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,380
Uh... I guess I better go.

258
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,060
Okay.

259
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,470
Okay... well...

260
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,390
thank you for letting me
look at all your work.

261
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,710
- It's really amazing.
- You're welcome.

262
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,860
You know where to find me,
Alan Hergott.

263
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,970
What did I say, "Alan"?

264
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,500
You said no contact.
But she put money in my meter.

265
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,500
- I didn't want to seem rude!
- Rude.

266
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,990
She was being so nice. Okay,

267
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,010
all right, I understand that manners
aren't my first priority on a mission,

268
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,770
- Kyle...
- Okay?

269
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,340
- It just happened.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,170
What, what, what's
that supposed to mean?

271
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,950
Nothing. You know,
just seems a little aggressive.

272
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,790
You're a total stranger,
she gives you money,

273
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,220
invites you up to her apartment
on the spur of the moment...

274
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,760
Okay, we weren't strangers.

275
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,500
We had the whole parking meter thing,

276
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,500
- we talked about art restoration...
- Uh-huh.

277
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,760
Diane, is it so impossible
for you to believe

278
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,840
that this girl might actually
be interested in me?

279
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,310
Hi.

280
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,970
We have an unconfirmed sighting
of the terrorists in Colombia,

281
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,120
possibly heading North,
and not a single hit from Carano

282
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,120
in the last twelve hours.

283
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

284
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,920
I think Mr. Alan Hergott can help us.

285
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,450
My sixth grade teacher?

286
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,760
Oh.

287
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,420
Uh, Lou, I don't know
if that's such a great idea.

288
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,350
No, no, no, no, no. It's a
good idea. She likes him.

289
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,350
Yes. Jake can get her to trust him.

290
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,820
I-I really wouldn't want
to use her like that.

291
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,190
Uh, unless, of course,
you wanted me to.

292
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,450
Let's get Mr. Hergott a painting.

293
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,490
Go, Alan.

294
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,890
So, Alan,

295
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,170
- hear you've got a mission.
- Yeah.

296
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,010
What, you're totally not excited?

297
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,820
Not excited about lying to this girl.

298
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,430
Well, you're not really lying.
It's part of the job, right?

299
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,410
The part I'm not very good at.

300
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,400
You're telling me you've
never lied to a girl before?

301
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,220
Never used to.

302
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,400
- Alan.
- Hey. Hi.

303
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,780
Uh, I was wondering
if you could help me.

304
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,980
The composition's subtle but strong.

305
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,900
The palette seems
like it might be good.

306
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,110
It looks like it was painted quickly,

307
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,350
which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

308
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,080
The plenary painters always strove

309
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,260
to get their landscapes
done in one sitting.

310
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,770
What?

311
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,670
Why'd they want to get
them done in one sitting?

312
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,120
They wanted to capture
life, the moment.

313
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,490
They didn't want to put it
in a glass jar for study.

314
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,170
You see these strokes,

315
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,930
how thick the paint is, how bold?

316
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,490
Feel it.

317
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,610
Yeah... it's bold.

318
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,190
Why did you pick this painting?

319
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,470
Uh... well, it's...
I like it 'cause it's open

320
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,810
and, um... simple.

321
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,630
Right.

322
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,970
And that path,

323
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,100
I don't know where it goes, it's...

324
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,120
just kind of goes on forever.

325
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,910
And, uh... and the trees,

326
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,080
they're really tall and dense,
like you could get lost

327
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,710
in there for hours, you know?

328
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,850
Yeah... I do know.

329
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,060
Okay, take off your shirt.

330
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,190
- What?
-Yeah! You're going to help me restore it.

331
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,440
- I am?
- I'll be back in a sec.

332
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,420
I just got to get some
new brushes and paints.

333
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,970
Okay.

334
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,720
- Alan!
- Uh... yeah!

335
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,900
There's some beer in the fridge.

336
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,660
Okay. You want one?

337
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,590
- Sure!
- Okay.

338
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,070
I'm watching him now.

339
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,680
I'll tell you what he's doing:

340
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,130
He's poking around the desk
looking at some mail.

341
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,750
He's definitely a wrong number.

342
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,830
Don't worry, Carano,

343
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,870
I'll find out who he really is

344
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,800
and what he's really up to.

345
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,760
So what exactly am I doing here?

346
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,710
You're cleaning the surface.
That way, when you start painting,

347
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,450
you don't seal in the dirt particles.

348
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,860
- When you start painting...
- No, when we start panting.

349
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,310
Don't be afraid to really push.

350
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,460
Probably not the first
time she said that.

351
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,570
This is going nowhere.

352
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,520
So your parents live in DC?

353
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,320
They used to.

354
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,930
My father travels a lot.

355
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,740
My mom died when I was ten.

356
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,110
Oh, I'm sorry.
What does your dad do?

357
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,560
I-I don't mean to pry.

358
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,320
No, uh, no.

359
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,220
I say he's an importer-exporter.

360
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,660
Oh.

361
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,690
My dad's an arms dealer.

362
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,280
Lou, I think he might've
stumbled onto something.

363
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Uh... an arms dealer?

364
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,990
Wow, that's...

365
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,500
different.

366
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,710
Uh... yeah, pretty different.

367
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,320
It's not something
I tell most people.

368
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,970
You told me.

369
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,940
You're not most people.

370
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,010
I can't imagine what that
must've been like growing up.

371
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,760
It was something.

372
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,540
You know, you get old enough,
you read things in the newspaper.

373
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,680
They can say what
they want about him,

374
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,870
but he never missed
my birthday or a school

375
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,840
play or anything else that mattered.

376
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,640
So, do you still see a lot of him?

377
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,640
Not as much as I'd like.

378
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,450
We talk on the phone.

379
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,560
- He's out of the country.
- Yeah.

380
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,560
I can't keep up with him. He's
always in a different time zone.

381
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,250
He sent me these shoes
a couple weeks ago.

382
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,510
Very nice!

383
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,450
Caracas has the best shoes.

384
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,220
- Caracas.
- Let's get our agents over there

385
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,820
to circulate Carano's photo.

386
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
- So, we just start painting now or...?
- Nope.

387
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,570
You see where these rips were?

388
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,740
You have to let the
putty dry overnight.

389
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,520
Oh. So then, I guess...

390
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,830
You have to come back tomorrow.

391
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,130
Oh...

392
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,460
A man fitting Carano's description

393
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,120
left a private compound
in the El Posada

394
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,940
neighborhood of Caracas
three days ago.

395
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,510
Confirmed?

396
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,620
By Venezuelan Intelligence
and Miraflores.

397
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,200
That's the presidential palace.

398
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,110
I didn't know we had someone
in the presidential palace.

399
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,090
Hmm. Yes. The president.

400
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,130
We believe Carano boarded a flight

401
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,780
on El Centro air under
the name Eduardo Garcia.

402
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,770
That plane went to Costa Rica.

403
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,110
Too late for a welcoming committee?

404
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,630
Long gone.

405
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,790
Carano leaves Venezuela
for Costa Rica,

406
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,060
Soledad is rumored to be
heading north into Colombia.

407
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,010
Let's focus our resources here between

408
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,080
El Salvador and Costa Rica.

409
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,170
I believe Carano's going to be meeting

410
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,000
his buyers somewhere in this vicinity.

411
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,300
That's good work.

412
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,280
Thanks. You guys can take it from here?

413
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,430
Don't you and Carano's daughter
have a date tonight?

414
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,990
A... a date? No, no, no.

415
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,190
Hey, no, no, it's not a date,
it's, um...

416
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,020
uh, we're supposed
to work on the painting

417
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,940
- around 8:00. I'll cancel.
- No, you won't.

418
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,240
In fact, I'd like you to go sooner.

419
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,310
Are you sure you need me on this?

420
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,640
'Cause you guys already know
they're in Central America.

421
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,470
You have agents
all over the place, uh...

422
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,400
She talks to her father on the phone.
She told you that herself last night.

423
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,580
We've run traces on her cell,
land line - nothing.

424
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,030
She's communicating
with him somehow.

425
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,000
You want me to find out how.

426
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,540
Nice to see you, too.

427
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,800
Hi. Sorry. Uh...

428
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,950
it's just, you look... amazing.

429
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,220
Thank you. Come in.

430
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Are you allowed
to paint in that dress?

431
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,810
No, we're not painting tonight.

432
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,540
- We're not?
- No.

433
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,600
Uh, the painting still
has to dry another day.

434
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,750
So I figured that there's not much

435
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,440
else to do but eat

436
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,350
and enjoy ourselves.

437
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,510
I hope you're not upset
that I tricked you.

438
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,620
No, no. I'm... delighted.

439
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,560
Something smells really good.

440
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,610
It's the chipotle sauce for dipping.

441
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,430
Relax, make yourself at home.

442
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,950
Okay.

443
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,140
I expect you to be honest.

444
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,250
Tell me if it's too spicy.

445
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,270
- Wow, that's perfect.
- Yeah?

446
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,000
- Mm.
- Good. Let's dance.

447
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,120
No, I don't really...

448
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,120
Wow...

449
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,100
you're a natural.

450
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,640
You're really cute when you do that.

451
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,540
What? Wh-when I do what?

452
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,350
You... scrunch up your forehead

453
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,080
'cause you're concentrating.

454
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,490
- I scrunch?
- Yeah, you do.

455
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,110
Right here.

456
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,160
He called her twice
in the last nine hours.

457
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,060
Santa Ana, San Salvador.

458
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,810
How do we know it was him?

459
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,510
She has a cell phone
on her speed dial,

460
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,510
so when the calls came in,
it said "Papa."

461
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,270
I'm uplinking to the satellite now.

462
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,140
Put it on the big board.

463
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,620
Yeah.

464
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,570
The El Cortez hotel,
top floor, northeast corner.

465
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,240
Got him.

466
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,240
Put rotating teams on that hotel.

467
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,810
When he moves, we move.

468
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,260
Uptown one's in position.

469
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,750
Downtown two,
approaching at nine o'clock.

470
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,820
Carano's on the move.

471
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,840
Copy that.

472
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,630
He left the El Cortez 20 minutes ago.

473
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,780
Is he, uh, is this the handoff?

474
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,520
We'll find out.

475
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,020
- Our guests have arrived.
- I copy.

476
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,800
Looks like the Colombian
posse's meeting on a boat.

477
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,120
You got an I.D. on Carano?

478
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,430
It's a positive.

479
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,960
Our guess is, the semtex
is inside the boat.

480
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,760
Where are the buyers?

481
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,740
So far they're a no-show.

482
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,500
Maybe this isn't the handoff. Maybe
they're just transferring the semtex.

483
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,310
Doesn't look like the folks from
Soledad are coming to the party.

484
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,640
No pressure, boss, but these guys
aren't going to be around forever.

485
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,080
If we get Carano, maybe the semtex,

486
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,990
that's two out of three, and we
put a stop to it for the time being.

487
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,640
No, let's-let's wait one more minute.

488
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,190
I copy.

489
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,310
They're on the move.

490
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,970
- Okay, Peter, let's draw in the net.
- Copy that. Let's go.

491
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,050
Let's go.

492
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,150
NSA! Drop your weapons.

493
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,250
Drop your weapons. Get down!

494
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,240
Get down, Federal Agents!

495
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,200
Vamonos rapido!
Vamonos al bote! Vamonos!

496
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,080
Peter, what's going on?

497
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,400
Peter... what's happening?

498
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,240
Peter?

499
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,420
Looks like a lot of bodies.

500
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,550
Peter? Peter?

501
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,550
We've sustained two injuries,
both minor.

502
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,610
And the Colombians?

503
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,470
Three dead, one wounded.

504
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,590
And Carano - what's Carano's status?

505
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,410
Carano is dead.

506
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,990
Repeat: Carano is dead.

507
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,920
Jake, it's not your fault.

508
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,660
Diane, I put the NSA on to him.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,120
I broke into her phone logs.
I pinpointed his location

510
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,610
- right down to his hotel room.
- Yeah, because you were doing your job!

511
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,360
You had no control over
how this turned out.

512
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,220
No, I knew the risks.
I knew this might happen.

513
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,240
She trusted me,
and now her dad's dead.

514
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,470
Hello?

515
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,500
Theresa.

516
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,620
Theresa, I'm so sorry.

517
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,830
I always knew someday
something like this would happen,

518
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,240
you know? I just can't believe...

519
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,200
he was shot eleven times.

520
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,430
What kind of people do that?

521
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,170
He was shot in the street.

522
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,920
I didn't even get to say good-bye.

523
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,760
- You went to see her?
- Yes.

524
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,750
- Without authorization?
- Yes.

525
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,270
And?

526
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,950
She's a wreck.

527
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,830
The funeral's on Friday.

528
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,090
She's burying him here in
Washington next to her mother.

529
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,500
Well, I'm sorry that
a girl's father had to die,

530
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,870
but I am not sorry that a dangerous
arms dealer is gone,

531
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,670
and you shouldn't be, either.

532
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,620
Is there anything else?

533
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,620
Yes. I want my final report.

534
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,880
Everything on Carano
for the last six years.

535
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,110
Guess you're going to be
here for a while.

536
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,590
I'm Theresa Carano. Theresa...

537
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,750
Are you always this
nervous around women?

538
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,980
My dad travels a lot...

539
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,140
my mom died when I was ten...

540
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,140
my dad's an arms dealer...

541
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,170
I always knew someday
something like this would happen...

542
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,840
He was shot eleven times.

543
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,470
What kind of people do that?

544
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,400
Is this everything?

545
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,230
Yeah.

546
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,370
I'd like permission to see her again.

547
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,930
Permission granted.

548
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,670
Hey, come in.

549
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,280
You don't have to do this...

550
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,800
keep checking up on me.

551
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,390
- Theresa...
- I have something for you.

552
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,340
I finished it. What do you think?

553
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,870
It's beautiful,

554
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,000
but you didn't have to do that.

555
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,940
Yeah, I did. Working on it helped.

556
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,670
Helps.

557
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,790
Anyway, it's all yours now.

558
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,470
It was the one good thing
the last couple of days.

559
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,480
Well, two. You being the other.

560
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,540
Uh...

561
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,370
Theresa... uh...

562
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,480
I'm not good,

563
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,410
and I'm not who you think I am.

564
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,000
What?

565
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,730
I just, I...

566
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,370
I think you deserve to know the truth.

567
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,320
My real name is Jake Foley,

568
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,320
and I don't repair computers.

569
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,340
I'm an agent with the NSA.

570
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,240
The NSA?

571
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,250
Yeah, your father, he's been selling

572
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,550
some very dangerous explosives
to a terrorist group.

573
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,550
We have agents all over
the world looking for him,

574
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,360
and I was assigned to follow you.

575
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,330
Are you joking?

576
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,610
I used you

577
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,590
to help them track him.

578
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,560
Uh...

579
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,620
our agents were the ones
who tried to arrest him

580
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,470
who killed him.

581
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,720
Why are you...

582
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,450
why are you telling me this?

583
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,260
'Cause I care about you.

584
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,280
I-I think you deserve better.

585
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,770
And...

586
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,080
I couldn't live with
myself if I didn't.

587
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,400
Yeah, well, I'm glad you
can live with yourself now.

588
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,380
Are you all right?

589
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,930
Yeah. Never better.

590
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
The NSA bought it.
They're out of the picture.

591
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,710
Tell Soledad they can
take delivery tomorrow.

592
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,410
You are good, Carano.

593
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,020
You're right.

594
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,070
Helps that men are
the same everywhere.

595
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,380
They always underestimate the woman.

596
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,140
Theresa.

597
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm sorry. I had to come.

598
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,860
I couldn't let you go
through this by yourself.

599
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,040
Maybe... I'll leave if you want me to.

600
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,460
No.

601
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,040
Sorry about what happened to your dad.

602
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,450
Two and a half years ago,
when he really died in Belize...

603
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,760
One of his private planes
changed hands.

604
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,620
There was a forged bill of sale.

605
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,080
He didn't sell that plane. It crashed.

606
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,950
You covered it up.

607
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,920
That day we met,
thought I was watching you.

608
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,340
Turns out, you were watching me...

609
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,330
playing me from the minute you
put the quarter in the meter.

610
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,840
Got it. Don't be afraid to push...

611
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,580
Were you always this
nervous around women?

612
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,910
I'll be back...

613
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,820
I'm guessing you told Alonzo
to find out who was.

614
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,860
- Don't worry, Carano.
- Why are you telling me this?

615
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,500
And that's when you
really start to shine.

616
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,980
My dad's an arms dealer...

617
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,560
The shoes from Caracas,

618
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,390
the PDA out in plain view,

619
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,490
all to make us think dad's
still out there, cutting deals.

620
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,230
Hey, family business.

621
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,110
You make millions running it.

622
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,910
Your father's enemies chase his ghost,

623
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,230
and occasionally someone you hire
to keep that ghost alive gets shot.

624
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,910
Eleven times, to be exact.

625
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,620
Turns out your people were there
watching that little set-up

626
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,250
got back to you faster than
the coroner got back to us.

627
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,500
You're very good.

628
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,360
You know, I was thinking
to myself, if I were you,

629
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,570
how would I get that micro semtex
back into the country

630
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,490
and still keep my $20 million?

631
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,780
I think I'd take it through customs,

632
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,400
right along with dear
old dead, fake dad.

633
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,930
Am I warm?

634
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,300
Kyle, little help.

635
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,820
Everyone, weapons on the ground, now!

636
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,650
- Put it down!
- Hands in the air!

637
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,340
Weapons on the ground, now!

638
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,320
Hands in the air. Hands in the air.

639
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,270
Get down, get down!

640
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,260
Kyle!

641
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,810
Kyle?

642
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,720
I'm all right. Get her!

643
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,530
Look...

644
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,320
I make it a rule never to...

645
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,030
do that.

646
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,410
Jake!

647
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,610
Hi.

648
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,490
What, uh...

649
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,550
whatcha... what are
you doing with that?

650
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,350
Uh... evidence cleared it.
Taking it home.

651
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,350
Oh! It's nice.

652
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,400
- It'll look nice in your place.
- Yeah.

653
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,160
Well, it's my reminder
I can't trust people anymore.

654
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,830
I can't even trust myself you know?

655
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,990
Well, Jake, you can
trust people. Wha...?

656
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,010
Sure.

657
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,600
No, look, wait. Wait,
wait, wait. Wait, wait.

658
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,050
Jake, just listen. Look,

659
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,940
I know for the mission and all that,

660
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,820
yeah, you can't trust anyone,

661
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,540
but that's-that's just your job.

662
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,370
I mean, you don't have
to take that home.

663
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,920
You just... you gotta find moments

664
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,580
with people that you do trust.

665
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,220
You know, and-and people

666
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,140
with whom you can be honest,

667
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,920
and then it keeps you balanced.

668
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,790
You know what I... mean?

669
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,950
Where are you from, anyway?

670
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,210
Bar Harbor, Maine.

671
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,980
What about you?

672
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,700
Akron, Ohio.

673
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,440
- Akron, Ohio!
- Yeah.

674
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,390
What's there to do in Akron, Ohio?

675
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,250
- There's an amusement park.
- Yeah?

676
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,630
Yeah.

677
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,640
Hello, Sarah. It's Jake.

678
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,080
A friend of mine got me thinking,

679
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,040
and I need to be honest with you.

680
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,420
I've known you all this time,

681
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,170
and I've never told you how I feel,

682
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,440
how I really feel about you.

683
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,540
I like you.

684
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,530
I've always liked you, Sarah,

685
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,280
and... and not just as a friend.
