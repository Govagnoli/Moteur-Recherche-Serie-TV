1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,100
Previously on Jake 2.0

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,420
I'm Jake Foley, tech support.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,490
I see you're still at the NSA.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,230
We have a problem.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,060
You see how the nanites have positioned

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,940
themselves along his
central nervous system.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,020
This guy can interface with technology.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,850
He's like a universal remote,

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,110
and every one of his
body functions is enhanced.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,810
I've just been authorized
to create a special ops team

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,040
with you at its core.

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,490
Drop your weapon and
hand over the pouch.

13
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,650
What?! No, no, no.

14
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,400
Oh, man.

15
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,950
You're not listening.

16
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,770
You've failed the simulator again.

17
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,310
I keep telling you, always
count your shots, Jake.

18
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,860
Twelve in the mag, one in the pipe.

19
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,900
I know, it's just... All right, look,

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,110
I messed up, okay?
But did you see that jump?

21
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,200
I mean, come on. It...

22
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,750
Yeah, yeah. I did; it was impressive,

23
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,700
but in the real world, you're dead.

24
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,040
What do they want?

25
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,020
We've got a guy with
a half billion dollars' worth

26
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,620
of nanotechnology inside of him.
They want results.

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,820
Oh, we're getting results, honestly.

28
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,820
Just look at what he can do. Here.

29
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,430
Okay, see this? It's what
I use to monitor Jake

30
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,650
and track his vitals and
stuff like that. Okay,

31
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,800
so... look here.

32
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,390
His breathing is normal for this level
of exertion. His heart rate's 103.

33
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,990
Now, here...

34
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,260
This is when he sees the rocket

35
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,190
grenade thing - whatever you call it - and

36
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,430
his adrenals are up 300% instantly.

37
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,420
That is the nanites
triggering his adrenal glands.

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,070
I mean, Jake's muscles are not
any different than yours or mine,

39
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,070
but you hit him with this
much adrenaline, and,

40
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,280
I mean, their performance
just increases tenfold,

41
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,530
and the same goes for
his sight and hearing.

42
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,590
I mean, the nanites simply enhance

43
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,340
all of his existing functions.

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,620
It's technology at its best. It's...

45
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,050
- it's beautiful.
- It's unpredictable.

46
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,820
Diane, he was dropped to his knees
by one of our metal detectors.

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,790
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm working on that, but

48
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,530
you have to understand that
the nanites are molecular computers,

49
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,140
which makes him susceptible
to the same kinds of things as,

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,640
well, your average desktop - I mean,

51
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,120
electromagnetic waves,
and power surges,

52
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,040
and viruses... the hacking...

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,380
... - well, technically - I mean,

54
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,260
the chances of that,
I think, are really low,

55
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,800
and-and I don't even know how
an outsider would even know that...

56
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay, okay. Kyle?

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,060
Yeah, he's strong; he's fast...

58
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,010
but I'm concerned about his instincts.

59
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,080
He has yet to beat the simulator room, and
he can barely bring himself to hit someone.

60
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm afraid that if we put him in the
field, he'll be a danger to himself

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,790
- and any other agent he's with.
- Enough, enough.

62
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,220
- All he needs is more time.
- He's had three weeks.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,310
- They're giving us one more.
- What?

64
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,220
Diane, they want to see a demonstration.

65
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,700
If we can't prove Jake's a viable
use for this technology,

66
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,420
they're going to shut us down.

67
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,350
You're going to shut down my program?

68
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,350
This is years' worth of research.

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,530
Well, they would continue to study
him in a controlled environment.

70
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,330
What - they're going to lock him up
in a room like a lab rat? Wh...

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,970
he's a human being.
They-they... they can't do that.

72
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,220
Oh, they can, and they will.

73
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,670
Oh, yeah, we're still having some
trouble with the cramping, and...

74
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,820
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.

75
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,370
Security Clearance: Low.

76
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,320
Very low.

77
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,440
Then one day, it all changed.

78
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Now, I can do things
I've never dreamed of.

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,780
I've been upgraded.

80
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,680
I have these powers.

81
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,110
Life just got real interesting.

82
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,120
"Sandstorm" in position.

83
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,180
Copy that, Sandstorm.

84
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,490
Look, we're still not able to get a
read on that inside heat signature.

85
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,890
- Please stand by.
- Standing by.

86
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,800
- What's going on?
- It's Al Juhuara -

87
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,700
a terrorist cell in Tunisia.

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,700
They've gotten their hands
on one of our EMPs.

89
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,620
Electromagnetic pulse bomb?

90
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,620
That's right.
We're going to get it back.

91
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,890
We only got a half an hour
of darkness left,

92
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,230
and coming home empty-handed
is not an option.

93
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,330
Request permission to proceed.

94
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,340
Well, that's not how I'd like to go in,
but it is your call, Sandstorm.

95
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,340
Don't worry yourself, Chief.

96
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,180
No worries here...

97
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,250
and just a reminder, you are authorized

98
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,870
- for flash and bang only.
- Copy that.

99
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,270
- Percussive grenades?
- Yeah. They want to stun the guards

100
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,590
- before storming the compound.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

101
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,990
Okay, boys,

102
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,120
let's go wake 'em up.

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Come in, Sandstorm.

104
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,970
Sandstorm, come in.

105
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,910
Sandstorm, do you copy?

106
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,950
Yeah, I copy. Sorry.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,990
Looks like I got a little
sand in my radio.

108
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,170
Well, I'll tell you what.

109
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,170
You bring it home,
and I'll clean it myself.

110
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,250
I'll take you up on that, chief.

111
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,310
We got the target in good hands.

112
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,310
Request permission to head home.

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,130
Good work.

114
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,670
How unbelievable.

115
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,550
Well, that's what real agents do.

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,330
"That's what real agents do, Jake."

117
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,020
"In the real world, you'd be dead, Jake."

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
Oh.

119
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,250
Hello?

120
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,500
Okay, I know you're going
to think I'm a total idiot,

121
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,520
but where is my "C:" Drive?

122
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,580
Uh, it's in your computer.

123
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,380
No. It isn't showing up.

124
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,570
Uh, oh-oh, um, hit control
function 8 all at the same time.

125
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,670
There it is. Jake, you're amazing.

126
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,400
I try.

127
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,180
I miss seeing you.

128
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,350
- You do?
- Yeah. Can I take you to lunch?

129
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,530
I'd love to catch up.

130
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,100
Um, okay.

131
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,770
- Are you free tomorrow?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,330
How 'bout, um, 1:00 at Mick's?

133
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,440
Yeah, okay, sure. That sounds fine.

134
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,170
All right, uh, I'll see you then. Bye.

135
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,440
- Hey.
- Hi. Uh...

136
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,140
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I-I just was on my way home,

137
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,160
uh... sort of.

138
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,300
I actually live on the other
side of the hill, but, uh...

139
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,220
I picked this up on the weekend.

140
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,110
- It's a desk lamp.
- That's...

141
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,110
really nice. Thanks.

142
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,880
Welcome.

143
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,270
Do you want to come inside?

144
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,970
Yeah.

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,760
This is going to look great...

146
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,170
well, when I have a desk.

147
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,010
Can I get you something to drink?

148
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,980
- Uh, yeah, just water is fine.
- Okay.

149
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,200
I haven't unpacked my glasses yet.

150
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,140
I've kind of been drinking
out of the faucet.

151
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,100
Oh, I'm good then.

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,220
You know what? I'm going
to find you one. Hold on.

153
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,630
I guess you can probably kiss the

154
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,430
security deposit good-bye, huh?

155
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,850
Yeah, I don't really know
my own strength anymore.

156
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,340
Well, you'll get used to it.

157
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,970
Yeah, I was thinking that,
this whole thing's really weird,

158
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,240
'cause-'cause I come home
from work one day,

159
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,310
and all my stuff's packed up in boxes,

160
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,330
and my roommate's been
transferred out of the country,

161
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,110
and then I'm forced to come live here,

162
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,250
'cause it's supposedly
a more secure location

163
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,200
above Luigi's Deli.

164
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,230
You smell that? I do.

165
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,440
Twenty-four hours a day.

166
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,960
Well, all things considered,
I think that you're

167
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,400
handling things pretty well, um...

168
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,000
Diane, you don't have to say that.

169
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
I saw the way you guys were looking
at me today, and it's pretty clear that,

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,500
uh, even if I wanted to be
an Agent my entire life,

171
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,260
I may just not be cut out for it.

172
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,230
Jake...

173
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,080
do you know what happens
if you don't make it?

174
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,740
What?

175
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,830
I don't get my Nobel Prize, and

176
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,700
I really want my Nobel Prize,
you know - I-I want

177
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,610
the-the fame, and I want the money, and

178
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,870
I really want the medal...
So this whole

179
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,090
"I don't think I can make it" thing -
I think you better lose it,

180
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,130
or I'm going to have to kick
your nanobot butt, okay?

181
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,520
What's the deal with the TV?

182
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,430
Oh, yeah, the TV. Well,

183
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,430
uh, the cable guy was
supposed to come by -

184
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,010
twice - but, uh, you
know how that goes.

185
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,950
You know that you could just...

186
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,710
fix it yourself.

187
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,930
Wouldn't that be illegal?

188
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,100
Uh, shouldn't it be illegal
for the cable guy to make

189
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,970
you wait around all day
and not show up?

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,430
Good point.

191
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,220
There you go.

192
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,910
You want to stick around
for a while, watch some TV?

193
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,710
Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,190
So is, is this the place where
you tell me my mission,

195
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,100
should I choose to accept it?

196
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,010
Right.

197
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,270
Armory access open.

198
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,660
Cool. Wow.

199
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,310
Ah, this is where we get our side arms.

200
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,330
It's where I get mine.

201
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,960
Right.

202
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,250
Well, I guess as long as we're
together, then, uh, I'm covered.

203
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,050
Vault Access Open.

204
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,880
What's in there?

205
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,810
It's the most secure
vault in the building:

206
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,960
Three feet of lead and steel, impenetrable
to any and all types of blasts.

207
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,040
Cool.

208
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,240
I just can't get over that Agent Wright.
I mean, the guy is awesome.

209
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,170
Hey, you ever think they'll
ever send me to Tunisia

210
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,420
or someplace like Tunisia,
someplace exotic?

211
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,410
Jake, this is the NSA.

212
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,510
We're the largest and most powerful
intelligence agency in the world.

213
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,380
There are 46,000 people working here,

214
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,330
all charged with the
awesome responsibility

215
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,060
of keeping this nation safe.

216
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,120
Not one of them, including myself,

217
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,170
is concerned with whether or not
you'll be sent someplace "exotic".

218
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,360
Right... no, of course.

219
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,860
Hey, so, Kyle, what are we doing here?

220
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,810
Is something going down, or...

221
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,390
Look around, Jake.
Tell me what you see.

222
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,840
Okay, uh...

223
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,560
I see, uh, mom pushing
a baby in her stroller...

224
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,990
some... businessmen,
probably on lunch break.

225
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,230
There's, uh, woman jogging -

226
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,040
she's kind of hot.

227
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,800
Not that it matters.

228
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,750
Does it? I don't know.

229
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,680
Let me tell you what I see.

230
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,450
Six people on cell phones.
Any of them could be ordering a hit.

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Three backpacks and a baby carriage,

232
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,360
each large enough to hold
enough C-4 to level a city block.

233
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,390
Right.

234
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,370
Now, as to the reason we're here.

235
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,400
The NSA intercepted a phone call.

236
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,500
An unidentified state
department official

237
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,420
is attempting to sell some information.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,280
That exchange is going down here.

239
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,370
We have two agents
covering the north end.

240
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,200
You and I will cover the south.

241
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,570
Okay.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,050
Jake, this may be our
only chance at this guy.

243
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,050
You understand?

244
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,600
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, sir.
Absolutely, I'm ready.

245
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,830
- Good.
- Let's go. Let's do this.

246
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,730
Oh, let's do this. Yeah. Take it.

247
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,810
So this is everything?

248
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,970
It's all there.
Nobody can know about this.

249
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,610
Of course not.

250
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,740
Kyle.

251
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,080
Kyle!

252
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Kyle... Kyle!

253
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,150
Kyle, I got him!

254
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,400
- Everybody down! Federal agent!
- Hey stop!

255
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,620
- Hand it over!
- What?

256
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,580
I'm with the NSA,
pal. I saw everything.

257
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,740
- Jake, what are you doing?
- I got him Kyle. I got him.

258
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,040
Jake, he's not even one of ours.

259
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,610
One of ours?

260
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,430
We're running a training operation, sir.

261
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,300
- It's a case of a mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity.

262
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,910
- We apologize.
- You're going to hear from my lawyers.

263
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,280
That's what you're going to hear from.

264
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,770
That's great. That's great.
You've managed to catch a hot dog

265
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,350
- vendor paying off his bookie.
- Well, it sounded like a drop, okay?

266
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,370
Jake, think. Now would
a real drop sound like one?

267
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,320
- Huh? Would it be that obvious?
- Maybe,

268
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,130
I don't know.
What do you want from me?

269
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,820
I want you to step up.
Okay? Dig deeper.

270
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,380
Jake, I want you to learn
to look beyond the obvious.

271
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,020
SandOps. This is Sandstorm.

272
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,990
We're headed home with the device.

273
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,610
Copy that.

274
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,900
There you go, sir.

275
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,500
Agent Wright, would you care
for anything else before we land?

276
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,060
No, thank you.

277
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,160
So sorry about that.

278
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,050
All right, let's go again.

279
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,340
You're pretty stressed.
I figure we should just take a break.

280
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,270
No, I'm fine. Let's go again.

281
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,850
Okay.

282
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,240
Go.

283
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,990
Come on. Let's do it.

284
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,080
Okay, just breathe.
Just take it easy.

285
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,040
Come on. No, damn it!

286
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,840
All right, you know, that's it.
That's enough.

287
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,340
- Why does it keep doing that?!
- Because interfacing wirelessly,

288
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,470
especially when the nanites are operating
at this many computations per second,

289
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,600
it's very taxing. They have to shut
themselves down to keep from overloading.

290
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,850
-Well, why don't you increase the threshold?
- Can't do that.

291
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,650
What do you mean you can't?

292
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,960
- It's new technology.
- Diane, I need help.

293
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,850
I don't know how.

294
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,860
This was Dr. Gage's project,
and I came in early on

295
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,460
as his post-doc but I just...
I don't know it like he does,

296
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,510
and I can't ask him because
he's kind of dead so

297
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,100
I'm the best that you got,
and I'm telling you, Jake,

298
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,820
I am doing everything that
I can to help you, but you just,

299
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,000
you can't rely on me to make this happen,
and you can't rely on the nanites.

300
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,350
Hey now, you don't understand.
I am messing up out there,

301
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,800
and the only reason I'm still here
is 'cause of the nanites.

302
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,150
You know what? You're an idiot.

303
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,780
Ow!

304
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,460
What, so are we done?

305
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,500
I guess we are.

306
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,570
You guys done here?

307
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,070
Yes.

308
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,810
Ow! Damn.

309
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,790
We've got something.

310
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,810
Are we going somewhere
cause I kind of have something.

311
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,240
At 1:00. Lunch with
Sarah Carter. I'll drive.

312
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,020
What do you know about Sarah?

313
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,790
She attended Georgetown University,

314
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,700
graduated in 1999 with you.

315
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,000
Currently the legislative director
for Senator Thompson.

316
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,840
You have a thing for her.

317
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,830
She trusts you.
That works in our favor.

318
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,560
What?

319
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,710
Your friend's been
investigating DoD funds

320
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,110
that were diverted to us for
the nanotechnology project.

321
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,310
That's highly classified.

322
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Your objective is to stop
her investigation.

323
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,630
- What's this?
- Your cover.

324
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
My cover.

325
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,250
You want me to lie to my friend?

326
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,020
I'll be listening.

327
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,470
Oh, thanks.

328
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Isn't this great?

329
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,980
Just the two of us.

330
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,350
Yeah, yeah. Just the two of us.

331
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,990
So how are things at work?

332
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,340
Oh yeah, same old same old. You know,

333
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,650
just trying to keep the nation's
computers up and running.

334
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,970
How about... how about you?

335
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,950
Are you-you still seeing that guy?

336
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,170
No. He was, um...

337
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,310
I don't know. I just didn't trust him.

338
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,170
How about you?

339
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,650
Oh, no. You can...
you can trust me.

340
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,180
No. No. I mean, are you seeing anyone?

341
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,410
Oh, oh. No. No.

342
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,220
I kind of feel like I'm being
consumed by my work.

343
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,450
That's this town, Jake.

344
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,030
That's what it does to you.

345
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,010
Do you remember when
the most important thing was

346
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,730
how to get beer on a Friday night?

347
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,520
- Jake, get on with it.
- Okay.

348
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,870
What?

349
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,040
Oh, I-I-I meant, um,

350
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,570
yeah, yeah. I remember
what that was like

351
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,140
back in college with the-the...

352
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,700
beer.

353
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,420
Oh,

354
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,510
I'm sorry. I have to get this.

355
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,930
Hello.

356
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,230
I told you I'd have
the stats by friday.

357
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,980
All right, look, you're not helping me.

358
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,420
I can do this, but you have
to get off my back.

359
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,160
Yeah, I know. I know. I am.

360
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,310
And just for the record,
all this training stuff -

361
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,190
you're not so good at it, okay?

362
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,110
Are you okay?

363
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,730
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?

364
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,480
You know when you're
working on a problem,

365
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,350
and you're kind of talking to yourself?

366
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,160
No. Uh, not really.

367
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,110
So what's the problem?

368
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,650
Actually, uh...

369
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,720
actually, it was something
I wanted to talk to you about.

370
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,320
Okay.

371
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,530
Um, well, I came...

372
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,370
I came across something at work,

373
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,880
and, um...

374
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,890
I think it has something to do with those
missing funds you were looking into.

375
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,690
- You did?
- Yeah.

376
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,620
The thing is,
it's actually kind of silly.

377
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,750
Well-well, the NSA wanted to
upgrade some computer systems,

378
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,810
but they didn't want the CIA
to find out about it,

379
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,790
because they-they want
the same thing, so...

380
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,730
they hid the funds.

381
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,730
I don't believe it.

382
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,920
Yeah. Really competitive over there.

383
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,440
No. I mean, I don't believe it, Jake.

384
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,240
They wouldn't come after me
over something like that.

385
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,500
That's a good point.

386
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,250
But, uh,

387
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,100
Sarah, you have to realize
that these computers -

388
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,090
they're really big

389
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,850
and expensive.

390
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,300
No, Jake. It's not true.

391
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,750
I know.

392
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,540
I have a source.

393
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,400
A source?

394
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,230
You sure it's someone
you can trust? 'Cause,

395
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,130
Sarah, the-the Intel that I have

396
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,890
is-is really supposed to be

397
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,850
really reliable.

398
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,100
Great story, Kyle.
Worked like a charm.

399
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,000
I think it did.

400
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,160
What?! Were you listening?

401
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,080
She's not going to quit.
She has a source.

402
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,210
She has a source.

403
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,030
Congratulations. You did good.

404
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,910
Hello.

405
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,210
SandStorm has been compromised.

406
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,030
- Where?
- National Park.

407
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,660
I'm on my way.

408
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,380
What do we know at this point.

409
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,460
At least five people
were killed in the crash.

410
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,950
Alright, listen up, people.
We suffered a terrible blast today.

411
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,580
Agents Wright, Tishler
and Garcia are dead.

412
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,090
We believe the person
responsible for this

413
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,150
took possession of an EMP
and parachuted from the plane.

414
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,750
I've notified the CIA and
the National Security Advisor.

415
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,910
This is a code red threat
to our nation's capital.

416
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,830
Let's get in front of it.

417
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,350
You want me to notify their families?

418
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,320
- No. I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

419
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,450
Hello, Gwen?

420
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,730
This is Lou Beckett.

421
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,750
I'm afraid I have some very
sad news about Nicholas.

422
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,390
It happened at 11:35...

423
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,230
They cut off his hand.

424
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah.

425
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,140
We got to get this guy.

426
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,820
The missing electromagnetic pulse bomb

427
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,610
is a class D portable,

428
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,840
similar to larger devices
we used in Iraq.

429
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,800
Now this one has a blast radius of

430
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,670
approximately two miles.

431
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,660
Any electronic device within
that perimeter will be disabled.

432
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,420
Now as you can imagine,
detonation almost anywhere

433
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,310
in the D.C. Area could be devastating.

434
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,960
Now, fortunately for us, we built it,

435
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,980
- so there are some fail-safes.
- Like what?

436
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,940
Well, first, there's an
encrypted warning beacon.

437
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,220
If he tries to arm it,
we'll get a signal.

438
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,410
Giving us how much time
to find it and shut it down?

439
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,120
Twenty minutes.

440
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,640
- What's the other fail-safe?
- Well, that one might not necessarily work

441
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,540
in our favor. In order to shut it down,
you need the right codes.

442
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,200
Enter the wrong code,
it accelerates the timer.

443
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,900
And there's no turning it off.

444
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,830
- Get the codes.
- Yes, sir.

445
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,580
Who are we looking for?

446
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,440
We picked up a security
cam image in airport in Tunis.

447
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,500
We believe it's Abdul Tiranzi,
Al Juhuara's chief weapons expert.

448
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,770
Tiranzi. Advanced Engineering Degrees.

449
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,510
Helped the Chinese design
their long-range missiles.

450
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,540
His mother's an American.

451
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,040
Why is he listed as
"possibly deceased?"

452
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,280
The Israelis have targeted
him several times,

453
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,240
but they've never confirmed his death.

454
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,060
They did get his brother last year.

455
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,110
- Was his brother Al Juhuara?
- No.

456
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,880
He was a professor in Gaza.
It was a mistake.

457
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,830
- What happened?
- Bad intel.

458
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,770
From us.

459
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,530
Great. So now he's really pissed.

460
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,710
I want Tiranzi's photo
out in the field.

461
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,080
Maybe we'll get lucky.

462
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,660
It's the warning beacon.
He just armed it.

463
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,270
Take whoever you need
and get out there.

464
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,810
Leland, Carvallo, Wallace - let's go.

465
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,140
He's turning South on 18th street.

466
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,720
Copy that.

467
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,340
Target's on the northeast
corner of 19th and M.

468
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,340
- You have 12 minutes.
- Got it.

469
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,900
- Has Alan got those codes?
- I need two more minutes.

470
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,350
We'll make it.

471
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,200
- Hey, are you doing okay?
- Yeah, fine.

472
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,780
Well, your blood
pressure's a little high.

473
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,250
Yeah, probably 'cause I'm standing
around here doing nothing.

474
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,110
- Well, you're still in training.
- I could be in training forever.

475
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,060
Kyle will never believe
I've got what it takes.

476
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,540
Jake, Kyle fought for you.

477
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,140
I mean, when this accident happened and
none of us knew what to do with you,

478
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,080
he's the one that wanted
to make you an agent.

479
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,630
He knew how badly you wanted this.

480
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,200
- He's moving.
- Where?

481
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,310
- South on 19th.
- We're on it.

482
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,050
He's making a left on Pennsylvania.
He's heading for the White House.

483
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,310
You can outflank him at 18th.

484
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,190
Copy that. Doing it now.

485
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,630
Come on.

486
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,880
Hey, on the ground now!
On the ground!

487
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,670
Dude, chill! It was just a stop sign!

488
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,320
Get down! Don't you move!

489
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,260
Watch him.

490
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,150
We got the case.

491
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,080
We have a problem.

492
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,100
There's no EMP;
it's just a transmitter.

493
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,310
He's replicating the warning beacon.

494
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,890
We got another one at
the pentagon. And congress.

495
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,930
Check them all out. Get every
available agent on it now.

496
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,260
Fifty feet right in front of you.

497
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,750
I'm on it.

498
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,780
What do you have?
Do you have anything?

499
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,340
No, just another transmitter.

500
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,480
Watch quadrant D.

501
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,470
Nothing. Just another transmitter.

502
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,800
Ortiz, where are you?

503
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,620
Yo, nothing here.

504
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,000
Another transmitter.

505
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,240
What? What's wrong?

506
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,720
This guy is drawing all our
available agents into the field.

507
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,080
- And...?
- And...

508
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,100
I-it, it's too obvious.

509
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,030
He wants all our attention out there.

510
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,370
He wants all of us out there. Why?

511
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,530
Because the target's not out there.

512
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,350
The target's here,
where we're most vulnerable.

513
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,230
He detonates that bomb inside the NSA,

514
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,470
we lose all our satellite links,
all our communications.

515
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,340
There's a worldwide security blackout.

516
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,880
Al Juhuara has free rein.

517
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,870
How would he ever get in here?

518
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,620
He knows exactly how.

519
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,980
Level five,

520
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,990
the mainframe...

521
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,460
Agent Wright admitted 1723 p.m.

522
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,670
He's here.

523
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,350
Call Kyle. Tell him what's going on,
and evacuate the building.

524
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,090
Jake! Oh...

525
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,760
Hello sir.

526
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,150
Mainframe Access. Open.

527
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,310
Please proceed to the nearest exit.

528
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,150
Going somewhere with that?

529
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,970
I guess not. I'll have days,

530
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,560
maybe weeks...
with nobody watching.

531
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,060
Your world will never be the same.

532
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,540
Don't tell me you're
the best they've got.

533
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,270
Mainframe Access Open.

534
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,400
Vault Access Open.

535
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,740
Hey, come on.
You've got to get out of here.

536
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,980
Freeze! Federal Agent!

537
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,350
You should always count your shots.

538
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,440
12 in the mag...

539
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,130
One in the pipe.

540
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,480
You are so lucky.

541
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,710
A slightly larger dose of that EMP,
I think would have put you out for good.

542
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,010
But as it is now, all we
need's a little reprogramming.

543
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,750
Thank you.

544
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,035
It's nothing. We can
take care of it tomorrow.

545
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:54,280
Uh, no.

546
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,620
I meant for believing in me...

547
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,160
and... putting up with me.

548
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,640
Well, we're in this together, right?

549
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,460
Right.

550
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,880
Lou wants to see you.

551
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,730
I lost three agents
to this operation, Jake.

552
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,900
Three very gifted agents.

553
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,510
Fortunately, I found one, too.

554
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,730
Congratulations, Agent Foley.

555
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,330
Thanks.

556
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,230
You did good.

557
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,650
So, how'd you know?

558
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,650
Looked beyond the obvious.

559
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,820
- Oh. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

560
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,220
- It's good.
- Yeah.

561
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,190
Oh, hey. Congratulations.

562
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,550
Thanks, thanks a lot. Thank you.

563
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,780
- Thank you.
- Oh, goodness, hi.

564
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,730
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

565
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,650
Thank you, thank you. Oh, thanks.

566
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,510
- Who is it?
- Cable guy.

567
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,890
Uh, just a second.
