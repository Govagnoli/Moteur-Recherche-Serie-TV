1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,930
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,880
until a freak accident
transformed him

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,170
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,340
Millions of microscopic computers

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,120
interface with his biochemistry

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,120
and make him stronger and faster,

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,020
able to see and hear farther
than normal men.

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,920
They give him the power

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,030
to control technology with his brain.

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,390
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,700
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,060
He is the ultimate human upgrade.

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,260
Could you please identify
yourself for the record?

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,190
Agent Jake Foley,

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,900
the human subject

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,900
with millions of tiny robots inside.

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,970
Did you see the way he stood up to us

18
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,610
This isn't about our
"field performance",

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,330
this is about you
finding a scapegoat.

20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,230
- You're out of line, son.
- that's a soldier.

21
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,130
- You like him.
- I hate and fear him,

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,760
but a man like that bent to your
will could accomplish anything.

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,910
I don't believe he's
bent to anyone's will.

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,970
You follow orders,
just like everyone else.

25
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,190
that's the problem.
One I intend to rectify.

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,020
All right. So who had
the chicken crisp?

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,830
That's me.

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,080
And Deputy Director Beckett?
What did you order?

29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,590
Vegetable soup. Green salad.
Brown rice.

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,130
Now we know how she keeps
her girlish figure.

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,850
Oh! Here's my pepperoni pizza

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,980
with anchovies and artichokes.

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,310
The two A's that make
a meal worth having.

34
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,580
Mmm. Dig in, guys.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,330
Mm-mmm.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,590
We're clear.

37
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,200
The "two A's that make
a meal worth having"?

38
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,770
I'm not a spy, okay?
You guys are the spies.

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
I thought this war was
with our enemies out there,

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,290
not our superiors in here.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,030
Well, get used to it.

42
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,850
There are factions upstairs who
don't want to see us succeed.

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,450
They're threatened by things
they can't control,

44
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,370
and they can't control you.

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,050
What?

46
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,840
Lou, Diane and I had a talk.

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,990
What, you're voting
me off the island?

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,810
No, but

49
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,260
we can have lives after this program.

50
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,000
We can move on.

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,180
You, on the other hand,
are the program.

52
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,210
If it shuts down, Jake...

53
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,660
What?

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,490
You going to put me in a cage five
miles underneath the rocky mountains?

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,120
Oh, god.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,300
I have a contact,
an identity specialist.

57
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,570
He creates new lives for people

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,410
and erases the old ones.

59
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,350
He operates outside normal channels.

60
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,180
Now, what he does is neither
legal nor cheap.

61
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,040
But he owes me.

62
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,880
Big time.

63
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,020
If you want it,

64
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,690
there's a way out of this war.

65
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,510
Three hundred year-old rivalries

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,810
have flared up again
in Kembu, Africa.

67
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,790
A radical paramilitary faction

68
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,780
lead by General Iniko Baako

69
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,860
has broken last year's cease fire

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,660
and is attempting to overthrow
the parliamentary democracy

71
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,840
established by King Namir,

72
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,440
the patriarch of the
royal family of Kembu.

73
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,220
Namir issued this statement
early this morning.

74
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,840
Kembu is a country that
is run by its people,

75
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,740
and we will stand our ground
before this tyrant Baako,

76
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,260
as we always have.

77
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,750
And our allies from around the world

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,660
will stand with us.

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,670
His allies are us and the French.

80
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,630
Well, I guess when it comes
to the bleeding, that means us.

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,030
As long as the oil fields
of Kembu produce, it does.

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,960
What's the king asking for?

83
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,700
Very little, but he's
worried about his son.

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,190
The prince.

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,790
There has been no comment yet
from Prince Malik of Kembu

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,990
who's in attendance
at a private university

87
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,200
in the Washington, D.C. Area.

88
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,170
The unrest in Kembu
raises the potential

89
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,760
for an assassination attempt
on American soil.

90
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,370
Mm-hmm. How credible are the threats?

91
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,940
Judging from General Baako's
bloody track record,

92
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,790
I'd say very.

93
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,850
He doesn't just kill his enemies,
he kills their families.

94
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,950
We're talking about putting our
own agents in the line of fire.

95
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,580
I see.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,720
What's Jake Foley up to?

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Hello, Jake.

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,800
Hey, uh, hello,
Executive Director Warner.

99
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,720
Please, call me Valerie.

100
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,330
I just ran into Warner in the hall.

101
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,240
She was pleasant.

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
- Now I'm really scared.
- You should be.

103
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,990
- She has an assignment for you.
- Yeah? What is it?

104
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,580
Protecting Prince
Malik Namir of Kembu

105
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,670
until the unrest in his
country subsides.

106
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,600
Bodyguarding a Prince.

107
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,490
Doesn't sound so bad.
What's the catch?

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,510
It's dangerous. You could end up
between the prince and a bullet.

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,090
And it's delicate.
If the prince gets hurt,

110
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,770
Warner blames us.
You get hurt...

111
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,400
- Warner blames us.
- You are a good candidate.

112
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,260
You're close to the Prince's age

113
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,520
and you are the ultimate human
surveillance system.

114
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,870
We'd have a team of agents
working with you.

115
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,190
Kyle would head a group here,
profiling VISAs,

116
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,440
looking for potential sleeper cells
working for General Baako.

117
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,060
So you wouldn't be alone
out there. Still,

118
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,210
have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
It's about all I've been doing.

120
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,730
And?

121
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,560
And...

122
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,600
I haven't made a decision
on that front yet.

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,570
So, in the meantime,

124
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,630
I guess I wouldn't mind hanging
out with this prince guy.

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,240
You sure?

126
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,970
Yeah, so, uh, where am I going?

127
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
To live in a castle somewhere?
It'd be kind of cool to see a moat.

128
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,420
- Watch out!
- Ow.

129
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,830
Are you all right?

130
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,050
Yeah, I'm fine.

131
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,050
No need to put that in the reports.

132
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,090
Hi.

133
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,400
Sorry. Can you throw it here?

134
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,100
Sorry!

135
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,470
Hey, you guys know where
I can find Malik?

136
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,470
- Upstairs on the right.
- Thank you.

137
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,780
Oh, your highness.

138
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,860
I'm Jake Foley.
I was assigned to protect you.

139
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
Uh,

140
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,210
I'm with the NSA.

141
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,070
Jambo?

142
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't believes he speaks swahili.

143
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,780
Actually, I grew up in Vermont.

144
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,100
- There's not a lot of call for it.
- Sorry.

145
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,300
- You're Jake?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm Malik.

147
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,630
You bow to me, call me your highness,
anything like that, you're fired.

148
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,850
This is Tracey.

149
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,260
I know what you're thinking.
"Isn't that a woman's name?"

150
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,070
No, no, I wasn't thinking that.

151
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,820
Smart man.

152
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,040
- It's nice to meet you both.
- Likewise.

153
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,770
- So, you're my bodyguard.
- Yeah.

154
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,770
Are they downsizing at the NSA?

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,470
Well, didn't you hear?
Scrawny's the new big.

156
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,380
All right, ground rules.

157
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,380
I don't like guards
cramping my style,

158
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,710
and I can't have some guy
following me around campus

159
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,530
because that's not suave.

160
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,500
So, you keep your distance,

161
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,240
nobody gets hurt.

162
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,360
Uh, I'm afraid you might.

163
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,090
I was assigned to protect you, so,

164
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,990
I'm sorry, but that's
what I'm going to do.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,890
- Hold on.
- It's cool, it's cool.

166
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,890
Is that so?

167
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,790
Pretty much.

168
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,790
You're not hanging with me, man.

169
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,860
- At least not in those clothes.
- What's wrong with these?

170
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,600
Nothing at all,

171
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,530
if you're going to a debate.

172
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,270
Come on.

173
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,550
Perfect.

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
You want me to wear that?

175
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,570
The crown prince of Tajir
didn't think it was so bad.

176
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,300
He wore it with pride.

177
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,530
Or I tell the NSA
you're not cooperating.

178
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,350
Can I borrow your cell?

179
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,790
All right. I'll be waiting.

180
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Take your time.

181
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,580
All right, I'm coming out,

182
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,660
but I look like some
kind of muppet reject.

183
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,340
Jake, Jake,

184
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,430
I have the Prince on
the northeast perimeter.

185
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,240
Where are you?

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
- Yeah, I'm on him.
- Okay.

187
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,090
Excuse me, Tracey.

188
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,650
I'll excuse you in five minutes,
but until then,

189
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,020
my word to Malik and
two C-notes in my pocket

190
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,820
is keeping me right here.

191
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,740
Tracey, I'm going to give
you three seconds to move.

192
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,470
Or what?

193
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,440
- Where is he?
- He's going past the science building.

194
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,990
How'd you do that?

195
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,460
'Cause I'm good at my job.

196
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,670
You are never to get into a vehicle

197
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,570
unless I check it first.

198
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,110
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,370
So, how much is my freedom
going to cost me?

200
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,880
You can't bribe me, Malik.

201
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,150
Well, that's disappointing.

202
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,590
Yeah, well, like it or not,
you're stuck with me.

203
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,980
Have it your way.

204
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,130
- Seat belt.
- What?

205
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,200
Whoa...!

206
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,370
My last bodyguard, Bobby Dean -

207
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,770
he took two to the head.

208
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,970
- You ever seen brain?
- No.

209
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,720
It's nasty.

210
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,970
It's nothing personal,
Jake, it's really not.

211
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,790
It's just that bodyguards,
they get hurt.

212
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,290
Then you got to bring flowers
to the hospital, the grave...

213
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,110
Aren't you worried
about getting a ticket?

214
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,150
Two words - diplomatic immunity.

215
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,660
- Yeah, how about dying?
- That'll come soon enough.

216
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,480
In the meantime, I'm going to enjoy
every moment to the fullest.

217
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,710
Would you watch out?!

218
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,660
What? It was yellow.

219
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,970
General Baako's army swept
through the northern cities

220
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,750
of Ujeme and Nyumba

221
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,610
in war-torn Kembu today.

222
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,810
King Namir responded
by deploying troops

223
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,810
to the country's rich oil fields,

224
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,670
and, according to
unconfirmed reports,

225
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,480
Baako now controls two

226
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,680
of the country's
four electric plants.

227
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,740
How does the news know
that before we do?

228
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,730
- Well, they said it was unconfirmed.
- Well, it's confirmed now.

229
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,850
Baako has two of the electric plants?

230
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,920
No. Three.

231
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,450
The king told us two hours ago
he controlled all four.

232
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,290
- Well, he's lying.
- Well, he's our ally. Why would he lie?

233
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,300
To appear stronger
than he is, and Diane...

234
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,730
What, this doesn't really concern me?

235
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,670
Well, you know what? Jake does,

236
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,470
and if you're going to
assign him to the field,

237
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,600
I think I have a right to know
what's going on... ma'am.

238
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,750
Well, that's part
of the problem, Diane.

239
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,540
We don't know what's going on.
We need better intel.

240
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,440
We have people in the capital.

241
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,210
Who do we have that's
close to the king?

242
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,120
Uh, Jake is.

243
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,330
Well, he's guarding
the king's only son.

244
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,680
- Hello.
- How's it going with the Prince?

245
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,530
I'd say on a scale of one to ten,

246
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,310
it's about a two.

247
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,500
- Jake...
- No, it's fine. What do you need?

248
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,100
I need you to find out what his
father is telling him about the war.

249
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,120
Kyle, this guy's not exactly
thrilled to have me around.

250
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,780
You want me to spy on him?

251
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,940
We're the National Security Agency.
It's kind of what we do.

252
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,650
Look for any e-mails or
other communications.

253
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,100
If the king's going
to be honest with anyone,

254
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,030
it'll be with his son and heir.

255
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,330
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Come on, come on, fellas.

256
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,330
You're all right, man,
you're all right.

257
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,420
Hey, you.

258
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,360
Hey. I was just, uh...

259
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,290
We need someone to fill in
for Little Mike. Can you ball?

260
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,680
I'm not exactly what the doctors
call coordinated.

261
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,890
Come on, Jake.

262
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,830
I mean, it's not like we going
to pass you the ball anyway.

263
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,510
Come on, man.

264
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,010
- Give me the ball.
- Come here.

265
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,870
Basically, you stay out of my way.

266
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,830
I'll take care of business,
all right?

267
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,460
Here we go! I'm ope... ah.

268
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,910
Sorry.

269
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,050
It's all right.

270
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,490
Jake!

271
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,980
Sorry.

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,790
I'm open!

273
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,490
Hey!

274
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,650
Ow. Hold on a second, guys.

275
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,560
- Sorry.
- Come here, Jake. Come here, man.

276
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,810
What did I say about
getting in my way?

277
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,670
- I'm doing my best.
- Are you?

278
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,310
Cause we're getting
blown out right now.

279
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,750
We're just wondering if Whitney
Houston and Kevin Costner

280
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,610
are going to toss it in or
keep playing. Come on, man

281
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,850
Shut your mouth, kid.
Sit this one out, Foley.

282
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,920
I can take care of it myself.

283
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,800
All right, all right.

284
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,670
Our ball.

285
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,510
Have you got a concussion,
or something?

286
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,640
Hey, you know when I said
I was doing my best?

287
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,440
I lied.

288
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,170
Whoo!

289
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,720
All right, Jake, okay.

290
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,420
All right.

291
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,890
Game point! Dish it off, Jake!

292
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm open!

293
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm open!

294
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,880
Ooh!

295
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,420
You just got schooled
by Kevin Costner.

296
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,260
That's what I'm talking about!

297
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,840
So, where'd you learn to play
like that, Foley?

298
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,960
Mean streets of Akron, Ohio. You?

299
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,200
The guarded royal compounds of Kembu.

300
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,200
Where I watched Michael Jordan,
game five at the forum,

301
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,980
win the bulls their first NBA finals.

302
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,960
Ah, you wanted to be like Mike.

303
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,540
No, no, just wanted him
to teach me how to play.

304
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,500
Dad flew him out for a week.

305
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,800
He showed me his crossover,
fadeaway, you know.

306
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,420
Yeah.

307
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,870
Yeah, I, uh, owned a pair
of Air Jordans once.

308
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,330
We may have more in common
than you think.

309
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,470
You're a good guy, Jake.

310
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,540
I don't say that often.

311
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,470
My father raised me to trust no one.

312
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,190
- What's he like?
- He's a good man.

313
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,000
Good as you can be
given his position.

314
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,680
He's done a lot of things
he's not proud of.

315
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,630
But people have been plotting against
my family for hundreds of years.

316
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,630
There's a legacy of bloodshed there.

317
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,670
Between you and me,

318
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,940
it's not something I want
to become a part of.

319
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,570
Who says you have to?

320
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,780
It's my destiny.

321
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,810
Can't change that.

322
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,260
I'm going to crash out.

323
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,260
You know what, Jake?

324
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,150
I'd visit you in the hospital.

325
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,680
But flowers - that's
where I draw the line.

326
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,490
All right, man,
I'll see you later.

327
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,090
Jake.

328
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,300
About the outfit.

329
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,640
Crown Prince of Tajir never wore
anything like this, did he?

330
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,140
No. But you can keep it.

331
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,340
Or burn it, or whatever.

332
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,260
Okay.

333
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,300
You know where I'll be.

334
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,720
All members of the royal family

335
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,710
must be eradicated to ensure

336
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,510
our complete success.

337
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,070
The prince is your primary target.

338
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,100
Jake. Jake.

339
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
Jake.

340
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,850
Jake.

341
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,270
Yeah, I'm here.

342
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,520
Jake, there's a breach
in dormitory security.

343
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,550
Someone just entered
through an emergency exit,

344
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,410
and they're headed your way.

345
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,250
Hands in the air!

346
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,460
Uh...

347
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,360
sorry.

348
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,890
Sorry.

349
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,110
Now I'm going to hand
Malik some utensils.

350
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,010
You're not going to try
and jump me, are you?

351
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,830
Well, if you try and assassinate him with
that spoon, you leave me little choice.

352
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,590
Tell me about yourself, Jake.

353
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,180
Do you know karate? Jujitsu? Kung-fu?

354
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,860
Uh, a little judo. Sixth grade.

355
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,580
So what exactly makes you qualified
to protect the Prince?

356
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,980
I mean, no offense, but
I could probably kick your ass.

357
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,490
Anna, he's cool.
Leave him alone, babe.

358
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,900
No, no. It's okay.
It's a valid question.

359
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,660
Um,

360
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,650
all I can really say is that
it's mostly up here.

361
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,320
Otherwise, it would kind of hard
to kill a man with your bare hands.

362
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,620
You killed a man
with your bare hands?

363
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,850
I don't know if that's the
truth or an ice cold bluff,

364
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,930
- but I'm feeling you, Foley.
- Fo'shizzle?

365
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,090
Okay. You don't need to do that.

366
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,170
Baby, I forgot to
invite Ryan tonight.

367
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,530
Hmm.

368
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,530
Don't worry. I'll see him in class.

369
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,000
- This party's going to be off the hook.
- For sure.

370
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Party?

371
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,960
It's Malik's 21st birthday.

372
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,590
Well, happy birthday, but I don't think
a party's such a good idea right now.

373
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,820
We're having a party. I don't
care what your bodyguard says.

374
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,550
Anna, he is looking out for me.

375
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,890
If he doesn't think it's a good idea,
then it's his call.

376
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,870
All right, but you stay
by my side at all times.

377
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,030
Deal. All right, baby.

378
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,460
- We got to run.
- All right.

379
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,420
It's nice to meet you.

380
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,860
Mm-hmm.

381
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,140
So Anna seems like
a pretty nice girl.

382
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,460
Once you get to know her.

383
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,670
She's really special.

384
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,430
It's going to be hard when
I have to break up with her.

385
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,230
What are you talking about?

386
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,140
Eventually, I have to go
back and marry someone

387
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,160
whose lineage is deemed
worthy of a queen.

388
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,160
You're in an arranged marriage?

389
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,840
Yeah. My cousin Shawanda.
She's 14 years old.

390
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,940
Weighs 350 pounds.

391
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,740
Cute face, though.

392
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay.

393
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm messing with you, man.

394
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
I can marry anyone I want.

395
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,480
As long as she's another
royal from Kembu.

396
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,650
All right, so you're choice...

397
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,190
- well, you don't really have a choice.
- Exactly.

398
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,650
Hey.

399
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,620
Good job with Malik's PDA,

400
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,450
but aside from his social activities
calendar for the next six months,

401
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,890
- there was nothing on it we could use.
- I see.

402
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,340
Jake, we're getting a lot of
pressure from above.

403
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,150
Kembu's our biggest
oil supplier in the region.

404
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,530
You're going to have to dig deeper.

405
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,710
I'll see what I can do.

406
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,620
Moving on to some familiar calculus,

407
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,410
who can tell me how we show that

408
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,380
p-zero-one and this
inner product define

409
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,890
inner product spaces?

410
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,850
Am I to believe that

411
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,750
after a week of going over this,
no one knows the answer?

412
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,690
- What are you doing?
- I so know this.

413
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,390
And a brave warrior raises
his hand in the distance.

414
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,710
- Your name?
- Alan.

415
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,170
Uh, Alan Hergott.

416
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,140
Are you in my class?

417
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,430
I'm, uh, auditing.

418
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,380
Even more impressive.

419
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,380
Proceed to dazzle us.

420
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
Well, since we don't
have an intuitive picture

421
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,590
of the p-zero-one vector,

422
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,610
we just need to integrate the product

423
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,720
of the two factors and
evaluate from zero to one.

424
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,670
That'll give us a real number.

425
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,770
Well, that would be
an excellent answer

426
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,740
if it wasn't entirely wrong.

427
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,000
Now, who would like
to correct Mr. Hergott?

428
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,940
Atone for his failure.

429
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,760
His mistake

430
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,410
is in the interpretation of
the inner product definition.

431
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,080
We're not interested in
the value of the integral,

432
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,700
but that it satisfies the four
properties of the definition.

433
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,060
We can apply the properties
of the Riemann integral,

434
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,020
beginning with the

435
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,710
symmetry condition, and...

436
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,750
there you go.

437
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,790
Similarly, three other conditions

438
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,120
can be proven through the properties
of the Riemann Integral.

439
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,770
Good work, Malik.

440
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,870
Now we can prove some results
from the property spaces.

441
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,740
Nice brick back there
in front of class.

442
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,310
Yeah, yeah. It's not like I majored
in computer science or anything.

443
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,240
So, what do we got next?

444
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,890
Early 19th century Eastern
European literature.

445
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,340
Great.

446
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,690
I was actually looking forward
to coming back to college.

447
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,200
Hey, babe.

448
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,260
Find anything interesting,
Agent Foley?

449
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,990
What are you talking about, Ann?

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,340
I just saw your bodyguard
hand off something to a woman

451
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,540
I can only assume
was another NSA Agent.

452
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,350
What was it?

453
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,790
I don't know what
you're talking about.

454
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,690
What was it?

455
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,180
Jake?

456
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,400
I can't tell you.

457
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,510
You... you're not protecting me.

458
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,510
You're spying on me.

459
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,110
- I told you he was bad news.
- Nothing personal, right?

460
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,810
You know, I was actually starting to
trust you. I should have known better.

461
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,600
Malik...

462
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,020
- Stay away from me, Foley.
- You know I can't do that.

463
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,740
- You're fired.
- What?

464
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,670
You heard me. Get out of here.

465
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,900
You can't fire me!

466
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,020
He fired me.

467
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,530
Anything from Jake?

468
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,630
King Namir sent the Prince
an e-mail yesterday.

469
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,040
And?

470
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,320
You tell me.

471
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,990
"The flowers have all faded...
blow if you will, autumn wind."

472
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,460
I didn't know the king was a poet.

473
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,200
He's not.

474
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,260
These are the last words
of Lord Usagi in Feudal Japan

475
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,260
just before he was beheaded.

476
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,600
I think the King is trying
to send his son a message.

477
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,860
That he's going to lose the war.

478
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,700
Or his life.

479
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,660
If the king is this vulnerable,

480
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,420
General Baako will make sure

481
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,410
there's no heir left
to assume the throne.

482
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,460
We've just red-flagged
three student visas.

483
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,100
Possible Baako sleepers.
Stream the pictures to Jake.

484
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,310
Make sure he stays
close to the prince.

485
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,360
Come on, Trace. Let me in.

486
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,600
Hey, the name's Tracey,
and you're not on the list.

487
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,870
Yes, I am on the list. I see my name.
It's right there.

488
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,300
That's right. It says, "Don't let
Jake Foley in." Now, get out of here.

489
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,770
- What's up?
- How ya doing?

490
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,520
- All right. Peace.
- Have fun.

491
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,920
Why are you still here?

492
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,040
Look, I can call the NSA and
shut this whole thing down.

493
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,700
Go for it.

494
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,390
Hello!

495
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,390
We've got some hits.
Potential sleepers.

496
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,330
I'm sending you their pictures now.

497
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,170
Don't lose sight of the prince.

498
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,680
Well, that's going to be kind
of difficult 'cause he fired me.

499
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,630
- He can't fire you.
- That's what I said.

500
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,910
Listen, Jake, you need to fix this.

501
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,300
- If the brass finds out...
- Hey, it was your stupid idea

502
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,340
to start spying on him
in the first place.

503
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,340
Just hold on. Let me look at these.

504
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,740
Kyle, I saw this guy.
He just went into the party.

505
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,450
I'm sending backup.
Get to the prince... now.

506
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,720
Yeah.

507
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,920
- Foley! It's not going to happen.
- Sorry, Tracey.

508
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,770
- For what?
- This!

509
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,510
Hey, hey, hey!

510
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,620
Excuse me, excuse me.

511
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,650
Pardon me, excuse me... sorry.

512
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,770
Pardon me... excuse me.

513
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,300
Malik!

514
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,870
What's up Daddy? Baby!
You're so good!

515
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah, so... I'm in
the middle of something.

516
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,750
Malik!

517
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,470
Aww...

518
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,760
Malik!

519
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,980
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

520
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,270
Yeah. All right. I understand.

521
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,720
All right.

522
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,720
Thanks.

523
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,440
And for the record... you're rehired.

524
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,900
I can't believe this.

525
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,930
It's okay, baby. Everything's
going to be all right.

526
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,330
We just received intel from Kembu.

527
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,420
- The war over?
- Yes.

528
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,730
The king is dead.

529
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,340
What is it?

530
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,080
Malik, your father's dead.

531
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,240
West perimeter. Got it covered.

532
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,440
Copy that.
Displace to rear parking lot.

533
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,340
I say again, rear parking lot.

534
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,050
- Stairwells?
- We're green.

535
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,050
- Now I want a man on every rooftop.
- Yeah.

536
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,130
King Namir's assassination
virtually assures

537
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,850
that General Inako Baako

538
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,850
will be Kembu's new ruler.

539
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,780
Now, the State Department
has not issued

540
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,940
an official response
to the rebel coup,

541
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,780
except to say that so far,

542
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,780
the situation remains fluid.

543
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,850
Can I get you anything?

544
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,510
I'm fine.

545
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,420
We got to go.

546
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,140
- Kyle...
- It's not open for discussion.

547
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,140
Lou needs to see you, now.

548
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,750
Don't go. We want you here.

549
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,880
I'm sorry.

550
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,410
Look, we're leaving an army here,

551
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,460
nothing's going to happen,
I promise.

552
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,500
Sorry about your father, Malik.

553
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,670
At which point I used the necessary
force to enter the dormitory

554
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,460
where I found the suspect armed and
directly threatening Prince Malik.

555
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
But you guys already know all this.
Why'd you bring me here?

556
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,070
Jake, your work was exemplary.

557
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
But you're not sending me back.

558
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,310
Well, who's protecting him?

559
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,740
The prince is going to have
to make his own arrangements.

560
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,190
We've been ordered to pull
our security detail.

561
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,040
That's straight from Director Warner.

562
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
He's as good as dead without us.
He needs us.

563
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,690
Tomorrow morning, the state department
is going to announce the commencement

564
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,550
of diplomatic talks with
Baako's new government.

565
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,180
We're changing sides.
Just like that.

566
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,660
Whatever happens, Jake,

567
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,550
you went in there as ordered,

568
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,490
you proved yourself,
you proved our unit.

569
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,980
It's a small victory, but we
have to take what we can get.

570
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,020
We promised to protect the prince.

571
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,120
Yes, we did.

572
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,800
Agent Foley.

573
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,860
I'm glad to see you're okay.

574
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,800
I'm glad you're glad.

575
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,720
Excellent work tonight.

576
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,720
Prince Malik won't be
so lucky the next time.

577
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,980
King Malik.
If he can rule a country,

578
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,800
he can procure his own bodyguards.

579
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,810
You didn't have to give
the order to abandon him.

580
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,700
Do you know something I don't?

581
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,490
This agency's job is to uphold
the nation's foreign policy.

582
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,600
Protecting the enemy of our new
ally contradicts that policy.

583
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,230
And you're fine with that?

584
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,260
I'm an instrument
of our country's will.

585
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,310
So is everyone in this building,
including you.

586
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,310
An instrument.

587
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,220
Word of advice?

588
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,180
Leave your politics at home.

589
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,400
- And my ethics?
- Not my call.

590
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,550
I barely know you.

591
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
Malik!

592
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,860
Malik?

593
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
There's nothing more
I can do. It's over.

594
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,660
Don't worry, man.
I'm not going to jump.

595
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,050
Even if I tried,
you'd probably save me.

596
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,560
Listen, uh...

597
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,770
I have some bad news.

598
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,440
The United States
has changed its mind.

599
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,360
Baako's your man now.

600
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,130
Hey...

601
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,330
just because we're not
offering you asylum

602
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,330
doesn't mean somebody else won't.

603
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,330
You see those lights over there?

604
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,910
That's embassy row.

605
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,970
Go over there any night of the week
and somebody's throwing a party.

606
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,100
Only tonight,
they all must be partying,

607
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,590
because not a single one of them
has returned my phone calls.

608
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,570
The South African ambassador said
he'd call you in the morning.

609
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,270
He's going to be busy.
He'll be in a meeting.

610
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,940
You don't know that.

611
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,940
Anna, I grew up watching this dance.

612
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,940
I know when it's over.

613
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,490
Thank you, Jake.

614
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,710
For what? I didn't do anything.

615
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,580
You did all you could.

616
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,650
It's my destiny.

617
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,290
People who run this place - Skerritt,

618
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,650
Warner - they don't even consider
Malik a human being anymore.

619
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,560
He's a loose end.

620
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,830
Yeah, well, that's how they
look at the world.

621
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,200
Not going to change.

622
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
You didn't think it would, did you?

623
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,390
Yeah.

624
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,480
Yeah, I guess I did.

625
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,570
Go figure.

626
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,760
I just, uh...

627
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,340
What?

628
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,340
I just think you need
to make peace with it,

629
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,320
because at the end of the day,

630
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,320
there's nothing you can do about it.

631
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,600
I don't know if I can
do this anymore, Diane.

632
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Jake, if, uh...

633
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,780
if you decide that this life
isn't for you, and...

634
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,620
if I come here tomorrow and
you're not here... I just...

635
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,960
I want you to know
that I would understand.

636
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,330
And I'd really, really miss you.

637
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,180
Are you sure you want to do this?

638
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,290
I just don't see any
other way around it.

639
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,940
So,

640
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,730
thanks for everything
you taught me.

641
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,980
Yeah, well...

642
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,660
I'm sorry it wasn't enough.

643
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,050
Mr. Wenk.

644
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,760
Oh, call me Earl. Everyone does.

645
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,620
Actually, everyone that does
ends up dead to the world.

646
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,650
So how do we do this?

647
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
We don't do anything.

648
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,560
You give me your car,

649
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,240
I.D., credit cards,
kiss them good-bye.

650
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,580
Couple of days from now, one of your
neighbors notices a horrible stench.

651
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,600
Cops break down the door,

652
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,270
find the decomposed remains of a man
your height, weight, color

653
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,020
in a tub of maggoty slime.
Apparent suicide.

654
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,810
I call that "the bowl of soup."

655
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,580
I could also blow you up in your car.

656
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,010
That one I call "The Erik Estrada."

657
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,320
Also known as "The Ponch."

658
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,790
- Where do you get the body?
- The morgue.

659
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,830
I only kill people on paper.

660
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,250
Anyway, while I'm out desecrating
the dearly departed,

661
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,940
you're on a train to sunny Jalisco
with a brand-new identity.

662
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,940
The identity, is it bulletproof?

663
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,780
Kevlar.

664
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,820
Let's get this straight.
This is a one-time deal.

665
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,300
A favor for your buddy Kyle.

666
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,440
After tonight, you're dead to me.

667
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,540
More importantly,
you're dead to the world.

668
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,380
You don't come back from this one.

669
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,320
Lou...

670
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,370
hey, I thought that
I would find Jake here...

671
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,520
maybe.

672
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,220
You won't.

673
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,410
Jake.

674
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,720
Hey. You're late

675
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,170
for your morning work-up.

676
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,090
Director Beckett, Agent Duarte,

677
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,240
something you need to see.

678
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,500
In another tragedy for
the royal family of Kembu,

679
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,220
Prince Malik, last remaining
heir to the throne,

680
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,080
was killed in a car bombing
early this morning.

681
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,130
Also killed, an unnamed
female companion.

682
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,210
Now, the deaths come only hours
after the state department

683
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,820
announced it's support
of the regime change.

684
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,600
Why don't we take a walk?

685
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,790
We're clear.

686
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,030
I know what you did.

687
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,070
You took The Prince and his girlfriend
to see Mr. Wenk, didn't you?

688
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,160
You do realize that was
a one-time only deal?

689
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,880
You gave Malik your
ticket to a new life.

690
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,760
He needed it more.

691
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,480
You have a good heart, Jake.

692
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,980
I'm not so sure about your timing.

693
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,890
The guy who was after
the prince gave her up.

694
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,060
Her real name is Ayana Karanga.

695
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,370
She's a part of General
Baako's radical group.

696
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,490
She was sent in a year ago
to get close to the Prince.

697
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,510
I sent her away with him.

698
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,220
I know.

699
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,820
And now she's going to kill him.

700
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,160
No, no, no, no, no.

701
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,090
You and I cannot be seen together.

702
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,980
Just tell us where Prince Malik is.

703
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,930
Never heard of him.

704
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,200
You know as well as I do,
once they're gone, they're gone.

705
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,600
Not this time.

706
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,640
The girl he's with
is trying to kill him.

707
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,830
- Not my problem.
- Earl,

708
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,230
listen to me very carefully.

709
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,520
You're not the only one who knows
how to make people disappear.

710
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,110
Fine. Fine.

711
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,660
But I'm never going
to help you again, ever.

712
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,620
Where are they?!

713
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,990
What's the matter?

714
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,640
Nothing. It's great, right?

715
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,630
We're finally out.

716
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,790
This is what you
always wanted, Malik.

717
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,920
So why do I feel like a coward?

718
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,910
You're not a coward.

719
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,840
I take it we're not
calling in for backup?

720
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,450
We're going to have
to handle this ourselves.

721
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,810
I love you.

722
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,750
I love you, too, babe.

723
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,910
They told me to get close to you,

724
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,610
but I got too close.

725
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,190
- What?
- I'm sorry.

726
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,630
Anna, stop!

727
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,950
Stop! Don't do this! Anna, stop!

728
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,860
Lay down!

729
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,820
Hey!

730
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,260
Don't move!

731
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,640
- Are you okay?
- Let her go! Let her go!

732
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,140
Let her go! She's trying
to kill herself!

733
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,970
She couldn't kill me,
so she tried to kill herself.

734
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,040
Let her go.

735
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,220
It's all right.

736
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,950
It's not all right. It's
never going to be all right!

737
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,390
It's been going on
for three hundred years!

738
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,300
Shh.

739
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,090
- We can escape.
- We can't escape it.

740
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,380
Jake! Are you all right?

741
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,100
It's okay. Come here.

742
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,580
She's right.

743
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,580
You can't escape it.

744
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,640
But you might be able to change it.

745
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,340
In world news,
Prince Malik of Kembu,

746
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,870
believed dead in a car
bombing earlier this week

747
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,140
has re-surfaced in his homeland.

748
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,520
Seen here in a videotape
broadcast throughout Africa,

749
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,580
the prince has married
a former Baako loyalist,

750
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,800
and has now marshaled
a coalition army

751
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,900
to retake his country.

752
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,950
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

753
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,710
Yes.

754
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,050
Did you know about this,
Agent Foley?

755
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,990
Yes, I did.

756
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,770
I heard about it on the radio.

757
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,710
It's an amazing story, isn't it?

758
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,470
Unbelievable.

759
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,190
That man may just have what it
takes to reclaim his throne.

760
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't doubt it.

761
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,630
The real question is
who are we going to back?

762
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,110
The winner, of course.

763
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,030
Good night, Jake.
