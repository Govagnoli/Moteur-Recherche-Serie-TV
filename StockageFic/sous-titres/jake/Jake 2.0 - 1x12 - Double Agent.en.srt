1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,020
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,840
until a freak accident transformed him

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,990
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,280
Millions of microscopic computers

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,130
interface with his biochemistry

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,220
to make him stronger and faster,

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,730
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,370
They give him the power to control
technology with his brain.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,310
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,050
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,170
He is the ultimate human upgrade.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,380
I thought this war was with our enemies
out there, not our superiors in here.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,130
Either the board is satisfied
with your explanations

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,070
or we terminate the program.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,780
They're threatened by things
they can't control,

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,520
and they can't control you.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,570
I don't know if I can do
this anymore, Diane.

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,310
I have a contact.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,310
He creates new lives for people
and erases the old ones.

20
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,520
I thought that I would find Jake here.

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,360
You won't.

22
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,430
Jake... you're back.

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,630
This is four-one-Baltimore,
who has visual on the subject...?

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,260
- I did, but I lost contact.
- Where?

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,090
Northeast quadrant.

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,990
Damn it, who has the subject in sight?

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,310
I got her. She's heading south,
toward the river.

28
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,580
Who's got her?
Who said that?

29
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,850
Me. Uh, Jake... Six-Two-Denver.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,970
Say your number first.

31
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,140
Jake, stay put, we're on our way.

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,840
Okay, she's... she's heading
toward a car. She's going to bolt.

33
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,710
- Jake, stay put.
- This is Beckett.

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,390
Dankova must not get away.
Use all necessary force.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,020
- Is that a shoot to kill?
- That is affirmative...

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,200
Lou, we need Dankova alive.

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,130
Hold the shoot to kill
unless it's the only resort.

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,860
Wait until we get there!

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,690
Don't let her get away, Jake.

40
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,800
- Don't do anything until...
- Oh, would you just shut up!

41
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,220
Ow.

42
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,720
Now, how could this happen?
How did he let Dankova get away?

43
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,290
"He" practically got tire marks
on his face from trying to prevent it.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,850
Is it so hard for you
to do what we tell you?

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,140
Yeah, when you're telling me
fifteen different things, yeah.

46
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,830
Put it up.

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,630
Yeah... no, the leg's fine.
Thanks for asking.

48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,960
- Why don't you try and be useful.
- All right, all right.

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,120
We had Elena Dankova in
our sights and we lost her.

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,990
This woman is a former KGB
operative who tried to sabotage

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,980
our Wilmington nuclear
facility in 1986.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,740
We narrowly avoided
our very own Chernobyl.

53
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,400
Now, Dankova is a true believer.

54
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,820
She went rogue the day
the Berlin wall came down.

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,810
As far as she's concerned,
the cold war never ended.

56
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,270
Let's see if we can track her down

57
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,270
and see if we can
hold on to her this time.

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,590
And don't be afraid to think
outside the box.

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,170
Hey, Lou... what do you think
about bringing in the agent

60
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,190
who was point man on
Dankova in the eighties?

61
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,340
Are you talking about Richard Fox?

62
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,390
Uh, yeah. He has a lot of
commendations.

63
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,770
Fox.

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,700
Big deal back in the day?

65
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,950
The biggest.
He single-handedly captured

66
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,850
Mikail "The Shark" Petrovitch.

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,850
That was the beginning
of the end of the KGB.

68
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,930
Retired in eighty-eight.

69
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,440
- Where's he living?
- Here in D.C.

70
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,680
File says he has two addresses.

71
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,540
Bring him in.

72
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,060
You're about to meet a legend.

73
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,540
Call me. I mean it.

74
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,330
If you don't, I will hunt
you down like a dog.

75
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,060
Bye, baby.

76
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,660
You got company.

77
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,470
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

78
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,020
Y'all lawyers or bill collectors?

79
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,480
NSA.

80
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,130
I'm Agent Duarte,
this is Agent Foley.

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,050
Sir, would you please put that away?

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,880
We were hoping we could talk
to you about Elena Dankova.

83
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,750
You are Richard Fox?

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,940
Call me Dick.

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,460
Anybody want a Fresca?

86
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,200
No, thanks.

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,160
Well...

88
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,570
Smoke bother you?

89
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,500
Uh... no.

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,500
Maybe...

91
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,310
You know, she always
was a real bastard.

92
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,380
You boys have got a problem, all right.

93
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,930
Well, that's why we came to see you.

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,320
What do you think
we should do, Mr. Fox?

95
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,640
Dick.

96
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,270
Well, first I think you should find her

97
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,000
and then kill her.

98
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,440
Good luck.

99
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,880
At the risk of sounding corny,

100
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,690
your country needs you.

101
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Oh, shucks, really?

102
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,930
I gave 'em thirty years of my life

103
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,790
and they gave me this nifty watch

104
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,560
and they need me now?

105
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,370
Tell you what I'll do -

106
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,510
$80,000 retainer, and I'm all yours.

107
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,350
I don't think we can do that.

108
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,060
I was just kidding. Make it fifty.

109
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,740
Actually Mr... Dick,

110
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,720
your NSA contract is pretty
specific on the matter:

111
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,090
You can be recalled to
active duty at any time.

112
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,140
Failure to comply
can result in arrest,

113
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,870
confinement and/or
cessation of pension.

114
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,120
I thought you were the smart one.

115
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,900
Me, too.

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,300
Well, I guess I better get
gussied up and get some clothes on.

117
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,800
But we do this, we do it my way.
Is that clear, boys?

118
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,680
You can take that up with the boss.

119
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,110
Oh, I will.

120
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,760
What's his name?

121
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,060
Deputy Director Louise Beckett.

122
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,520
Well, hot damn. Fill me in.

123
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,110
All right.

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,380
We suspect that Elena Dankova
slipped into the country four days ago.

125
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,770
Since that time, we've had sightings
of her in Cincinnati and Chicago.

126
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,530
We know for a fact that she
was here in D.C. Yesterday.

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,400
How so?

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,950
We had her in our sights
and we lost her.

129
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,950
Who was the pinhead
that let that happen?

130
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,790
Uh...

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,070
I would be that pinhead.

132
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,930
Oh, The Smart One.
Were you sober?

133
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah. Of course.

134
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,520
Well, that was your first mistake.

135
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,590
And were you doing everything
they were telling you to do?

136
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,590
I was trying.

137
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,590
Kid, you got a lot to learn.

138
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,510
Can we could move forward, please?

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,380
Copy that, sir.

140
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,380
Listen up -

141
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,610
Chicago, Cincinnati, D.C.-

142
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,270
Run these names: Nicolai Iskanov,

143
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,200
alias Nolotov;

144
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,530
Liam Petrov, A.K.A. Kovalev;

145
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,900
and Max Romanov,

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,170
alias Petrenko and/or Bulgakov.

147
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,380
My guess is Dankova's
has contacted sleepers

148
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,810
left behind after the collapse
of the soviet empire.

149
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,150
- Why?
- Well, to finish the job

150
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,170
that we stopped her from doing in '86.

151
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,680
Are you saying she's planning another
attack on a U.S. Nuclear Facility?

152
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm saying that if it looks,
sounds, feels radioactive,

153
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,260
I'd park my ass in front
of it with an M-16.

154
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,040
You never gave up, did you?

155
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,390
Cold war ends and
you're a relic overnight.

156
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,120
Betrayed by your own country.

157
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,340
I know how you feel, Lenochka,

158
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,840
but you shouldn't have set
foot on American soil.

159
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,880
Going to have to bring you down.

160
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,040
Bring you down hard, baby.

161
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,930
I think I have something.

162
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,840
There's a Max Petrenko,
living in Atlantic City...

163
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,490
well, he was living there. I don't see any
hits on him in the last couple of years,

164
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,440
but he has a line of credit

165
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,750
at something called "Rudolph's Red."

166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,220
- Is that a casino? I never heard of it.
- Russian mob joint.

167
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,990
It's off the boardwalk,
low-rent, high-rollers.

168
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,600
- You got a facial?
- I've got a passport picture.

169
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,460
That's our man - Romanov.

170
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,410
One of the soviet union's
top nuclear engineers.

171
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,660
I'll bet bucks to beans he's the key

172
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,370
to whatever Dankova's got up
her sleeve. Good work, son.

173
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,570
I've got a Nicolai
Nolotov in Cincinnati.

174
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,330
Okay, I want teams in the field.

175
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,060
One to Cincinnati to pick up
Nolotov, one to Chicago.

176
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,150
Smart boy and me here
will take Atlantic City,

177
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,020
if that's all right with you, boss.

178
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,340
- You want to partner with Jake?
- Yeah.

179
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,230
- Why?
- Best man for the job.

180
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,230
He let Dankova get away once.

181
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,050
I don't think he'll let
that happen again.

182
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,210
I want you checked out
by medical staff.

183
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Whatever you say, boss.

184
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,700
Get me Homeland Security.

185
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,720
Was there something else?

186
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,720
Sure got real pretty eyes.

187
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,700
Okay.

188
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,250
No, no, no. Not on my watch.

189
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,340
Oh, pretty and tough.

190
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,490
I'll be right back.
Just take your shirt off.

191
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,230
Okay, but I expect you to do likewise.

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,220
So, you and the doc there -
you got a little thing?

193
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,620
No, no, no. We're just colleagues.

194
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,970
What's that, a fancy
word for "friends"?

195
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,440
Yeah, I guess.

196
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,500
You kids nowadays.

197
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,620
You know a man and a woman
can't be just friends.

198
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,300
They got to be lovers or enemies.

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,470
Like you and Elena Dankova?

200
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,230
Well, sometimes,
it's a little of both.

201
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,590
And why is your shirt still on?

202
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,560
- Uh...
- And if you say, "why is yours?"

203
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,380
You'll stick a scalpel in me.

204
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,390
Yes, something like that. All right.

205
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,180
Look, I'm as fit as I'm going to be.

206
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,120
- Me and the kid here, we got work to do.
- Yeah.

207
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,590
Not until you get a full medical
work-up. See, I have orders.

208
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,430
Let me see that.

209
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,470
Yeah, well, you do everything

210
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,650
they tell you in this joint,
you'll go nuts.

211
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,080
No, no, no. But, you can't...

212
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,840
- Uh...
- Hey, Lou.

213
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,740
Is he ready yet?

214
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,610
- Uh...
- A hundred percent.

215
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,440
Let's get this show on the road.

216
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,360
Jake, this one's by the book.

217
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,210
All right.

218
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,810
Just wait till you see this.

219
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,320
You're not going to believe it.
That salesman never saw me coming.

220
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
Vintage Mach I. Only three thousand

221
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,610
of these babies left in the states.

222
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,110
Oh, sweet. They don't
make 'em like this anymore.

223
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,170
You just spent almost every penny

224
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,000
in our expense account on a car?!

225
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,600
What are we gonna
live on in Atlantic City?

226
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,320
What am I gonna tell Lou?!

227
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,140
You always wound this tight?

228
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,240
Kid, this car is the mission.

229
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,240
It's your ass on the line out there.

230
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,290
How you look, how you
feel, what you drive

231
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,870
can be the difference in coming
back alive or in a body bag.

232
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,140
The number-crunchers
back at headquarters,

233
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,170
they'll never understand
a thing like that.

234
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,640
You want to know
the secret to this job?

235
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,240
- Okay.
- Get in.

236
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,140
"Go with your gut."

237
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,930
At the end of the day, the only thing

238
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,080
that matters is that you
get the job done right.

239
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,780
Okay, kid, you ready
to have a little fun?

240
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah! Ha-ha!

241
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,180
Now, this is what going
undercover's all about.

242
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,820
Romanov has a big line of credit,

243
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,820
so I'm guessing he's a high roller.

244
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,690
Maybe we should...

245
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,780
What are you doing?

246
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,910
I'm ordering a pizza.
What does it look like I'm doing?

247
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,700
That's all the money we have left.

248
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,460
I'll play these three hands.

249
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,460
Four hundred on each and
an extra hundred for the dealer.

250
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,630
- Thank you, sir. Good luck.
- Dick!

251
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,960
If you want to look like a high
roller, you got to act like one.

252
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,980
Twenty-one.

253
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,400
- You won?
- All right. Double down here.

254
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,960
Yes, sir.

255
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,200
Are you just going
to stay here and gamble?

256
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,560
No, I'm going to stay here
and gamble and... drink.

257
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,790
Winner.

258
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,330
Cocktails.

259
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,350
Why don't you go look for some
big guys in expensive suits?

260
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,190
They would be the Russians.

261
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,910
Hey, honey, let me have a double scotch

262
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,900
and drinks all around, huh?

263
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,650
Hit me here.

264
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,290
All right. I'll stand.

265
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,760
Twenty-one.

266
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,650
Thanks, sweetheart.
I was getting thirsty.

267
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,190
There you go, darling.

268
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,940
- Thank you.
- Cutie.

269
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,840
Hey, see that poker table
on the other side of the room?

270
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,840
The guy at the end - Is he one of them?

271
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,810
Only one way to be sure.

272
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,880
This will be phonetic Russian, okay?

273
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,720
I want you to join the game.

274
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,110
Wait for him to make a bet,
and when he does,

275
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,800
say this to him. If he says "da,"

276
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,540
finish the hand.

277
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,490
We'll wait for him outside.

278
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,530
- Uh, maybe I should hold onto...
- I'm in.

279
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,790
Or not.

280
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,450
What do we have?

281
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,750
Liam Petrov. One of
the names Fox gave us.

282
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,260
A team in Chicago
just found him... dead.

283
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,970
Murdered in his own home.

284
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,930
Two bullets right through the eyes.

285
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,380
- Dankova's trademark.
- Nice lady.

286
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,960
My guess is whatever
Dankova has planned,

287
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,130
- Liam wasn't going along.
- Why would he?

288
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,990
A hundred and fifty K a year
making plumbing equipment,

289
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,950
four-bedroom house in the suburbs.

290
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,400
Capitalistic imperialism's
been very good to him.

291
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,080
It gets worse.
Nicolai Iskanov was working

292
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,380
at the hope creek nuclear
reactor under an alias.

293
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,580
He hasn't reported to work in a week.

294
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,210
Around the same time,
one hundred curies of cesium 137

295
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,410
disappeared from their waste depository.

296
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,230
- They're making a dirty bomb.
- Yeah, that'd be my guess.

297
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,130
I've notified FBI, CIA,
Homeland Security.

298
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,810
All right, make sure we're
sharing intel as it comes in.

299
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,070
Last thing we need is another
communication breakdown.

300
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,740
Set up around-the-clock feeds.

301
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,510
New York City and D.C.
Radiation sensors.

302
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,070
We're on it.

303
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,300
T'voya mahts vonyayet kak abyeziana.
(Your mother smells like a monkey.)

304
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,060
"Moya mahts vonyayet kak abyeziana."
(My mother smells like a monkey.)

305
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,760
Ya yevo oobyu. (I will kill him.)

306
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,650
You wouldn't think that skinny
kid could fight that good.

307
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,830
What do you say we get out
of here? Grab your money.

308
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,930
What?

309
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh...

310
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,160
Director Beckett, I've got Jake.

311
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,390
- Beckett.
- I need a shoot to kill order.

312
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,780
What?

313
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,200
Dick - your legend - spent all our money,

314
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,520
tried to have me beaten
to death by strangers,

315
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,980
and then ditched out on the
mission with a cocktail waitress.

316
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,740
- Why didn't you notify me earlier?
- That's a very good question.

317
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,790
Look, the Atlantic City field
office is tenth and park.

318
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,550
- Can you get there?
- Yes. What about Dick?

319
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,270
Sounds like he's got some issues.

320
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,240
At any rate, you're
both off the mission.

321
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,760
And Jake, I look forward to your report.

322
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,270
Yeah.

323
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,530
I've been looking all over
for you, son. Come on. Get in.

324
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,950
No.

325
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,190
Okay, so you're pissed. I get it.

326
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,760
Why don't we go somewhere, grab
a couple of beers and talk about it?

327
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,520
There's nothing to talk about.

328
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,430
We're off the mission.
It's over. Finito.

329
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,690
Sounds like you've been talking
to the suits back home.

330
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,440
Yeah, I was. And if I were you,

331
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,390
I'd turn around and leave me alone.

332
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,700
I can't do that, kid.

333
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,940
Get in.

334
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,410
I'm not too proud to beg.

335
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,840
All right, hand it over.

336
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,610
Come on. Give it to me.

337
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,670
Back in my days, these things
were the size of a thermos.

338
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,030
So damn heavy, they
practically gave you a hernia.

339
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,120
Roll down your window.

340
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,120
You're making a big mistake.

341
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,910
Yeah, I've been hearing
that all my life.

342
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,840
Still doesn't phase me.

343
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,300
Apologies for the note.

344
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,330
These Russians, they
got no sense of humor.

345
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,180
You tried to get me killed!

346
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,040
If I wanted you dead, I would have
been a little more creative than that.

347
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,810
I was just testing you
to see what you're made of.

348
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,500
You know, your life's in your
partner's hands in this game.

349
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,020
You handled yourself well.

350
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,990
Gee, thanks.

351
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,940
Maybe a little too well.

352
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,710
What do you want?

353
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,620
I want to know what you are.

354
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,930
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

355
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,590
What did those bastards
at the NSA do to you, kid?

356
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,370
You know, you and I may have
more in common than you think.

357
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,210
Way back when you were just a tickle

358
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,950
in your daddy's pouch,

359
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,110
the NSA had these programs.

360
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,460
Enhancement programs: Steroids,

361
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,380
G-H-B, H-G-H.

362
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,300
Those were just the training wheels.
They moved up from there.

363
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,010
And you were...

364
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,180
Quid pro quo. And I asked you first.

365
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,740
Look, I know it's hard.
They can really screw you up.

366
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,480
You don't know what
you can or can't say,

367
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,480
who to listen to, who to trust.

368
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,830
Sorry about the gun.
It was a little heavy handed,

369
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,250
but you wouldn't have gotten
back in the car otherwise.

370
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,650
They, uh,

371
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,350
they did do something.

372
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,450
I can't really get into specifics.

373
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,310
There was an accident...

374
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah, there's always an accident.

375
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,910
What was that?

376
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,630
What was what?

377
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,790
Is there someone in the trunk?

378
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,190
No. You kidding?

379
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,640
Dick, open it up.

380
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,650
Okay, Mr. Paranoid.
Here have a look.

381
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,620
Vsyo gatovah. Davai.
(Everything is ready. Come on.)

382
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,480
Throw your weapon out of the car,

383
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
then step out.

384
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,360
Arms in the air.

385
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,540
Lenochka, don't you trust me anymore?

386
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,890
I slept with you many times,
but I never trusted you.

387
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,430
That's no way to build
a lasting relationship.

388
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,380
Do you have it?

389
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,300
But of course.

390
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,950
Open it.

391
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,310
You know, I don't take rubles.

392
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,210
Who does anymore?

393
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,150
Who did ever?

394
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,590
It's been a pleasure.

395
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,330
Call me.

396
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,930
You are so lucky you
don't have a concussion.

397
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,310
You just have some lacerations and
some bruises that should heal in, like...

398
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,020
well, very soon.

399
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,310
I hear they got every
available agent out there

400
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,150
looking for Dick and that car.

401
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,530
Between you and me, I thought
that guy was kind of a nutcake.

402
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,160
Jake?

403
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,900
Diane,

404
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,240
before the nanite project,
were there any other

405
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,240
enhancement programs?

406
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,060
Um...

407
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,780
um, I mean, I'm not familiar with any,

408
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,280
but I would have to say
that there were, yeah.

409
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,200
I mean, the NSA has more research money

410
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,440
than any other intelligence agency
and they have a mandate

411
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,560
to stay ahead of the curve, so...

412
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,510
why?

413
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,910
Do you think they did
something to Dick?

414
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,860
Uh, it's just...

415
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,220
I'm not sure that guy really is crazy.

416
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,900
I have a feeling he knew exactly what
he was doing every step of the way.

417
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,550
Excuse me.

418
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,190
Lab.

419
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,190
Okay, yes, ma'am, right away.

420
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,570
Lou says there's something in SAT OPs
that we have to see right this instant.

421
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,190
Okay.

422
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,470
Dick?

423
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,210
My name is Richard.

424
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,190
And having armed guards
hovering over me like this

425
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,270
is not the way to treat someone who
bled for this agency for thirty years.

426
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,610
I've been in Finland for the past
month doing some consulting work.

427
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,680
I came as soon as I got your message.

428
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,570
Now how can I help you?

429
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,960
Uh...

430
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,770
Look, I don't know what kind
of mind game you're running,

431
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,930
but you've got some explaining to do.

432
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,850
Look, you called me.

433
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,950
I'm reporting to duty per the
activation clause in my contract.

434
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,640
And with all due respect,
I don't understand

435
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,270
how the NSA shared
critical mission information

436
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,020
without first verifying the
identity of an operative.

437
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,790
Wait. Hold on.

438
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,740
So I just spent thirty-six
hours with what?

439
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,680
A double? Decoy? Clone?

440
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,390
There's no such thing, Jake.

441
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,090
- You've been watching too many spy movies.
- Don't be too sure.

442
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,390
Does this mission have anything
to do with Ex-KGB Agents

443
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,280
from the former Soviet Union?

444
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,710
We don't share any information with
you until we find out who you are.

445
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,750
Well, then let me do the sharing then.

446
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,860
Classified archive
Delta-X-ray-Oscar Niner.

447
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,750
The Crimean Project.

448
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,220
A joint operation by the KGB/GRU set up

449
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,160
to collect biometric data

450
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,200
on American Intelligence assets.

451
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,120
The goal was to destabilize

452
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,030
our intelligence-gathering ability

453
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,150
by creating doubles of American agents

454
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,520
using plastic surgery, drugs,

455
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,050
advanced language
and cultural conditioning.

456
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,260
I was to be one of the targets.

457
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,790
So whoever's doing
this must have known

458
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,050
I'd be out of the country
before activating their plan.

459
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,450
Can't find the archive
in the computer, Dick.

460
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,440
You're not going to find the
Crimean Project on a computer.

461
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,180
It's on microfiche in the basement.

462
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,950
Code named "Double,"

463
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,880
classified and secured under
the 1982 National Security Act.

464
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,000
It's only accessible to
Deputy Directors and above.

465
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,850
And you may refer to me
as "Richard" or "Agent Fox."

466
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,410
Okay, Agent Fox.

467
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,630
Let's hope, for your sake, that I come
back from the basement with a file.

468
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,700
Keep your eyes on this man.

469
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,870
While I'm waiting,
I hope someone's here

470
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,870
to take my blood and fingerprints.

471
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,190
That'd be you, little lady?

472
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,600
I didn't know they let agents wear
their hair that long nowadays.

473
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,240
Yeah. I'm a regular old beatnik.

474
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,840
From the looks you're giving me,

475
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,840
that impostor must have
done quite a job on you.

476
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,110
You know, if you'd gone by the book,
none of this would've happened.

477
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,380
You know, I'm not ready to take
lessons from you just yet.

478
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Well, I'm not ready to give them.

479
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,500
It's all here. The Crimean Project.

480
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,390
Looks like the soviets
really were trying

481
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,290
to copy our agents
using plastic surgery.

482
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,540
- So he's legit?
- Apparently.

483
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,870
Now if his fingerprints
and blood match our files,

484
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,820
we're going to have to give
him the benefit of the doubt

485
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,380
- and debrief him on the mission.
- What about trusting him?

486
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,040
Absolutely not.

487
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,230
Good. Any word on the mustang?

488
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,590
Sat-ops is working with local law
enforcement up and down the seaboard.

489
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,020
We'll find him. In the meantime,

490
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,090
I want your eyes on Richard 24-7.

491
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,550
Yeah.

492
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,570
This is odd.

493
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,530
Yeah, but DNA does not lie.
This is Richard Fox.

494
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,030
And I looked at those
Crimean Project files.

495
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,980
Everything they were doing to duplicate

496
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,750
our agents is medically feasible.

497
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,490
I mean, it's dangerous
and nuts but it's doable.

498
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,870
Hey, you remember that cigar
that Dick left in your lab?

499
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,540
- Yeah, you want me to run DNA on it?
- Yeah.

500
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
Excuse me.

501
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,230
All right. Agent Fox has
been brought up to speed.

502
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,070
I want you to give him
your full cooperation.

503
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,990
And we don't have much time.

504
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,910
Look, I'm sorry you were duped, son.

505
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,990
But the soviet agent
that was impersonating me

506
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,090
was using you to find out
everything the NSA

507
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,990
knows about Dankova's plan.

508
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,510
And we're three steps behind them.

509
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,270
- We've got to level the playing field.
- Seems to me the best way of doing that

510
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,090
is by finding the impostor.

511
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,740
Why don't we take a look at the
security tapes from that casino.

512
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,250
Okay.

513
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,230
And you thought that was me?

514
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,210
Look at the way he carries himself.

515
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,760
Did you look at any of
the pictures in my file?

516
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,740
All right, stop frame right there.

517
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,470
- What do you see?
- Dick's flirting with the waitress.

518
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,540
Look closer.

519
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,100
I don't know, he's playing her.
He's making like a high roller.

520
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,580
He distracted you once;
don't let him distract you again.

521
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,920
Okay. Uh...

522
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,190
The girl?

523
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,880
Cute. Fair skin.
High cheekbones.

524
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,760
Strong chin, possibly...

525
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,450
slavic.

526
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,010
Hey, can you pull up
that photo of Romanov?

527
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,590
Okay.

528
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,390
Okay, now freeze on the
waitress and enhance.

529
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,640
Romanov's daughter?

530
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,120
Romanov took his own
life two years ago.

531
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,300
Couldn't hack it in
the new world order.

532
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,880
She was a student at
The Central Academy

533
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,990
for Advanced Physics in Voronezh.

534
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,970
When the wall fell she came
to Atlantic City with her father.

535
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,890
Why is she serving drinks at a casino?

536
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,850
Our country's full of highly-educated

537
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,830
immigrants doing menial jobs.

538
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,490
The point is, she has the know-how
to put that bomb together.

539
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,490
He walked out of there with her,

540
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,380
- put her in the trunk of his car...
- and delivered her to Dankova.

541
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,940
- Right under my nose.
- Clear the board!

542
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,750
All stations on alert,
we have a red ball.

543
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,660
This was on its way to a Moscow
TV station for broadcast tomorrow.

544
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,950
We intercepted it from
a private courier company.

545
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,810
At midnight last night,

546
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,060
we cut out the heart of our enemy.

547
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,300
After years of humiliation,
we stand proud,

548
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,870
defiant and soviet to the end.

549
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,560
This is a code six:

550
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,190
We believe these people plan
to detonate a dirty bomb in D.C.

551
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,830
tonight at midnight.
Exactly one hour from now.

552
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,080
Rewind. Kill the audio.

553
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,800
- You see something?
- Yeah. That.

554
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,850
Magnify frame 1,000 percent.

555
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,950
Shift focus to the window.

556
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,680
Can you enhance it further
and ID the plane?

557
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,060
Not without pixelation.
It's all we've got.

558
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,340
They may have shot this
in sight of the glide path

559
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,340
for Reagan, Dulles or BWI.

560
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,540
Get me Homeland Security.
I want choppers in the air

561
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,340
with radiac detectors now.

562
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,920
The rest of you, you have
exactly five minutes

563
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,600
to find the most likely
locations for this device.

564
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,880
Kyle, assemble the strike teams.

565
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,870
Lou, Agent Fox and I
made some progress.

566
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,050
I think finding his double's
the best way to stop this.

567
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,460
I don't. I want every available agent

568
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,760
trailing this device.
Is that understood?

569
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,470
What do you think?

570
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,360
I think we have our orders, son.

571
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Backup clip,

572
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,280
check, body armor plate, secure.

573
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,720
Strike team, this is Thunderbird.

574
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,650
We're less than ten from the target.

575
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,830
- Diane, hey.
- Jake,

576
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,640
I just got the preliminary
result on that DNA.

577
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,950
Okay. Thanks.

578
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,810
What was that?

579
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,170
Hang on to something.

580
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,240
Who broke formation?

581
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,410
What the hell are you doing?

582
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,140
You are jeopardizing this mission.

583
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
You turn that car back around.
That's an order.

584
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,050
Kyle, bring him into compliance

585
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,910
by any means necessary, now.

586
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Damn it, Jake, what are you doing?

587
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,950
I'll tell you what I'm not doing.
I'm not stopping this car.

588
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,990
This is a flagrant breach of protocol.

589
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,640
Kyle, you gonna have
to trust me or shoot me.

590
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,310
What are we doing here?

591
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,370
Mustang Mach I. That's him.

592
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,270
Lou, this is Kyle.

593
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,270
I think we found Agent Fox's impostor.

594
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,770
He's here. Son of a bitch.

595
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,890
- I'm going in.
- No, wait!

596
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,390
Jake.

597
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,110
Down! Hit the floor now.

598
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,110
Screw you and get out of my house.

599
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,080
You want me to shoot, I'll shoot.

600
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,790
Good call, kid.

601
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,910
Now I'm going to put an end to you
and everything you stand for.

602
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,640
No, you won't.

603
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,680
You know you can't execute
someone without an Order.

604
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,820
In your case, I think
I can make an exception.

605
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,010
Lima one, do we have a visual?

606
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,890
Negative on that, Thunderbird.

607
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,060
Proceed to southeast
and northwest corners.

608
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,900
Copy that.

609
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,260
SAT Ops, do you have
anything on the location?

610
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,080
No unusual activity
on the radiac sensors.

611
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,830
And thermal imaging shows
nothing moving inside the building.

612
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,680
Thunderbird, again. It's a negative.

613
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,220
We have the wrong location.

614
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,250
Reports are coming in
from the other teams.

615
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,990
Negative on Delta.

616
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,990
Negative on Sierra.

617
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,100
Negative on Bravo.

618
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,010
Kyle, did you find him?

619
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,780
Sort of.

620
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,400
- He may be our only chance.
- We're working on it.

621
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,540
What happened to him?

622
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,310
The NSA.

623
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,440
Thirty years of being pulled
every which direction.

624
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,670
God knows what else they did to him.

625
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,580
Split him in half.

626
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,120
Richard...

627
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,690
- I don't think you wanna do that.
- This man's an enemy agent.

628
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,450
Who can lead us to
Dankova and the bomb.

629
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,290
Kid makes a good point.

630
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,850
Shut up.

631
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,900
He screwed you once.
He'll screw you again.

632
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,020
That's why I need you, Richard.
To make sure that he doesn't.

633
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,100
I need you, Richard. And Dick.
I need you both.

634
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,410
All right, kid.

635
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,410
Now, let me tell you the plan.

636
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,640
What?

637
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,960
We have a location! Let's move out.

638
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,710
All right. Let's go!

639
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,030
It's ready.

640
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,540
Once we're clear the
blast area, we detonate.

641
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,760
SAT Ops just confirmed heat signatures

642
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,860
for five people inside the location.

643
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Stealth is crucial.

644
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,640
I want snipers first at the scene

645
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,450
and fully deployed before
the ground assault.

646
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,840
Repeat, stealth is crucial.

647
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,030
Open the door.

648
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,860
Pack up the van.

649
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,750
Weapons down! Now!

650
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,420
Now!

651
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,440
Stand back!

652
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,240
We're getting too
old for this, Lenochka.

653
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,070
Did they offer you more money?

654
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,900
Don't I wish.

655
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,250
Go ahead, knock yourself out.

656
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,540
Boom.

657
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,850
Anytime, Agent Foley.

658
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,790
Were you waiting till
the last possible moment?

659
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,810
She was working with you?

660
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,780
Well, I did promise Miss Romanov

661
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,760
a little something
if she helped us out.

662
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
It's all yours.

663
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,780
Very nice.

664
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,870
So's the hundred grand in the trunk.

665
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,560
Also, my phone number's
in the glove box.

666
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,690
It comes standard.

667
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,160
The whole time, he was
two steps ahead of us.

668
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,000
He tracked Romanov at the casino,

669
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,970
told her we needed
somebody on the inside.

670
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,180
Then he paid her to rig the
bomb so it wouldn't go off.

671
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,430
My office 0700 tomorrow morning.

672
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,250
Special commendation from
The Secretary of Defense.

673
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,280
It's not every day
you stop a dirty bomb.

674
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,470
We have a problem, Jake,

675
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,420
and something's going to have to give.

676
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,180
There are people upstairs who
don't like the way you do things,

677
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,840
and they would love nothing
morethan to shut us down.

678
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,410
Now I do everything in
my power to protect you,

679
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,350
but there's a limit to what I can do.

680
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,850
So at the very least, when I give
you an order, you follow it.

681
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,780
You don't question it.

682
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,780
Just like all my other agents
who work for me.

683
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,000
Are we clear?

684
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,080
Lou,

685
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,810
I respect you.

686
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,460
And believe me,

687
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,950
I appreciate everything
that you have done for me.

688
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,670
But I'm not like all your other agents.

689
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,850
I wake up every morning with
millions of nanites inside of me.

690
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,410
Now, if you want me
to follow every rule

691
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,360
and regulation to the letter,

692
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,360
then that's what I will try to do,

693
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,330
but if you ask me to do that,

694
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,910
then one day something
is going to give.

695
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,920
It'll be me.

696
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,750
Aston Martin V-12?

697
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,860
No, no, no. Way too small.
What did I tell you?

698
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,660
If you get a hundred thousand
dollar car for a mission,

699
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,770
it needs to be fast and comfortable.

700
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,550
That's my boy.

701
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,730
All right. Bentley Continental GT?

702
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,340
Please. That thing looks like a hearse.

703
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,340
Speaking of hearse.

704
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,730
By the way... thank you, son.

705
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,530
What else you got?

706
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,380
Oh, uh...

707
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Mercedes Benz SLR Coupe.

708
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,160
Oh, give me a break.
I can run faster than that heap.

709
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,120
Really?

710
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,230
How about another Fresca?
