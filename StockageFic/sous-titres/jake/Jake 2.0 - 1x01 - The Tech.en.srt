1
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,800
What do we got?

2
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,770
Doesn't look good.

3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,540
Damn things been frozen
since I booted up

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,790
this morning and the
floppy drive's jammed.

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,940
All right, let me take a look.

6
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,020
Okay.

7
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,650
All right, talk to me, baby.

8
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,240
So?

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,560
Well, it's a 20-minute job.

10
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,460
I'll have you up and running in two.

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,580
Take your time.
I'm due for a coffee break.

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,020
Yeah.

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
Notify NORAD.
Negative telemetry intercept

14
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,850
on the missile test
over the Sea of Japan.

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,870
Per FBI request, the Echelon watch list

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,910
is being updated with
the following list.

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,870
Ammonia nitrate, cyclonite

18
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,870
and the name Ivan Benikov.

19
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,660
Okay, listen up, everyone.

20
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,050
The CIA station in Kandahar
has been tracking Ivan Benikov,

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,050
a terrorist on our watch list.

22
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,690
Now, once we've confirmed
Benikov's I.D. with satellite visuals,

23
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,960
U.S. Centcom has an unmanned drone

24
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,200
standing by to launch a
hellfire missile right at him.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,710
This is so freaking cool.

26
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,780
Uh, can I help you?

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,750
Oh, yeah, uh, act-actually,
I'm-I'm helping you.

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,110
Uh, uh, I-I'm Jake Foley,

29
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,960
tech support.

30
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,600
I-I was just fixing this computer,

31
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,430
but I'm done. It's fixed.

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,360
No problem-o.

33
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,360
Great, Mr. Foley.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,490
Now I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

35
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh. I'll just leave this behind...

36
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,440
...just in case.

37
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,930
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,660
Come on, buddy,
we have talked about this.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,930
Trust me, you don't want
to be one of those jerks.

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,890
Darin, I would kill to be
one of those jerks.

41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,630
No, we're in the perfect position
because we're practically agents,

42
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,000
- but we're not props.
- What are props?

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah, props - "property of the state" -
guys who actually have clearance.

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,090
Those guys, they have no lives.
See, you and me, we can quit

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,100
anytime we want and go start
a band or open up a restaurant

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,410
or something because we still
have that kind of freedom.

47
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,990
Two tequila shots over here,
please? Thank you.

48
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,910
The minute you know
any kind of real secrets,

49
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,920
like stuff you probably wouldn't
want to know if you want

50
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,400
to go to sleep tonight anyway,
that's when they own you.

51
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,370
And they own you for life.

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,630
Darin, you're the only guy
I've ever met whose life goal

53
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,760
- is to keep his options open.
- Cheers.

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,650
Huh, God, I hate tequila.

55
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,920
Whoo! Dude, six o’clock.

56
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,750
- Pull out your NSA badge.
- Why?

57
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,850
Because chicks dig spies.

58
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,950
Yeah, but they don't dig geeks.

59
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,720
Voila.

60
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,140
Excuse me, ladies.

61
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm Agent Darin Metcalf.
This is Agent Jake Foley.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,890
- Hi.
- You guys work for the NSA?

63
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

64
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,520
That's so sexy.
Do you have a license to kill?

65
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,520
Only if you are really bad.

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,370
I like that. I like that.
That usually works.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
Yeah, that was really good.
Um, I'm going to go home.

68
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,210
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, hey, hey.

69
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,480
The spoils of victory do not always go
to those that give up easily, my friend.

70
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,050
Uh-huh, yeah. I'm going
to go ponder that thought

71
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,340
at home, and I'll see you later.

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,970
Hey, leave the door open because,

73
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,080
- uh, I don't have a key.
- Bye.

74
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,720
Hey, stranger.

75
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,480
- Sarah!
- It's been a while.

76
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,210
Yeah. I read about you in alumni notes.

77
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,690
You're working for Senator
Thompson. Congratulations.

78
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,670
Thank you.
I see you're still at the NSA.

79
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,540
Oh, don't tell me - this is your way
of picking up the ladies?

80
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,980
No, no. No, no, no. This... I, uh...

81
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,620
just got off work a little late and I

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,570
didn't even realize
that this was even on.

83
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,280
So what are you doing for Thompson?

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,010
Oh, right now I'm reviewing
department of defense budgets.

85
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,780
Several of the research divisions
have come in under budget.

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,680
I'm trying to figure out
where that money went.

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,530
What, you don't trust the government?

88
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,610
I don't trust my therapist, Jake.

89
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,490
Hey, listen up, what
would you think about...

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,650
- I don't know...
- Sarah!

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,180
... Maybe a...
- Oh.

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,810
Come on over.

93
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,610
Those are some of the most
powerful aides in town.

94
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,830
All they wanna do is
drink martinis and gossip.

95
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,650
- Do you want to join us?
- Oh... ye... um...

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,620
well, maybe next time.

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,930
- I'll see you around, then?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
Oh, Jake...

99
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,810
what, what are you doing
Saturday afternoon?

100
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,610
Saturday? No plans.

101
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,500
Wait. Uh... can I have one of these?

102
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,060
- Sure.
- Thanks.

103
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,100
Um, do you think you could come by
my place and check on my computer?

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,100
Something's not right.

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,060
Here's my number.

106
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,670
- Sure.
- Great. See ya.

107
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,870
See ya.

108
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,610
Okay, I know you don't smoke.
Who's the girl?

109
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,890
Oh, it's Sarah. I bumped
into her at the bar last night.

110
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Georgetown Sarah?

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
Lived-in-the-same-dorm-for-four-
years-and-never-asked-her-out Sarah?

112
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,480
That's the one. She wants me
to come by her place on Saturday.

113
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,690
That's awesome!

114
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,000
Why are you not the least
bit excited about this?

115
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,000
Because she wants me
to fix her computer.

116
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,740
It's a service call.

117
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,630
Define "service."

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm serious. This is your chance.

119
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,180
If you show up like a tech,
then that's all she's going to see.

120
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,570
I hate to break up the moment,
ladies, but we got a server off-line.

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,560
That means 'let's go'.

122
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,630
You know, not a lot of people
have been within these walls,

123
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,480
so consider yourself lucky.

124
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,830
- Foley.
- Yeah?

125
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,310
- Foley!
- Oh. Coming, coming.

126
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,700
Sorry.

127
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,690
Nobody reads programming code faster

128
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,440
than you. What am I looking at here?

129
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,390
Let me see.

130
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,870
Hey. You guys know you're off-line?

131
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,430
Don't worry about it. We'll have
you up and running in two minutes.

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,990
Oh, this is weird.

133
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,280
So it says here that they're uploading
all the lab's research into, uh...

134
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,370
What?

135
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,190
What?

136
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,850
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

137
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,050
Since you're obviously the
smarter one, I need you

138
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,030
to disengage the diagnostics
system so that tech services

139
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,250
doesn't send anyone
else up here. Do it.

140
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,180
Okay. All right.

141
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,040
We have a problem.

142
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,180
Jake Foley, tech support.

143
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,820
I'm done.

144
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,360
Nothing personal.

145
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,220
Drop it!

146
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,100
You okay?

147
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,610
120/80. Good.

148
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,750
That means that your
blood pressure is normal.

149
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,940
Uh... you okay?

150
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,080
Jake?

151
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,780
What?

152
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,020
Uhm. I just asked if you were okay,

153
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
which is an incredibly stupid question

154
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,910
when you consider that
you just saw that. Um,

155
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,980
can I get you anything?
Do you want some water

156
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,420
or some aspirin or...

157
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,370
valium?

158
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,690
- I'll be okay, thanks.
- Sure.

159
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,620
Dr. Hughes.

160
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,470
Excuse me.

161
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,790
- Yeah?
- What's the status here?

162
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,150
Well, everything seems to be fine
and Hazmat's got containment, so...

163
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,490
You worked with this
guy for three years.

164
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,530
- Did you have any idea?
- No.

165
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,100
No. Dr. Gage was a jerk.

166
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,800
I mean, this guy thinks equal opportunity
is something you put in your coffee.

167
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,910
But a traitor?

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,120
No. Never.

169
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,090
I want to know everywhere Dr. Gage
has been in the past few months -

170
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,140
every phone call, every e-mail...
everybody's he's

171
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,350
been screwing and everybody
who's been screwing him.

172
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,980
He was with us for ten years
so we know he didn't come cheap.

173
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,070
Is that the guy who
made the distress call?

174
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,360
Yeah, Jake Foley. He's tech support.

175
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,590
He's really shaken up
right now, though, so I...

176
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,930
- I want to see him.
- Of course.

177
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,700
Mr. Foley,

178
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm Deputy Director Louise Beckett.

179
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,240
I understand that you
made the distress call.

180
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,320
- Nice work.
- Thanks...

181
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,750
I-I... but I was just doing what
any good employee would do

182
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm a go-getter.

183
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,590
Yes, so I've been reading.

184
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,810
It says here that you
applied for intel training.

185
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,810
Yes. Twice.

186
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,770
You've served your agency
well today, and I would

187
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,770
like to take this opportunity...

188
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,760
... to reiterate your
confidentiality agreement.

189
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,850
Under no circumstances are you to
recount what happened here today

190
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,850
... to anyone

191
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,190
... ever.

192
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,740
Or what, you'll have to kill me?

193
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,670
Darin?

194
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,950
What?

195
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,340
Sarah.

196
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,070
- Jake.
- Hope you like vino.

197
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,540
Uh... of course.

198
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,810
- Yeah. Uh, come in.
- Okay.

199
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,620
Oh, wow. This is a great place.

200
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,540
Rumor has it Bill and Monica
had a couple of trysts here.

201
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,440
- Really?
- Yeah, I didn't buy it at first,

202
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,600
but it kind of has that vibe -
don't you think?

203
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,240
I feel it.

204
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,880
Oh, so here it is.

205
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
Ah, the offending piece of hardware.

206
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,030
In all its Pentium II outdated glory.

207
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,920
Do you want me to open this?

208
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's pop it.

209
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,220
"Let's pop it"?

210
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,160
Idiot.

211
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,120
We have a problem.
Jake Foley, tech support.

212
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,740
It sounds like you have a problem.
Take care of it.

213
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,950
... You have a problem...

214
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,770
I know this guy -

215
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,530
Eric Vaughn -

216
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,950
black market arms dealer
with ties to the IRA

217
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,820
operating out of Belfast.

218
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,090
Been on British CTU's
wanted list for a year now.

219
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,370
He was behind the research
theft for the SS-G-20,

220
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,440
their next-generation
laser-guided missile.

221
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,750
Well, our agents in Belfast
will have their hands full.

222
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,540
I'd like your permission
to head a team to track him.

223
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,350
- No, we've discussed this before, Kyle.
- I belong in the field.

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
- Your cover was compromised.
- Yeah, through no fault of my own.

225
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,880
- They never forget a face over there.
- Come on, it's been two years.

226
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,750
- Listen to me. Listen to me!
- I'm being wasted here.

227
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,750
I'll use my agents as I see fit.

228
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,300
You want to work for me, you work here.

229
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,160
Well, I can tell you already
you need a new mouse.

230
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,250
These days, it's all about the wireless.

231
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,080
- Really?
- Uh... oh. Thanks.

232
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,270
Hey, I was wondering:
Who are these guys?

233
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,300
This one's my dad.

234
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,890
Oh, yeah? Was he in, uh, Desert Storm?

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,110
Not technically. He went over

236
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,380
to test some classified weapons system.

237
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,450
Wow, that's really cool.

238
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,220
He never came back.

239
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,620
Oh.

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,610
The worst part is they won't even
tell my family what happened.

241
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,590
He's gone, and all they say is,

242
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,270
"that's classified."

243
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,560
Just makes me feel
so helpless, and I...

244
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,710
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,220
Here you are, coming and doing a favor,

246
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,300
and I'm dumping all
this baggage on you.

247
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,260
No, no - dump on me.

248
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,630
- Um...
- Yeah.

249
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,770
Look... well, it's...

250
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,670
it's like when we were in college, and

251
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,640
I'd come and fix your
computer all the time, and

252
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,480
you were always apologizing,

253
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,800
and, well...
You probably didn't know, but...

254
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,770
I-I-I didn't mind.

255
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,580
I liked helping you.

256
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,500
I like helping you.

257
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,400
Um... the-the-the thing is...

258
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,260
- Uh...
- What?

259
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,340
Uh, you should probably get that.

260
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,840
Uh.

261
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,420
Hello. Oh, hey.

262
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,270
How was last night? 4:00 A.M.?

263
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,070
So glad I didn't come.

264
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,130
Who was there?

265
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,680
He was there?

266
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,070
Oh, my god. You fixed it.

267
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,160
- How did you do that?
- Uh...

268
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
I, uh... I don't know.

269
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,970
Jake, you don't look so good.

270
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,910
I, uh... I think that, um,

271
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,720
24-hour flu is more like, um,

272
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,500
a 36, or maybe a 48.

273
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,200
Um...

274
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm sorry. I-I-I... I got to go.

275
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,900
Uh...

276
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,120
Whoa.

277
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,860
Over here, mister.

278
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,860
Yeah, here you go.

279
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,420
- Sorry.
- Hey, you all right, man?

280
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,370
- Sorry.
- God.

281
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,340
That guy's got some arm.

282
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,270
There're rumors going around

283
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,360
there were problems in your lab.
What's going on?

284
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,140
Oh, nothing, really, you know.
Some shelves collapsed

285
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,580
and some... some of my mice got out,

286
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,380
but, you know - no big deal.

287
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,960
Oh, let's go, let's go, let's go.

288
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,960
You mean, there wasn't any gunfire?

289
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,170
Gunfire?

290
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,020
You kidding me? Girl, you need
to stop watching so much TV.

291
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,530
- Jake.
- Hey.

292
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,610
Hi. Oh, uh...

293
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,340
- Diane.
- Yeah, right.

294
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,240
Yeah. What are you doing down here?

295
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,820
Oh, I just, uh, wanted to follow up

296
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,060
and make sure your
server's running okay,

297
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,880
'cause that's my job -

298
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,060
to, um, follow up.

299
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,250
Oh, thanks. Well, yeah,
the server's fine.

300
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,380
- Good.
- Who-whoa.

301
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,340
So is your arm.

302
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,170
Yeah. Yeah. I-I-I've got one of those

303
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,140
killer immune systems.

304
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,700
I got to go, uh,
so I'll see you around.

305
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,280
If you have any more problems
with the server, just give us a call.

306
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,730
Oh! Whoa!

307
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,940
Oh, my god.

308
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,140
Whoo-hoo!

309
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,330
What is with these double locks?

310
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,650
Please tell me that there was some
really rough sex going on here.

311
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,910
Darin, you are not going to believe...

312
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,100
You remember Casey.

313
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,040
Ah, Yeah. Hi.

314
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,200
Hey. I never pictured spies living

315
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,160
like really poor college students.

316
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,725
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's exactly our cover.

317
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,020
Right.

318
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,250
So... Agent Foley...

319
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,880
don't you have an op to go to?

320
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,880
Right.

321
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,560
Come on in, come on in. Let me
show you our debriefing room.

322
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
You wanted to see me.

323
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,370
Eric Vaughn is in the country.

324
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,300
What?

325
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,220
Probably the east coast.

326
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,220
Most likely D.C.

327
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,530
How do you know?

328
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,530
I called some former assets.

329
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,540
I think he's here because
he doesn't trust anybody else

330
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,730
to pick up whatever
he paid Gage to steal.

331
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
Gage failed.

332
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,040
We got him before he managed
to steal anything.

333
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,220
We got a problem.

334
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,880
Sarah, look, I am so sorry

335
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,940
for barging in like this,
but I have got to talk to you.

336
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,000
- Jake. What is it?
- This is going to sound insane,

337
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,590
- but there are these things and...
- You got to try this.

338
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,370
It's the guanciale,
makes all the difference.

339
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,200
Peter, this is Jake. Jake, Peter.

340
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

341
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,840
- So what were you saying?
- Oh, uh...

342
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,810
oh, it's nothing that
can't wait, actually.

343
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,810
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

344
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,400
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you, Jack.

345
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,300
Jake.

346
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,560
I am so bad with names. Dinner's ready.

347
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,170
Let's go

348
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,170
Sorry.

349
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,790
Oh. Thanks.

350
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,730
Not a problem.

351
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,480
If there's one thing I'm good
at doing, it's pushing buttons.

352
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,470
You didn't think that
was very funny, did you?

353
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,340
Uh... no, well, yeah, I did.

354
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,340
No, you're just being polite.

355
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,060
My humor doesn't translate here.

356
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,630
Back in Ireland they'd be dying by now.

357
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,590
I know. Sure.

358
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,180
Are you really, Jake?

359
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,430
I'm sorry, how'd you know my name?

360
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,660
Let's just say I have an interest in you.

361
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,370
Or rather what's inside of you.

362
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,950
Don't worry, Jake.
I wouldn't hurt you.

363
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,010
But my associate might.

364
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,920
- Hey!
- Use a tazer!

365
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,980
We got to him just in time.

366
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,240
It's remarkable.

367
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,920
You see how the nanites
have positioned themselves

368
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,900
along his central nervous system?

369
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,430
What they're doing is establishing
contact with the brain

370
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,750
via electrical impulses,
but eventually,

371
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,150
that link will be seamless.
I mean, whatever...

372
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,300
whatever he wants
them to do, they'll do.

373
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,360
So this is what Vaughn's after,

374
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,360
some kind of future soldier.

375
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,080
Exactly.

376
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,280
It began as a research program for DoD.

377
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,480
It was intended for soldiers in combat
to help repair damaged tissue.

378
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,040
But we realized pretty early on
that when you're dealing with

379
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,640
molecular-sized computers,
the possibilities are endless.

380
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,050
I mean, this guy can
interface with technology.

381
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,800
He's like a universal remote.

382
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,360
And every one of his body
functions is enhanced.

383
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,490
- Meaning what?
- Meaning that...

384
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,620
I can hear everything!

385
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,220
We're just going to run
a few more tests, Mr. Foley.

386
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,300
We're going to have you
out of here in no time.

387
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,220
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

388
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,710
How are we going to get
these things out of me?

389
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,700
Uh... well...

390
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,100
the nanites are fully integrated
into your system. They're...

391
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,000
they're part of you now.

392
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,870
They're not something we can

393
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,650
take out of you.

394
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,010
But I'm going to be fine,
right? I mean,

395
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,540
it's not like they're going
to hurt me or anything...

396
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,840
- ... right?
- There are side effects.

397
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,880
Like what?

398
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,550
Some of the lab mice
experienced muscle spasms...

399
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,740
blindness...

400
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
partial or full paralysis.

401
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,010
In rare cases, they rejected
the nanites and the results...

402
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,280
not good. But that
doesn't mean that any

403
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,830
of these things are going
to happen to you, all right?

404
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,750
What is going to happen to me?

405
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,620
Honestly, we just...

406
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,620
we don't know.

407
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,490
So how long are you going to hold him?

408
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,840
Mr. Foley is none of your concern, Kyle.

409
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,840
Did you even give him a choice?

410
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
Choice is a luxury. You know that.

411
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,410
I have the agency's
interests to consider.

412
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,510
Oh, the Agency's interests or your own?

413
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,610
You're out of line.

414
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,850
Look, it was an accident,

415
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,730
... and I'm sorry about that,

416
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,920
but I am not going to
pass up this opportunity.

417
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,140
- Opportunity?
- Yes, we don't know how long this guy's

418
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,900
going to live and we need to learn
what we can while we can.

419
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,100
Unbelievable. Lou,
this guy risks his life for us

420
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,530
and in exchange, we're going
to turn him into a lab rat?

421
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,660
I hope it's worth it.

422
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,120
You are a very brave
man flying international,

423
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,680
very brave. Between the security,
the background checks...

424
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,520
The metal detectors,
the national guard standing there

425
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,960
- with their semi-automatic weapons...
- Hello?

426
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,910
- Jake?
- Oh, Sarah.

427
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,770
I need to talk to you.

428
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,360
Well... now's not really the best time.

429
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,690
Jake, please. I'm really scared

430
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,760
and I have no one else to turn to.

431
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,480
You remember what I told you about
the budget discrepancies at the DoD?

432
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,230
- Yeah, yeah, unused funds or something?
- They weren't unused, Jake.

433
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,820
They were diverted... to the NSA.

434
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,360
- What?
- Yeah. Nobody knows what it's for,

435
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,820
and whoever does wants
to make sure I don't find out.

436
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,530
- Sarah...
- No, wait.

437
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,870
Maybe I'm being paranoid, but.

438
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,950
Remember when you
stopped by the other night?

439
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,630
Ms. Neilmeyer in 3-C saw
two weird guys in the lobby.

440
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,490
The next morning, the place
was completely trashed.

441
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,830
I mean, did you see anything?

442
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,540
No. No. No. Uh,

443
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,030
it was probably
just a couple of guys...

444
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,070
kids... pranks... it was a prank.

445
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,640
Look, maybe it sounds crazy, but

446
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,610
I think I'm being followed.

447
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,530
We've got visual.

448
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,130
Target is seated in the window,

449
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,330
speaking to a caucasian woman.

450
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,870
... It's like at any minute,
someone's going to come for me.

451
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,090
Sarah, listen to me,
I want you to get up,

452
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,520
- walk straight out of here and get in a cab
- So you believe me?

453
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,680
Sarah, please. Go back
to your office right now.

454
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,370
You're right. Right.

455
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,480
We never should've met here.

456
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,540
What was I thinking?

457
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,930
Oh, I'm sorry. My fault. You all right?

458
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,650
Yeah.

459
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,480
Sarah, you got to listen to me.

460
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,550
No, Jake, you listen to me.

461
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,940
Meet me at the Chemdyne
Research Facility,

462
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,830
midnight, alone,

463
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,030
or your friend is dead.

464
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,070
- Hello.
- Casey dumped me, man.

465
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,220
She thought it was too
dangerous dating a spy.

466
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,550
You're not a spy.

467
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,420
Rub it in, man. Rub it in.

468
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,650
Darin, can we talk about this later?

469
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,620
Uh, okay, whatever.

470
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,590
Hello? Darin...

471
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,500
Darin, I'm losing you, man.

472
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,350
Hello, Jake.

473
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,350
Chemdyne Research.

474
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,720
Kyle?

475
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,790
Now, just what the hell
do you think you're doing

476
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,700
at a cryogenics facility?

477
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,740
What? What?

478
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,770
Are you tracking me?

479
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,650
That's right. I'm sorry, Jake.
I need to bring you in.

480
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,570
Kyle, you can't.

481
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,570
Please, he's got my friend.

482
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,300
Who has your friend?

483
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,490
That Irish guy, the one
who was coming after me.

484
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,620
Jake, don't do anything.

485
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,790
I'll have a team there in ten minutes.

486
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,980
No, no, no! Kyle,

487
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,120
it's a trade. Me for her
or she's dead. I got to go.

488
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,450
Wait, wait! Jake, now
listen to me very carefully.

489
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,940
I'm tracking three figures
inside the building.

490
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,990
One of them is probably your friend.

491
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,160
- How do I get in?
- There's a stairwell

492
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,160
on the side of the building
leading to the roof.

493
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,090
Now, that's your best
chance of getting around

494
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,020
Vaughn's men at the front entrance.

495
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,020
Okay, okay. Thanks.

496
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,990
Jake? Jake!

497
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,730
Hold it!

498
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,060
uh-oh.

499
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,360
Sarah? Sarah? Sarah?

500
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,190
Amazing.

501
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,720
Millions of dollars in
research and development

502
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,760
and the best they can
come up with is you.

503
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,100
She'll be fine.

504
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,590
Just taking a little nap.

505
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,000
Where you're going is far more restful.

506
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,000
What you gonna do?

507
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,390
- Huh, freeze me in liquid nitrogen?
- No,

508
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,230
First I'm going to put a
bullet through your brain.

509
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,540
Then I'm going to freeze
you in liquid nitrogen.

510
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,810
What's the point of that?

511
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,860
Unfortunately, Jake,
you've reduced your worth

512
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,580
- to that of a carry-on case.
- Wait, no, no.

513
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,750
Listen. I can do some pretty
amazing things, right?

514
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,650
Don't you think people
would pay more money

515
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,620
if they could see it for themselves?

516
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,600
What are you suggesting, Jake?
A little bit of show and tell?

517
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,620
Yeah, yeah. I could do some jumping

518
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,610
and some cool strength stuff.

519
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,800
I can bend some... or- or

520
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,800
I have great vision.
I can see to, like, Texas.

521
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,720
And I can do stuff you
don't even know about.

522
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,720
I can interface with computers,
totally wireless. Incredible.

523
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,240
And how do we suggest
we demonstrate that?

524
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,130
Like that.

525
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,100
Go, go, go! Go on!

526
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,350
Sarah? Sarah?

527
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,350
He's dead, sir.

528
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,370
Sarah, are you okay?

529
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,810
Sarah?

530
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,870
We'll take care of her.
We've been ordered to bring you in.

531
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,530
Can I offer you a glass of water,
a cup of coffee?

532
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,070
Are you joking?

533
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,970
I have millions of these little things

534
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,510
running around in my body
that might kill me

535
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,060
at any moment.

536
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,550
I have spent the last couple
of days running for my life,

537
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,340
getting shot at because
of these little things

538
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,560
that might kill me at any moment.

539
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,520
So do I want a cup of coffee?
No, I don't want a cup of coffee.

540
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,700
You know what I want?
I want my life back.

541
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,980
I'm afraid we can't do that, Jake.

542
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah, yeah. Big surprise.

543
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,620
What I can do is upgrade
your security clearance,

544
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,440
effective immediately.

545
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,100
Ye...

546
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,020
what?

547
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,230
I've just been authorized
to create a special

548
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,740
ops team with you at its core.

549
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,160
Whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on.

550
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,410
I didn't ask for any of this, okay?

551
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,200
Yes, you did... twice.

552
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,570
This is your big chance.
Don't waste it.

553
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,870
Hey, bought you a gift.

554
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,690
Oh, thank you.

555
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
I guess you heard about what happened.

556
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,190
Yeah, Sarah, I am so sorry.

557
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,300
Sorry? Why? It wasn't your fault.

558
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,050
I was the one looking
into the missing money.

559
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,570
- What?
- That's why they came for me.

560
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,520
Obviously, I was getting
too close to something

561
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,340
the NSA doesn't want us to know about.

562
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,220
Sarah, maybe you should

563
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,190
consider just leaving that alone.

564
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,450
Look, I know you're trying to
protect me and I appreciate it,

565
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,550
but I can't let this go.

566
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,470
You know, you don't have to be a hero.

567
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,060
Oh, I know. There are no heroes, Jake.

568
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,040
Not anymore.

569
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,840
Right. Right.

570
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,180
Look, I just wanted you to know that...

571
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,480
Yeah?

572
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,540
Uh, that...

573
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,170
I'm here for you...

574
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,220
uh, in case you need me.

575
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,490
You're the best.

576
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,530
Thank you.

577
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,670
# Where do you go?

578
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,440
# Are you looking for answers

579
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,280
Um, okay.

580
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,380
# To questions under the stars?

581
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,180
# Well, if along the way

582
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,610
# You are grown weary

583
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,080
# You can rest with me

584
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,360
# Until a brighter day

585
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,460
# When you're okay

586
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,830
# I am no superman

587
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,680
# I have no answers for you

588
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,990
# I am no hero,

589
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,160
# ah, that's for sure

590
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,730
# but I do know one thing

591
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,270
# is where you are is where I belong.
