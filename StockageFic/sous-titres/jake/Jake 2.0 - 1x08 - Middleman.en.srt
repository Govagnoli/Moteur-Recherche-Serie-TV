1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,730
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,560
until a freak accident transformed him

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,560
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,500
Millions of microscopic
computers interface

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,380
with his biochemistry and
make him stronger and faster,

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,330
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,160
They give him the power to control
technology with his brain.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,060
Jake Foley - America's secret weapon.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,810
He takes on missions no
ordinary agent can perform.

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,780
He is the ultimate

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,640
human upgrade.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,730
I gave you a chance to do
this the easy way.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,860
Now, sooner or later, you're going
to tell me where that bomb is.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,510
I'm going to count to three. Three.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,260
Oh, you think you're tough?

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,160
Oh, you think you're a bad-ass?

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,990
Think again, pal.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,880
Remind me never to piss you off.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,080
It's time.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,240
- Already?
- Yep.

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,610
Ooh!

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,030
This is a very serious matter
concerning the personal safety

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,810
of all 46,000 NSA employees.

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,190
The workplace is not in home. There
are rules that govern your behavior...

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,920
Will you just take one and pass 'em?

26
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,820
Oh, but I collect seminar pamphlets.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,730
Each of us is entitled to a safe

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,610
and harmonious work environment.

29
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,710
But it is our - all of
our-responsibility

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
to maintain that balance.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,070
Now, if somebody is doing
something offensive,

32
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,800
you have to speak up.

33
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,310
Be sure to say no. If you smile
or act unsure of yourself...

34
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,290
Would you feel harassed
if I took this seat?

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,190
Oh, maybe a little.

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,210
We'd all like to be able
to joke about it,

37
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,190
pretend it isn't a big deal.

38
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,890
Please don't sue.

39
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,670
I doubt it's actionable.

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,670
I'm sure you all have places
that you would rather be,

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,570
but if you just give me your undivided
attention for half an hour,

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,580
I will try to make this
as painless as possible.

43
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,990
So, if you could please open your
pamphlets to section number one:

44
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,950
"Unwanted advances and
lascivious eye contact."

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,320
Now, as cited in Title VII,

46
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,490
the relevant section
civil rights act of 1964,

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,650
a "person" is defined as
one or more individuals...

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah, I'll be going for
the E6 field promotion.

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,070
Yeah, they can say California is theirs
all they want. It still belongs to us.

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,510
Satellite remote. No, honey.
The big gray one controls the tivo...

51
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,550
Yo quiero mas informaciones

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,880
acerca de la siete quinze
de diciembre. Me gusta mucho...

53
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,710
We've got a problem.

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,020
Echelon monitor over Europe's
detected a scrambled call.

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,480
- What are they using?
- I've never seen it before.

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,380
Some sort of crystal
logarithmic device.

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,790
- Initialize decryption.
- It's already running.

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,160
Record and process. We'll see if the
boys in crypto can make anything of it.

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,700
- Right away.
- What's the source?

60
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,230
A mobile phone.
Triangulating now...

61
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,770
Vienna, Austria.

62
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,630
# in untranslated Polish

63
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,420
I don't know...

64
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,820
I'm sort of in the
middle of something.

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm talking about 5 million.

66
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,040
- Hmmm.
- 5 million.

67
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,310
Is that American dollars?

68
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,100
Of course, American.

69
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,140
Give me day to tie up loose ends.

70
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,820
I'll be in DC on Monday.

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,110
Mr. Lowenstein...

72
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm afraid I have unfortunate news.

73
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,260
I'm not going to be able to do this
as thoroughly as I had hoped.

74
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,450
I'm deeply sorry...

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,240
about the rug.

76
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,610
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.

77
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,150
Security Clearance: Low.

78
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,850
Very low.

79
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,340
Then one day, it all changed.

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,450
Life just got real interesting.

81
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,740
So, want to catch a bite after work?

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,650
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

83
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,210
- Well, I'm off to catch the bad guys.
- Hmm, have fun.

84
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,910
Good weekend?

85
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,830
Yeah! Very good. You?

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,830
Oh, pretty uneventful.
I laid around on my couch,

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,160
watched a little football.
Well, a lot.

88
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,420
I don't know. I think I may
have watched all the football.

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,040
What-what'd you do?

90
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,040
Oh, I went out to Wolftrap
to see Alicia Keys.

91
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,090
- With who?
- Uh, well,

92
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,990
you haven't met Steve Clemens?

93
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,970
No, no, I haven't had the pleasure.

94
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,830
Oh, he's in cryptology. He's...

95
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,590
Eccentric? A little bizarre?

96
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,530
I was going to say, uh, "nice."

97
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,270
Hey, does he wear one of
those colanders on his head

98
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,120
to keep out the brainwave scanners?

99
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,860
I'm not making this stuff up.
Those code-breaker guys are weird.

100
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,030
Yeah, and do they exhibit
classic antisocial behavior

101
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,980
like never leaving their
couch all weekend?

102
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,800
Hey, Sarah, we're finally talking.

103
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,720
I know, just when I was
starting to develop

104
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,530
a relationship with your voice mail.

105
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,500
Yeah, you guys are
getting pretty close.

106
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,640
We are. He knows just when to beep.

107
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,400
Uh, a little predictable, though.

108
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,910
Yeah, I'm sorry. Things have been
crazy around here, but, uh...

109
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,120
I've wanted to talk to you.

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,080
Me, too. Uh...

111
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,780
look, I-I know it's short notice,

112
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,500
but my boss gave me his tickets

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,500
to the Saint Sebastian's
Fund-Raiser tomorrow night.

114
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,440
I know it sounds kinda lame...

115
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,580
No, no, you kidding?
I love the Saint...

116
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,350
Sebastian's fund-raiser.

117
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,580
- So, I'll meet you there, then?
- Okay, sure.

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,520
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

119
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,110
C'mon, I have a job
for you, Mr. Roboto.

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,930
"Mr. Roboto?" You're
dating yourself, Kyle.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,950
Sounds like a dying hippo.

122
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,570
It's actually a next-generation
encryption program.

123
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,310
So far, it's stymied any attempt
to unscramble with logic software.

124
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,300
It's kind of like a lock that changes
shape whenever you put a key in it.

125
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,260
We were hoping you could
interface with it, and...

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,700
- Ask it to be a little less difficult?
- Yeah, something like that.

127
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,620
I'll give it a shot.

128
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,320
Sorry, it's still gibberish.

129
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,340
No, it's not.

130
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,230
It's Polish.

131
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,060
Oh.

132
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,320
His name is Vasily Koronkiewicz.

133
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,920
According to the telephone
conversations we've intercepted,

134
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,200
it's highly probable
he's in the DC area.

135
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,660
This man is an efficient,
dangerous mercenary

136
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,530
who specializes in abduction.

137
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,480
He's been high on Interpol's
radar since the disappearance

138
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,340
of the Belgian consul last April.

139
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,290
Human trafficking. Nice guy.

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,130
Capturing Vasily is
our highest priority.

141
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,800
I want his 20 by the end of the day.

142
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,970
So? We gonna go shake
down some snitches?

143
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,110
Jake, please. I haven't
even finished my coffee.

144
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,400
- Transcription from linguistics.
- Thank you.

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,870
"Narodowy?"

146
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,790
There's no translation for this word.

147
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,550
Oh, uh, here. Let me.

148
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,380
Uh, National Bank of Poland.
There's a Branch on Florida Ave.

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,360
Hey, can you tap into
their security cameras?

150
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,100
I can if he tells me to.

151
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,910
Run Vasily's photo through
facial ID for the past 12 hours.

152
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,110
All right. What are we missing?
What haven't we thought of?

153
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,030
Well...

154
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
there's always LaFortunata.

155
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,680
What's LaFortunata?

156
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,980
Why don't you show him?

157
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,780
Speak only in short, terse phrases.

158
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,470
Under no circumstance are
you to engage, got it?

159
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,830
What is this? The dungeon
where you keep the Pig Boy?

160
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,810
Oh, oh, let me call you right back,
all right? I got some company.

161
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,050
I know. I know.
Will wonders ever start?

162
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,650
Okay. Okay. Keep your chin up.

163
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,340
- Seymour.
- Mr. Duarte!

164
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,870
Do I hear that clarion call?

165
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,850
Oh, my country needs me?

166
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,470
Just put that stuff anywhere.

167
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,410
Vasily Koronkiewicz.

168
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,070
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
He's a heavy, heavy hitter.

169
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,520
I was hoping some of your people
might know who put him up to bat.

170
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,470
Okay. Uh, yeah. Have a seat.

171
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,540
Let me make a few
hundred phone calls.

172
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,660
Uh, yeah, we're on kind
of a tight schedule,

173
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,430
Sy. Whatever you can do?

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,010
Thanks for your help.

175
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah, no need to front-load
the gratitude, boys.

176
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,170
I haven't worked my miracles yet.

177
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,390
Eastern European crime factions,

178
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,340
Asian triads, the guy on the corner
with a pop gun under his jacket.

179
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,140
Economic globalization has turned
it into one neat, big web,

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,380
but the spider feels
every little ripple.

181
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,980
Uh-huh.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,810
And... you're the spider?

183
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,530
I could write a book...

184
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,300
if I hadn't signed a foot of paper
promising that I wouldn't.

185
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,480
Between you and me,

186
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,460
I started anyway.

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,330
You must be Jake.

188
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,180
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Seymour LaFortunata.

189
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,510
Interpersonal liaising, as I'm sure

190
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,540
Mr. Duarte has informed you.

191
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,870
Apprehension of the unicorn
killer, Ted Kaczynski,

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,170
Mufari Allis-Khan...
ringing any bells?

193
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,480
You helped capture all those guys?

194
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,960
No, of course not,
don't be ridiculous.

195
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,790
Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

196
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,860
Kid's a little green, isn't he?
Little slow on the old uptake.

197
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,180
- You read my mind.
- You see? You see that?

198
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,000
You see that, Jake?
That, that is my magic.

199
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,060
I read people.

200
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,480
Gonna have to cut this short.
Facial ID's got a hit.

201
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,630
- Vasily was at the bank.
- Wow.

202
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,280
It was nice to meet you.
Really nice to...

203
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,910
You, too. You, too. Go get 'em.

204
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,880
Maybe this could refresh your memory.

205
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,830
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

206
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,890
Tell me, Mr. Harcourt,

207
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,660
would you prefer we wait until this
guy's already committed a crime?

208
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,360
You have reason to believe
that the immediate seizure

209
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,900
of the financial records in
question is necessary to prevent

210
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
the death of or serious bodily
injury to a human being?

211
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,160
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

212
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,460
Then pursuant to chapter 21a,

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,870
subchapter 1, Part A

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,150
of the unlawful acts
section 2000-Double-A,

215
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,100
you should have had no trouble

216
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,140
obtaining a subpoena duces tecum.

217
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,140
Do you have a subpoena for me?

218
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,070
I left it in the car.

219
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,680
You understand these are
extraordinary circumstances.

220
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,520
In the time it would take
for us to petition a judge,

221
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,500
very bad things could happen.

222
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,360
And none of us want that on our heads.

223
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,900
In the absence of a subpoena,
you can have the IRS issue

224
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,530
an administrative summons vis-a-vis
the bank secrecy act.

225
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,320
How about you just
blink once for yes?

226
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,580
Harcourt?

227
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,210
What?

228
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,390
If I were to open up
a checking account here,

229
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,030
what would I get,
like a free toaster?

230
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,380
We're done here.

231
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,700
Yes, we are.

232
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,390
Thanks for all your help.

233
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,040
I knew I brought you
along for a reason.

234
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,680
Vasily received a wire transfer

235
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,610
for $500,000 in cash.

236
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,340
Thanks to Jake, we have
a routing number.

237
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,150
So, we should be able to
track it back to the source,

238
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,810
figure out who hired him.

239
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,670
Well, why would a pro like Vasily risk
being paid in cash on American soil?

240
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,660
He needs the money
to complete the job.

241
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,630
I want to know who's
footing the bill.

242
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,480
I want to know what he's buying.
And most importantly,

243
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,940
- I want to know where he is.
- I'm on the routing number. I'm on it now.

244
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,120
I've got your number.

245
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,740
One routing number, seven hours,

246
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,980
153 dead ends.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,780
I feel like my eyes are bleeding.

248
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,630
I mean, actually bleeding.

249
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,780
Are my eyes bleeding?

250
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,300
Uh...

251
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
no.

252
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,390
All systems normal.
No complications with the nanites.

253
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,820
Aren't you even going to
do your penlight thing?

254
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,510
You don't need an exam, Jake.
You gust need to unplug.

255
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,590
Do something without computers

256
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,540
before you get permanent rasterburn.

257
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,800
Why don't you...

258
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,580
see a movie?

259
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,100
A movie? You mean one of those big,

260
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,300
bright things you sit and
stare at for two hours?

261
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,300
Oh, sorry. Bad suggestion.

262
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,350
Just do something with a human.

263
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,720
You want to come over
and play Boggle?

264
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,650
What? You're human.

265
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,970
Yeah. Um, I-I would like to, but I...

266
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,430
- Steve. Hi.
- Hey, Hughes.

267
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,310
Um, uh, Steve Clemens,

268
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,460
- this is Jake Foley. Jake...
- Hi.

269
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,730
How you doing, Foley?

270
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,150
Hi. Never better.

271
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,180
So, I'm thinking dinner at Maggie's.
What do you say?

272
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,180
- Mmm.
- White pizza.

273
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,910
- Freakishly white, still tangy.
- Mmm.

274
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,800
Uh, why don't you come, too, Foley?

275
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,560
I'll buy the first pitcher.

276
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,490
Oh, you know, I had
dinner last night.

277
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,650
And, uh, the whole novelty's
kind of worn thin.

278
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,110
- So, you sure?
- Yeah.

279
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, you guys go ahead.
Like I was telling Diane,

280
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,180
I just feel like crashing out.

281
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,010
Or working all night.

282
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,260
Hmm. Where are you hiding,
Mr. Vasily?

283
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,700
Oh, hey. Looks like I've got a match.

284
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,170
We've already got four teams
out chasing possibles.

285
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,150
Let's take this one.

286
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,010
Corner of 6th and F.

287
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,400
Do you even really need to sleep?

288
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,540
I mean, with those nanites and all.

289
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,590
No, Kyle. I just plug myself
into an electrical outlet

290
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,500
for a couple of minutes,
and I'm good to go for the day.

291
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,250
Hey, I'm just asking.

292
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,110
I have no idea what
it's like to have...

293
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,180
Kyle, I'm still human.

294
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,310
Okay. I understand.

295
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,170
So when you jog, do you
hear that slo-mo

296
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,170
running sound from the
six million dollar man?

297
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,180
The one that goes - do-do-do-do-do...

298
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,430
You're dating yourself again,
you know that.

299
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,060
Hello.

300
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,390
What do you think
he's got in the bag?

301
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,330
$500,000 worth of unmarked
nonsequential bills.

302
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,590
This is Agent Duarte.
We have target confirmation

303
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,810
on Sixth and F. Requesting backup.

304
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,310
He looks anxious.

305
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,320
Any sign of the mark?

306
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,000
No.

307
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,950
Damn.

308
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,850
Hey!

309
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,230
You all right?

310
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,040
- Yeah.
- Oh, god.

311
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,500
Oh.

312
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,620
Emergency, we have an agent down.

313
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,830
Repeat - we have an agent down.

314
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,120
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

315
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,990
- Miss, hold on a second!
- I'm Dr. Diane Hughes.

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,320
- I got to get to the med lab right away.
- I need to check your bag.

317
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,050
Here, keep it.

318
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,600
The nanites accelerated
hemostasis tenfold.

319
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,530
Fiberglass are already proliferated

320
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,260
in position for a collagen synthesis.

321
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,730
- That's amazing.
- So, what's it feel like?

322
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,860
Feels like a freak on parade.
It's not the circus, people.

323
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,570
You got a lot of guts, Jake.

324
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,060
But if it weren't for the nanites, I'd
be stuffing them back inside of you.

325
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,130
What's the situation?
Give me the bullet.

326
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,820
Mainly superficial damage.
Slashed through the primary derma.

327
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,890
Penetration was minimal.

328
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,810
No organs were punctured.

329
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,240
An inch deeper, though.

330
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,240
Can he get back to work?

331
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,070
If it's nothing too strenuous. He should
be as good as new in a day or two.

332
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,260
Glad to hear you're okay.

333
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,800
Thanks.

334
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,800
Sat Ops in 15.

335
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,800
- We need to run a full diagnostic.
- I did.

336
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,370
Careful. Platelets? BP?

337
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,590
- He checks out.
- I'm fine, Diane.

338
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,510
Jake, I am so sorry that I was not
here. It will never happen again.

339
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,320
Late night?

340
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,620
- Kind of, yeah.
- You and Steve?

341
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,710
Yeah.

342
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,780
We caught a midnight show of the
"Long Hot Summer" after dinner.

343
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,600
Huh.

344
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,170
What?

345
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,930
Nothing.

346
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,180
What?

347
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,770
Well, it's just, you guys are
moving kind of fast, aren't you?

348
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,160
Excuse me.

349
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,380
Lab. Steve, hi.

350
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,190
Maybe not.

351
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,220
You've got the accent way wrong.

352
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,910
Yeah. Orson Welles
was a lot more mumbly.

353
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,880
Guess I'm fine then.

354
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,880
It's not like I was
stabbed or anything.

355
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,000
More like a slash, really.

356
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,730
Kind of like a big paper cut.

357
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,210
No. The nose, the nose, the whole
fake... except for the knife.

358
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,410
prosthesis thing. No. It was so fake.

359
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,480
It was better than Nicole Kidman's
schnoze in 'The Hours'.

360
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,490
Are you kidding? No, no, no.

361
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,830
I'm not a Lee Remick man.
I'm a Joanne Woodward man.

362
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,890
Hi. Yeah.

363
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,600
Sweep teams covered
a four-block radius,

364
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,860
but no further sign of Vasily.
We lost him.

365
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,340
Yeah. I sure put the fear
of god into him.

366
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,370
You should have seen the blood
stain I left on his sleeve.

367
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,120
- That won't come out, you know.
- Any progress on the wire transfer?

368
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,060
We traced it to a
corporation in Warsaw,

369
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,350
but it's a shell within a shell. Jake?

370
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,470
Oh, yeah. I got it right here.

371
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,980
Okay, pay dirt on
Corporation Number 156.

372
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,690
Coming up as publicly held,

373
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,880
but the only name generated
is "Wladimir Sticj".

374
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,880
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

375
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,880
But I'm going to find out.

376
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,540
LaFortunata?

377
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,370
Yeah. LaFortunata.

378
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,630
Brave man.

379
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,860
It's hard work.

380
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,180
Novel approach, Jake.

381
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,140
I still hit the wall. Yeah.

382
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,110
Yeah, well, I will knock it down
for you, my friend, all right?

383
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,170
I admire your tenacity, Jake,

384
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,890
but, I... oh, but, hey, hey,
I would stick as close to home base

385
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,420
as you could if I were you. Last
guy who got his hands on Vasily -

386
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,420
Karl Devereaux at MI-5 - ooh.

387
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,520
Ooh. What? What about him?

388
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,010
Vasily cut off his hands, and sent
them to Karl's wife for Christmas...

389
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,160
along with a nice fruit cake.

390
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,960
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

391
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,960
Hey, you're-you're
the field agent, right?

392
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,940
Despite your lack of
a shoulder holster.

393
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,790
What's-what's up with that?
Anyway, Jake...

394
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,150
never mind. You know what?
None of my business. It's fine.

395
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,640
I'll find out soon enough
about your guy.

396
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,380
Keep your chin up.

397
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,620
Jake. Okay.

398
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,900
Hey, Sarah.

399
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,990
Jake, you made it.

400
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,120
Hey, you look... What's the word?

401
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,010
Fantabulous.

402
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,240
Thanks. So do you.

403
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,950
Uh...

404
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,620
So, um, what do you want to do first?

405
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,150
Well, uh, let's do the gambling thing?

406
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,630
I've got a little money
burning a hole in my...

407
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,220
Diane?

408
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,150
Hey. Hi.

409
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,370
- Hi.
- What a surprise.

410
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,980
Yeah. Hi, Sarah.

411
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,510
- Hi.
- Uh, this is Steve Clemens.

412
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,740
- He's my, um...
- He works with us.

413
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,350
And apparently has an uncanny
radar for where the fun is.

414
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,650
Steve went to St. Sebastian's.

415
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,750
So, um, he was, uh,

416
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,610
all city guard and-and-and
high honors, right?

417
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,610
I told you that in strict confidence.

418
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm using everything I can
to get her to like me.

419
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,330
Well...

420
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,770
So...

421
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,840
Anybody for basketball?

422
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,770
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

423
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,970
Steve's really good.

424
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,690
Thanks. I mean, yeah.

425
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,020
What? Do I have something in my teeth?

426
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,460
Oh, no, no, no. I just...

427
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,950
it's a little embarrassing. I...

428
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,000
when I first met you, I-I thought

429
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,360
there was, uh, something
between you and Jake.

430
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,770
Really? No. No.

431
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,640
We work together,

432
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,520
and you know how those things are.

433
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,490
Those worlds - they don't mix.
They collide.

434
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,440
Right. Business and...

435
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,660
Sorry. Sorry.

436
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,990
But, uh...

437
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,040
but you and Steve work together?

438
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,480
Yeah, but he's in
a different division.

439
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,850
And you and Jake are
in the same division.

440
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,630
Exactly.

441
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,850
So, uh, I.T. is in the same division

442
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,730
as, uh, medical research?

443
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
No. No, no.
That wouldn't make any sense.

444
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,100
Uh, did I say 'division'?

445
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,110
'Cause really in the NSA,
it's more like,

446
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,110
um, like-like 'wings'.

447
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,660
No, thanks.

448
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,770
Nice going.

449
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,300
Thanks.

450
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,280
Ooh, look what Steve won.

451
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,450
So you and Diane - pretty sudden.

452
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,060
I know. She's great, isn't she?

453
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,700
So, you guys are friends.
Has she said anything about me?

454
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,760
No, not really.

455
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,330
It's a winner!

456
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,630
Thanks. Steve,

457
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,370
you can't keep winning everything.
I don't have enough room on my bed.

458
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,240
You can make some room.

459
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,920
Hey, uh, test your strength, fellows?

460
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,410
- No, thanks.
- Come on. Sure. Sure.

461
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,950
Come on, Clemens.

462
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,130
I'm buying.

463
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,830
Here you go.

464
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,390
All right.

465
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,970
Now, there's a strong man.

466
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,870
Nice.

467
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,410
Okay.

468
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,410
Here goes nothing.

469
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,470
Oh!

470
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,800
Foley! You're a beast.

471
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,000
Uh... winner.

472
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,760
Are you all right?

473
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,650
Cheater.

474
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,510
Woo! Churros.

475
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
I'll treasure it always.

476
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,600
Um, so what do you want to do next?

477
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,030
Uh...

478
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,240
Is something wrong?

479
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,340
Uh, Sarah,

480
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,300
I have to go. I'll call you.

481
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,980
What?

482
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,100
Hey, Clemens, have you done
any field work?

483
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,790
- Just basic training. Why?
- You know what a code nine is?

484
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,270
- Yeah.
- Call it in right now. Code word, Vasily.

485
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,040
What's happ...?

486
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,400
No. No! What are you doing?

487
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,150
- I'm saving your ass.
- He's already down, man!

488
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,290
Yeah.

489
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,090
Okay.

490
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,320
Open it up.

491
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,430
Why don't you guys go get
yourselves some coffee?

492
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,960
I didn't think to bring you any.

493
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,690
It's a diuretic.

494
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,570
Yeah, that would be problematic

495
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,390
given the sparse modern
confines of your new home.

496
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,230
I've been in worse.

497
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,120
I'm glad you approve.

498
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,010
Since twice you've assaulted an agent

499
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,740
of the United States Government,

500
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,820
I doubt you'll be seeing
the outside world again

501
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,820
for another ten to
fifteen years minimum.

502
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,760
Oh, now that's got to bother you.

503
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,740
Must be really tough not having

504
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,740
any people around to kidnap, huh?

505
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,960
Foreign diplomats,
British Intelligence...

506
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,660
Are you going to torture me,

507
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,600
or are you just going
to talk me to death?

508
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,410
No. We don't torture
prisoners in this country,

509
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,790
no matter how much we might like to.

510
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,500
That's a shame.

511
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,820
I find pain to be
the most effective way

512
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,950
of getting what you want.

513
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,290
Is that why you tried
to hurt my friend, hmm?

514
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,980
To get something from him?

515
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,960
I cannot believe you tried
to take him down alone.

516
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,920
Thank god Steve had your back.

517
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,380
Yeah.

518
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,860
This is healing nicely.

519
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,480
You know he's getting a commendation.

520
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,920
We're going to go out
and celebrate tonight.

521
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,620
Even talk of making him
an active field agent.

522
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,410
Diane, they don't just make
anybody agents, okay?

523
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,000
Don't be jealous, Jake.

524
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,960
There's plenty of room
here for two heroes.

525
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,070
Yeah, and only one of us is
paying alimony. Go figure.

526
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,080
What are you talking about?

527
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,820
Steve's divorced.

528
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,270
Yes, I know. He told me.

529
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,860
They married right out of college,
and she ended up loving her job

530
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,960
a little... more than she loved him.

531
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,860
Did... he didn't tell you this.

532
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,660
Have you been checking up on him?

533
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,290
Oh, please. Come on,
like I don't have enough to do?

534
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,670
I'm analyzing money trails.
I'm pursuing...

535
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,750
dangerous... mercenaries,

536
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,430
uh... come on.

537
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,950
Okay, okay, maybe I took a little
peek into his personnel file.

538
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,460
Oh, I cannot believe you.

539
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,030
Me? Diane, me? Diane,

540
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,590
why is a crypto guy carrying
a gun to a carnival?

541
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,770
Oh, Jake, half the people
in this building carry guns.

542
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,450
Half the people
in this country carry guns.

543
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,610
- There's something wrong with him.
- Oh, no, there is something wrong with you.

544
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,790
You've lost the ability
to relate on a personal level.

545
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,990
Oh... that is not true.

546
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,710
Yes, it is. You don't even
leave your house all weekend.

547
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,430
You go out,
and you're completely awkward.

548
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,260
I saw how you were with Sarah.

549
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,320
Oh, god... I ran out on her.
I totally forgot.

550
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,430
Do you see?

551
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,370
What is going on?

552
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,810
All right, we kissed,
like, a week ago, okay,

553
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,920
and-and... I don't know.

554
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,580
Well, isn't that a good thing?

555
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,230
I mean, you-you've liked
this girl... forever.

556
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,960
Diane,

557
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,750
I have millions of microscopic
robots running around inside of me.

558
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,470
Please tell me what the next step in this
relationship is, because I have no clue.

559
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,500
I mean, the best I can hope for
is that I don't lie to her,

560
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
because she can never
know the real me.

561
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,350
Nobody can ever know the real me.

562
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,340
Nobody except you.

563
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,890
Jake...

564
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,850
I'm here for you.

565
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm not going anywhere...

566
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,290
but you got to stop cutting
yourself off from everybody else.

567
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,880
There is life outside this building.

568
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,000
- Anything?
- Nothing.

569
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,370
I'll keep at it, but I don't
think he'll give up his bosses.

570
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,700
- No good for the rep.
- Lafortunata called.

571
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,660
- He says he wants to talk.
- Yeah, and talk, and talk...

572
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,060
- I'm on it.
- I'll go with you.

573
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,770
Bless you.

574
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,120
- Hey.
- Hi.

575
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,020
Sarah, I-I am so sorry
about last night.

576
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,340
- It was work. This thing came up...
- Jake stop.

577
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,940
I get it.

578
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,890
You do?

579
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,430
Look, we kissed...

580
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,360
and it was nice.

581
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,660
Yeah, yes, it was.

582
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,220
I don't think either of us expected
there would be something there,

583
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,980
but there was. I felt it,

584
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,150
and I thought you felt it, too...

585
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,640
but you don't have to keep
coming up with these stories

586
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,730
to cover the fact that you're...

587
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,800
hesitant.

588
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,220
I'm not. I'm not. It's...

589
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,820
I don't want to wreck this.

590
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,690
I don't either.

591
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,390
But I need to know
how you feel, Jake.

592
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,830
I need you to be completely
honest with me.

593
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,750
You want me to be honest?

594
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,060
Totally.

595
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,600
Vladimir Sticj.

596
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,800
Your boy Jake put me onto him.

597
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,800
Not of any prominence,
really. He, uh...

598
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,760
tended bar at the beer
hall putsch in 1923,

599
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,080
spent the last 40 years
buried in a less

600
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
than ornate grave at
the Bierkel cemetery.

601
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,020
- I don't follow.
- Just wait for it.

602
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,610
Now, technically, this guy
is the sole shareholder

603
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,540
of the same corporation
that hired Vasily.

604
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,080
One of my fraternity brothers -
Boola-Boola - has a-a cousin

605
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,150
who opened a transistor
factory in Gdansk.

606
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,440
Now, he says that this
"corporation" is actually

607
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,220
a front for local mafia,

608
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,700
mostly, you know,
ex-KBG and whatnot.

609
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,530
Well, why would a local syndicate
send a mercenary to DC?

610
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,160
Well, because... because
they're-they're obsessed

611
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,060
with cutting edge technology -
most recently, nano-technology.

612
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,240
Vasily was commissioned to retrieve

613
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,330
a human subject to get them
in the nanotech game.

614
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,000
Now, if you guys know anybody,
you know, who fits that bill,

615
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,860
now, I would recommend
getting him well-protected -

616
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,460
they got deep, deep pockets.

617
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,410
It is not going to end
with this Vasily character.

618
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,500
Welcome. You're welcome, guys.

619
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,470
You guys... stop by any time.

620
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,690
Wow, uh...

621
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,810
that-that's unbelievable.

622
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,380
I... I don't know what to say.

623
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,340
There's nothing you can say.

624
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,260
I mean, really -

625
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,260
you can't tell this to anyone ever.

626
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,060
So, let me get this straight, um...

627
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,370
you're a secret agent at the NSA,

628
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,080
and... there-there are
these tiny robots...

629
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,240
Computers, really.
Microscopic computers.

630
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,300
They're self-replicating,
feed off...

631
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,400
Uh... yeah, t-tiny robots.

632
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,180
And-and they got inside you, and, uh,

633
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,540
now you have these, um...

634
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,560
superhuman abilities.

635
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,770
Okay.

636
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,280
I-I know this is a lot to take in,
but I felt like...

637
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,450
well, I just... I-I needed
to be one hundred percent...

638
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,250
I just asked you to be
honest with me, Jake.

639
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,020
Sarah...

640
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,500
You know what?

641
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,240
It's been a blast.

642
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,820
At least I didn't lie...

643
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,290
Do you have to be so dramatic?!

644
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,010
Get in!

645
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,410
You got lucky.

646
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,440
Vasily was hired to retrieve
a human subject

647
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,330
linked to the nano-technology.

648
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,840
- I don't get it.
- Jake, he's here for you.

649
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,460
What?

650
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,100
That doesn't make any sense.
He could've had me... twice.

651
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,960
Why didn't he take me?

652
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,220
Let's ask him.

653
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,740
Okay, wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

654
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,640
I got some more questions for you.

655
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,710
Hey. You got a dead
prisoner in there -

656
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,430
you want to tell me
what the hell happened?

657
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,020
- That's impossible.
- No. No. No!

658
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,400
We searched him completely. No
unauthorized personnel has been in there.

659
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,440
Then what authorized person has?

660
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,590
The last visitor was...

661
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,580
Steve Clemens.

662
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,050
What?

663
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,670
Diane's new boyfriend. He's a dirty
agent. He's working with Vasily.

664
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,240
Once we caught him...

665
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,400
Steve had no choice.
He couldn't let him talk.

666
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,140
He cut out the middleman.

667
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,850
He's going to finish the job,
and give them exactly what they want:

668
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,440
An expert on nano-technology: Diane.

669
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,550
So... you're not going to
tell me where we're going?

670
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,990
Uh, I told you... it's a surprise.

671
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,570
Okay.

672
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,440
Bring up the feeds for all metro
intersection cameras and toll booths.

673
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,990
Steve Clemens took the black duffel
out of the evidence locker.

674
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,100
Diane isn't answering
her cell or home phone.

675
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,550
Oh, no, she's with him. Cross-check
with Steve Clemen's license plate.

676
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,820
- What's the number?
- A DC plate, 4BMH359.

677
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,750
Come on!

678
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,450
- Where?
- Key Bridge into Virginia.

679
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,870
- When?
- About fifteen minutes ago.

680
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,760
Re-task all available
eyes in the sky.

681
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,580
Start tracking sequences.

682
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,460
I want a pinpoint.

683
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,070
Oh, my god.

684
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,830
Steve.

685
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,910
- Hope you like boats.
- I do.

686
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,250
A friend of mine chartered one.

687
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,120
Turns out he's not going to use it,

688
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,060
so I thought we could take
a little pleasure cruise.

689
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,780
- And I'll cook you dinner.
- Ooh.

690
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,580
- How's that sound?
- I think it sounds very romantic.

691
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,970
Oh, I'm glad you think so.

692
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,120
What's the status on the vehicle.

693
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,220
Clemens' vehicle is stationary.

694
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,780
Two miles east on 60,
royal avenue exit.

695
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,560
Copy that.

696
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,990
Jake, nothing's going
to happen to Diane.

697
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,570
You pissed?

698
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,560
Very.

699
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,630
Good.

700
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,060
Fan out, fan formation.
No one fires unless fired upon.

701
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,530
Oh, Steve. This is so fantastic.

702
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,560
Let's go, let's go!

703
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,780
- Jake!
- You okay?

704
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,830
- What are you doing here?!
- Where is he?!

705
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,650
I've got the champagne.

706
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,340
- Foley.
- It's okay.

707
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,690
- You shouldn't be here.
- Steve!

708
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,980
Why don't you tell her why
you really want her, huh?

709
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,530
What's going on?

710
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,020
Sorry, Diane. I really like you,

711
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,670
but you can't imagine
how much they're paying me.

712
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,440
Jake, turn the boat around.

713
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,310
Oh, that's not going to happen.

714
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,300
Jake!

715
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,630
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

716
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,560
Lousy. Ugly. Lying.

717
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,960
Bastard.

718
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,000
Lone.

719
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,360
Only. Lonely.

720
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,940
Solo. Sadly,

721
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,950
badly and madly.

722
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,180
That's all I got.
It's your turn.

723
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,400
Okay, uh, I have, um...

724
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,040
"tush."

725
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,340
That's it?

726
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,200
Oh, uh, and, um...

727
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,180
"tush-y."

728
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,640
- I guess you win.
- Hmm.

729
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,180
Again.

730
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,900
Whoo-hoo. Oh, god,

731
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,630
I feel like such an idiot.

732
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,270
Hey, could have happened to anybody.

733
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,690
Yeah. Not just anyone
allows themselves

734
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,560
to get wined and dined

735
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,930
and sold into white
scientist slavery.

736
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,440
Well, that just, uh,

737
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,420
proves how special you are.

738
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,040
Yeah. I guess I should have listened
to you. You were just trying to save me

739
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,110
from the world's most pathetic breakup.

740
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,110
Well, second most pathetic.

741
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,920
I win that one, actually.

742
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,600
I guess sometimes people,

743
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,580
they don't want to see
the truth even...

744
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,670
when it's sitting
right in front of them.

745
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,530
Yeah.

746
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,300
Do you think you can take me?

747
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,240
Oh. Well,

748
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,500
I-I don't know if I can
compete with your... brain.

749
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,180
Oh, yeah?

750
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,600
You weren't even trying.

751
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,830
Well, apparently the only word
you don't know is "mercy."

752
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,660
I didn't see that one.

753
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,970
Seriously, Diane,

754
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,800
y-you have an amazing mind.

755
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,420
Yeah.

756
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,070
Why can't I find a guy who's
just after my body, huh?
