1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,520
- How could you?
- Let me call you back.

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,610
It's a little something
called chain of command.

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,330
It's a little something
called betrayal.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,120
I had orders and I followed them.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,770
I promised her she'd be safe.
I gave her my word!

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,750
That wasn't your promise to give.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,370
Are you having me arrested?

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,600
Deputy Director Beckett, Agent Foley,

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,600
we have orders to bring
you both upstairs.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,530
What do you mean he's
not on that flight?

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,530
I have the manifest right here.

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,200
Can I help you?

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,070
- What is going on?
- It's an emergency Board of Inquiry.

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,170
- It's like a trial.
- Only worse.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,500
Okay, I don't understand.
What did we do?

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,750
Director Beckett,

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,910
Agents Duarte, Foley,

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,910
Dr. Hughes.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,360
This Emergency Board of Inquiry

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,920
has been convened to decide

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,990
the future of your Special Ops unit.

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,860
Jim, we should have received notice.

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,850
This board is under no obligation
to notify you of anything.

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,330
Lou,

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,700
considering what's happened
in the last few days,

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,590
there is enormous pressure

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,300
to justify Agent Foley's behavior.

28
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't worry. This isn't a witch hunt.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,300
We just want the truth.

30
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,070
It is now 8:47.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,250
I'm calling this hearing to order.
Please sit.

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,440
Let the record show

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,060
that six years ago, NSA began working

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,120
on project Free Target

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,160
exploring the use of nanites -

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,160
molecular-sized computers

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,270
to enhance our agents'
field behavior.

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,050
Several months ago,

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,960
a lab accident resulted
in the premature introduction...

40
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,020
of millions of these nanites

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,020
into a human subject,

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Jake Foley, at the time,
a computer technician.

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,960
At Director Beckett's request,

44
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,010
Foley was promoted
to full agent status

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,260
and a Special Unit was formed

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,220
with him at its core.

47
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,690
Now, since that time, this unit,

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,830
at best, has produced uneven results.

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,350
Technology isn't the issue here.

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,890
Agent Foley's enhanced
physical powers and endurance,

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,070
along with his ability to interface

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,160
with electronic devices and computers,
are all very impressive.

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,310
Impressive, yes, however,
this program was designed

54
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,700
for a trained professional,
used to following orders,

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,870
something Mr. Foley clearly is not.

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
Recently, and most egregiously,

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,240
he disobeyed a direct order
to execute an enemy of the state

58
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,470
and aided that same individual

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,810
in an attempt to assassinate
a foreign official.

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,520
If I may ask,

61
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,830
what are the possible
outcomes of this...

62
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,780
"Inquiry"?

63
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,160
Either the board is satisfied
with your explanations,

64
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,150
or we terminate the program.

65
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,880
This is not a trial
in the formal sense.

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,900
What does that mean?

67
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,830
- We don't get a lawyer.
- Lou,

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,860
could you please identify
yourself for the record,

69
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,410
and tell us what happened

70
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,890
regarding this operation
starting November 17.

71
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,760
Deputy Director Louise Beckett, NSA.

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,060
On the 17th of this month,
there was a break-in

73
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,730
at the Densmore Research Facility
in Alexandria, Virginia.

74
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,220
And the intruder stole three
vials of a controlled substance.

75
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,220
Thank you.

76
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,270
Why did you tell him about...?

77
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,160
Agent Foley,

78
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
if there's something you
need to say to the board,

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,380
will you please address us directly?

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,340
Okay, well, I was just wondering...

81
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,890
Give your name and position,
please, for the record.

82
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,160
Uh, Agent Jake Foley.

83
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,160
The things you experienced firsthand.

84
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,160
From the top, if you don't mind.

85
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,450
From the top. Okay.

86
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,960
Uh,

87
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,140
well, I guess it all started
when I got an urgent phone call

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,140
from my immediate superior,
Agent Duarte.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,810
Hey, I got here as fast as I could.
What do you need?

90
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,370
You.

91
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,420
You know this girl I've been seeing,
Megan Reilly?

92
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah.

93
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,650
Her sister's in town for a few days.

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,480
Uh, no. No. No.

95
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,720
Wait, wait, wait, Jake.
She's really cute.

96
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,050
Uh-huh.

97
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,080
Look, all you have to do is hang out
with her one, maybe two hours, tops.

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,860
No, forget it.

99
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,330
I have a hard enough time talking
to girls I actually know. Kyle...

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,920
Well,

101
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,140
on the other hand, anything I can do
to help a friend out of a jam.

102
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

103
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,580
So, you really like

104
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,570
those daiquiris?

105
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,510
Jake, Jake.

106
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,460
Janet. Janet.

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,550
How do you go out there every day

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,520
not knowing if you're
ever coming back?

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,040
Well, I pretty much know
that I am coming back,

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,390
'cause, like I said,
I'm a computer tech,

111
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,660
so we come back every morning,

112
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,450
except weekends.

113
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,390
Right. Right.

114
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,040
Hush, hush. On the QT.

115
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,990
I'm sorry, but I don't know

116
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,800
why I thought you could
talk about it.

117
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,450
Uh, I can talk about it.
I just did.

118
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,220
And you told me nothing.

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,220
You are very good.

120
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,800
You know,

121
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,250
I just feel so grateful

122
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,710
knowing that there are
men out there like you

123
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,660
doing what you do.

124
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,740
It's getting kind of late.

125
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,970
It's only 9:30.

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
Yeah? Feels a lot later.

127
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,210
C'mere you.

128
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,210
Ow.

129
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,210
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,380
Yep, I think just maybe
a chipped tooth.

131
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,160
Want to go back to your place?

132
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,030
Agent Foley.

133
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,760
You told me to start from the top.

134
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,350
Yes, Agent Foley,
regarding the mission.

135
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,320
Right. Right.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,350
Anyway, after heretofore

137
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,350
described events at the bar,

138
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,590
Agent Duarte got a call from Sat Ops

139
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,590
instructing us to come in
immediately...

140
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,310
Three vials of nitrous
varcon were stolen

141
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,140
from the Densmore lab

142
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,470
at exactly 1930 hours.

143
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,430
This is the deadliest V series
nerve agent on the planet.

144
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,980
What is it, Jake?

145
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,570
I just didn't think the U.S.
manufactured biological weapons.

146
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,440
We don't.

147
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,710
Varcon has never
officially been produced

148
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,710
or tested in this country,
never will be.

149
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,670
Understood?

150
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,740
Can the security guard
I.D. the intruder?

151
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,780
No, all he remembers
is a cinder-block wall

152
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,770
flying at him at 30 miles an hour.

153
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,230
We do have audio feed
from the break-in.

154
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,350
- That's not a lot to go on.
- No, it isn't.

155
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,630
When we find this individual,
executive action obtains.

156
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,150
Executive action?

157
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,590
- Shoot to kill.
- We can do that?

158
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,760
When the order comes
from the President we can.

159
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,010
We've just received echelon chatter

160
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,950
indicating a potential
buyer in Santa Costa.

161
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,340
- The rebels?
- That's what I want you to find out.

162
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,140
Can I come?

163
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,880
Director Beckett,

164
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,960
Agent Foley's unique
skills didn't seem

165
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,120
to have any specific
application to this mission,

166
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,920
so would you mind
explaining to the board

167
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,030
why you would risk our
agents and our investment

168
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,030
in nanotechnology by sending him in?

169
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,030
Jake isn't an appliance.

170
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,780
He's a member of our
intelligence community

171
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,620
being trained for
advanced field work.

172
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,910
He goes on missions. And by the way,

173
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,550
any other agent would have
ended up dead on that assignment.

174
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,120
Would any other agent
have compromised

175
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,860
the mission to such an extent?

176
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,400
All right, all right.

177
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,150
Ease off, Mr. Jennings.

178
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,150
Dr. Hughes.

179
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,210
Me? Yes, I'm Dr. Hughes.

180
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,680
Um...

181
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm the scientist in charge
of the nanotechnology program.

182
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,620
I took over from Dr. Gage.

183
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,590
He was, well, he was shot. He died.

184
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,840
Dr. Hughes,

185
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,510
part of your job is
preparing Agent Foley

186
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,430
- for his work in the field.
- Yes.

187
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,230
Please, tell the board of
inquiry about your examination

188
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,530
of Agent Foley before
he left for Santa Costa.

189
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,140
Um...

190
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,080
Well, I was giving him some shots.

191
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,710
I, uh...

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,020
heard about your hot date.

193
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,080
Ow. What did Kyle tell you?

194
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,310
Nothing, just that she
came on a little strong.

195
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,360
I've had people shooting
at me and been less afraid.

196
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,100
Well,

197
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,140
I guess you could consider
it a compliment

198
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,380
in a scary, nutty,

199
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,490
- clinically-obsessive kind of way.
- Yeah.

200
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,320
Hey, Diane, listen,

201
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,150
I need to ask you a question.
It's kind of a

202
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,560
doctor-patient thing.

203
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,110
Sure.

204
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,530
Okay... uh,

205
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,560
you know, it's funny,
I never had a female doctor before.

206
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,940
Do you have a rash?

207
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,820
What? No.

208
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,740
Oh, I...

209
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,800
um, so, then what's this about?

210
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,740
Uh... well,

211
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,510
okay, let's just say

212
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,240
that the girl last night
wasn't totally insane, okay?

213
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,240
And that I wanted

214
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,270
to take her back to my place.

215
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,440
Is it safe?

216
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,180
You mean... um...

217
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,150
Well, yeah, I mean,
if you use a condom.

218
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,690
No, yeah. I-I know that. I just...

219
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,320
I mean with the nanites
and everything?

220
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,200
Well, based on research,

221
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,230
I can say with some
degree of certainty

222
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,800
that the possibility
of transference/infection,

223
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,730
is statistically low enough
to be considered

224
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,710
virtually nonexistent.

225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,200
Uh-huh.

226
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,200
So, you're telling me
I can have sex, right?

227
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,790
I should do some tests
just to make sure.

228
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,280
I'm not thirsty, thanks.

229
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Uh...

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,810
Oh.

231
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,290
Uh, so I should, uh...

232
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,860
Yeah. The bathroom is just
over there, and...

233
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,440
there's a lock, yeah.

234
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,750
Yeah.

235
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,830
Hey, Diane.

236
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,000
- Hi.
- What's Jake up to?

237
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,270
Um...

238
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,340
My name is agent Kyle Duarte.

239
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,370
I'm Agent Foley's Direct Superior

240
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,370
and the person most
involved in his training.

241
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,820
Do you believe that Agent Foley

242
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,500
was a benefit to your
operation in Santa Costa?

243
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,060
Yes.

244
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,060
Please, tell us about the operation.

245
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,350
We arrived in Santa Costa at 0800

246
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,530
and made contact
with our local agents.

247
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,210
Two hours later,

248
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,750
we had the alleged buyer
and seller in our sights -

249
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,810
a male latino and
a blond caucasian female

250
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,870
they were meeting at an apartment
in the market district.

251
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,950
Notice how the travel brochures
never mention monsoons?

252
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,950
What's up with that?

253
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,070
Oh, hey, hold on.

254
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,060
Yeah, it's the buyer and the seller.

255
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,060
Oye, Jorge, estan en camino.

256
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,350
Whoa, whoa!

257
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,460
Hey, hey! Muevate!

258
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,730
- Excuse me!
- Ifuera de aqui, oye!

259
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,460
Excuse me.

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Sorry, sorry.

261
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,460
Don't move!

262
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,760
No se mueve, por favor.

263
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,620
We found all three vials
in the apartment.

264
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,850
Muy bien. Esta todo que puedes llevar.
(Very well, you can take them away now.)

265
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,780
Tenemos el varcon.
(We have the Varcon.)

266
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,780
Dos sospechosos han sido arrestados.
(The suspects have been arrested.)

267
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,780
Si, si. Los tres frascos.
(Yes, the three vials.)

268
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,460
- They say anything?
- Oh, you know, the usual -

269
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,640
"We're innocent,
we don't know how it got here."

270
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,590
We can have a talk
with them later on.

271
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,210
Why don't you go back to the hotel?
I'll call you when I know something.

272
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,110
Are you sure? You sure
there's nothing I can do?

273
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,640
'Cause I know I was jet-lagged before,
but I'm pumped now, I'm ready.

274
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,010
Hello.

275
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,010
Hey, Jake. It's Diane.

276
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,090
I, uh, heard you already caught
the bad guys. Congratulations.

277
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,860
Oh, thanks.

278
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,530
And I, uh, I got your test
results back, and you are...

279
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,530
good to go.

280
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,920
Wait, uh... you mean, I...?

281
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,980
I mean that you can
have sexual relations

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,610
without fear of, uh...

283
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,610
"intrahominid cross transference."

284
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,040
Ah...

285
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,750
yeah!

286
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,380
What?

287
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,730
Uh, nothing, nothing. Thanks, Diane.

288
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,200
Well, of course, uh...

289
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,660
it's important to find
the right girl, right?

290
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,970
I mean, not in the strictly scientific
sense of the word "important,"

291
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,670
but it's important.

292
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,550
Yeah, yeah, sure, absolutely.

293
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,850
It's not like I'm going to run out of
here and pick up the first girl I see.

294
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,210
Buenas noches.

295
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,960
Adios.

296
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,590
Yep, you are one super stud.

297
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,700
You mind if I join you?

298
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,250
Yeah. Yeah!

299
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,520
I mean, yeah, you can join me.

300
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,200
Are you sure? 'Cause you
can tell me to get lost.

301
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,220
That's usually my line.

302
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,010
Angela Wright.

303
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,860
Uh, Jake Foley.

304
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,690
- Hi.
- Hey.

305
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,900
For the record, Agent Foley,

306
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,910
is this the woman you picked up
in the Santa Costa hotel bar?

307
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,250
I didn't pick her up.

308
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,230
All right, you began
a relationship with this woman

309
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,380
in the middle of your mission
to Santa Costa. Yes?

310
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,720
No. No. I thought
the mission was over.

311
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
And you claim here

312
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,880
that you did not know
that she was an enemy

313
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,230
in possession of a stolen
weapon of mass destruction.

314
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,270
I don't claim.
I didn't know any of that.

315
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,590
Well, tell us, Agent Foley.

316
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,980
What exactly did you know about her?

317
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,510
You're double jointed! So am I.

318
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,750
Well, that does it, then.
We should get married.

319
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,560
Yes, yes. Think of all the things
that we have in common.

320
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,110
We're both in sales.

321
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,520
We both went to schools
on the east coast.

322
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,240
- We both met Katie Couric.
- Yes.

323
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,530
Well, I saw her.

324
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,240
That counts.

325
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,980
Before we get married,
I would like to know, um,

326
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,540
do you have a girlfriend?

327
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,160
No. No. You?

328
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,360
No, no girlfriend...
or boyfriend, or husband.

329
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,300
Okay.

330
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,140
Well, then, uh... there's
just one more question.

331
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,120
Then we get married for sure.

332
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,740
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

333
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,610
Thank you. Um...

334
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,770
Thanks.

335
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,740
Why'd you come up to me tonight?

336
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,300
You have a nice place.

337
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,090
It's very trustworthy.

338
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,630
Thanks.

339
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,150
I get it from my mom's side.

340
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,560
Hmm.

341
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,000
The bedroom eyes from dad?

342
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,550
So, uh...

343
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,330
since I have a nice face,

344
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,540
and, uh, I like you...

345
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,430
seems like you like me, so...

346
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,230
what do you think about

347
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,180
continuing this, uh...

348
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,590
On the roof?

349
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,260
Well, I was thinking my room,

350
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,460
or-or maybe your room.

351
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,250
Or... ok-okay, the roof, if it's...

352
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,130
or you can just slap me in the face,
and get it over with.

353
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,470
I didn't say no.

354
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,990
You really are double-jointed.

355
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,980
So, she did go to your room?

356
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,430
Yes.

357
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,570
And you had NSA hardware,

358
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,900
which, if breached, could have
compromised your mission?

359
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,320
Excuse me.

360
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,280
He thought the mission was over.

361
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,530
Sit down, Agent Duarte.

362
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,250
What's your point?

363
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,040
That Jake had no idea our
case was falling apart.

364
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,180
I told you, I don't know how that
stuff got into my apartment.

365
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,100
It says here that's not
your primary residence.

366
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,930
I have a house outside of town.

367
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,300
But the apartment is where
you conduct business, right?

368
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,380
Charming view,
buy a little nerve gas?

369
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,660
No.

370
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,910
Then why'd you rent it?

371
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,270
He was having an affair?

372
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,270
With a woman from his office.

373
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,230
Said it was his first one.

374
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,980
Well, that'll teach him.

375
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,090
That's when we got the test
results back from the lab.

376
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,680
The vials we found
that morning were fakes.

377
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,600
I phoned Director Beckett
to give her the news,

378
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,600
and that's when I called Agent Foley.

379
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,580
And what was his response?

380
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,510
I wasn't able to reach him.

381
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,750
We have audio feed from the break-in.

382
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,090
- Yeah.
- Kyle.

383
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,670
Jake. I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

384
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,560
Yeah. I'm in my room with a woman.

385
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,760
Well, good for you.

386
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,250
No, no, she's the one
who stole the vials.

387
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,410
What? Stall her.

388
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,040
- I'll be there in 15 minutes.
- It's too late.

389
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,040
No, Jake, she still has the varcon.

390
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,040
The vials we picked up were fake.

391
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,500
What?

392
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,410
You have a shoot-to-kill order.

393
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,310
Enforce it.

394
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,810
I think you've got something of mine.

395
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,680
I need you to put down that handbag.

396
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,100
- This isn't what...
- Now.

397
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,610
Oh!

398
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,890
- Don't shoot!
- You don't shoot!

399
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,930
- Put down your gun!
- You put it down!

400
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,790
I'm CIA. I'm going to show you my ID.

401
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,720
Don't get trigger happy.

402
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,810
Whoever you're working for, it's pretty
obvious we're after the same thing.

403
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,770
Yeah, I think you already have it.

404
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,990
Angela Hamilton?

405
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,990
You said your name was Angela Wright.

406
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,110
I'm an intelligence officer.
What do you expect?

407
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,110
I'm sure your real name
isn't Jake Foley.

408
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,320
Of course not.

409
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,240
Why don't you just put your gun down,
and we'll figure this out together?

410
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,640
No, no. I'm not putting my gun down.

411
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,490
Fine.

412
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,210
Here.

413
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,900
There.

414
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,440
Okay?

415
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,800
Now, who are you?

416
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm NSA

417
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,660
Great.

418
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,500
You're after the varcon as well.

419
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,220
I can't believe our idiot agencies.

420
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,140
You'd think they'd have figured this out by
now - tell one hand what the other is doing.

421
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,820
Why were you on my laptop?

422
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,400
I knew you were a wrong number.

423
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,190
What kind of watch salesman would
be caught dead wearing that?!

424
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,220
I needed to find out who you really
were and what you were up to.

425
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,570
What, by sleeping with me?

426
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,650
Let's get this all straightened out.
You call the CIA,

427
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,650
- call your people.
- Oh, I will.

428
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,200
Could you please?

429
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,140
Thank you.

430
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,190
For the record, Agent Duarte,

431
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,050
Jake Foley received
a direct order from you

432
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
to kill a rogue agent

433
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,950
and simply ignored it?

434
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,300
Yes.

435
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,040
But I'm not going to stand here

436
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,020
and tell you this operation
was a complete failure.

437
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,390
Duly noted.

438
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,970
Now, perhaps you could regale
us with some facts.

439
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,830
I arrived at Agent Foley's hotel room

440
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,360
shortly after his altercation
with Angela Hamilton.

441
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,710
Lou? It's Kyle.

442
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,000
We have a problem.

443
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,280
Buenos dias, Colonel.

444
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,780
Yes, I have all three.

445
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,310
I expect 80 apiece.

446
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,120
- I hope you take dollars.
- That's all I'll take.

447
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,410
- Where are you?
- Don't worry, I'll be there.

448
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,410
Excuse me, Agent Foley.

449
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,290
How long did you say you clung

450
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,380
to the underside
of Angela Hamilton's car?

451
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,770
I don't know... I don't know.

452
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,590
Two, two and a half hours.

453
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,540
That's impressive.

454
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,950
Can you imagine that power

455
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,950
in the hands of
a properly-trained agent?

456
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah. Imagine that.

457
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,650
Nano hearing.

458
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,600
Agent Foley...

459
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,570
just tell us what happened next.

460
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,870
- How...?
- Shut up.

461
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,870
Turn around.
Put your hands on the car.

462
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,190
Don't!

463
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,270
You're the one
who planted the fake vials.

464
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,320
You came up to my room
to see if we bought it.

465
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,320
And you did.

466
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,280
Turn around!

467
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,400
You have a shoot-to-kill order,
don't you?

468
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,630
Take another step, you'll find out.

469
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,860
It's not so easy, is it?

470
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,240
Putting a bullet
in somebody you know...

471
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,210
intimately.

472
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,200
Why are you doing this?

473
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,200
Why are you selling
this stuff to the rebels?

474
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,520
I'm not. I'm selling it
to the government.

475
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
The U.S. won't sell
the varcon gas anymore. I will.

476
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,010
All right. Hold it.
Just hold it right there.

477
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,170
Now, you have been warned
about mentioning

478
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,250
the use, manufacture, or sale

479
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,270
of varcon gas in the United States.

480
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,090
Agent Foley, I think

481
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,240
what Mr. Skerritt is trying to say

482
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,420
is for a government employee

483
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,530
to intimate that our government
would do such a thing

484
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,380
is considered treason.

485
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,760
I understand.

486
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,760
Thank you, Agent Foley.

487
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,430
Proceed with your story.

488
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,880
Okay.

489
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,140
The gas

490
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,910
that the united states government

491
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,930
would never manufacture -

492
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,900
the same gas

493
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,440
that the united states government
would never dream of

494
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,400
selling to a client state -

495
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,320
that exact same gas

496
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,050
was used to kill Angela
Hamilton's younger sister.

497
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,300
"Jessica had just
graduated from Penn."

498
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,210
And she was a speech therapy major.

499
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,050
She already had a job lined up.

500
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,640
She and her girlfriend were
backpacking through Central America.

501
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,310
They stopped in Golfito,
a little town on the coast here.

502
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,390
Didn't realize it was
a rebel stronghold.

503
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,730
One minute, they're having lunch

504
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,360
and the next, the whole
village is being gassed.

505
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,060
The U.S. never lifted a finger.

506
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,020
Never went after the guy
who gave the order,

507
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,930
nothing.

508
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,920
- Angela, whoever this guy is...
- I know exactly who he is -

509
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,600
Colonel Enrique Alonzo,

510
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,560
head of the Santa Costa
revolutionary guard.

511
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,100
It's army talk for death squad.

512
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,100
But we can tell people.
We can bring him in.

513
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,630
I gave them two and a half
years to bring him in.

514
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,760
When I knew they never would,
I left the agency.

515
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,130
So, now you're selling varcon
to the people who killed your sister.

516
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,310
No, you're not selling
the gas to them.

517
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,970
You're going to kill Alonzo with it.

518
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,620
I can't let you do that.

519
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,480
I don't think you have a choice.

520
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,030
- There she is!
- Oh, this is suicide.

521
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,000
But you already knew that.

522
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,470
Thank you for a perfect last night.

523
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,450
You're my partner.
You helped me steal the vials.

524
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,890
When they take me inside
the mobile lab, stay outside.

525
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,490
Good.

526
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,260
I just need the other two vials,
and we have a deal.

527
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,110
No, we have a deal when I deliver

528
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,950
the other two vials
to Colonel Alonzo.

529
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,280
Colonel Alonzo has other
matters to attend to.

530
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,550
Well, then we don't have a deal.

531
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,580
I'm sorry, but in fact we do.

532
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,560
Muchacho. Llevela afuera y matela.
(Take her outside and kill her.)

533
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,180
Angela!

534
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,000
Here!

535
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,000
I have to perform a tracheotomy.

536
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,800
It means I'm going to open
your airway, okay?

537
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,890
I've done this before.
Don't worry, sweetheart.

538
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,050
Don't move.

539
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,640
I'm better.

540
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,980
And along with the team at Sat Ops,

541
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,920
I monitored the operation.

542
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,860
And did you feel at any time
that you lost control?

543
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,870
No. Field work is not
an exact science.

544
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
These operations take on
a life of their own

545
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
once all of the different
variables come into play.

546
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,790
Agent Foley was a party
to several murders

547
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,900
of one of our allies and
this is what you call a variable?

548
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,010
Agent Foley was pressed
into a difficult

549
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,030
and ethically challenging situation.

550
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,340
Once we became aware
of the deaths in Santa Costa,

551
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,560
I dispatched Agent Duarte
to extract him

552
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,870
and to finish the operation...

553
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,340
according to the orders
given me by my superiors.

554
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,630
They're all dead.

555
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,680
It was the American girl
and her friend.

556
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,680
Don't get too close.

557
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
Find them now!

558
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,500
What the hell are you?

559
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,580
I told you.
I'm an agent with the NSA.

560
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,430
I didn't ask who. I asked what.

561
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,800
You survived exposure to varcon gas.
Nobody does that.

562
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,080
Give me the other two vials.

563
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,400
I'm not done with them.
Alonzo isn't not dead yet.

564
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,240
- Angela.
- No.

565
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,070
All right.

566
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,630
I work with a Special
Ops team at the NSA.

567
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,490
A team that will do anything for me,

568
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,600
including bringing this
Alonzo guy in.

569
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,820
Jake, you say that,
but I know how these agencies work.

570
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,820
Well, that's not how I work.

571
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,820
And that's not how my superiors work.

572
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,700
You have my word.

573
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,820
Angela, if you try
doing this on your own,

574
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,630
this guy's going to vanish, and
then he will get away with murder.

575
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,190
Was that your sister's?

576
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,760
Yeah.

577
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,690
You know what the hardest thing is?

578
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,630
Watching the news.

579
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,900
Jessie used to yell
at the broadcasters,

580
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,860
not about the news,
but about the way they talked.

581
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,570
She was a speech therapist, you know?

582
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,470
"That guy's hiding a stutter."

583
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,850
"I could cure his cul-de-sac
resonance in a day."

584
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,170
"Talk about disfluency."

585
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,620
How are you today?

586
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,480
Hands in the air.

587
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,960
He's got the Varcon.

588
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,690
You shoot me, you'll be
dead in ten seconds.

589
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,690
- He's bluffing.
- No, he's not.

590
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,040
Do you know who I am?

591
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,750
No.

592
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm a nurse in Zancuta going home
to cook dinner for her two children.

593
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,950
I'm a 12-year-old boy
on his way to soccer practice.

594
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm a 22-year-old American girl
from Philadelphia

595
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,540
with her whole life ahead of her.

596
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,650
I am not afraid to die.

597
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,530
We'll see about that.

598
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,010
Jake!

599
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,590
Okay, it's okay.

600
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,000
- Angela Hamilton?
- Yes?

601
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,720
Kyle?

602
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,730
It's okay guys.
It's not necessary.

603
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,870
Kyle.

604
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,300
What's going on?

605
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,160
Kyle, what's going on?

606
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,990
No, I told her we could help her.

607
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,930
Jake, Jake, listen to me.

608
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,980
It's their country, okay?

609
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,740
Lou had to pull strings
just to get you out alive.

610
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,500
No, no, she trusted me, damn it!

611
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,290
Jake, listen to me.

612
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,160
It's out of our hands.

613
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,030
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,150
I was ordered to hand
Angela Hamilton over

615
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,690
to a government with
an abominable human rights record.

616
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,230
Right now, she's rotting
in one of their prisons,

617
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,940
while the country she once served
ignores the fact she's even alive.

618
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,940
Sit down, Agent Duarte.

619
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,990
Barring any further questions
from my colleagues,

620
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,630
I think we're done here.

621
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,530
We will review the evidence

622
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,760
and return our
evaluation of your unit

623
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,500
as soon as possible.

624
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,070
Until then, you'll be
restricted to desk work

625
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,560
and your movements
will be carefully monitored.

626
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,730
I'm sure you all understand.

627
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,640
No, I don't...

628
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,630
and I need to say something.

629
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,210
- You've said enough.
- No, I haven't!

630
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
This isn't about our
field performance.

631
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,070
This is about you
finding a scapegoat.

632
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,690
- You're out of line, son.
- Because I'm not afraid of the truth?

633
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,550
That we helped kill American citizens,

634
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,290
that we abandoned Angela Hamilton,

635
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,970
that we sold Varcon to Santa Costa,

636
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,030
and you hypocrites can't even
bring yourself to say the word?

637
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,610
Guards, escort Mr. Foley to a cell.

638
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,730
what's happening?

639
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,520
Our transcript is being uploaded.

640
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,910
What's he doing?

641
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,140
Tell them to stand down.

642
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,190
The transcripts for this hearing
are now in the server.

643
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,580
If I blink, everything
that's been said here today

644
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,600
will be e-mailed to the AP wire.

645
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,210
All of your dealings with the
repressive government of Santa Costa,

646
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,320
turning over Angela...

647
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,400
every paper in the country'll
have their hands on it.

648
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,330
Now, you want to shut us down,

649
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,860
send me off to be a lab rat the
rest of my life, be my guest...

650
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,230
but Angela is walking out
of that prison...

651
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,690
or else.

652
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,840
Chief Skerrit,

653
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,180
members of the board...

654
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,420
this might be an excellent
time for you

655
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,700
to reevaluate your perception
of my team.

656
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,130
If you think we are going to allow

657
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,320
ourselves to be blackmailed by you...

658
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,320
Sit down, Miles.

659
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,850
We see your point.

660
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,640
In light of your passionate
testimony today...

661
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,280
I think we shouldn't rush to judge.

662
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,370
This is an unorthodox unit.

663
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,290
It cannot be measured by

664
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,440
traditional notions
of intelligence work...

665
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,340
for the record.

666
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,510
This meeting is closed, then?

667
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,700
Yes. It's closed.

668
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,650
Okay, so-so we're free?

669
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,630
For the time being, yeah.

670
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,730
I need some tea
or something stronger.

671
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,330
- Are we allowed to drink on duty?
- No, but we're going to start.

672
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,940
Were you really going
to send that transcript out?

673
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,720
Sure, if the e-mail I made up
actually belonged to anybody.

674
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,380
Good work.

675
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,150
Leave us.

676
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,260
Spineless.

677
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,260
Excuse me?

678
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,200
No, I don't.
Letting them off was inexcusable.

679
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,200
I mean, what does that say about us?

680
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,770
It says we handled
the situation ineptly.

681
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,370
And, Miles, if you ever speak to me

682
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,680
in that tone of voice again,
I'll cut your tongue out.

683
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,330
I'm not being figurative.

684
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,680
Jim...

685
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,660
Louise Beckett is in many
ways an admirable woman.

686
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,480
You promoted her.

687
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,400
If she fails, so will you.

688
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,500
Duly noted.

689
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,240
Jake Foley is another matter.

690
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,250
Did you see the way
he stood up to us?

691
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,070
That's a soldier.

692
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,200
You like him?

693
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,040
Oh, my god, I hate and fear him,

694
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,710
but a man like that bent to your will
could accomplish anything.

695
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,210
I don't believe he's bent
to anyone's will.

696
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,520
No, that's the problem.

697
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,860
One I intend to rectify.

698
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,470
Thanks.

699
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,280
You all right?

700
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,120
I am now.
