1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,370
Jake Foley was an ordinary guy

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,180
until a freak accident transformed him

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,130
into the world's first
computer-enhanced man.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,180
Millions of microscopic
computers interface

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,150
with his biochemistry and
make him stronger and faster,

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,830
able to see and hear
farther than normal men.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,890
They give him the power to
control technology with his brain.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,650
Jake Foley - America's
secret weapon.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,460
He takes on missions
no ordinary agent can perform.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,570
He is the ultimate

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,330
human upgrade.

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,920
Stay sharp, Jake, could be anyone.

13
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,750
Sector one all clear.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,450
This is two. Nothing here
displacing a ticket counter.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,200
Copy that, two.

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,960
Possible multiple targets
in three's location.

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,890
Moving west to the food court.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,270
Give us the word. Check that.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,390
It's nothing.

20
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,990
Got a guy with a suitcase.
Fits the profile.

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,530
Mid to late 30s. Possible ex-military.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,040
Give us the word. Possible
confirmation at Foley's 20.

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,040
He's opening his bag...

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,080
False alarm.

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,020
That's a negative. Standing by.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,820
Kyle, Kyle! Trash can, north exit.

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,860
I'm on the suspect. Guy is white,

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,370
baseball cap, khakis.
He's heading for the escalators.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,010
Roger that, two is moving.

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,770
Three's rolling.

31
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,840
He's down! Do not move!

32
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,650
Do not move!

33
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,440
What do we have?

34
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,440
That canister was full of ricin gas.

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,970
Coagulant fuse.

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,820
It would have liquefied
and released in five minutes.

37
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,000
Hundreds could have died.
Tokyo all over again.

38
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,500
He doesn't fit the profile. He's
just a kid. Why would he do that?

39
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,130
It's because it's all he knows.

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,740
Both our intel

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,720
and the viciousness of the attack

42
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,490
point to one conclusion:

43
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,420
Today's incident was the work

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,290
of Ethan Fulton's militia.

45
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,890
Fulton is an extremely
dangerous and driven man.

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,170
His wife Ann

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,090
was FBI.

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,920
She was gunned down in a botched raid

49
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,770
on Henry Travis' compound

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,680
near Bozeman in 1994.

51
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,870
Fulton blames the government
for her death,

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,370
not without some merit.

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,920
Who is this guy?

54
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,950
Chief Director Skerritt. Lou's boss.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,300
- Lou has a boss?
- Shhh.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,340
We've been targeting
Fulton's militia for years.

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,770
They are responsible for six
domestic terrorist attacks

58
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,660
including the near miss on
the Supreme Court in April.

59
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,490
Now, as you can see,

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,750
we haven't been able
to I.D. many of them.

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,570
So today's capture

62
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,430
is a very important step
forward in our investigation.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,950
Now I would like to acknowledge

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,950
Agent Foley's part in that capture.

65
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,460
- Lou's boss just complimented me.
- I heard.

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,460
We have an I.D. on the assailant?

67
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,750
No, sir. He's being
interrogated right now.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
You keep me posted.

69
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,960
Excellent work, all of you.

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,210
Good-bye, sir. It was

71
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,260
very nice to meet...

72
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,550
Okay, you heard him.
Fulton is aware

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,550
the noose is tightening
so watch your backs.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,180
Hey!

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,380
Yo, chill!

76
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,390
Is that any way to treat
your kid brother?!

77
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,590
Oh Jerry? Oh...

78
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,490
I could have killed you.

79
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,490
Yeah, yeah, right, dude, right.

80
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,470
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,410
Came to see you, of course...

82
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,540
also, our nation's great capitol.

83
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,430
I hear downtown's strip club-alicious.

84
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,740
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.

85
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,200
Security Clearance: Low.

86
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,430
Very low.

87
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,280
Then one day, it all changed.

88
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,340
Life just got real interesting.

89
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,190
- Okay, Ensenada.
- How could I forget?

90
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,380
Booze cruise, bikini twins, discotheque.

91
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,370
No. Federales, a pumped stomach
and a switchblade fight.

92
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,570
No, it was a butterfly knife.

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
You dug it. Admit it.

94
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,970
All right, I will admit that you talked
us out of it. I'll give you that.

95
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,470
Um, hello. Can we get some
Servicio, Por Fa-please?

96
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,550
Oh, god.

97
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,960
So, why aren't you in school?

98
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,850
I needed a break. You know,
I've been working pretty hard.

99
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,370
I got classes every
Tuesday and Thursday.

100
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,980
Uh-huh.

101
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,350
Plus I wanted to hang with my big bro.

102
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,210
Mom and dad know you're here?

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,180
Jake, I keep mom and dad on a strictly

104
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,330
need-to-know basis.

105
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,220
What happened there?

106
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,030
Um, it's a

107
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,810
work-related accident.

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh, what your motherboard cut?

109
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,640
- What up?
- You guys ready to order?

110
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,900
Uh, beer. Start with a pitcher of draft.

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,900
Can I see your I.D.?

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,030
Oh, he's 26. He just looks young.

113
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,030
Your I.D.

114
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,340
Oh, me. Oh, um,

115
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,720
because when we left,
you were going to drive, so I...

116
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,510
I left my wallet at the house.

117
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm sorry. I can't serve you then.

118
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,710
This is my brother. He'll vouch for me.

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,250
Oh, right. Yeah, he'll have a red bull.

120
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,560
Make that two, please. Thank you.

121
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,540
You call yourself a big brother?

122
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,180
That's right.

123
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,100
I'll let you make it up to me.

124
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,640
What do you say we shock on our
red bulls and hit the strip clubs?

125
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,810
Jerry, I can't. I have to be
at work tomorrow.

126
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,040
Hey, if I can make it through
a rigorous day of study

127
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,670
with a massive hangover,
I think you could, too.

128
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,030
I'll do you a favor; if I can get
off work tomorrow night,

129
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,770
we'll go out and do
something fun, okay?

130
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,490
Yeah, I can't wait.

131
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,670
Anyway, don't worry about me.

132
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,460
You won't even know
I'm here. I promise.

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
Hmm.

134
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,310
Sorry.

135
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,310
Whoa!

136
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,450
Yo, Jake, wake up.

137
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,170
Jerry,

138
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,790
I'm trying to sleep.

139
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,570
It's kinda important.

140
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,260
Oh, what is it?

141
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,600
- Promise you won't get all pissed?
- Oh, just say it.

142
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,480
I need a fire extinguisher...

143
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,390
like pronto.

144
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,900
What?

145
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,260
Okay, you're done.

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,940
Your vitals look good.

147
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,900
Have you had any

148
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,870
lightheadedness or nausea since

149
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,270
we had to, you know,
reboot the nanites?

150
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,840
Since you saved my life?

151
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,480
Yeah.

152
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,430
No, I'm fine.

153
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,260
Okay. Any recent glitches,

154
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,690
complications, any abnormalities?

155
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,990
My little brother's in town.
He's a bit of all three.

156
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,460
- I didn't even know you had a brother.
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.

157
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,060
He's checking out Georgetown

158
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,150
or burning down my apartment,
whichever comes first.

159
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,350
How old is he?

160
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,840
Nineteen... going on six.

161
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,090
Hmm. A little immature.

162
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,090
No, no, he's a lot immature.

163
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,350
When I was his age, I was
working two part-time jobs

164
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,400
while was taking eighteen
credits at Georgetown.

165
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,290
Did you have to walk six miles in
the snow every day to get there, too?

166
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,750
Funny. I'm serious. I don't get it.

167
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,200
He's a smart kid. He could go far.

168
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,500
He always screws it up.
He has no focus, you know?

169
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,150
Who does at 19?

170
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,860
Oh, well, except for you

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
and Bill Gates.

172
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,610
- Huh, duty calls.
- Yeah.

173
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
Stop by any time.

174
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,090
I have good news and bad news.

175
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,900
The young man who put
ricin gas in the subway

176
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,100
is Caleb Fulton,
Ethan Fulton's only son.

177
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,540
Now, Ethan blames the government
for the loss of his wife

178
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,520
and our capturing his son
will not sit well.

179
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,100
On the other hand, Caleb
grew up inside of the militia.

180
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,920
He knows it inside and out.

181
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,780
And next to capturing his father,

182
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,070
he's our best hope
in shutting them down.

183
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,090
- What's he saying?
- Nothing.

184
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,090
Our best interrogators
are working on him.

185
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,020
So let's get back to work.

186
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,290
Follow every lead,
every scrap of intel.

187
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,610
Um, do you think maybe
I could talk to him?

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,570
It's just we might have a connection

189
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,370
'cause I was the one that captured him,

190
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,300
and we're closer in age than you guys.

191
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,840
Not that you're old or anything.

192
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,180
You look great. It's just, uh...

193
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,150
I think he might relate to me better,

194
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,740
possibly.

195
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,670
Quit while you're ahead, Jake.

196
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,670
See what you can do.

197
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,080
Well, your pistons are shot,

198
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,790
your gas filter's rusted

199
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,840
and it looks like you might have
a crack in your engine block.

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,780
But I could have it ready Monday.
Say hello to the wife for me.

201
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,890
Thanks, Jimmy. I owe you.

202
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,090
They knew what we were doing
before half our men did.

203
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,250
Now, can you explain
to me how I let my son

204
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,100
walk right into an NSA sting?

205
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,960
You didn't crypt the final transmission
to our people in Virginia.

206
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,820
Ethan...

207
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,280
There is no excuse that
is going to free my son.

208
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,160
Sir.

209
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,390
There's been some concern
among the men about Caleb.

210
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,570
That they might possibly
force him into talking.

211
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,720
Caleb won't talk.

212
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,650
And neither will he.

213
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,140
Caleb.

214
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm Jake.

215
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,450
You're pretty quick.

216
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,200
Thought I was chasing Emmitt Smith
down there in that subway yesterday.

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,440
I guess that's appropriate
since you were

218
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,350
all-league running back in high school.

219
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,380
Was it 24 touchdowns you
scored your senior year?

220
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,280
That's impressive.

221
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,780
I can barely score five when I'm
playing Madden on my PlayStation.

222
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,520
You should try the rookie
setting, it's easier.

223
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,770
Yeah, I will. I'll try that.
Thank you.

224
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,570
So you read my file?

225
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,510
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

226
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,350
But this isn't your file.

227
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,070
Have you ever seen what ricin
gas does to the human body?

228
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,360
That little boy right there
is three years old.

229
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,040
That's his sister.

230
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,880
That's her mom.

231
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,500
The gas fills your lungs.

232
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,530
It feels like fire, but really
it's more like drowning

233
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,430
because your lungs literally burst.

234
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,580
That's why there's so much blood.

235
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,570
You almost did that to a lot of
innocent people yesterday.

236
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,290
But you didn't.

237
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,440
It's not too late,
you can change your life.

238
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,960
I can help.

239
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,740
How?

240
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,180
Tell us where your father is.

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,810
I'd rather die than betray my father.

242
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,820
He did not say that.

243
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,580
What do you look like?

244
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,780
So, what are you going to do tonight?

245
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,620
You should totally come over.

246
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,480
Jerry...

247
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,410
Hey, you got to try everything once.

248
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,450
And I'm telling you,
you haven't lived life

249
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,700
until you've tasted
my pasta a la Jerry.

250
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,090
Now get your buns over
here and I'll prove it.

251
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,960
She so wants me.

252
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,630
You met a girl already?

253
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,410
No. You did. Sarah.

254
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,070
She as hot as she sounds?

255
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,830
My Sarah? Were you talking to her?

256
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,350
No, relax, bro, it's fine.
I know we talked forever.

257
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,310
She's coming over to see you.

258
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,220
- Whoa, whoa, tonight?
- Yeah, man.

259
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,190
I'm hooking you up.
What's the deal with you two?

260
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,950
Nothing. We're friends.

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,740
Oh, I get it. She's a bowser.

262
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,510
No.

263
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,080
Fat?

264
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,340
She is beautiful and
she's intelligent, okay?

265
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,910
- So...?
- So...

266
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,640
it's complicated.
And it's none of your business.

267
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,700
Hey, whatever you say, man.

268
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,190
Do you mind keeping
it down for a while?

269
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,870
I'm gonna squeeze in a nap

270
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,650
before smackdown. Thanks.

271
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,930
Any progress?

272
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,210
- We know he's NSA.
- We knew that yesterday.

273
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,780
We know he's local. We believe
he works out of Fort Mead.

274
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,500
I want the name and
location of the man

275
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,340
who captured my son.

276
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,460
And then I want him standing right here

277
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,310
in front of me

278
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,550
so I can kill him myself.

279
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,170
Yes, sir.

280
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,530
Pasta a la Jerry coming your way!

281
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,690
Sarah. Sarah.

282
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,690
- No worries.
- Don't eat the food.

283
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,690
- I'm serious.
- I'll mop that up later.

284
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,530
Dinner... is served.

285
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,660
So, uh, what's in this?

286
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,160
Uh, pasta, vietnamese hot sauce

287
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,730
and selected seasonings.

288
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,200
It's a dorm room classic.

289
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,200
Dig in, Wedgie.

290
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,580
Wedgie?

291
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,360
One of Jake's many nicknames.

292
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,390
So what do you call him?

293
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,730
Oh, no, I'm far too mature

294
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,860
to embarrass Jerry like that.

295
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,740
Right, Humper?

296
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,710
I don't even want to know.

297
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,450
We've just begun picking up some
encrypted chatter from Fulton's militia.

298
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,370
First time since the ricin incident.

299
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,730
That's right. We believe there's
something going down tonight.

300
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,730
How long before we can decode it?

301
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,840
It's an algorithmic encryption.
It's gonna take a while.

302
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,610
Get every one of your code
breakers on this thing immediately.

303
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,540
You've got to hear this one.

304
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,210
Jake shows up to
Cheryl Rhodes' sweet 16

305
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,100
dressed like Gene Simmons.

306
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,070
I mean, full KISS makeup,
leather codpiece...

307
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,140
They told me it was a costume party.

308
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,110
Look at the time.

309
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,980
No, no, no. Hey, hey
I've got one more.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,720
No, no, Jerry, you really don't.

311
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,620
Hey, this may be Sarah's only
opportunity to know the real you.

312
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,480
Right?

313
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,220
It's Christmas, and I was, like, seven.

314
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,430
And all I'd asked for that year

315
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,610
was this kick-ass red huffy bike.

316
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,260
Apparently, "Santa" got the message

317
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,940
because Christmas morning, there it was

318
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,110
along with a list of rules from my dad.

319
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,420
Number one being you
always lock the bike.

320
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,320
- Wha...?
- So Christmas Day,

321
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm riding that sucker all
over town like it's a Ferrari.

322
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,330
I pop into the store for a soda

323
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,810
and when I come out, it's gone.

324
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,660
Jake finds me two hours
later crying my eyes out.

325
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,090
We go home and Jake tells my dad

326
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,320
he borrowed my bike
and forgot to lock it up.

327
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,880
Yeah, he got grounded for three weeks

328
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,860
just to keep his little
brother out of trouble.

329
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,020
That is so sweet.

330
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,410
I'll be right back.

331
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,940
Cool story, huh?

332
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,940
None of that ever happened.

333
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,770
It's no biggie, she'll never know.

334
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,300
That's not the point, Jerry.

335
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,170
Hey, I'm helping you seal the deal.

336
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,900
You can thank me later.

337
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,670
Where are you going?

338
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,600
I'm clearing the runway, man.

339
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,300
You can't land a plane when your little
brother's sleeping on the airstrip.

340
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm not to trying to land a plane.

341
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
Hey, that's your own issue.

342
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,920
Can I borrow some cash?
I'm a little light.

343
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,650
You know, from dinner.

344
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,290
Yeah, sure. Take whatever
you need from my wallet.

345
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,650
Where's Jerry?

346
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,010
Uh, he had to go.

347
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,690
You, uh...

348
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,060
pizza?

349
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

350
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,630
I thought you might be cold.

351
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,800
Your father never told you
about this part, did he?

352
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,830
I'm prepared to die for my cause.

353
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,530
Did your daddy teach you that?

354
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,130
Caleb, how many people have to die

355
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,570
before you realize your
mother's never coming back?

356
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,120
I take it you're not married.

357
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,960
Got any kids?

358
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
That's none of your business.

359
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,590
No matter, I can tell.

360
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,380
In your world, your job comes first.

361
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,390
In ours, it's family,
it's loyalty to your blood.

362
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,950
I feel sorry for you.

363
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,500
The feeling is mutual, Caleb.

364
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,890
Hey, can I help you?

365
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,050
Uh, scotch, neat, two napkins.

366
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,820
You got your I.D., kid?

367
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,730
I never leave home without it.

368
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,400
What kind of scotch?

369
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,290
Uh, the brown kinds.

370
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,170
Right.

371
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,560
Hey.

372
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,640
Hey.

373
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,120
You a secret agent or something?

374
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
Huh?

375
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,560
I snuck a peek at your NSA badge.

376
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,260
You naughty little girl, you.

377
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,760
- There you go.
- So, are you? An agent?

378
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,140
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to...

379
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,620
Kill me?

380
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,490
I was going to say "sleep with you,"
but, uh, if that's your thing...

381
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,530
- start a tab.
- You got it.

382
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,970
You got to understand,
we were best friends.

383
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,580
We went through the Academy
together. We had nicknames.

384
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,360
So what happened?

385
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,400
I looked into his scared dark eyes...

386
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,630
and I asked him one more time.

387
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,720
I said, "Are you a double agent?"

388
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,500
He took a deep breath...

389
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,060
his hand slowly slipping from mine,

390
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,990
and he muttered,

391
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,350
"Si, Senor... Si."

392
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,790
Then I let go...

393
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,860
and watched him plummet to his death.

394
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,690
Wow.

395
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,190
Right. So where'd this all happen?

396
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Where did this happen?

397
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
Can't tell you that, sir.

398
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,180
It's classified.

399
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,670
Yeah, stupid, it's classified.

400
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,810
All right, the drinks
are on Agent Foley.

401
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,910
Yeah!

402
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,910
Fo-ley! Fo-ley!

403
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,200
Anything on Foley?

404
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,230
NSA has him listed as a tech support,

405
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,510
but our people in payroll
can't confirm this.

406
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,230
There's no record of him on file.

407
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,600
I don't give a damn where he's listed.
I want to know where he is.

408
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,200
We're working on it, sir.

409
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,510
- You check DMV records?
- Came up clear.

410
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,100
You can't take a piss in this country
without someone knowing.

411
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,870
You're trying to tell me we can't find
this government piece of trash?

412
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,900
Wait a minute, we got something.

413
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,410
Foley just used his credit card
in the last ten minutes.

414
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,460
- Where?
- Georgetowne Station.

415
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,460
It's a bar on 4th and K street.

416
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,280
You get on him, now.

417
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,870
But having no idea where
little kids come from,

418
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,860
I just put it on my Christmas list:

419
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,580
One little sister -

420
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
and I was so pissed
when I didn't get one.

421
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,350
I just wanted someone to take care of,
you know, like you and Jerry.

422
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,470
Oh, Jerry never needed
anybody to take care of him.

423
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,670
Oh, come on, I heard the bike story.

424
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,490
Sarah, uh... that never happened.

425
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,140
What?

426
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,910
He made it up, but that's Jerry -
he's just trying to help.

427
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,050
To help what?

428
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,590
Uh, well

429
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,340
I-I guess he thought
that-that you and...

430
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,180
and-and me m-

431
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,180
uh, I guess he just thought that

432
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,270
maybe you'd like me better if...

433
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,270
Well, he was wrong.

434
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,770
Yeah.

435
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't need any more reasons
to like you, Jake.

436
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,770
You got your standard military grip

437
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,770
that's been around since the 1800s.

438
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,080
I prefer a more modern approach

439
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,080
made popular by rappers
and drug dealers.

440
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,110
It's, uh, "let's kick back" and...

441
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,090
just plain cooler looking.
Come on, people, you with me?

442
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,320
We found him.

443
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,160
Oh, Jake, you have a little, um...

444
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,090
What? Here?

445
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,040
Uh, I-I'll get it.

446
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,050
I should...

447
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,570
Answer the phone?

448
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,410
Yeah.

449
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,960
Hello? Uh. Hello?

450
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,520
- Uh, Jake?
- Jerry?

451
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,220
Yeah. I'm in big trouble.

452
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,380
Okay. This one's for you,

453
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,740
and this one's for you.

454
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,400
Let's just say I understand the part

455
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,080
where you take my car without asking

456
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,930
and accidentally bump
into a police car.

457
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,000
Let's just say that
I understand the part

458
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,160
where you threaten to call
your friend, Mayor Williams,

459
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,060
if they don't let you go. But why

460
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,960
would you give them my I.D.
and pretend to be me?

461
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,740
First of all, you have a
much better driving record,

462
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,450
and second, you're NSA -

463
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,550
they should've let you walk out
of professional courtesy.

464
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,080
What is wrong with you?

465
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,760
Don't go all parental on me. We got
a couple of tickets - it's no big.

466
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,070
Yes, yes, it is big, Jerry,

467
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,070
and the amazing thing is,
you don't see it.

468
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,900
You know what?

469
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,150
This has been fun,
really, a lot of fun,

470
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,150
but I think it's time
you go back to school.

471
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,300
I can't.

472
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,980
Why?

473
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,220
Because I dropped out.

474
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,470
What?

475
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,380
I don't need school.

476
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh, my god.

477
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,340
I know this guy, Randy Marshank,

478
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,730
he's making 10k a month with a web cam

479
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,710
and a girls' volleyball team.

480
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,670
Jerry, even for you,

481
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,340
that is the dumbest thing

482
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,120
I have ever heard in my life.

483
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,130
Why, because I want to do
something with my life?

484
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,070
No, you don't want to do
something with your life.

485
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,330
You want to avoid doing
anything with your life.

486
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,460
- I have a plan.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

487
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,730
You have a scam.
That's all you ever have.

488
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,830
You know what? I don't need this.

489
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,340
I don't need some nerd
who sits at a computer all day

490
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,350
telling me how to live my life -
I don't need you.

491
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,940
Good. Good.

492
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,130
'Cause I don't need
some irresponsible child

493
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,090
hanging around wrecking my apartment
and stealing my stuff!

494
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,750
- Lou?
- Yes?

495
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,750
What's wrong?

496
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,010
We've decrypted the chatter
from Fulton's militia.

497
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
It's about his next target.

498
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,230
What is it?

499
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,180
Jake Foley.

500
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,970
Foley.

501
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,530
Oh, whoa, oh, hey, man,
you were in the bar, right?

502
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,680
And you brought your friend.
Oh, is-is this about that girl?

503
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,730
I didn't touch her, man.
She said she was single.

504
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,990
Respect, bro - I'm all about respect.

505
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,510
Whoa! Whoa, take it easy.

506
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,570
It's... we should all
go back to the bar,

507
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,500
and I'm buying. Sorry about...

508
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,420
Let's go.

509
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,100
What?

510
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,020
Jake, it's Lou. You need
to come in right away.

511
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,610
They took my son away from me, Foley.

512
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,030
And you need to know...

513
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,390
That that was a mistake.

514
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,410
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.

515
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,820
I don't know you.
Why are you doing this to me?

516
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,400
This is the NSA nowadays?

517
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,550
We're going to win this war.

518
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,770
I'm talking about my family, Jake,

519
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,130
and how you're going
to pay for what you did.

520
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,850
I'm... not Jake.

521
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,160
I thought he was a little young.

522
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,810
He was at the bar spouting off.

523
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,040
- He said he was Jake Foley?
- Yeah, he had Jake Foley's I.D.

524
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,550
And credit card.

525
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,380
Jerry Foley. Jake's brother.

526
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,030
Oh, god. But at the bar...

527
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,830
Yes, at the bar he was 'spouting off'.
I remember.

528
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,290
I'm sorry, sir.

529
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,410
I failed you and your son.

530
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,650
You didn't fail.

531
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,390
In fact,

532
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,490
you might have saved my son's life.

533
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,000
What's going on?

534
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,180
We've had a communication
from a man claiming to be...

535
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,870
Ethan Fulton.

536
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,770
All right.

537
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
- Was it about me, or something?
- Yes.

538
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,530
- Where is he?
- We don't know.

539
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,610
What do the communications say?

540
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,610
That they've got your brother.

541
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,810
They want an exchange.

542
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,690
Him for Fulton's son.

543
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,700
And if we refuse?

544
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,380
What did it say?

545
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,050
If we don't release
Caleb in one hour...

546
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,940
they're going to kill Jerry.

547
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,830
Okay. Okay.

548
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,280
So, so, we have his son.

549
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,230
So, we figure out a way to do this.
Where do they want to do it?

550
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,760
- Jake...
- I get it.

551
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,710
- We have to get them to come to us.
- Jake,

552
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,000
the National Security Agency
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

553
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,490
What?

554
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,430
No, we have to...

555
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,280
This isn't a negotiation.

556
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,640
- We're just figuring out a way to...
- I realize this is difficult.

557
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,590
They have my brother!

558
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,870
And we are doing everything we can.

559
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,900
But we do not negotiate.

560
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,450
It only makes it more likely
that someone else's brother

561
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,160
or sister or father
will be taken in the future.

562
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,300
We have to help him.

563
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,260
I'm very sorry.

564
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,360
- Lou, we got to figure this out.
- Jake, I need a little time.

565
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,520
No, ee don't have a little time -
we don't have any time.

566
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,620
This is insane.
I'm not going to let them...

567
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,590
He needed me and
I wasn't there for him.

568
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,340
And now they're going... Please, please.

569
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,190
Jake, did you hear Skerritt said?
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

570
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,040
There's nothing I can do. I...

571
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,240
I can't go down to Caleb's
cell and let him out.

572
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,590
Do you understand?

573
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,480
I can't do that.

574
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,420
Jake, you have ten minutes,

575
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,330
and they're right behind you.

576
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,800
Does your brother love you?

577
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,730
We're about to find out how much.

578
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,330
He's got...

579
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,210
25 minutes.

580
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,780
Put this on.

581
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,860
- Why? What's going on?
- Don't ask me any questions.

582
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,760
I'm getting you out of here.

583
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,820
Good. Let's go.

584
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,260
Aw, come on.

585
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,980
This way. Go.

586
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,550
Go. Up the stairs.

587
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,740
Okay, try it now.

588
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,570
Isn't technology grand? Thanks.

589
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,930
What the...?

590
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,580
Call your father.

591
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,010
- I told you...
- Caleb, he has my brother.

592
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,080
He wants you in exchange. Now
I figure we've got about two minutes

593
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,540
before the NSA figures out that
you're gone and I took you.

594
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,110
So if you ever want to see your
dad again, you call him. Now!

595
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,620
Louise,

596
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,580
what you know about
Caleb Fulton escaping

597
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,940
from a supposedly secure lockdown?

598
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,990
I'm aware of the situation,

599
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,740
and I'm on it.

600
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,610
Well, you better be.

601
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,090
You made it.

602
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,000
I was pretty scared.

603
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,690
You're my son.

604
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,670
You never, ever be afraid of anyone.

605
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,580
Not them, understand me?

606
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,350
Yes, sir.

607
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,270
He came alone and unarmed.

608
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,840
You're a man of your word.

609
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,710
Where's my brother?

610
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,750
I'm a man of my word, too.

611
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,640
Oh, Jerry.

612
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,640
It's okay.

613
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,660
Come on, it's gonna be okay.

614
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,670
You moving on?

615
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,390
It's how we survive.

616
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,210
- What about Caleb?
- What about him?

617
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,110
He's just a kid.
Why don't you let him have a life?

618
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,350
Because his life is here
with his family - with me.

619
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,360
And I wouldn't overstay
my welcome if I were you.

620
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,880
Come on.

621
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,770
Watch your back. There are friendlies
in the building! Standing by.

622
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,570
This is the NSA.
Throw down your weapons

623
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,250
and come out with your hands up!
You are surrounded.

624
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,740
Hold your ground.

625
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,820
Weapons down! Let me see your hands!

626
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,970
Hands!

627
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,750
Clear!

628
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,920
Okay, we're clear.

629
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,400
You okay?

630
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,960
Yeah.

631
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,840
No. Caleb...

632
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,400
You okay, sir?

633
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,210
Well, we had a terrific
success last night.

634
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,760
We shut down the militia,

635
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,760
arrested Fulton and his men.

636
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,520
However...

637
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,620
I have people very high up
I have to answer to.

638
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,640
I realize that.

639
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,550
Do you?

640
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,920
And what am I supposed to tell them

641
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,650
about our policy

642
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,480
of never negotiating with terrorists?

643
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,250
Tell them we didn't.

644
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,470
God almighty, Beckett,

645
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,380
you got bigger ones than I do.

646
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,060
Thank you, sir.

647
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,650
You ready?

648
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,260
I think so.

649
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,510
You going to have any
trouble re-enrolling?

650
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,980
You mean the work studies
chick in admissions?

651
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,420
- Tight.
- Nice.

652
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,700
So now, uh, about the parental units?

653
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,390
Yeah, you came to check
out Georgetown...

654
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,050
because you insisted
on me having a plan...

655
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,050
once you get out of junior college.

656
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,300
Sweet. Thanks for everything.

657
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,730
Yeah.

658
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,570
Okay, enough of the Gilmore
Girls. Let's roll.

659
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,920
- So, can I ask you one question?
- Sure.

660
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,380
What exactly do you do at the NSA?

661
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,150
I could tell you, but then
I'd have to kill you.
