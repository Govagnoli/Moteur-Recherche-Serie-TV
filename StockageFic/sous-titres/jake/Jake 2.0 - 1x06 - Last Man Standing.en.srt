1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,170
See this? It's what
I use to monitor Jake

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,920
and track his vitals
and stuff like that.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,530
It's technology at its best.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,240
- Jake!
- Sarah!

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,160
- Who's the girl?
- Oh, it's Sarah.

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,390
Georgetown Sarah?
Lived in the same dorm

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,180
for four years and never
asked her out - Sarah?

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,940
That's the one.

9
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,760
See how the nanites
have positioned themselves

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,610
along his central nervous system?

11
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,200
What they're doing is establishing
contact with the brain.

12
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,600
The lab mice experienced muscle spasms.

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,700
In rare cases, they
rejected the nanites

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,680
and the result's not good.

15
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,450
What is going to happen to me?

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,640
I received your message.

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,000
I will meet you at the restaurant.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,950
Hmm.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,970
Buon giyrno, Lorenzo.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,040
Come sta? Bene?

21
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,170
Ciao, Maria.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,130
Antonio... piccolo

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,130
Antonio bebe laco

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,520
Antonio?

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,220
Antonio?

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,350
Oh, my god. Jake.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,270
Come on. Come on, Jake.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,620
Oh!

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,390
Jake! Wh... are you okay?

30
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,280
Yes, I'm fine.
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,150
Well, I was worried about you.

32
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,020
I checked your vitals,
and they-they showed...

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,710
Oh, no.

34
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,250
What?

35
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,470
Um...

36
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,470
my screen is frozen.

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,770
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,650
Oh, my god.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,170
That's me. Jake Foley,
I'm in Tech Support.

40
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,740
Security Clearance: Low.

41
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,730
Very low.

42
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,990
Then one day, it all changed.

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,150
Life just got real interesting.

44
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,980
Fran, we need to run
another diagnostic screen.

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,820
We've just run one.

46
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah. Well, his vitals are fading fast,

47
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,750
so we need to run another one.

48
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,610
Okay, okay, the screen, I know.

49
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,480
It was my fault, but there
was more to the story.

50
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,370
- I certainly hope so.
- Yeah.

51
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,170
See that mouse?

52
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,320
That's Antonio, who, unfortunately,

53
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,540
remains in the same state
in which I found him this morning -

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,460
that is, paralyzed.

55
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,400
Can I show you something?

56
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,690
This particular
side effect has occurred

57
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,610
on rare occasions in beta
versions of the nanites,

58
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,410
but never before
in this latest version.

59
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,690
- Is that what's in...
- Antonio. Yes.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,650
It's also what's in Jake.

61
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,590
- In fact, they're twins.
- Twins?

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,700
Yeah. They were injected
on the same day,

63
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,360
which is why... why I'm concerned.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,540
Is Jake showing any symptoms?

65
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,370
- Well... no, but...
- Dr. Hughes,

66
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,540
because if he is, I...
I need to know about it.

67
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,140
- Okay.
- I'm quite serious.

68
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,700
I can't afford to have Jake
being a risk out in the field.

69
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,570
Do you understand?

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,400
Yes. Of course.

71
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,850
Good.

72
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
Keep your eye on him.

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,560
Well, that's not going to be easy.

74
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,340
- Departure time?
- 9:00 A.M.

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,450
- What's the flight number?
- Flight 10-11.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,300
Hmm, that sounds really familiar.

77
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,100
Sarah, you're not going
to believe this.

78
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,090
- We are on the exact same flight.
- Great.

79
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,740
Mm-hmm. Hey,
are you staying at that inn -

80
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,210
- what's that place called?
- No. I'm staying at the Bay Lodge.

81
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,820
Yeah. I thought the lodge
looked better, too.

82
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,880
We can share a car.

83
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,330
Sure. Sure we can share a car.
That's a great idea.

84
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,210
- Okay. Friday at 10:00.
- See ya.

85
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,680
Jake.

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,200
Yes?

87
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,200
- Could I have a word?
- Sure.

88
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,090
Ow!

89
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,130
How could this come as a surprise?

90
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,470
I put my request in to Human
Resources three weeks ago.

91
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,340
Well, unbeknownst to Human Resources,

92
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,510
you have a half billion dollars'
worth of research inside of you.

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,430
Research that many people
would like to get their hands on.

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,130
It's a wedding.

95
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,980
- You're still at risk.
- From what,

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,760
drunken bridesmaids?

97
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,900
Lou, I woke up this morning

98
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,780
with guns in my face.

99
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,800
What's next,
sidearm chaperones on dates?

100
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,550
Permission to go potty?

101
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,390
It's for your own protection, Jake.

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,510
And I appreciate that,

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,240
but I need to have
a life outside of this.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,650
My friend is getting married.

105
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,690
I'm his best man.

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,370
Please.

107
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,200
All I'm asking for here is two days.

108
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,160
Two days of a normal life.

109
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,760
Sarah, hey.

110
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,650
Glad this worked out.

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,200
I, uh... you know, it's great
about Kevin and Jen. I like you.

112
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,290
Hey, Sarah, hey.

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,280
Glad this worked out with
the car and the whole flight.

114
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,380
Maybe we could go out
sometime and cut the rug...

115
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,630
it's funny how, you know,
they've been friends for so long,

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,830
and we've been friends for so long -
not that we should get married.

117
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm not saying that.

118
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,030
Definitely not saying that.

119
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Sorry I'm late.

120
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,770
Hey!

121
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,450
I just got caught up, and... anyway.

122
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,950
Don't worry about it - I'm just
glad this whole thing worked out.

123
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,480
So, pretty great about Kevin and Jen.

124
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,700
Been friends for so long,
getting married. It's amazing.

125
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah. I knew eventually
they'd figure it out.

126
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,200
- Yeah.
- Okay, so we got to go.

127
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,200
Oh. Okay. Um, listen...

128
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,950
- We have all day to talk.
- Yeah.

129
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,720
- Hi.
- Oh, uh, Jake, Alex. Alex, Jake.

130
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,520
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You, too.

131
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,670
Um, let me sit in the middle.

132
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,020
Oh, you guys, this weekend's
going to be so much fun.

133
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,580
- Yeah, it's going to be great.
- Okay.

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,070
Dude...

135
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,430
Hey, man, how's it going?

136
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,230
What's up, Kev?

137
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,890
Yeah! Whoa!

138
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,950
Can't believe you're still wearing
the same old ratty jacket.

139
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,870
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe
you're still losing your hair.

140
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,690
Hey! Let's not hit

141
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,480
a guy below the belt on his wedding.

142
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,010
So... finally happened.

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,070
Yeah, a lot quicker than
I expected, believe me.

144
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,450
I thought for sure I was going
to be the last one to go.

145
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,420
No, no, apparently, that's me.

146
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,140
Speaking of which, am I
the only single person here?

147
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,450
What happened? I thought
you were coming with Sarah.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,140
You know, that didn't
exactly work out as planned.

149
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,550
Uh-huh.

150
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,510
You still haven't
told her how you feel.

151
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,860
- It's all about timing.
- Right, yeah, years and years of timing.

152
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,860
Come on, buddy, step off the ledge.

153
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,580
- I mean, look, it happened with Jenny.
- You stalked her.

154
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,050
Whatever. She said yes.

155
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,510
Hey, oh, listen, um,
just go grab yourself a drink,

156
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,660
and, um, I'll go find my bride.

157
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,220
She's dying to see you.
Thanks for coming.

158
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,110
- Okay, man.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

159
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,340
Hey, Fran?

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
- Can you do me a favor?
- What?

161
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,270
If, uh, if we're asked any questions
about the mice or Jake...

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,210
just let me know first.

163
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,560
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

164
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,350
Yep. Having fun.

165
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,790
Aww, finally, a familiar face. Hey.

166
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,170
I swear, I've been meeting relatives
I didn't even know existed.

167
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,110
- Jen, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

168
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,790
You're much too beautiful for this guy.

169
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,800
Well, what can I say?
Geeks turn me on.

170
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,360
- Yeah. Ha!
- Hmm.

171
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,300
So, a lot of people are looking
forward to that toast.

172
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,730
- Oh, yeah, how is that coming, by the way?
- Uh, it's,...

173
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,630
um, right in here.

174
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,680
- You got nothing.
- Not a word.

175
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,080
Oh, Jake.

176
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,990
Honey, Aunt Lois wants to see you.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,460
Oh, is she sober?

178
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,500
Uh, for the moment,
so now's a good time.

179
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,340
- Okay.
- Good luck.

180
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,540
Hey, hey, who's that guy over there?

181
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,410
Well, who are you talking about?

182
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,410
The guy walking away -
he's been looking at me.

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,460
Oh, that's probably my cousin Phil.

184
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,220
He's a really weird dude.

185
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,700
Hey. He's single. Ha.

186
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,060
Ha-ha. Jerk.

187
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,130
Oh, great.

188
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,920
That's me.

189
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,990
Oh, hi. Um...

190
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh, here, you want to, uh...
have a seat.

191
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,640
- Thank you.
- Sure.

192
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm Jake Foley.

193
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,760
- Nice to meet you, Jake Foley.
- You, too

194
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,410
are you bride or groom?

195
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,260
Bride - we work together.

196
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,210
Ah. Groom - best man.

197
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,510
So, I, uh, guess they...

198
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,420
meant for us to meet.

199
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,740
Hey, baby.

200
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,770
Honey! I'd like you to meet Jake.

201
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,530
Jake, this is Rachel,

202
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,110
my partner.

203
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,690
- Did you see that one?
- Yeah.

204
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,850
Isn't that funny. With the beard.

205
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,380
I don't know what's going on.

206
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,740
What am I doing?

207
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
No, no, no.

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,970
Alex, stop. That tickles.

209
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,240
Oh, how about this?

210
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,350
Oh, that's perfect.

211
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,260
How about here?

212
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,410
Idiot. Idiot.

213
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,310
All right, all right.

214
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,320
Hello.

215
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,270
Jake, hey, it's Diane.

216
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,210
What are you doing?

217
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,950
- Nothing.
- Really?

218
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,610
I just noticed some
nanite activity, so...

219
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,000
Diane, you're monitoring
me at a wedding.

220
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,050
I'm sorry, Jake. It's my job.

221
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,500
I know. I know, I know. I'm sorry.

222
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,460
- It's just... it's just...
- What?

223
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,460
Nothing. It's nothing.

224
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,980
Jake...

225
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,670
I don't know, I guess I'm just
frustrated, you know. I'm here,

226
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,050
all my friends are here and they're
all moving on with their lives.

227
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,780
They're all...

228
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
falling in love and
they're having families

229
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,590
and it's just so clear
that I'm going nowhere.

230
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,470
Jake, listen, all these things
that you're feeling -

231
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,660
they're... they're very common. I mean,

232
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,720
just about everybody experiences
them at one time or another.

233
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,960
I mean, in med school we
even coined a term for it.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,750
Oh, yeah, what's that?

235
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,580
Yeah, "single syndrome."

236
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,580
Is it fatal?

237
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,890
No. It's just mildly depressing.

238
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,600
In the meantime,

239
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,160
just try and get some sleep, okay?

240
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,970
- Thanks, Diane.
- Good night.

241
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,690
Good night.

242
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,260
Who is it?

243
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,890
Hi.

244
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,230
Hey.

245
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,900
You're surprised.

246
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,430
A little bit.

247
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,180
Well, I checked with an expert
on the whole single syndrome thing,

248
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,690
and he said you should never
go to a wedding without a date.

249
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,510
So here I am.

250
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,850
I mean, not as your date -

251
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,390
just as a friend posing as your date.

252
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Diane, uh, you didn't have to...

253
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,000
No, no, I know. I had all
these frequent-flier miles

254
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,610
and I kind of always wanted
to see Seattle, so...

255
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,310
I can't believe you flew
all the way out here.

256
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,980
Yeah.

257
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,120
So you're buying breakfast.

258
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,010
Oh, so the whole bouquet thing -

259
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,100
it's like why don't you
just shine a spotlight

260
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,810
down on all the single,
desperate women whose entire

261
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,320
fate lies in the hands of this bride

262
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,680
just blindly throwing
flowers over her head.

263
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,660
And then you have me. I mean, at my height,
do you think I even stand a chance?

264
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,720
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

265
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,730
I don't think I can eat this.

266
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,730
What? Why not?

267
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,630
My stomach's all in knots.

268
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,440
- Really, since when?
- I don't know. Uh, a couple days ago.

269
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,480
- Okay, well, is it... is it?
- Put it away!

270
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,890
- Jake, this could be serious.
- It's not serious.

271
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,100
It's the wedding toast, okay?

272
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,070
This happens every time
I have to speak in public.

273
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,880
Sorry.

274
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,760
Can I help at all?

275
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,740
No, no, I'm beyond help.
It's like watching a train wreck.

276
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,490
It's okay. Everyone expects a disaster,

277
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,490
and I deliver every time.

278
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,280
Jake. Dude, paint ball.

279
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,400
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Paint ball?

280
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,420
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

281
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,060
You know, the whole battle before
the battle type of thing. You okay?

282
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,800
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

283
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,800
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

284
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,130
- Let's go.
- C'mon.

285
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,410
David.

286
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,150
Redner.

287
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,800
Jesse.

288
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,630
Meeks.

289
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,340
Uh... Shefflin.

290
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,040
Spider.

291
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,760
Later, Foley.

292
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,560
Okay, guys, listen up.

293
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,580
This may very well be the last time

294
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,640
I get to see all of you guys...

295
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,420
without permission.

296
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,940
But, and despite of the fact

297
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,320
that we are all about to go to war,

298
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,310
let's not forget we came
here to have some fun, okay?

299
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,080
So remember, safety first, guys.

300
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,790
Ow! Ow! Ow!

301
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,750
That doesn't count, does it?

302
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,320
That's my best man.

303
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay, guys, let's do it.

304
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,250
Oh, Fran. It's Diane.
Anything on Antonio?

305
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,700
Not yet. I'm still reviewing
the backup data.

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,920
- Okay, so you'll let me know?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,920
So, how's Jake?

308
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,150
Oh, he's fine. I feel kind of silly.

309
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,690
Well, it's better that you went anyway.

310
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,350
Yeah. So listen, call me
when you're done, okay?

311
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,580
All right.

312
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,020
Honey. We're right over here.

313
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,350
- They already started.
- Okay, started what?

314
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,070
- Oh, no thank you, but this really
- Honey...

315
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,760
This is so not my thing.

316
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,730
Looking glamorous is

317
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,710
every woman's thing.

318
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,850
Oh, thank you. Ooh.

319
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,460
Okay.

320
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,740
You're a dead man, Foley!

321
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,580
- Who've you got?
- It's just Foley.

322
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,500
This is going to be easy.

323
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,770
Okay, you flank right. I'll go left.

324
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,740
He'll have nowhere to run.
On three, ready?

325
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,280
One... two... three.

326
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,440
Well, that was easy.

327
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,240
Damn.

328
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,060
Mani-pedi's one of life's
greatest pleasures.

329
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,270
I'm a virgin.

330
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,880
Well, I'm a mani-pedi virgin.

331
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,570
It's my first time.

332
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,300
- You're kidding?
- No.

333
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,220
I always thought they were
like a big waste of time.

334
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,300
And now I see that that's the point.

335
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,210
Oh, exactly.

336
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm Sarah Carter.

337
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,140
Oh... Oh, hi.

338
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,030
Oh, I'm so sorry!

339
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm Diane Hughes. I'm really sorry.

340
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,060
- Don't worry about it. Don't worry.
- Oh, god.

341
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,860
So are you with the bride or the groom?

342
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,740
Oh, the groom... I guess.

343
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,620
Although I haven't actually met him.

344
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,230
I'm with Jake.

345
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,960
- Jake Foley?
- Yeah.

346
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,040
- We went to college together.
- Yeah, I know.

347
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,210
He's mentioned you to me before...

348
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,800
once.

349
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,600
Just once.

350
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,480
Oh, uh...

351
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,880
that's so weird, 'cause we
rode to the airport together

352
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,880
and he never mentioned bringing a date.

353
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,380
Well, I'm not actually
his date. I'm his doctor.

354
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,940
Well, I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

355
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,050
So it was a last minute thing.

356
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,850
I guess so.

357
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,180
So how'd you meet?

358
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,180
Just at work.

359
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,090
So you're a doctor at the NSA?

360
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,100
Mm-hmm. Yes, Research.

361
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,780
That must be really interesting.

362
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,560
Yeah.

363
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,560
What kind of research do you do?

364
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,190
Oh, I'm in...

365
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,960
I am not allowed to tell you.

366
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,580
It's a... confidentiality thing.

367
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,460
- Right.
- Sarah!

368
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,220
Um... oh, Valerie's open.

369
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,940
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

370
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,680
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

371
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,350
Hey, Jake.

372
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,110
All right, all right, you got me.

373
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,610
Hey, fella...

374
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,010
I think you've got to turn down
your pressure a little bit.

375
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,050
What's the matter, Jake, you afraid?

376
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,870
Seriously, man, you're
going to hurt somebody.

377
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,620
Exactly.

378
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,570
Jake, where you going?

379
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,470
Hey, Jake, come back.
I just want to talk.

380
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,650
Hey, Jake, wait up, Jake.

381
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,310
Fantastic.

382
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
Absolutely beautiful.

383
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,790
You've outdone yourself.

384
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,230
Hi. I'm all yours.

385
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,760
Okay.

386
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,750
Aw, Jake, where you been?

387
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,220
I've got this little thing
today - it's called a wedding.

388
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,310
Your cousin Phil is out
of his freakin' mind.

389
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,050
- Yeah, so?
- Seriously.

390
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,870
- He was trying to hurt me out there.
- With paint balls?

391
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah.

392
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,910
- Paint balls?
- Yes. Yes.

393
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,880
- My cousin, Phil?
- Yeah...

394
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,380
- That's Phil?
- Yeah.

395
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,020
Hey. I'm Jake.

396
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,850
You think maybe you were
a little aggressive out there?

397
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,580
Yeah, there's nothing
like a good hunt, huh?

398
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,990
Yeah. Fun, fun, maybe for you.

399
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,400
I had you until that jump.

400
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,840
Where'd you learn how to do that?

401
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,810
Uh... well, it was

402
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,790
a lot lower than it looked.

403
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,810
Yeah, I guess it was.

404
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,930
Hey, I didn't catch your name.

405
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,230
See you at the wedding.

406
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,840
- Paul, where's Jake?
- I don't know.

407
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,050
Oh, man.

408
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,770
Well, unbeknownst to human resources

409
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,400
you have a half billion dollars
worth of research inside of you.

410
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,500
Research that a lot of people
would like to get their hands on.

411
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
There's nothing like a good hunt, huh?

412
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,910
You are still at risk.

413
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,390
It's for your own safety.

414
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,570
Secure line to Deputy
Director Louise Beckett.

415
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,880
What? Uh, oh, yeah. Uh,

416
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,990
Alpha Charlie Tango 4271.

417
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,200
No, no, no, listen,
this is an emergen... hello?

418
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,430
Hi. Have you noticed
all the activity outside?

419
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,280
That's my daughter's wedding beginning.

420
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,280
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

421
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,860
I need you to call the police.

422
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,520
May I ask why?

423
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,210
Yeah. 'Cause there's a guy in room 214

424
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,050
who's trying to kill me, that's why.

425
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,170
That was 214?

426
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,990
Yes. Yes. Room 214.

427
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,440
Dude... Jake... what is your deal, man?

428
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,960
Everyone in there is waiting on you.

429
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,550
I'm sorry. Just give me one second.

430
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,810
Jake, dude, you're my best man, okay?

431
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,610
I'm kind of freaking out here.
I really need you.

432
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,610
He needs you.

433
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,200
Okay? You're right.
You're right, let's go.

434
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,070
Call them now.

435
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,910
- I think she's up ahead on the right.
- What?

436
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,350
Diane, your date. We met.

437
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,280
Oh, great.

438
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,250
She seems really, um...

439
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,970
interesting.

440
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,830
Yeah. Yes, she is.

441
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,620
You keep a good secret, Jake.

442
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,190
What?

443
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,060
I looked across the room
and I thought to myself,

444
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,220
"that girl is totally out of my reach."

445
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,230
Jenny,

446
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,450
being with you has taught
me how to love

447
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,250
and be loved.

448
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,830
Makes realize

449
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,780
nothing is beyond my reach.

450
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,790
Jake...

451
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,560
Jake...

452
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,410
ring.

453
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,020
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

454
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,200
Here you go.

455
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,120
Jenny...

456
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,860
I love you.

457
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,630
Oh, man.

458
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,750
That was beautiful.

459
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,530
Fran!

460
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,890
Deputy Director Beckett called.
She's checking up on Jake.

461
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,720
What do I say?

462
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,750
Fran, don't tell her where I am.

463
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,730
Tell her I'll call her back.

464
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,650
May this beautiful day

465
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,760
shine eternally in your lives.

466
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,160
May it add brilliance

467
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,050
to every achievement

468
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,000
and cast a divine light

469
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,760
over any misfortune.

470
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,600
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

471
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,230
And...

472
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,280
may all that is virtuous,

473
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,580
beautiful and honest
remain in your lives.

474
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,890
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

475
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,330
to introduce you to...
Kevin and Jenny,

476
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,290
husband and wife.

477
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,810
You may kiss the bride.

478
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,340
It starts with the muscles.

479
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,400
First you think it's just tension.

480
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,670
What are you talking about?

481
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,180
Poison.

482
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,580
It's in your water bottle.
You were very thirsty.

483
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,470
Spreads to the eyes and the ears...

484
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,030
and soon there'll be nothing left.

485
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,250
Not even the nanites can help you.

486
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
It's not worth the fight, Jake.

487
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,460
You're already dead.

488
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,300
Fran, it's Diane. Do you have
anything on Antonio?

489
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,900
Yeah, there was an abnormal
increase in nanite activity

490
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,340
around the interior cortex.
But this is where it gets weird.

491
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,360
On his brain, Antonio had a massive

492
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,300
cluster of nanites in his frontal lobe.

493
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,400
Oh, no. No.

494
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,740
What happened?

495
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,620
Where is he?

496
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,150
Where's Jake?

497
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,970
- You know Jake Foley?
- Yes. What happened?

498
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,120
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

499
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,940
Mr. Foley was seen on security camera
breaking into one of the rooms.

500
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,380
- What? Why?
- We have no idea.

501
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,770
Jake.

502
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,460
Diane, get out of here. He's after me.

503
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,090
Jake, no one is after you.

504
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,980
- No, he's trying to kill me.
- Jake...

505
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,230
Jake, listen to me. It's the nanites.

506
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,470
The nanites are killing you.

507
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,950
What?

508
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,530
Okay, okay go and lay down, okay?

509
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,750
Okay? Oh... lay down.

510
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,650
Okay, don't worry, Jake.

511
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,480
We're going to figure this out, okay?

512
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,190
- Diane. Diane.
- What?

513
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,360
- Diane.
- What?

514
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,960
Diane...

515
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,940
he's here. He's in the room.

516
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,190
Jake, Jake, listen to me.

517
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,410
What you are seeing is not real.

518
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,800
Diane, he's right behind you.

519
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,340
No. No, this is all in your mind.

520
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,790
The nanites are rejecting you.
They are overloading your brain

521
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,810
with electrical impulses
and making you see things

522
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,660
that are not there.

523
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,850
Jake, look, I need you to see this.

524
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,760
That's got to be uncomfortable.

525
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,110
Okay, up.

526
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,830
I got this from hotel security.

527
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,880
It's from earlier today.
Who are you talking to?

528
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,050
- He was there.
- No.

529
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,810
No. I know it doesn't make
sense to you right now,

530
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,560
but you have to trust me.

531
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,560
In his room, the pictures of me.

532
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,560
The room was empty.

533
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,500
This is all in your mind.

534
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,320
There has to be
something in the kernel.

535
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,840
Diane...

536
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,880
Maybe the code is self-replicating,

537
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,930
- or there's a memory link.
- Diane...

538
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,550
Diane,

539
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,270
I can't move.

540
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,010
Jake, it's in here.

541
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,010
The answer is in here
somewhere and I will find it.

542
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,880
There's no more time.

543
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,510
- You got to reboot.
- No, we can't do that.

544
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,290
- Why not?
- Because the nanites are fully integrated

545
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,030
into your system.
They are part of you.

546
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,940
If I shut them down,
it will kill you.

547
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,030
Maybe just for a second.

548
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,190
No. No. We don't know that.
There's got to be another way.

549
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,430
Jake,

550
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,650
no, I will not be the one to kill you.

551
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,030
Please...

552
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,780
Okay. Okay, okay,

553
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,740
I'm setting up the command structure.

554
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,840
The link is set.

555
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,820
She can't save you, Jake.

556
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,330
Okay. You are okay.

557
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,380
You are okay. Are you ready?

558
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,980
Okay.

559
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,200
Jake!

560
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,800
One, two, three.

561
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,660
Come on, Jake.

562
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,620
One, two...

563
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
One... come on!

564
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,550
Two, three.

565
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,450
Come on! Jake!

566
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,250
Jake!

567
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,850
Jake?

568
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,430
I'm sorry.

569
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,250
Jake!

570
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,270
Hey!

571
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,270
Who are you?

572
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,970
What?

573
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,150
I'm just kidding.

574
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

575
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,640
No, no!

576
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,020
Diane, Diane,

577
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,970
I'm the best man.

578
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,770
Please?

579
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,870
I have a toast to give.

580
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,060
I'm okay.

581
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,260
I'm okay.

582
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,850
Okay.

583
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,580
Give me a second.

584
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,020
Director Beckett, Hi. It's Diane.

585
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,990
You're asking about Jake?

586
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,930
Yeah, have you heard from him?

587
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,120
Yeah, I spoke to him
this morning and he's fine.

588
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,570
I overreacted as usual.

589
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,080
All right.

590
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,030
We'll see you Monday.

591
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,890
Okay, bye.

592
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,490
Congratulations.

593
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,260
Thanks, buddy.

594
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,470
- Here we go.
- Oh.

595
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,100
I know you've all been looking
forward to this, so, uh,

596
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,380
here goes.

597
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,430
Life

598
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,190
is, uh,

599
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,630
hard, you know?

600
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,970
Brace yourself, folks.

601
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,820
Thank you.

602
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,570
Go on, Jake.

603
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,220
Okay.

604
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,200
Jenny,

605
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Kevin may need more
professional help than most,

606
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,060
but he's a terrific guy,

607
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,390
and he loves you more than anything.

608
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,370
And, Kevin,

609
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,860
science may never
discover how it happened,

610
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,320
but you won Jenny's heart;

611
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,930
and, to me, that's
the real miracle here.

612
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,820
We're lucky if we're
able to find someone

613
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,650
who's always there for us,

614
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,250
who stands by us

615
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,190
no matter what.

616
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,280
Makes life easier.

617
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,790
So,

618
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,640
to my friends,

619
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,620
to our good friends,

620
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,480
Kevin and Jenny.

621
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,700
Thanks, buddy.

622
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,320
Hey. Your toast was really beautiful.

623
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,240
It seems like you got over your fear.

624
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,570
Yeah. Yeah, I guess

625
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,640
it was all in my head.

626
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,330
So,

627
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,820
where's Alex?

628
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Oh. I think he found
somebody more his type.

629
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,090
I don't get it.

630
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,980
Alex is gay; he's a friend.

631
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,460
I just hate coming
to these things alone.

632
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,600
But I thought I heard...

633
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,910
I thought that Joe...
So you're not...?

634
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,700
Oh, no, no. No.

635
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,400
The closest Alex
gets to me is a facial.

636
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,980
Oh.

637
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,360
Well...

638
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,180
So, uh, I guess I'm, I'm dateless.

639
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,750
Yeah.

640
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,120
Um...

641
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,940
I think we're supposed to dance now.

642
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,410
Yeah.

643
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,330
Sarah,

644
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,220
I think I need to dance with my date.

645
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,540
Would you like to dance?

646
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,830
Aren't you supposed to...?

647
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,260
Yes.

648
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,820
I forgot to tell you something.

649
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,290
What?

650
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,160
You look beautiful.

651
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,800
Grazi.
