1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,240
I know it's an important meeting.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm wearing a tie. But my car

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,230
was on fire.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,400
Yes, fire.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,990
Flames of fire shooting
out of the hood.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,890
And the auto club's taking their
sweet time getting here.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,040
What? What

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,270
I-I can't hear... hello?

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,090
Hello? Okay, there.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,040
Can you hear me now? Good.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,860
Maybe if I stand here long enough,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,640
we can have a full conversation.

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,890
No, I don't think it's
my crappy carrier,

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,910
I think it's my cheap, crappy phone.

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,830
Just-just... just tell Lou

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,960
that I'll be there as soon as
they tow my car, okay?

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,500
All right, thank you. Diane,
thank you. You're the best.

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,830
Wow. Nice car.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,690
Uh... yeah.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,830
Yeah. It's a 355 spider.

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,310
You like cars?

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,040
I like this car.

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
What's not to like? It's a beauty.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,780
Eight cylinder, six-speed engine.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,930
Smooth grain leather.
You know these things are

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,410
assembled entirely by hand.

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,610
You're right.

28
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,900
What's not to like?

29
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,450
All right, call for a tow?

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,110
Just a, uh... Yeah. Right here.

31
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,280
Right. Where you want me
to haul this steaming pile,

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,220
garage or straight to the junkyard?

33
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,920
Garage would be fine. Thanks.

34
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,590
Sorry. My car broke...

35
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,650
broke down.

36
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,880
Hope you brought cash, Romeo.

37
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,710
Your membership's expired.

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,200
What?

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,150
Man...

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,770
What's going on?

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,220
Uh... someone's just
hacked into our accounts.

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,300
What? What are you talking about?

43
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,160
We're being robbed.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,820
They've got a million.

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,890
How? Th-this is a restricted system.

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,930
- Million and a half.
- Stop them.

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,050
I can't.

48
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,760
The United States Federal Reserve:

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,980
$300 billion.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,060
A big marble building
to keep track of it:

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,970
$10 million

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,130
Stealing $2 Million from the Man:

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,040
Priceless

54
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,210
That's me. Jake Foley,

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm in Tech Support.
Security Clearance:

56
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,860
Low.

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,640
Very low.

58
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,740
Then one day, it all changed.

59
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,780
Life just got real interesting.

60
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,080
James Bond, Napoleon Solo,
Steve Austin.

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,310
You never saw any of those
guys count pennies for a tow.

62
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,310
Okay, you can't compare
yourself to Steve Austin.

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,970
He was a man barely alive.
They had to rebuild him.

64
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,410
Laugh it up. My auto repair estimates

65
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,310
come in as bad as I think
they are, I'm gonna be

66
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,230
the world's first
ride-sharing superspy.

67
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,860
Okay, (A) ride sharing? Hello?

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
It's an idea whose time has come.

69
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,050
And (B) eventually they're
gonna give you a company car.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,970
- What? Really? When?
- Oh, yeah,

71
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,600
in a couple years.

72
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,570
Oh, great. Well, maybe
by then, Human Resources

73
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,610
will have processed my R-12 form,
and I'll start getting paid.

74
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,110
You know, I made more when I was
de-fragging hard drives around here

75
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,170
than I do fighting Uncle Sam's
enemies. And you know why?

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,920
Two words: Overtime.

77
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah, uh, Uncle Sam's enemies

78
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,670
don't punch a clock. Come on.

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,470
This M.O. matches a cyber-criminal gang

80
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,370
- we've been tracking.
- Ooh, guys.

81
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,940
Our intel on them is limited.
They're pretty clever.

82
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,910
This isn't the Bedford Falls
Savings & Loan.

83
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,480
This is the Federal Reserve
Bank of the United States.

84
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,380
The people of this country depend on us

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,860
to keep their tax dollars
safe from criminals,

86
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,960
even the very clever ones.

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,370
We have our best people
on this. We'll get a lead.

88
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,370
We already have one. Look.

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,120
This crest is from
Ironhawk Knight Quest.

90
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,380
Could be a fifth-level mage.
Not really sure about the...

91
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,930
Ironhawk Knight Quest?

92
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,680
It's an online role-playing game.

93
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,810
Okay, thousands of people
can play at the same time.

94
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,570
I'd put money on it

95
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,310
you spend enough time poking
around in that environment,

96
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,150
you're eventually gonna find this guy.

97
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,390
Oh, you're throwing
fireballs at me now,

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,480
is that how it's gonna be?
Well, bring it on, little man.

99
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,450
Is he still playing that on-line game?

100
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,680
He cut off my leg!

101
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,210
18 hours and counting.
This better be the guy.

102
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,580
Please tell me we're close.

103
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,860
We are. We're running a reverse
IP lookup on that wizard,

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,990
but the player is re-routing his signal
through offshore data havens.

105
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,390
We just have to keep
him online a little longer.

106
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,780
Not longer, you're killing me.
I haven't slept,

107
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,950
I haven't showered,
and I have one leg.

108
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,770
Why don't you just use
that dagger thing?

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,750
You, go away. Now. Now.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,140
We've got him.

111
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,700
Oh. Thank god.

112
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,750
Ow.

113
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,160
Five, four,

114
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,610
three, two,

115
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,380
one.

116
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,020
Get away from the desk, Dumont!

117
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,160
Hands where I can see
them now. Come on!

118
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,160
I saw you on my security cameras.

119
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,160
Your cover formation is sloppy.

120
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,330
Your men have the weaver
stance all wrong.

121
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,330
I deserve better for my tax dollars.

122
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Jake...

123
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,090
- he's erasing the hard drive.
- What?

124
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,360
Don't even try. It's over.

125
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,770
How'd he do that?

126
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,580
That's your tax dollars at work.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
You get what you pay for.

128
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,000
Get him out of here.

129
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,870
I want my lawyer

130
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,330
Uh-oh.

131
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,190
What's wrong?

132
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,210
Well, it's asking for a password.

133
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,720
Can't you just do your thing?

134
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,150
No, I can't just do my thing

135
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,370
'cause the password's
not in the computer,

136
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,620
it's in his head.

137
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,800
You know what I love about passwords?

138
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,510
It can take years to figure them out.

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,690
You named your cell phone "Fionavar,"

140
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,960
your mp-3 player "Earthsea,"

141
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,880
your PDA "Gondor."

142
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,480
All your passwords are kings
in those fantasy novels.

143
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,510
Foley, you're embarrassing yourself.

144
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,270
Oh, now when I saw your hard
drive was named "gormenghast,"

145
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,100
now that really narrowed things down.

146
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,640
'Cause it could've Titus groan,

147
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,420
or it could've been his
dad lord sepulchrave...

148
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,800
It takes more than an underpaid
tech grub to crack me.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,020
Well, then I-I pictured you

150
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,640
at your computer with
your little black chair

151
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,490
and sunglasses.

152
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,390
And I realized that

153
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,270
your password could only be

154
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,010
the Death Owl.

155
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,850
You're bluffing.

156
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,710
Well, thanks, Death Owl,

157
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,830
'cause this underpaid
tech grub just got you

158
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,580
to hand over your password.

159
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,890
Foley...

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,730
you're talented,

161
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,810
but when you wake up tomorrow
you're still gonna be the same

162
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,630
government droid sellout.

163
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,850
- You're still gonna be in that cell.
- Don't bet on it.

164
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,300
You know the difference between
you and me? I've lived.

165
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,150
I've been to every continent,
and I've eaten every food,

166
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,530
and I've had hotter sex
than you'll ever know...

167
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,310
and when I get out
with the sole mission

168
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,800
to personally frag your ass
for depriving me of that,

169
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,290
you're still gonna be the same
thrift-store- clothes-wearing,

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,310
six-dollar-haircut loser
I see before me.

171
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,930
Here's what Jake found
in Dumont's computer.

172
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,120
There are four other hackers in the ring.
They don't use their real names.

173
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,070
The two virus engineers
call themselves Clu and Bit.

174
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,080
Telco specialist is Yori.

175
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,740
And the one with the online
handle "MacP" plans the jobs.

176
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,430
He wants the others to meet
him in Berlin in two days.

177
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,320
They're willing to risk
a meeting this soon

178
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,320
after robbing the Federal Reserve?

179
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,460
- What is he planning?
- Well, I suggest to place

180
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,510
someone undercover in
Dumont's place and find out.

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,910
- They've never seen him?
- No, they never met in person.

182
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,660
They're so paranoid,
they haven't exchanged photos.

183
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,990
It's all e-mails, IRC chats,
numbered Cayman accounts.

184
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,110
What do we know about this Dumont?

185
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,580
Got a Ph.D. at 15.

186
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,150
Recruited to write
software for Banatech.

187
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,020
Six months in, he quits.

188
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,190
Dumont accussed Banatch
of stealing his ideas.

189
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,980
He's been underground ever since.

190
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,640
All right, make a list.
Who's available,

191
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,450
who's qualified, who fits the profile.

192
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,450
Ah, if ever an assignment
screamed Agent Foley...

193
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,420
- I don't think so, Jake.
- Oh, why not?

194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,770
I found Dumont, I cracked
his hard drive. I can do this.

195
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
No, Jake, we're talking
about going overseas

196
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,730
and infiltrating a criminal gang.

197
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,800
Agents train for years
to do this type of duty.

198
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,390
Yeah, but these aren't drug dealers.
They're not terrorists.

199
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,090
They're nerds. They're like...
they're like nerds gone wild.

200
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,650
These are my people.

201
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,020
Okay, what's your in?

202
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,010
I show up, wait for them to contact me.

203
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,900
- Now when they do?
- Get them talking.

204
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,350
- Wrong. - Don't you want me
to find out about the job?

205
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,450
Let the information come to you, Jake.

206
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,590
- Observe and gather.
- What if they're not buying it?

207
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,150
What if they start
asking me questions?

208
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,780
Well, you tell me.

209
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,120
- I walk away.
- You walk away.

210
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,950
Where's your primary safe house?

211
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,960
Lisberger apartments
number 98 Alexanderplatz

212
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,890
- Secondary.
- 221-B Backer Strasse.

213
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,360
Good.

214
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,570
Okay, passport...

215
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,250
wallet...

216
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,850
euro dollars.

217
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,800
- Wow, these are cool.
- Jake.

218
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,960
Right. I'm listening.

219
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,620
Your cell phone functions
as a streaming video transmitter.

220
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,660
Show us what they look like, okay?

221
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,980
- Where are you gonna keep it?
- Uh, my coat lining.

222
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,000
No, it's a cell phone.

223
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,750
Right. It's a phone.
Treat it like a phone.

224
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,460
Where'd you go to school?

225
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,210
Carnegie Mellon for undergrad,
cal tech for my masters,

226
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,790
Doctorate at MIT and did my
thesis on heuristic algorithms.

227
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,660
Too much information.

228
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,880
Never give them enough
to catch you in a lie.

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,400
Weapons.

230
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
I can't take any.

231
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,400
That's right.

232
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,760
You'll be alone and unarmed.

233
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,830
Jake, I think I've told you
everything I can.

234
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,950
From now on, your best defense,
your only defense...

235
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,070
is knowing Dumont inside out.

236
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,570
You have twelve hours to become him.

237
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,960
Hi, I'm Dumont.

238
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,730
Dumont

239
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,650
Yeah. That's good.

240
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm Dumont.

241
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,020
Yeah, I ride bikes.

242
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,290
Different one every day. Today?

243
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,450
Well, today's the KTM-525 SX, Babe.

244
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

245
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,930
Like the wind.

246
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,490
Oh! Hey!

247
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
My car.

248
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,260
Wir mochten mit ihnen sprechen.
Commen sie mit

249
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,470
German intelligence.
You are under arrest.

250
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,590
Look, I told you,
my name is Kevin Flynn.

251
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,670
I don't know who this "Dumont" is.

252
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,910
Don't patronize us.

253
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,000
Dumont is your online handle.

254
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,120
We know you robbed
the American Federal Reserve.

255
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,250
And we know you're working
with at least four others,

256
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,010
attacking systems,
rerouting transfers,

257
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,810
appropriating millions.

258
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,770
And you will give us their names.

259
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,670
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

260
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,670
Every nation in the european union

261
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,540
has a jail cell ready for you.

262
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,640
If you don't cooperate, you may
find yourself in every one of them.

263
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,390
That's a nice watch.

264
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,850
We are not here to discuss watches.

265
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,660
We want names.

266
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
And we are quickly losing our patience.

267
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,600
The building seems kind of empty.

268
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,790
German Intelligence on some
kind of a holiday or something?

269
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,110
Wal... Walther PPK. I thought...

270
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,370
I thought James Bond was the only
guy who still used one of those.

271
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,290
Oh, you think you're smart?

272
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,290
Think you can outsmart the bullet?

273
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,490
That's a line from "Robocop".

274
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,700
What's going on here? You guys learn
everything you know from movies?

275
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,850
We're so busted!

276
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,000
Hey, way to ace
the loyalty test, Dumont.

277
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,620
I'm Bit, this is Clu.

278
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,090
Hey, who'd you believe more?

279
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
Oh,

280
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,060
clearly you're both evil geniuses.

281
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,540
Hey, this is 50,000 euros.

282
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,930
That's courtesy of McP.

283
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,720
The only caveat is:
spend it all by dawn.

284
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,770
Is this some silent zen torture?

285
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,380
I was just thinking.

286
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh.

287
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,210
That would explain
the long silent patches.

288
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,620
You're a bright guy.

289
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,670
Are you bright enough to understand
that the only way out is to cut a deal?

290
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,940
What have I said or done to make
you think I would cut a deal?

291
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,330
Oh...

292
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,190
you're pitching a deal
'cause you're worried.

293
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,050
You sent little Jake
in my place, didn't you?

294
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,570
That's a bad poker face, Agent Duarte.

295
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,850
Qui tacet consentire videtur.

296
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,500
"He who is silent is
understood to agree."

297
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,770
You know, it's because
of people like you

298
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,630
that I love the Patriot Act.

299
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,630
I hope you kissed him good-bye.

300
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,290
Because even if he
manages to fool them,

301
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,690
which he won't for too long,

302
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,560
the temptation will be too much
for the little bag-biter to resist.

303
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,120
I know it was for me.

304
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,350
Yeah, right.

305
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,350
Oh, and Dumont -

306
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,900
besame el culo.

307
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,100
This place used to be headquarters

308
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,100
for east berlin communist youth.

309
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,300
Now you can't get a drink
here for less than 20 euros.

310
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,400
Wow. Ausgezeichnet.

311
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,950
Excellent. Carry on.

312
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,550
Enschuldigen sie bitte.

313
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,090
Uh, is this the end of the line?

314
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,370
Dude, what are you doing?

315
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,440
Right.

316
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,090
Come on.

317
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,940
We don't do lines.

318
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,820
Look who we brought.

319
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,350
Aha!

320
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,610
Family's complete.

321
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,470
Hey, about time.

322
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,290
How you doing, brother?
How was your flight, man

323
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,060
- Good.
- Good.

324
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,170
Finally, in the flesh.

325
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,050
Dumont?

326
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,850
Yori.

327
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,830
You're not what I expected.

328
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,900
- What'd you expect?
- Less.

329
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,070
- Come on!
- Come on!

330
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,100
Come on, man! Bring it on!

331
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,870
Come on, man! Another round.

332
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,850
You got the shots?
Put on some liederhosen!

333
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,810
Bring your sister. Bring your sister.

334
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,210
Temping was the worst.

335
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,290
Anything goes wrong, they blame you.

336
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,970
Dranzacom fired me

337
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,920
because they thought
I was stealing post-its.

338
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,160
Well, that and I wouldn't sleep

339
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,130
with the homunculus office manager.

340
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,070
Nothing's as bad as a render farm -

341
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,060
herding pixels 24 hours a day

342
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,990
for nothing.

343
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,340
I couldn't even afford a new futon.

344
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,150
I slept on a used one.

345
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,180
Hey, at least you had a bed.

346
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,200
Try sleeping on a flea-infested couch

347
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,340
while your less talented,

348
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,230
more politically savvy friends

349
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,270
are peddling IPOs.

350
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,660
Oh!

351
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,960
Yeah, okay, okay.
Uh, m-my first I.T. job,

352
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,730
I-I had these two bosses

353
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,730
that second-guessed
everything that I did.

354
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,770
And they give me a "promotion"

355
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,530
and take away my overtime.

356
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm driving this old,
rusty piece of junk car,

357
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,570
I live above a 24-hour deli.

358
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,570
To this day, the smell of fried peppers

359
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,350
makes me homicidal.

360
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,760
That surprises me, Dumont.

361
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,670
I can't imagine you as an I.T.

362
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,360
Yeah, I'm trying to forget it.

363
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,920
Hey, here's to not spending
80 hours a week

364
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,040
putting away code in a cubicle,

365
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,940
never wearing a tie
and never being poor.

366
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,270
And to doing it on our own terms,
ladies and gentlemen!

367
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,460
Oh, yeah! Ow! That's right!

368
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,060
Cheers.

369
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,680
Oh-oh, yeah!

370
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,760
Oh!

371
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,190
This yours?

372
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,950
Vid phone.

373
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,960
Real-time data stream.

374
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,150
Cool!

375
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,350
Yeah!

376
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,410
Yeah! Woo!

377
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,660
Hi. Yeah!

378
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,960
What the hell is he doing?

379
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,720
I think it's the slip.

380
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,070
It's this dance...

381
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,250
more like a grind, actually.

382
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,010
It's very popular
in the mitte district.

383
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,290
Not helping. Right.

384
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,050
These are the players?

385
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,940
We assume. He didn't bother
to label the photos

386
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,330
or contact us three hours ago
like he was supposed to.

387
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Let's see if we can photo-match
ID any of these guys.

388
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,540
Working on it.

389
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,090
Why is Jake in all of his photos?

390
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,880
I have no idea.

391
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,080
How much lead time does German
Intelligence need to mount a raid?

392
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,830
- Thirty minutes.
- Well, we can wait for Jake

393
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,700
to figure out what they're planning,

394
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,230
or we can go in there now and
nail them for the Federal reserve.

395
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,510
Alert the Germans.

396
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,510
We're getting him out of there.

397
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,450
Dude, your phone.

398
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,990
Thanks!

399
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,590
What?

400
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,630
You're beautiful.

401
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,850
This is it.

402
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,660
He's at the bar.

403
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,670
- He's here.
- Yeah.

404
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,460
You want me to do it or are you gonna?

405
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,020
Uh, well, you know, whatever.

406
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,150
- Okay, so you give him the 30.
- Got it.

407
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,690
The-the 30,000. Is that all?

408
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,180
That's what we talked about, right?
He's not going to jack you, is he?

409
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,370
- Better not.
- All right, here we go.

410
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,280
- It's all there?
- Yeah, it's all there.

411
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,680
Don't try to jack us.

412
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,510
What?

413
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,480
Don't you have something for me?

414
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,860
He took off from Heathrow
six minutes ago.

415
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,490
He took off from
Heathrow six minutes ago.

416
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,770
We're going to change the world, bro.

417
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,490
Yeah, that we are.

418
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,920
Hey, guys! Guys, we're on.

419
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,780
Dumont just got the word.

420
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,920
- Awesome!
- It's on? Now?

421
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,820
Hey, listen, I just...
I really have to...

422
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm going to go.
I'll be just a minute.

423
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,700
Hey, what's going on?

424
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,950
- Why haven't I heard from you?
- All right, just listen.

425
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,170
He left Heathrow airport
six minutes ago.

426
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,970
Uh, well, no. Eight, I guess.

427
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
What are you talking about?

428
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,860
Uh, I don't know. I don't know.
Uh. It's a plane.

429
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,060
I think that there's
something big this time.

430
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,900
No, Jake, listen.
We're getting you out.

431
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,630
German Intelligence
is moving in ten minutes.

432
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,760
No, no, no, they can't.
This thing's already in motion.

433
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,950
Who are you?

434
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,570
I don't know what game you're playing,
Dumont, but I'm not interested.

435
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,820
What, what game?

436
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,700
We've been doing it online
for six months, okay?

437
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,540
I don't need you to tell
me I'm beautiful.

438
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,400
Save the compliments
for somebody who needs it.

439
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,110
Wait, wait.

440
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,300
We're not online anymore.

441
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,330
You're breaking all the rules.

442
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,430
No eye contact, no real names.

443
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,900
We're breaking the rules.

444
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,310
Guys...

445
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,950
we got work to do.

446
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,010
What's the target?

447
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,960
Get in.

448
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,800
Come on. Give us a hint.

449
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,860
Guess we're going down.

450
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,570
We're going way down.

451
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,130
What's that beeping?

452
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,080
I-I'm sorry. It's Jake.

453
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,890
What just happened?

454
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,890
All his numbers just disappeared.

455
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,760
What does that mean, he's dead?

456
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,570
I don't know. He's just gone.

457
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,170
German Intelligence
just raided the club.

458
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,550
There's no sign of the hackers.
No sign of Jake.

459
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,090
How is that possible?

460
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,130
They went out of satellite
range. I don't...

461
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,950
maybe they went underground.

462
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,540
Have them send us a subterranean grid

463
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,490
of all sewers and tunnels
in the vicinity.

464
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,310
Get me manifests of all
flights coming into Berlin.

465
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,800
Priority match anything that came out
of Heathrow in the last half hour.

466
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,820
Cool...

467
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,630
we are in the bat cave.

468
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,310
No, dude. We're in Hitler and
Eva Braun's love bunker.

469
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,660
We're inside a concealed lead-lined,

470
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,010
nuclear fallout shelter that
hasn't seen the light of day

471
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,760
since the Berlin wall came down.

472
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,350
This is really cool. You think we can
get back to the club and keep drinking?

473
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,550
What are we doing?
There must be 100 asbestos-free,

474
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,330
nicely-ventilated places
we could do this.

475
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,970
There is no place as safe
from satellite surveillance,

476
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,390
thermal imaging, and sonar
and radio interference.

477
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,390
So buckle your seat belts,
ladies and gentlemen.

478
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,170
Excuse me.

479
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,830
Boys and girls, may I present

480
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,450
three tons of supercomputing
magnificence.

481
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,210
A teraflop machine.

482
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,020
A multi-teraflop machine.
What is that -

483
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,780
like, 60 billion
calculations per second?

484
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,780
- Look at the size of that thing.
- I am in love.

485
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,360
Our target is Banatech.

486
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,560
My old stomping ground.

487
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,210
Nice. I've been wanting
to get back at those wipes

488
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,600
ever since they started charging
for their stupid upgrades.

489
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,810
- Buggy software.
- I temped there for a couple of weeks

490
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,110
trying to lift the code off the beta
version of their new browser.

491
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,870
- How'd you make out?
- I didn't.

492
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,680
They've got the firewall
of death. I don't care

493
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,270
how many teraflops we've got here.

494
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,210
You're right. It's impossible
to crack their firewall.

495
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,870
But not their executive jet.

496
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,410
Right now, all of Banatech's
top management are on it,

497
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,580
flying in from Heathrow
to a conference in Berlin.

498
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,650
When that jet enters German airspace,

499
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,960
we are going to crack its fly-by wire,

500
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,730
forcing it to circle and circle...

501
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,190
Losing fuel

502
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,170
until their top brass
transfer their fortunes

503
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,040
into our Cayman accounts.

504
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,660
We're talking "b" as in billions!

505
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Catch me. I'm gonna faint.

506
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,900
Good.

507
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,220
So, guys... uh, we don't
have a lot of time.

508
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,660
Please, start your software.

509
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,140
Be careful.

510
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,210
Dumont,

511
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,210
can I have a word?

512
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,830
Where are my manifests?

513
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,670
We've got 22 printing now.

514
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,640
The Germans just sent us
the underground grids.

515
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,590
It's a mess: Miles and miles of
cold war bunkers and tunnels.

516
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,380
Tell 'em to start looking.

517
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,570
Here they are.

518
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,870
I got to say, man,

519
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,870
I doubted you.

520
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,070
You were right, man.
They bought everything.

521
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,820
They bought everything
like a bag of chips.

522
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,540
You got everything else locked down?

523
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,450
What else is there?

524
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,350
Cayman accounts?

525
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,250
You said we didn't need them.

526
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,010
And by the time this is done,

527
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,140
it's going to be pretty obvious
we didn't do this for the money.

528
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,420
We got all the money we need.

529
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,040
In your own words, "the only thing
we don't have is infamy."

530
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,420
You want to do the toast?

531
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,310
To crashing a plane.

532
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,560
To crashing a plane full of toads.

533
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,530
It's all you, Dumont.

534
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,770
You are a genius.

535
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,120
We're in the system. We're ready
to take that plane when you are.

536
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,600
Nice!

537
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,190
Agent Duarte,

538
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,840
Dumont says he knows
about the hackers' plans,

539
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,160
but he'll only talk to you.

540
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,900
Let's go.

541
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,450
You come in.

542
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,810
What I have to say
is for your ears only.

543
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,140
Open it.

544
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,820
You seem pretty tense.

545
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,290
How's it going?

546
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,000
Do you have something
to tell me or not?

547
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,640
Just this.

548
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,490
Tell me about the plane!

549
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,190
He asks for me again, you tase him.

550
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,380
Right.

551
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,780
Open it.

552
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,220
- Say the magic word.
- Give it to me! Give it to me!

553
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,230
Say it now!

554
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,660
He slipped.

555
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,430
Got the navigational beacon.

556
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,210
Dumont, crack the fly-by wire
whenever you're ready.

557
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,940
Just a sec.

558
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,620
- We've got a problem.
- Yes, we do.

559
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,550
Upper management of Banatech
is flying into Berlin as we speak.

560
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,160
The company Dumont hates.

561
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,940
What is that?

562
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,000
Someone's trying to send us a message

563
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,970
through one of our secure uplinks.

564
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,950
I think it's coming from Berlin.

565
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,680
It's Jake.

566
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,290
Get Berlin air traffic control.

567
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,540
Find that plane and land them, now!

568
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,410
Dumont, what are you doing?

569
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,300
Waiting for the ping to
come back from the 5-0-1.

570
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,780
We got that five minutes ago.

571
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,090
Look, it's right there.
Now, take the damn plane.

572
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,990
No.

573
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,740
Why not?

574
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,490
What's-what's going on?
Who's trying to upload a message?

575
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,670
Check your e-mail at home, guys.

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
This is Berlin control

577
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,820
requesting an immediate
emergency landing

578
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,390
Tower, this is charter November X-Ray

579
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,970
seven-four-two-zero-five.

580
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,960
This communication
is highly irregular.

581
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,220
I need a reason to initiate
an emergency landing.

582
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,300
Fly-by-wire's been bypassed.

583
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,740
Manual override's out.

584
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,460
We don't have control of the plane.

585
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,020
How do we get control of that plane?

586
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,390
Get a secure line
to Berlin Intelligence.

587
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,330
German air traffic control
should have a code

588
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,580
to override the fly-by-wire
and release that plane.

589
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,730
They're gonna crash...

590
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,600
in ten minutes.

591
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,290
Dude, how could you?

592
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,630
Because you're all being used.

593
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,480
You weren't brought here
to hold that plane hostage.

594
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,310
You were brought to crash it.

595
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,310
- What?
- He's lying.

596
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,920
Yeah, tell them about
the Cayman accounts.

597
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,250
There aren't any!

598
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,570
This isn't about money.
This is all about

599
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
Dumont getting back at Banatech.

600
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,340
Who you gonna believe?

601
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,390
Your friend who's made you millions

602
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,630
or this U.S. government wage slave?

603
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,390
Look, I've met Dumont.

604
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,290
You know he can make you
believe anything that he wants.

605
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,640
He's got you isolated.

606
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,480
His lackey's got a gun.
You really believe

607
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,430
he meant for you to
get out of this alive?

608
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,520
Okay, let's rethink this.

609
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,570
It's not worth it till we know
who's telling the truth.

610
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,840
Do you all feel that way?

611
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,670
Okay, then.

612
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,150
No, no!

613
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,770
I feel differently.

614
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,730
Ich bin Louise Beckett.

615
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,700
Ich muss mit ihren direktor sprechen.

616
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,380
You're pretty good, huh -

617
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,750
as a hacker and a social engineer.

618
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,800
Buy you'll never be a player.

619
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,290
You better pray.

620
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,300
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is November X-Ray

621
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,200
Seven-Four-Two-Zero-Five.

622
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,880
We are unable to maintain
control of the equipment.

623
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,150
Ja, ich verstehe.

624
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,630
The hackers have locked the Germans
out of their own system.

625
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,650
They can't input the override code.

626
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,580
But Jake can.

627
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,680
Wir benotigen seinen code.

628
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,640
Wir benotigen seinen code.

629
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,370
It's gonna be okay.

630
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,560
Not for you, it's not.

631
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,830
What did you do to my computer?

632
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,990
We got it back.

633
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,910
We have control of the plane.

634
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,150
Pull up. Just pull up!

635
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,240
This is November X-Ray
Seven-Four-Two-Zero-Five

636
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,150
requesting immediate
landing clearance, please.

637
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,200
He did it.

638
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,970
Anything more you can tell us,
Agent Foley?

639
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,670
Yeah, I don't know.
Uh... excuse me.

640
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,120
I'm sorry about the way
things turned out.

641
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,530
You've got nothing to be sorry for.

642
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,630
Uh, my real name is Rachel.

643
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,650
Jake.

644
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,370
What?

645
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,900
Nothing. It's just funny, you know.
I just rode to work

646
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,950
with the world's first
ride-sharing superspy.

647
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,810
Yeah, well, I hear ride-sharing's
an idea whose time has come.

648
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,560
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

649
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,400
- Huh. I'll see ya.
- Okay.

650
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,960
How was Berlin, Jake?

651
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,040
Miss me?
