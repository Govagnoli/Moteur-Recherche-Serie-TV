1
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,368
I want you to count
backwards from 10.

2
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,373
10, nine...

3
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,879
mr. Soprano,

4
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,247
there's someon
e here to see you.

5
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,636
Even here
you hector me?

6
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:02,505
The director has authorized
us to make you an offer.

7
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,891
Give up your nephew
tony, cooperate fully,

8
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,509
help take him down.

9
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,393
What do i get?

10
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,761
A guaranteed cure.

11
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,263
No more cancer?

12
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,265
Not a single
diseased cell.

13
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,411
I'm happy for you.

14
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,414
I know you've
waited a long time...

15
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,917
stay home, clip your
coupons, be a happy man.

16
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,420
Don't let certain people
take advantage...

17
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,922
i'm kiddin' you,
you old fuck.

18
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,924
Peppers and eggs.

19
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,425
Dr. Kennedy...

20
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,194
it's dr. Enloe...

21
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,796
i have the results
of the frozen section.

22
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,798
Can we move this
along, dr. Enloe?

23
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,201
I have a thyroid in
o. R. Six at 10:30.

24
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,720
Based on the preliminary
results of the frozen section

25
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,224
and depending, of cour
se, on the full path report--

26
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,726
is it clean,
enloe, or not?

27
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:59,229
Yes, it's clean.

28
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,730
Miles, you close.

29
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,233
Let's do it quickly,
i've got his bp back up,

30
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,734
but i don't know
how long it'll hold.

31
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,486
Watch and
learn, miles.

32
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,988
Watch and learn.

33
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,498
Well?

34
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,504
Your uncle
is a very strong
man, mr. Soprano.

35
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,005
He did very well.

36
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,507
The news is
all good.

37
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,008
Beautiful.

38
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,009
So, the
cancer is...

39
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,511
gone?
You bet.

40
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,013
I took a tumor
the size of a fist
out of his stomach.

41
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,515
Madonn'.

42
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,016
So, if you'll
excuse me,

43
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,017
i have another
patient waiting.

44
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,771
Cheryl, make sure
that marty gets

45
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,773
doc?
That goldman- sachs statement.

46
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:44,274
Yes?

47
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,775
I...

48
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,277
just want to
say thanks.

49
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,779
You know, my uncle
thinks the world of you.

50
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:53,783
If there's ever anything i
can do, a favor, anything,

51
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,785
let me know.

52
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,787
I'll keep that in
mind, mr. Soprano.

53
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,929
Game three.

54
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,932
That's $60.

55
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:10,683
Good luck
getting it.

56
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,553
I fuckin' won,
paulie, it's only
right you pay me.

57
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,554
And for other
things too.

58
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,189
Like what?

59
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,808
Fuckin' dom perignon
for everybody in the skybox

60
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,310
at the garde
n the other night.

61
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,312
Check comes,
suddenly you're m. I. A.

62
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:25,315
Chrissy, you're
too fucking worried
about what i give you.

63
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:27,951
Worry a little more
about what you give me.

64
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,953
Blow me with your
lectures, paulie.

65
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,322
Kid, you wearing
a wire?

66
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,325
Are you
fucking crazy?

67
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,210
Pasqual,
pat him down.

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,461
He fuckin'
touches me...

69
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,079
then make it easy
on all us all.

70
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,665
Take'em off...
everything.

71
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:46,302
New york reopened the books,
but they also laid it down.

72
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,304
Probationary period.

73
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,058
When i was coming up
this would never happen
to new made guys.

74
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,061
But too many people
are doin' a simulcast.

75
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,063
Maybe you,
you fuck.

76
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,185
Do me a favor and don't
take it personally.

77
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,582
I said everything.

78
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,700
Go fuck yourself.

79
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,202
Before i was
breaking balls,

80
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,704
now, you're beginning
to worry me.

81
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,969
I guess you could
call that a dick.

82
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,229
You're going,
young man, that's
all there is to it.

83
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,231
Jason mangelli
isn't going.

84
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,233
Tony, you wanna
weigh in here?

85
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:53,736
Tony?

86
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,240
What?

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,241
The washington trip?

88
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,494
No, you're gonna be on tha
t school bus to d. C. Tomorrow.

89
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,497
You're all packed and paid f
and you're gonna pay attention

90
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,499
and you're gonna
learn something
for a change.

91
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,501
We're going to
fbi headquarters.

92
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,004
So?

93
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,510
Excuse me.

94
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,517
What did you do
to this'scarrole?

95
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,018
It's delicious.

96
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,020
Balsamic.

97
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,022
That's all they ha
ve at king's these days.

98
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,525
Balsamic,
balsamic, balsamic.

99
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,528
My mother never
heard of balsamic.

100
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,029
I gotta go.

101
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,031
Problems at work.

102
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,032
It's sunday
dinner, tony.

103
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,033
I know.

104
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,535
I gotta go.

105
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,036
Alright, hug
h, see you later.

106
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,425
Can i be
excused too?

107
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,177
No, you may not.

108
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,045
He's got homework
to finish before
the trip.

109
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,547
Go ahead, anthony.

110
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,435
It's a nice
example he sets
for his son.

111
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:00,436
Ma...

112
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,438
the man's got
two speeds...

113
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,440
moping or yelling...

114
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,942
when he's here.

115
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,443
He's got an uncle
sick with cancer.

116
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:08,444
Oh, please.

117
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,446
They didn't
speak for a year.

118
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:13,950
Actually, if you
must know, tony has
been a little better.

119
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,457
We've been seeing
his therapist together.

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,301
What?

121
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,304
He's no angelo
stamfa, that's all.

122
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:36,806
What is that
supposed to mean?

123
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:38,808
You know angelo was
dying to marry you

124
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:41,811
and now, stamfa's is
a chain of drugstores.

125
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,813
So, what, he doesn't
need therapy?

126
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:45,815
He prescribes his
own tranquilizers?

127
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:47,316
Don't be
so sensitive.

128
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,317
What sensitive?

129
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,319
I gotta hear this
angelo stamfa shit again?

130
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:00,830
All i was
saying was--

131
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,832
i know wha
t you were saying.

132
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,834
Hugh, bring
your plate!

133
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:08,337
You are blowing this
all out of proportion.

134
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,590
We worry about
you, that's all.

135
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,592
Spare me your
concern, alright?

136
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,594
And spare me
your attitude too.

137
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,095
Or maybe you forgot,

138
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,098
dad's little strip mall on
route 17 was zoned residential

139
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,600
until tony made
a phone call.

140
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,601
Bullshit.

141
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,603
Oh, really, dad?

142
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,605
The contract you got t
o do at sparta high
for the hurricanes repairs.

143
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,607
What, all the
other builders were
too busy to bid?

144
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,358
Oh, please,
my heart bleeds.

145
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,361
What, the waters
don't part for you
wherever you go?

146
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,863
I earn it.

147
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,865
You two get
a free pass.

148
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,237
Hey.

149
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,238
Ton', what's up?

150
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,739
Hey, tony.

151
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,762
Anyway, four
dollars a pound.

152
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:11,767
Who brought
this in here?

153
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,269
Georgie.

154
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,770
It's wacky, huh?

155
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:24,280
What do you think,
it's a fuckin'
playroom back there?

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,781
What, ton'?

157
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,283
What, what, fuckin'
toys? This is a
place of business.

158
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:28,784
That's an office
back there!

159
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,287
I saw it at rite- a
id, they were selling'em.

160
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,788
What? What
did you say?

161
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,290
Ah!

162
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,294
I pay you a
fuckin' salary!

163
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,316
Carmela...

164
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,331
you sounded tense
on the phone.

165
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,833
Ah...

166
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:22,338
i just wanted to make sure
it was okay if i came alone.

167
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,840
I mean, because tony
couldn't make it.

168
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,351
I love the artwork
you have out there,

169
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,352
those country scenes.

170
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:37,853
Thank you.

171
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,357
That statue is
not my favorite.

172
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,869
Oh, come on...

173
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,871
look, it's not lik
e this when me and ton
y are here together.

174
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,373
You never give him
the silent treatment.

175
00:10:57,873 --> 00:10:58,874
Is that what
you think?

176
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,377
I'm giving you the
silent treatment?

177
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,882
Maybe you could tell me
why you came today.

178
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,386
I'm worried
about my husband.

179
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,388
The mood swings.

180
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,890
I thought...

181
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,893
when his mother
died, maybe...

182
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:24,400
but still half the tim
e he doesn't even talk to me.

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,402
You've seen him
get like that,

184
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,904
that day he sat
here like a wall.

185
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:31,407
I know that
he's your patient

186
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,908
and i am only
the patient's wife,

187
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,911
but you try living with
that 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

188
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:36,912
see how you feel.

189
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:37,913
I see.

190
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,415
Oh, you do?

191
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,918
Well, for your information
, i am not the only one.

192
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:45,421
The fact is, tony isn'
t under the weather today,

193
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,923
he just didn't
feel like coming.

194
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,925
"Fuck that shit",
i think he said, okay?

195
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,928
Usually happens when
we touch on a nerve.

196
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,932
He was distressed about
this young man's death

197
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,435
in the garbage
compactor.

198
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:03,439
See, he didn't say,
"garbage compactor",
did he?

199
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,942
See?

200
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,944
What is it
you believe?

201
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,446
You know
about his job.

202
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,947
He reports to
a strip club.

203
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,949
Who knows how he
spends his days?

204
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,468
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:34,470
I'm just frustrated,
that's all.

206
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,972
Tony's been out of
sorts, for so long

207
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,474
and there is...

208
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,476
there is nothing
i can do to help him.

209
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,478
I think coming to
therapy with him

210
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,980
has stirred up a lot
of feelings in you

211
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,983
that you would like
to address with somebody.

212
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,485
Oh, please.

213
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,487
I'm just a little
emotional today.

214
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:53,489
I would like
to help you,

215
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:56,992
but as you've pointed out,
your husband is my patient.

216
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,995
I'm not the one
who needs mental help.

217
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,497
I just needed
to vent.

218
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,502
In case you
change your mind,

219
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:11,006
here's the number
of a colleague
in livingston.

220
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,518
He was a teacher
of mine.

221
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:25,521
That really
won't be necessary,

222
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,523
but thank you
anyway.

223
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,527
Thank you
for your time.

224
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,542
You took
these yourself?

225
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,545
That's a samoan village
i lived in for a month.

226
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,046
You could send these int
o "national geographic".

227
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:56,051
So, i got back
your complete
surgical pathology

228
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,553
and op reports.

229
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:59,054
I feel 100%.

230
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:00,556
That's good.

231
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,058
It's possible though...

232
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:07,062
that there may
be some malignant
cells we didn't get.

233
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,065
See, when
we operate,

234
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:13,068
we have to decide
how much healthy tissue

235
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,070
to cut around
the tumor.

236
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,572
Alright?

237
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,575
The margins
weren't wide enough.

238
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:23,078
We took a small sampling
of the tumor from
the frozen section,

239
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,580
when we got back
the complete results,

240
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,582
it showed
nodal involvement.

241
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:29,084
Don't blame
yourself, doc.

242
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,587
So, what do
we do next?

243
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,088
It's called
amended surgery.

244
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,590
Oh, jesus.

245
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,091
Cut me again?

246
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:39,094
Mrs. Brody is here.

247
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,596
Don't let me
keep you, doc.

248
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,097
I am kinda
backed up.

249
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:45,601
Let's schedule you
for tuesday at six a. M.

250
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,603
We can admit and prep
you monday night.

251
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,605
Any questions?

252
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:52,107
When can h
e eat regula
r food again?

253
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,609
I'd guess two weeks.

254
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:57,613
Let's fill out the
surgical consent forms.

255
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,115
That's one less thing you have
to deal with in the hospital.

256
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,117
Take all the time
you need to read them.

257
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,119
No need,
you say sign,
i sign.

258
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,622
You tell me to take a crap
on the deck of the queen mary,

259
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,625
an hour later, they're hosin
her down with disinfectant.

260
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,627
I owe you
everything, doc.

261
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,129
How do i know what
nodal involvement means?

262
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,131
Didn't you
fuckin' listen?

263
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,134
A whole issue
of "u. S. News" on
seniors and health.

264
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,637
Bring somebody
with you to the
doctor's, it said.

265
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:23,639
Somebody to
ask questions.

266
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,642
You ask one dumb fuckin'
question about my diet.

267
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,165
Angie?

268
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:51,667
Carmela!

269
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,168
Hi.
Hi.

270
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,170
What a surprise.

271
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,172
I didn't know you
shopped over here.

272
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,675
They're running
a special on iams.

273
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,677
Every penny
counts these days.

274
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:05,681
How are you doing,
angie, with pussy gone?

275
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,182
Oh, you know.

276
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,685
I'll tell you, shopping
for one is no picnic.

277
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,186
Why don't you
come for dinner?

278
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,688
It's jus
t me and tony,

279
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,189
with med at school
, a. J. 's on a field trip.

280
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,692
Who knows, maybe we'll g
et lucky and tony won't show.

281
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:23,699
That's coco's
worst time of the day.

282
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,200
I can't leave her.

283
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,201
Angie, that dog is
not a substitute

284
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,203
for human contact.

285
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:30,706
That french poodle is
all i got left of sal.

286
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:34,209
24 years, he disappears
one day, and i get
left with a sick dog.

287
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,211
The vet says i
should put her down,

288
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:38,714
but i want her to get
another operation.

289
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,215
I remember when
sal was around

290
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:42,217
there was nothing too
good for that dog.

291
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:45,220
Yeah, but where am i
gonna come up with $1200?

292
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,224
I mean, tony helps out
and i am so grateful.

293
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,225
It covers
the basics,

294
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:53,729
but anything extra,
there's no way, carmela.

295
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:55,731
Jeez, ang,
i'm sorry.

296
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,232
That must be
so tough.

297
00:16:57,232 --> 00:17:00,235
I told the wallpaper
guy that this was okay.

298
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,237
Well, why
did you do that?

299
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,740
Because i didn't want to deal
with your parents anymore.

300
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,745
Anybody around here love
the word "jimmy choo shoes"?

301
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:12,748
No way!

302
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,253
Oh, my god.

303
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,255
They're gorgeous!

304
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:24,259
Or would the lady
prefer something in...

305
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,761
gold?

306
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,262
Say a nice...

307
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:30,265
i don't know,
whatever the
fuck that is.

308
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,272
They're all
yours, baby.

309
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:39,775
And they're from next seas
you can't even buy them yet.

310
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,781
What size
are these?

311
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:46,782
10.

312
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:47,783
10?

313
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,785
That's sasquatch
size, christopher.

314
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,286
I'm an 8. 5.

315
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,789
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

316
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:54,790
where'd i
get 10 from?

317
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,291
Yeah, where?

318
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:02,297
So, now what happens?

319
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,799
You gotta give
'em all back?

320
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:04,800
Temporarily.

321
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,802
I'll get you
8. 5's tomorrow.

322
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,804
All of'em?

323
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:10,806
You swear?

324
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,307
More even.

325
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,813
Since you been
, you know...

326
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:19,314
"in",

327
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:21,817
i just can't believe
the stuff we get.

328
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,318
It's so great.

329
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:26,321
Except for that
schmaccone paulie.

330
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,824
Fuck him and the coupe
de ville he rode in on.

331
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:31,326
He saying you're
holding back again?

332
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,829
Like i'm gonna give
that prick a full share?

333
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,831
C'mere.

334
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,336
What do you say?

335
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,339
I love you, baby.

336
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,341
Oh, you fucking better.

337
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,843
You better.

338
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,344
I do.

339
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,357
You could've
called.

340
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,359
Now everything's cold.

341
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,362
That's why the
y invented microwaves,

342
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:10,365
for inconsiderate
husbands.

343
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,867
It's just that
since we're alone,

344
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:13,869
it would be nice to
have dinner together.

345
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:15,871
Don't bust my
chops, carmela.

346
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,372
I got a lot
on my mind.

347
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,881
This is fuckin
' delicious.

348
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,883
Really.

349
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,384
Is this
the pecorino?

350
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,886
Right.

351
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:34,890
The hell with
heatin' it up,
it's good like this.

352
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,895
I'm glad something
brings you joy.

353
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:44,900
You're amazing,
your cookin'.

354
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,902
I'm having lunch
with our daughter's
dean tomorrow.

355
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:48,403
I gather you
won't be joining me.

356
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:51,406
I told you, all he
wants is our money.

357
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,408
Fine.

358
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,910
We already shell
out 40 grand a
year to those people.

359
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,411
It's well spent.

360
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:57,913
She's really learning,
she's out on her own.

361
00:19:57,913 --> 00:19:59,414
And if she
passes us by--

362
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:00,415
if?

363
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:01,917
She did that
when she was 14.

364
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,920
Isn't that what you
want for your kids?

365
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,421
No.

366
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,423
I want them to be
backwards and ignorant

367
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,925
and sit around wit
h their thumb up their ass

368
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,427
and i'm gonna make sure
of that by not going to lunch

369
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,429
with some asshole who's
trying to shake me down.

370
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,932
Fine, tony,
don't go.

371
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,939
Guess who i ran into
at the supermarket today.

372
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,942
Angie bonpensiero.

373
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:30,946
Really?

374
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,949
How's she doing?

375
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,951
Her dog is sick.

376
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:40,956
What, that fluffy french
coco piece of shit?

377
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,458
What's wro
ng with him?

378
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,459
Her, osteoporosis.

379
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,962
Angie needs money
for an operation.

380
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,465
Well, take it
up with pussy.

381
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:53,468
If you can find th
e fat fuck, wherever
the feds put him.

382
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:57,472
I'd look in arizona,
you know, stake out
all the "tgi fridays".

383
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,474
He loves
their wings.

384
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,477
He left angie holding the
bag, which is not right.

385
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:06,982
And those fbi family value
loving cocksuckers,

386
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:09,484
how could they let him
go without his wife?

387
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:10,485
Into the program?

388
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:11,987
Yeah, that's right.

389
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,989
He ratted us out, carm.

390
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:14,990
Me and you.

391
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,491
And that's
where he is

392
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:17,993
and i don't want to hear
about him ever again.

393
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,494
Or his ungrateful
cunt wife.

394
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,997
His what wife?

395
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,002
Okay...

396
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,005
who was
your oldest?

397
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,006
Easy.

398
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,507
Chuckie periccio's
mother.

399
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:33,508
Shut up!

400
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,510
You had sex wi
th beverly periccio?

401
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,511
Yeah.

402
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,513
A whole
summer's worth.

403
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:43,018
Okay, my turn.

404
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:45,520
Who was your
most famous?

405
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:47,522
And bobby ditillio
doesn't count,

406
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,524
he's only famous
in new jersey.

407
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:50,525
Okay...

408
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,527

penn and teller,

409
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,029
the magicians?

410
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,531
You fucked them?

411
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,033
Penn.

412
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,034
And i didn't
fuck him...

413
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,036
i gave him head.

414
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:02,037
Which one is he?

415
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:03,538
The big one.

416
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,040
They were playing a. C. ,
and they're funny as hell.

417
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,541
I was ther
e with georgette.

418
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,043
He followed me
into the ladies room

419
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:09,544
and he asked--

420
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,046
you lowlife
cunt whore.

421
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:12,547
Get the fuck
out of my sight!

422
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:14,049
Ow, you fucking
shitbag!

423
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:15,550
In the fucking
bathroom?

424
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:27,562
Who is it?

425
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,064
The fbi.

426
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:31,066
Come o
n, dickhead
, open up.

427
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,571
For fuck's sake paulie,
it's two in the morning.

428
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,572
I know.

429
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:39,074
It's an outrage.

430
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:42,077
Adriana,
you in there?

431
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,078
Yeah.

432
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,579
Sorry for the
intrusion, honey.

433
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,081
Put something on
and come out here.

434
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,583
You can't fuckin
' do this like this!

435
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,085
I can't?

436
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:52,587
You must've not read
up on the latest rules.

437
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:55,090
And put
that piece away.

438
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,094
What's all this?

439
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,596
The berezovsky
brothers jacked
a shipment from milan

440
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,098
off pier 87.

441
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,599
These are for ade.

442
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,600
Nice goods.

443
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,602
My broad wears
a size 10.

444
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:09,604
Patsy, pack up
some of these shoes.

445
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,107
Chrissy, you don't mind
if i take my taste now?

446
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,110
He's not
taking those.

447
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,112
Make yourselves
comfortable.

448
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,614
We'll just have a
little look around.

449
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:24,619
I'm still gonna get
more shoes, right?

450
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,622
I don't know, now i have t
o go into my pocket for'em.

451
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:36,131
This really sucks,
christopher.

452
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,133
You see the shit

453
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:50,145
Motherfucker!

454
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,146
What?

455
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,148
Nothing!

456
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:49,704
Leave it on,
it's nice.

457
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:19,734
Meadow?

458
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:22,737
Didn't you hear
me knocking?

459
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:26,241
I was sleeping,
i thought it was vanessa.

460
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:37,252
You don't answer the d
oor when your friends knock?

461
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:39,754
They keep you
from studying.

462
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:41,756
And my first class
isn't until two.

463
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:44,759
I brought your laundry
and i made you the ziti

464
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,761
with the sweet sausage
that you like.

465
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:48,263
I'm so starved.

466
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,767
Jesus, it reeks of
cigarettes in here.

467
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:53,768
You're not smoking,
are you?

468
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,770
Caitlin.

469
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:01,776
I hope you're taki
ng advantage of some
of these offers here.

470
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:03,278
Look at this.

471
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:04,779
A boy just
handed this to me.

472
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,283
A seminar on the cia
and the cultural cold war.

473
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,784
Look at this.

474
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,291
This looks
interesting.

475
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,794
It's basic, we're
way past that.

476
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,297
I'm reading the ne
w barbara kingsolver.

477
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:25,300
I so wish i had
time for fiction.

478
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:31,806
So, how is the drama
queen doing anyway?

479
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:32,807
Fine.

480
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,809
Can we not talk
about this, please?

481
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,311
I'm trying very
hard here, med.

482
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,812
If you want me to
leave, i will leave.

483
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:39,814
I have an hour befor
e my lunch with dean ross.

484
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:42,317
You're going to lunch
with the dean?

485
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,319
Can we not talk about
this now, please?

486
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,320
Mom!

487
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,322
Yeah, his secretary called
last week and invited me.

488
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:50,325
Come on,
what about?

489
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,327
Money, i'm sure.

490
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:54,329
They probably want
a donation from us.

491
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:56,331
How corrupt.

492
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,834
The real reason i stopped
by to see you though

493
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,337
was to make sure
you're recovered
from this noah thing.

494
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:04,339
I'm worried it
'll affect your grades.

495
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,841
You call losing
a wonderful man
because of dad...

496
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,343
a thing?

497
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:10,345
Now, is that reall
y what happened?

498
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:12,847
'Cause you certainly kept
seeing him plenty long enough

499
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:14,849
after that business
with your father.

500
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,851
Look, don't drag me
into whatever bullshit

501
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:19,854
accommodational pretense
you've got worked
out with daddy.

502
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:22,857
What was that, last night's
reading assignment?

503
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,861
Alright...

504
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:30,365
let's hear it.

505
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,367
What's your big theory
about me and daddy?

506
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,369
No way.

507
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,371
I'm not
touching that.

508
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:03,898
Oh, fuckin' bitch!

509
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:09,904
Uncle jun', what the
hell are you doing?

510
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:13,908
Those marshals see
you coming in here?

511
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:16,911
'Cause i need being
remanded to a fucking
jail hospital

512
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:19,914
right now like
i need a fuckin'
case of crabs.

513
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:22,917
There's no car
out there today

514
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:25,920
and i come up throug
h the cellar like always.

515
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,422
Where the fuck
is bacala?

516
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:28,923
He's supposed to b
e doing this shit for you.

517
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:32,427
I sent him to
the drugstore
for more pepto.

518
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,434
You're getting
better, that's the
important thing.

519
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:40,935
You look better too.

520
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:42,937
If you're
gonna lie to me,

521
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:43,938
tell me there's a broa
d waiting in the car

522
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:45,440
who wants to
tongue my balls.

523
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,942
You want that, it's
a phone call away.

524
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,447
You still
want this?

525
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,449
I gotta get
nutrition somehow.

526
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:58,453
Kennedy says eat
only what i ca
n sip through a straw.

527
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,463
What's going on with y
ou and ralphie cifaretto?

528
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:10,465
Bacala tells me
there's bad blood now.

529
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:11,966
You don't got
enough in your plate?

530
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,468
I mean, in
your blender?

531
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:15,970
Worry about
your own problems.

532
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:20,475
When'd they
say you could
eat real food?

533
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,976
Who knows?

534
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,478
Kennedy's putting
me under the knife again.

535
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,480
Whoa, back up.

536
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,481
More surgery?

537
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,483
Don't think you should
talk to somebody else?

538
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:29,984
Get a second opinion.

539
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,985
Chemo?

540
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:31,986
Forget it.

541
00:29:31,986 --> 00:29:34,989
With kennedy it's cut,
zip, over and out.

542
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,991
He has the hands
of an angel.

543
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:38,493
And don't
forget his name.

544
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:39,494
What?

545
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:40,495
I'm supposed to
be impressed

546
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:41,996
'cause the man's name
is john kennedy?

547
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:44,499
All the micks named their kids
that after the guy got killed.

548
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,502
I loved that man.

549
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,506
He was older than
me and now look.

550
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,009
You were g
one a long time.

551
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:56,010
How many
white castles
did you have?

552
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,512
I didn't, i swear.

553
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,013
I can smell them.

554
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,517
Let me call
cusamano.

555
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,018
He knows doctors
in the city.

556
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,020
He sent silvio's
mother to one.

557
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,022
It can't hurt
to make a call.

558
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:10,024
People come from the
city to see kennedy.

559
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,026
Good, then we won't
be fighting traffic.

560
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:16,030
C'mon, uncle jun',
you know i'm right.

561
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:21,536
Alright, you set it up
, you come with me...

562
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:26,040
to listen and
ask questions.

563
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,043
Good, good.

564
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:30,545
I'll let you
know, alright?

565
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,047
Alright.

566
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,560
My nephew thinks i need
a second opinion.

567
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,563
He doesn't like
it that i'm going
back under the knife.

568
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,064
Maybe there's
something to that.

569
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,066
Another expert
heard from.

570
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,068
Think on this,
burger boy,

571
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:56,571
anthony is a
cunt hair away

572
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,072
from owning all of
northern jersey.

573
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,074
And i am
that cunt hair.

574
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:03,077
So, maybe he
has something
else on his mind,

575
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,580
besides my full, complete
and speedy recovery.

576
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,582
Oh, junior,
all this cynicism...

577
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:10,084
this can't be
good for you.

578
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:14,088
Giorgio.

579
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:20,094
You speak italian.

580
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:21,596
Second generation.

581
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,097
Really, ross?

582
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:24,098
Rosetti.

583
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:27,101
1, 000 years of
a proud name undone

584
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,603
with one stroke of
a pen at ellis island.

585
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:30,104
A paisan.

586
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:31,606
And not fa
r from you either.

587
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:32,607
New brunswick.

588
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:33,608
Get out!

589
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:34,609
Any success
i may have,

590
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:36,110
i credit to the jersey
public schools.

591
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,612
They were somethin
g in those days.

592
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:38,613
Where did you
go to college?

593
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:39,614
Rutgers.

594
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,115
I went to
montclair state.

595
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:42,617
Good school.

596
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:43,618
What was
your major?

597
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:45,620
Business
administration.

598
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,622
To meadow soprano,

599
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:50,124
a valuable addition to
the columbia community.

600
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:51,626
Really?

601
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:52,627
Absolutely.

602
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:54,629
I don't know
her personally,

603
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,631
but i've talked to
her professors.

604
00:31:56,631 --> 00:32:00,134
They say she's attentive,
inquiring, does all her work,

605
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:01,636
and makes insightful
contributions

606
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,137
to class discussions.

607
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,639
I am so glad to
hear you say that.

608
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,641
And here i was worried
about her adjusting.

609
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,643
Let's not
tell her though.

610
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,144
We don't want he
r overconfident.

611
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:13,147
It seems like she
sleeps an awful lot.

612
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:15,149
They all do.

613
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:41,676
Tony, what the hell?

614
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:44,679
You know, ang,

615
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:47,181
driving over here,

616
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:49,183
i was thinking about how
i was gonna handle this.

617
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,686
I been working
on my anger lately.

618
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,688
So, i figured it'd be good
if i could just quietly say

619
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:58,693
any kind of problem you got,
financial or otherwise,

620
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:00,695
you come
directly to me.

621
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:03,197
Please, leave carmel
a the fuck out of it.

622
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:05,199
Like that.

623
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,200
Of course.

624
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,702
Then i saw
the cadillac.

625
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:10,204
The money
i give you...

626
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:13,207
you're driving a
cadillac and you'r
e looking for more?

627
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:15,209
Shot the whole plan.

628
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,720
So, remember this...

629
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,223
you see my wife, you talk
about oven cleaner.

630
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,225
Anything els
e you come to me,

631
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:33,227
but think twic
e before you do.

632
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:36,230
Think about that f
at fuck husband of yours

633
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,732
and what h
e did to you.

634
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:39,233
Him...

635
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:40,234
not me.

636
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:45,239
Coco, please,
coco, down!

637
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:47,742
Hey, hey
, how are ya?

638
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:49,744
I'm sorry, tony,
i'm sorry.

639
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:50,745
Just push her away.

640
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:52,246
No, she's alright.

641
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:54,248
Good girl.

642
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,250
Good girl.

643
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,252
She don't
look sick.

644
00:33:58,252 --> 00:34:00,755
It comes and goes.

645
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,262
So, your children don'
t feel boxed in by the city?

646
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,764
We're out
all the time.

647
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:12,266
Lately, felicia has us all
into kayaking on the hudson.

648
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,768
You all do
it together?

649
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,770
Yeah, the kids
love it too.

650
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,271
They're already
better at it than i am.

651
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,273
More wine?

652
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:20,775
Why not?

653
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,276
Remember i told you
i spend about half my time

654
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:23,778
involved in
student affairs?

655
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:27,281
Well, this is how
i spend the other half.

656
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,783
Taking parents
to lunch?

657
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,284
Development.

658
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,788
A fancy word
for fund- raising.

659
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:35,790
The new student center.

660
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,291
We break ground
next fall.

661
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,794
See the large
black marble wall

662
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:41,295
to the right
of the entrance?

663
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:42,296
Ah, yes.

664
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,799
That's where the donor
names will be inscribed.

665
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,801
Everybody who donates
gets their name up there?

666
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,803
The wall is reserved for
people whose commitment

667
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,805
begins at the
$50, 000 level.

668
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:52,306
50, 000?

669
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,309
It's what the giving
committee felt you'd
be comfortable with.

670
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:58,813
Based on your past generosity
to the verbum dei school.

671
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:00,815
You know what we
gave to verbum dei?

672
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:04,819
I'm half embarrassed
to say it, but it's
my job to know.

673
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:09,323
All the information including
tax benefits is in here.

674
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:14,328
Well, i will have
to talk to my husband.

675
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:15,830
50 grand?

676
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,832
You gotta
be kidding me.

677
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:20,334
He talked an awful lot
about meadow's having

678
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:22,336
the best possible
university experience.

679
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,338
Yeah, those jew pricks
are holding her hostage.

680
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:25,339
He's italian.

681
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,842
Jews with
better food.

682
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:29,844
They know from verbum
we're big givers.

683
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:32,346
We gave five
grand a year.

684
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,348
That's a long
way from 50.

685
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,350
This is college,
tony, new york city.

686
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,853
5, 000 is a slap in
the face to these people.

687
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:40,354
Well, let
'em say no.

688
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:50,364
Here...

689
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,868
it's around
five grand.

690
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:56,370
Run it through you
r household account

691
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:58,372
so, you can
write him a check.

692
00:35:58,372 --> 00:35:59,373
And that's it.

693
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:01,375
Not a penny more.

694
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:10,384
A five- f. U. Based regimen with
cisplatin and doxorubicin.

695
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:12,386
This is the treatment
i would recommend.

696
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:13,888
Are you
getting this?

697
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,892
Sort of.

698
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:21,395
So, the chemotherapy
would be instead of
the surgery?

699
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:23,397
But i can't
guarantee
even that.

700
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:25,900
We'll have to
evaluate the results
of the treatment.

701
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,902
I could end up
having the chemo,

702
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,904
puking my guts out,

703
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:32,406
having the six hairs
i have left fall out...

704
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:33,908
and still have to
be cut again.

705
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:35,910
I'm afraid that's
a possibility.

706
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,913
You see, with kennedy you
don't get these "maybes"
and "possibilities".

707
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,414
Yeah, but you gott
a have the surgery again.

708
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:41,916
Dr. Kennedy is an
excellent surgeon.

709
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,418
Isn't there some
way you people
could just agree?

710
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:44,919
Sure.

711
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:46,420
Convene a tumor board.

712
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,421
What the hell
is that?

713
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,423
A meeting of the
chief of oncology,

714
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,425
an oncological
pathologist,

715
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,928
and other specialists
who then work together

716
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:55,429
to reach a consensus.

717
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:58,432
Then i guess you hea
r what they have to say?

718
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,434
Well, your uncle
will not be present.

719
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:02,436
They will pass their decision
along to both of you.

720
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:05,940
What you do then is
still your decision.

721
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,441
And kennedy
will be there?

722
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:09,944
I assure you,
no surgeon
would miss it.

723
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,445
Not much to him,
if you ask me.

724
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:15,449
What, you mean
he's not kennedy?

725
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,451
You make life
and death decisions

726
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,453
because of a
man's name.

727
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:22,456
It's only sloan
fuckin' kettering,

728
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:24,458
the best cancer hospital
in the whole world.

729
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:27,461
Excuse me.

730
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:37,471
And let me ask you
something about this
jfk worship of yours,

731
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:39,974
what about hoffa
and the teamsters?

732
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:43,477
That was
the brother.

733
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:45,980
Oh.

734
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:55,489
Dr. Krakower?

735
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:57,491
Hi, yes, thanks
for calling me back.

736
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:00,494
I was referred by
a dr. Jennifer melfi.

737
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:02,496
Yes, i would.

738
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,999
Any time that's
good for you.

739
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,001
That's gre
at, that's fine.

740
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,502
Grove avenue, right.

741
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,504
Okay, i gotta
go, bye bye.

742
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,008
Who was that?

743
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,010
It's the paving guy.

744
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,511
I'm thinking of having
the driveway redone.

745
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:20,014
You smoking?

746
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,515
What is this,
the third degree?

747
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:24,018
This says
with pulp.

748
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:26,520
You like it
with pulp.

749
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:30,524
Not this much, i like
the one that says some pulp.

750
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:34,528
What the fuck
was that for?

751
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:36,530
I'll write
you up a list.

752
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,042
Oh, honey, i
missed you so much.

753
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,047
You know, i figured ou
t that this is the longest

754
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:54,548
we have ever been
away from each other.

755
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:56,050
Did you miss me?

756
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,051
Sure.

757
00:38:57,051 --> 00:39:00,054
Somebody drop this?

758
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,558
Well, ho
w was it?

759
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:07,061
It was pretty good.

760
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:09,063
They had playstation two
right in the hotel room.

761
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,564
And?

762
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:17,071
That was the sum
total of your trip t
o your nation's capital?

763
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,572
I guess.

764
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,082
Alrigh
t, i'm sorry.

765
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:29,583
The orange
juice is fine.

766
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,085
Whatever kind you
wanna get is fine.

767
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:32,586
Fuck the orange juice.

768
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:36,590
Alright, i give
up, what then?

769
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,093
All the money you give
to angie bonpensiero

770
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:43,097
and who knows what
other widows you've
got on your payroll.

771
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,598
It's a business
expense.

772
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:46,600
But there's not
enough to make sure
your own daughter

773
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,102
is protected?

774
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:49,603
I won't pay.

775
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:52,606
I know too muc
h about extortion.

776
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,612
Big deal, he
pat you down.

777
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,115
Pat me down i can do
standing on my head.

778
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,616
It's every
fucking thing else.

779
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:05,119
He came into my apartment
in the middle of the night

780
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,121
and embarrassed
the shit out of me
in front of adriana.

781
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:09,123
Yeah, i heard he
strip searched you.

782
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,625
I'm not fuckin
g kidding, tony.

783
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,627
He's a sick fuck!

784
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:16,130
He was sniffin
g her fucking panties.

785
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,631
What?

786
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:19,133
You heardme.

787
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:24,638
Look, i don't deny that
paulie could be a little...

788
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,640
quirky.

789
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,142
He always has.

790
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,645
Christopher, you're
moving up very fast.

791
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,147
Why do you
think that is?

792
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,149
Are you gonna say
it's'cause i'm
your fucking nephew?

793
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,651
So, be a big boy
and suck it up.

794
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:44,158
The patient,
soprano comma corrado,

795
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,160
male, caucasian,
72- years- old.

796
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,163
Presented three months ago
with severe weight loss

797
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,664
and early satiety.

798
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:52,666
He was scoped and
a four millimeter mass

799
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:55,169
in the greater curvature
of his stomach was detected.

800
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,172
A ct scan revealed no
evidence of metastasis.

801
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,674
Dr. Kennedy
was referred in

802
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:03,677
and he recommended
gastric resection for cure.

803
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,179
There were
no surprises.

804
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:06,180
I thought
we had it.

805
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,182
I was told we had
clean margins.

806
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:11,185
Often, too little
healthy tissue

807
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:12,686
was taken from
around the tumor site.

808
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:15,689
Which leaves the
possibility, a
s in this case,

809
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,191
for a false negative.

810
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,692
You want the man's
whole stomach?

811
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:20,194
If there's a problem
with the procedure,

812
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,695
we'll take it up
on a board level.

813
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:23,697
Meanwhile, what are we
gonna do with this guy?

814
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:25,199
He's high risk.

815
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,701
His pressure fell below 60
systolic for eight minutes

816
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:28,702
on the table.

817
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,204
The incision's
still fresh.

818
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:31,205
I can do it in
half the time.

819
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,207
If we don't do surgery,
we do 5- f. U.

820
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:35,709
Which works how well
on an adenocarcinoma?

821
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,211
Not very.

822
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:39,713
Which is why we decided
to go in, in the first place.

823
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,216
So, what do
i tell mehta?

824
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:43,717
Mehta?

825
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:45,219
Sloan- kettering mehta?

826
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,721
Your patient sought
a second opinion
with dr. Mehta.

827
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,723
Forget it then.

828
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:51,725
The last thing i
need is to operate

829
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,727
with that little shit
looking over my shoulder.

830
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:57,231
I'll tell him.

831
00:41:57,231 --> 00:42:00,234
Yes, i'll have
him there, thanks.

832
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:05,239
Don't sugarcoat it.

833
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,741
If you concentrate
on your breathing,

834
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:09,243
it'll be easier
all around.

835
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:11,745
The girl said she'd
page dr. Kennedy.

836
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:13,747
Where the fuck
is he?

837
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,750
Alright, 20 minutes
and i'll be back.

838
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:27,261
You go too
easy on him.

839
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:28,762
Probably.

840
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:32,266
Hey, if my nephew
cubby wasn't dead,

841
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:35,269
i'd have a soft
spot for him.

842
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,272
Did you sniff that
girl's panties?

843
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:40,274
He told you that?

844
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,276
Fucking baby!

845
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:44,778
You got
to apologize.

846
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:47,281
T, i'm not
apologizing to him.

847
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,782
You were
out of line.

848
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,284
He's gonna marry t
he girl, for chrissakes.

849
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:52,286
As of the
wedding day,

850
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:56,290
anything that touches
her pussy is off limits.

851
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:05,799
You think
it's all up?

852
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:11,305
Soon enough there'll
be more where
that came from.

853
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:17,311
Sounds like you were going
at it pretty good in there.

854
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:19,313
My pain a source of
entertainment to you?

855
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,316
You see me laughing?

856
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:24,818
I brought you
a milk shake fro
m "31 flavors".

857
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,822
It's all your
fucking fault anyway.

858
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:32,326
I'm throwing up day and night
since i started the chemo.

859
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:33,327
Oh, right.

860
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:35,329
I gave you cancer.

861
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:37,831
You don't know what
this is like, anthony.

862
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:40,334
I can't do it.

863
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,836
Kennedy was right.

864
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:44,338
What's he
got to say?

865
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,840
I can't get him
on the phone.

866
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,342
The nurses won't put
me through to him.

867
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:49,843
Why not?

868
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:52,846
I leave messages
at the hospital,
at the office.

869
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:54,848
I sent him
a box of cohibas.

870
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:56,850
I couldn't get
past reception.

871
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,852
He didn't
call you back?

872
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:00,354
Who knows if they
even tell him?

873
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:01,855
Last night the
machine says,

874
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:03,357
"if it's an emergency,
press six."

875
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:04,858
So, i press six.

876
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:07,361
Still no call back,
24 hours later.

877
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:09,363
He must be
very busy.

878
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,366
Yeah, that must be it.

879
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:17,371
You go
t his number?

880
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:25,379
Three more weeks.

881
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:27,881
Three more
fuckin' weeks.

882
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:34,888
His fuckin'
answerin' machine.

883
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:36,890
What are ya
gonna do?

884
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,892
These doctors,
it's not like on tv.

885
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:41,395
Dr. Kennedy,
this is tony soprano,

886
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:43,397
corrado soprano's nephew.

887
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:48,402
My cell ph
one is 917- 555- 0157.

888
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:51,405
Call me back any
time, day or night.

889
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,907
It's important.

890
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:57,911
Batter up.

891
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,921
Bye.

892
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:32,946
Now what?

893
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:33,947
Get in.

894
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:42,956
You're not even
married yet,

895
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,958
you're dipping int
o whores already.

896
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,960
Didn't cost
me a quarter.

897
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,462
I don't
pay for it.

898
00:45:50,964 --> 00:45:52,966
How'd you find me?

899
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:53,967
Better be careful.

900
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:57,471
If i can do it, so
can your bride- to- be.

901
00:45:57,971 --> 00:45:58,972
So, what is this?

902
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:00,974
Some new rule
about who i fuck?

903
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:02,976
You want more
shoes, what?

904
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,479
No, funny thing is
they don't even fit her.

905
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:09,983
I don't know why i thought
she was a size 10.

906
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:10,984
I don't know either.

907
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:14,488
I'm here to tell
you one thing...

908
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:16,490
you ever go whinin
g to the big man again

909
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,492
about shit between
you and me,

910
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:20,994
we'll have a problem,
my friend.

911
00:46:37,511 --> 00:46:39,012
You seen these?

912
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,015
The fuck is that?

913
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:43,517
My godson
got it for me.

914
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:45,018
They're all ov
er the fuckin' place,

915
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:48,522
we gotta bring one
into the club.

916
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:13,547
Watch and learn, phil.

917
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:15,048
Watch and learn.

918
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:26,560
What are you doing?

919
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,562
Hey, doc,
it's me, tony.

920
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:30,063
Corrado soprano's
nephew.

921
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:31,565
You belong to
this club?

922
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:33,066
Me?
No, no, no.

923
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:34,568
I came here
to see you.

924
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,069
If it's about
your uncle,

925
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,571
you'll have to
call my office.

926
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:39,072
You might need
a new secretary,

927
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:41,575
i don't think
you're getting
all your messages.

928
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:45,078
For you...

929
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:47,080
titanium.

930
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,584
I use one, added 1
0 yards to my drives.

931
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:53,086
Thanks, but i really
can't accept it.

932
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:56,089
For everything you'v
e done for my uncle.

933
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:58,091
Anyway, what a
m i gonna do with it?

934
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:00,093
I've already got one
and mr. Williams here...

935
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:01,595
he don't play.

936
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:03,096
Right?

937
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:05,599
Stupid fucking game.

938
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,101
What can i do
with it?

939
00:48:08,101 --> 00:48:09,102
What is it, jack?

940
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:11,104
He'll just
be a minute.

941
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,112
Well, i could use a
little extra distance.

942
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:20,113
Who couldn't?

943
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:24,117
You know, my uncle, he's
not doing so well.

944
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:26,119
He's got a bad reaction
to that chemo.

945
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,621
That happens
all the time,

946
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:30,123
there's nothing
that i can
really do.

947
00:48:30,123 --> 00:48:32,125
You know, there
are worse things

948
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,628
that can happen to
a person than cancer.

949
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,129
My uncle think
s he's gonna die.

950
00:48:36,129 --> 00:48:37,631
He's convinced ofit.

951
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,133
You know how old people
are with their superstitions.

952
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:44,638
He thinks it's'ca
use he went against you.

953
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:55,649
I was his surgeon,
that's all.

954
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,151
You got a bee
on you hat.

955
00:49:00,153 --> 00:49:04,157
Show that man the
respect he deserves.

956
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,662
Answer his
phone calls.

957
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:22,175
Cheryl, make sure
mr. Soprano is
scheduled for--

958
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:24,678
just rememberit.

959
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,692
Everybody's marriage
has problems.

960
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:40,193
Is he seeing
another woman?

961
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:42,696
You can make
that plural.

962
00:49:42,696 --> 00:49:44,197
Yes, he sees
other women.

963
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:45,699
I sort of lo
ok the other way.

964
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:47,701
I want to help him.

965
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:48,702
Do you?

966
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:51,204
Moments ago you used
the word "divorce".

967
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:53,707
I said i was
considering divorce.

968
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:58,712
I may be overstepping
my boundaries here,

969
00:49:58,712 --> 00:50:01,214
but you are jewish,
aren't you?

970
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:02,215
Is that relevant?

971
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:04,718
Well, us catholics,

972
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:08,722
we place a great deal of sto
in the sanctity of the family.

973
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:11,725
And i'm not su
re that your people--

974
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:15,228
i've been married
for 31 years.

975
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:18,732
Then you know how
difficult it can be.

976
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:21,234
He's a good man,

977
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,235
he's a good father.

978
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:25,739
You tell me he's a
depressed criminal.

979
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:27,741
Prone to anger,

980
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:29,743
serially unfaithful.

981
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:33,747
Is that your definition
of a good man?

982
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:36,750
I thought psychiatrists
weren't supposed
to be judgmental.

983
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:40,253
Many patients want to
be excused for their
current predicament

984
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:43,757
because of events
that occurred in
their childhood.

985
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:45,759
That's what psychiatry
has become in america.

986
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:50,263
Visit any shopping mall
or ethnic pride parade

987
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:53,266
to witness
the results.

988
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:58,772
What we say in here
stays in here, right?

989
00:50:58,772 --> 00:51:00,273
By ethical code
and by law.

990
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:01,775
His crimes...

991
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:04,277
they are...

992
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:08,281
organized crime.

993
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:09,783
The mafia?

994
00:51:09,783 --> 00:51:11,785
Oh, jesus.

995
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:17,290
Oh, so what?

996
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,792
So what?

997
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:22,796
He betrays me every week
with these whores.

998
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:25,799
Probably the least
of his misdeeds.

999
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,302
You can
leave now,

1000
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:32,305
or you can stay and hear
what i have to say.

1001
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:37,310
You're gonna charge
the same anyway.

1002
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,812
I won't take
your money.

1003
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:40,313
That's a new one.

1004
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:41,815
You must trust
your initial impulse

1005
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:44,317
and consider
leaving him.

1006
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:47,320
You'll never be able to
feel good about yourself,

1007
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,824
never be able to quell
the feelings of
guilt and shame

1008
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:53,326
that you talk about...

1009
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:56,329
as long as you're
his accomplice.

1010
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:59,332
You're wrong about the
accomplice part though.

1011
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:01,334
Are you sure?

1012
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:02,836
All i do is make sure he's got
clean clothes in his closet,

1013
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:05,338
and dinner
on his table.

1014
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,841
So, enabler would be a more
accurate job description

1015
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:09,342
for you than
accomplice.

1016
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:11,845
My apologies.

1017
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,348
So...

1018
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:17,851
you think i need to...

1019
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:20,854
define my boundaries
more clearly,

1020
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:23,356
keep a certain
distance,

1021
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:25,358
not internalize my--

1022
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,361
what did
i just say?

1023
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:31,364
Leave him.

1024
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:32,866
Take only
the children.

1025
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:34,367
What's left of
them and go.

1026
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:37,370
My priest said i shoul
d try and work with him,

1027
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,872
help him to be
a better man.

1028
00:52:38,872 --> 00:52:40,874
How's that going?

1029
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:46,379
I...

1030
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:49,382
have you ever read
"crime and punishment"?

1031
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:50,884
Dostoyevsky?

1032
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:52,886
It's not an
easy read.

1033
00:52:52,886 --> 00:52:55,388
It's about guilt
and redemption

1034
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:58,391
and i think were
your husband to
turn himself in,

1035
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:00,894
read this book
and reflect on
his crimes

1036
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:02,896
every day for seven years

1037
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:04,397
in his cell,

1038
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:06,900
then he might
be redeemed.

1039
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,903
I would have to
get a lawyer,

1040
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:11,404
find an apartment.

1041
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:14,407
Arrange for
child support--

1042
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:15,909
you're not listening.

1043
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:20,914
I'm not charging you because
i won't take blood money.

1044
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:22,916
And you can't
either.

1045
00:53:24,918 --> 00:53:26,920
One thing you
can never say...

1046
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,924
that you haven't
been told.

1047
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:35,428
I see.

1048
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:38,431
You're right,
i see.

1049
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:44,437
You're fucking
poisoning me.

1050
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:46,439
I don't know how much
more of this i can take.

1051
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:48,441
You taking
good care of
this young man?

1052
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:49,943
Jesus, dr. Kennedy.

1053
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:51,444
How you doing, guy?

1054
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:54,447
I been busy,
you alright?

1055
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:56,950
Doc, don't bullshit

Everybody else in this
family sleeps all day,

1077
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:02,015
I figure in the division
of labor around here,

1078
00:55:02,015 --> 00:55:03,016

1079
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:22,535
'Cause if you want
to go to therapy

1080
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:25,538
on your own
or something...

1081
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,043
i've noticed you b
een a little tense lately.

1082
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:31,544
That's rich.

1083
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:35,048
You suggesting
i go to a shrink.

1084
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,552
I don't
have the time.

1085
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:45,558
I'll still go to
yours if you want.

1086
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:51,064
You know best.

1087
00:55:51,064 --> 00:55:54,567
That dean
called today.

1088
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:57,070
Well, that
can't be good.

1089
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,572
I told him to put us
down for the 50, 000.

1090
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:03,576
Carmela, i
gave you five.

1091
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:05,078
Now...

1092
00:56:05,078 --> 00:56:07,580
maybe i could go
another five, maybe 10,

1093
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,583
but that's enough.

1094
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:16,089
Tony, you gotta do
something nice for me today,

1095
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:19,092
this is
what i want.

1096
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,594
You gotta
do this.

1097
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:23,096
Alright,
i'll go to 10.

1098
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:27,100
That should be enough
for those morningside
heights gangsters.

1099
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,102
I already
told him 50.

1100

50 g's.

1101
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:43,616
Yes.

1102
00:56:59,132 --> 00:57:02,135
You look like you could use
a night off from cookin'.

1103
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:05,138
What do you say
