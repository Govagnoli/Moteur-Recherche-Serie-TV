1
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,516
Three fucking weeks
it takes you

2
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:15,018
to put me on
your visitor's list?

3
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:16,519
Just be careful.

4
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,022
These motherless fucks
listen to everything.

5
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:21,524
A nephew's
visiting his uncle...

6
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,027
who loves him.

7
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,528
I got nothing
to say to you.

8
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,031
So many tragedies
and near tragedies
to those close to you.

9
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,033
Don't be
so fucking smart.

10
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,535
Things could have
gone the other way,
my little nephew.

11
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,538
Yeah, but
they didn't.

12
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:38,541
What's all this shit
i'm hearing about your heart?

13
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:44,047
This problem
you and me had...

14
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:47,050
i want you to know your mother
had nothing to do with it.

15
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,551
She's dead to me.

16
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,553
She's a sick woman,
she don't have all her marbles.

17
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,055
Who the fuck
are you kidding?

18
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,557
It's killing you
that people are talking...

19
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:58,061
that an old woman
made an asshole out of you.

20
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,562
Not half so bad
as certain rumors

21
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,564
floating around
this place about you.

22
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:04,567
How tony soprano likes to
fluff up his mother's pillow

23
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,569
so she can get
a nice long sleep.

24
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,071
Who said that?

25
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:10,073
You want to make all this
nonsense disappear?

26
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,075
Make peace with her,

27
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,578
it'll look like no bad blood,
it'll be good for all of us.

28
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:17,580
No fucking way.

29
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,582
You tell
that fat fuck, bacala,

30
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:23,086
tell him to come out
from his mouse hole,
i want to see him tomorrow.

31
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:28,091
What for?

32
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,094
The black man
industrialized the north

33
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,096
but we're still
fighting for jobs.

34
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:36,099
Over 25 joint- fitters
on this work site,

35
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,102
not a black man
to be found.

36
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,104
Tell'em, reverend.

37
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,106
I'll tell you why.

38
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:45,608
Black joint- fitters,
like all black artisans,

39
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,111
have been shut out
of the union.

40
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:52,115
Out of work while
their white joint- fitter

41
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,617
is filling his stomach.

42
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:58,621
My father put his life
on the line for this country.

43
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:01,124
C'mon up here, papa.

44
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,626
Somebody help
my papa up here.

45
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,629
This is my papa!

46
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,631
Fought in world war ii
, the war against tyranny,

47
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:13,636
came home to establish
his own tabernacle.

48
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:17,640
When he came home,
i said when he came home,

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,643
he had to fight a differen
t kind of war all over again.

50
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:29,152
Talk to them, papa,
talk to the people, papa.

51
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:32,155
Since then we have
spilled our blood in korea,

52
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:35,158
vietnam and iraq.

53
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,660
Every time i say,
sweet jesus,

54
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,663
let them do right by our boys
when they get back here.

55
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:44,667
But somebody forgot
to tell the man.

56
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,670
Now, you know
what i'm talking about.

57
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,672
Tell them!

58
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,674
Yes, i'm gonna
tell them.

59
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,177
I'm gonna tell them no more
cutting us out.

60
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,679
No more!

61
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,681
No more!

62
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:59,682
No more!

63
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,184
No more!

64
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:06,189
You hear that,
mr. Masserone brothers'
construction?

65
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,191
No more!

66
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,692
Somebody tell me
what we want!

67
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:10,693
Jobs!

68
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:11,694
When do we
want'em?

69
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,695
Now!

70
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:13,696
Want do we want?

71
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:16,199
Jobs!

72
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,700
Hey, med!

73
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,703
I'm going to visit
"she who's name
may not be uttered".

74
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:21,704
Wanna come?

75
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,206
Grandma?
You mean like now?

76
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,709
I'd really like to
but i gotta study my french.

77
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,211
Stupid verbs.

78
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,712
No biggie.

79
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,214
Hey.

80
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:34,717
I want
to talk to you.

81
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,720
What the fuck were you doing
with that real estate sign?

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,723
Oh, yeah, i wanted
to talk to you about that.

83
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,725
I'm selling ma's house,
you understand, janice?

84
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,728
Now put that fucking sign
back in the fucking ground
and that's it!

85
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,230
End of discussion,
period!

86
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,232
You're so
left- brain.

87
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:51,234
Whether the sign's
there or not

88
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:54,237
the house is still
for sale, the agent
still has the listing.

89
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,739
Then what was the sign doing
in the back seat of your car?

90
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,242
Don't try
to deny it!

91
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,744
Because i'm trying
to save a little money,
is that alright?

92
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:03,746
Do you remember
cathy fiola?

93
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,749
She was in my class
at sacred heart
with the birthmark.

94
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,251
What about her?

95
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,752
She's in
real estate now.

96
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:12,255
She said she'd only charge
a three percent commission.

97
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:15,758
That's half, tony,
thousands of dollars.

98
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,261
It may not mean
anything to you, but
maybe ma could use it.

99
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,263
Yeah?
Fuck her.

100
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,765
And next time
you disappear for a week,

101
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,767
take that piece of shit and
park it in the fucking street!

102
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,270
This isn't
a fucking hotel!

103
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:35,278
We're out of cran- apple,
mrs. S. , is plain apple okay?

104
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,780
Oh, sure, dear.

105
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:39,282
Oh, honey?

106
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:42,785
Do you suppose you could get me
some strawberry ice cream?

107
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:46,789
They can't expect me
to eat this tapioca.

108
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,791
I'll see
what i can do.

109
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,795
She cracks me up.

110
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:55,298
Well, i can't
believe it.

111
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:58,301
It's my daughter
from california.

112
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,802
It's seattle, ma.

113
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:01,804
Would you like
some of my tapioca?

114
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:03,306
Good morning.

115
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,809
Oh, you reek
of cigarettes.

116
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,811
Look at you.

117
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,813
All dressed,
out of bed.

118
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,815
You see my hand?

119
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:14,317
It's all
black and blue

120
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,320
from where they
stuck in the needle.

121
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,321
That's how
you get better.

122
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:19,822
You don't care.

123
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:22,325
You weren't here
five minutes.

124
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,328
I had to go to
the city for a few days.

125
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,330
I'm pitching
my self- help video.

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,333
"Lady kerouac",

127
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,337
or "packing for the highwa
y to a woman's self- esteem."

128
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:36,339
You could never
stand it here.

129
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,341
You could never
stand yourself

130
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:41,344
and that's
why you ran away.

131
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:43,346
Let's not go there
today, ma.

132
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,848
You think it was
easy for me?

133
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:49,352
You don't know the kind of
man your father was!

134
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,853
What do you mean?

135
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,355
Nobody knows!

136
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,357
Nobody knows
what i went through.

137
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:57,860
What about daddy?

138
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,862
One thing
i could tell you,

139
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:04,367
it would kill him
to see me now.

140
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,370
Here's your ice cream, mrs. S,
then we can take our walk.

141
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,372
Leave me alone,
please.

142
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:12,375
Open the window
and just push me out.

143
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,378
I can't
take this anymore.

144
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,380
Mrs. Soprano, what's wrong,
what happened?

145
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,382
She just
started crying.

146
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,884
You, i know
why you're here.

147
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,886
You don't fool me
for a second.

148
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,889
You're here because
you want to take my house.

149
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,891
Ma!

150
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,893
You don't know what goes
through this mind of mine.

151
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:32,895
That's for
fucking sure!

152
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:36,399
Someday i hope you have
children of your own

153
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,401
and they treat you
like this.

154
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:44,407
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

155
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:46,409
This is bullshit.

156
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,416
Talk to me.

157
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,918
These fucking activists,
they're killing me.

158
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:57,420
They're picketing
my place 24- 7.

159
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,422
Three days
i'm down already.

160
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:00,923
Who?

161
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,425
This hard- on,
rev. Herman james jr.

162
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:03,926
He's an old song,

163
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,928
not enough minorities
doing the joint fitting.

164
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,430
You were told
the joint- fitters union

165
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,931
is under my uncle's
jurisdiction.

166
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,933
I know.

167
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,435
But if you could pave the way
for me to talk to your uncle,

168
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,437
so he could maybe
send some guys down

169
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,439
and make it uncomfortable
for these people.

170
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,441
Like you did with
your unions before.

171
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,942
It's gonna
cost you.

172
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,444
Besides what you're
already raping me

173
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,945
for those no- show
electrician jobs?

174
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:24,947
You're not such
a fucking citizen

175
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,949
when you want a construction
bid to go your way.

176
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,451
Take it easy.

177
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:30,453
I'll see
what i can do.

178
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:32,955
Meantime,
call animal control.

179
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,458
Watch you don't
get followed meeting me.

180
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:52,475
You're late.

181
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:56,979
Bobby baccalieri,
the last man standing.

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,482
I don't want to
say nothing, tony.

183
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:00,983
You don't want to get
yourself in trouble.

184
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:04,487
A lot of funerals in
your corner of the world,
huh, bobby?

185
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,490
What'd you have to do,
refinance your house?

186
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,493
Don't look at the floor,
bobby, look at me.

187
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,496
I want you to talk
to that bald cocksucker

188
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,998
who calls himself
my father's brother.

189
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,501
Tell him i'm gonna let him
keep on earning.

190
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,003
Subsistence level.

191
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:24,507
He'll be able to pay
his defense lawyers.

192
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,509
Let me say for him,

193
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,010
thank you.

194
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,513
You're gonna hear
some high- end shit.

195
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,016
And "a", i hope
you could understand it,

196
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:38,020
and "b", i hope you keep it
between this room and junior.

197
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,523
Because if you don't,
i promise you,

198
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:43,526
they're gonna find
pieces of you in
eight different dumpsters.

199
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,027
I inherited junior.

200
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:48,030
I don't think you got reason
to talk to me this way.

201
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,032
I always liked you.

202
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,534
Bullshit.

203
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,536
But we'll assume
you do now.

204
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:57,540
You tell my uncle that
he gets to keep five percent,

205
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,543
five percent of his shy,
his sports betting,

206
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,545
same with the coke.

207
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,047
The joint- fitters union,
it's all his, okay?

208
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:08,050
Bobby, listen,
this is very important.

209
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,554
He also gets
to keep his stripes.

210
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,055
As far as the feds
are concerned,

211
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,558
they got the boss
of the family in jail,
awaiting trial,

212
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,060
and if they hear different,
it creates confusion.

213
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,562
Got it.

214
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:22,565
As far as the rest of
everything that junior owned,

215
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:28,571
it's now mine.

216
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:30,573
I'll get this to him, tony.

217
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,074
That's it.

218
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:43,085
"To the victor,
belongs the spoils."

219
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,587
Why don't you get
the fuck out of here

220
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:48,090
before i shove
your quotations book
up your fat fucking ass!

221
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,097
Mr. Bompensiero?

222
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,600
Is your wife here
to drive you home?

223
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,602
Skip.

224
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,108
Skip?

225
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,617
How we feeling?

226
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,619
Fucking great.

227
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:19,622
He's gonna be out of it
for another hour or so.

228
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,625
The injection
went great.

229
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,628
You'll feel the difference in
your back in a couple of days.

230
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,630
Buzz me when he feels
ready to leave.

231
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,632
Yeah, we'll
buzz you, honey.

232
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:36,138
Bzz, bzz...

233
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,641
my back don't feel
one iota different.

234
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,644
Doctor said it'll take
a couple days for
the steroids to kick in.

235
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:44,146
I gotta get
my jacuzzi.

236
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,649
Too much stress
in your life, sal.

237
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,151
Tony doesn't know
you're back yet, does he?

238
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:52,154
Jesus christ, no,
i didn't go see him yet.

239
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,156
You guys
are all alike.

240
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,158
We've seen guys
drag their dicks before,

241
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,661
take advantage of
the government's generosity,

242
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,163
playing both ends
against the middle.

243
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,666
Will you give me
a window over here?

244
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,167
Tony already thinks
maybe i flipped.

245
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,169
I gotta
be careful.

246
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,171
Jimmy altieri
ate the pill for you.

247
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:10,172
Any suspicion abou
t being an informant

248
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,675
went to the grave
with jimmy altieri.

249
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:13,676
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,678
I know tony 30 years,
now this?

251
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,179
Spare me, okay?

252
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,681
You've been on our tit
since'98.

253
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,683
Fucking chauffeur service
to and from the doctor,

254
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,184
that we had
to find for you.

255
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,687
If we're gonna let you
back on the streets and earn,

256
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,188
we want results.

257
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:28,691
The fuck tried to
suffocate his own mother!

258
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,192
She's a disgrace.

259
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:32,194
His own uncle
wanted him whacked.

260
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,197
You said so for yourself,
he's been shitting
on you for years.

261
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,199
I know
what i said.

262
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,702
Plus he's been crying
to a shrink twice a week.

263
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:41,704
You don't
owe this man dick.

264
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:42,705
Don't sit there
and tell me

265
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,707
you're gonna take a bullet
for some yuppie

266
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:48,210
who thinks
you're his errand boy.

267
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:50,212
Your honor,

268
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,715
this man should not be
removed from custody
for medical reasons.

269
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,217
Every time we get one
of these elder mafiosos
incarcerated,

270
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,219
we get the same
bag of tricks.

271
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,722
Your honor,
i take offense

272
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,725
to the characterization
of my client as a mafioso.

273
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:06,228
Mr. Soprano has not been
found guilty of anything.

274
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,731
He's awaiting trial
for alleged offenses.

275
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,232
Noted.

276
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,234
With all due respect to
the state's medical facilities,

277
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:16,739
in his condition,
mr. Soprano has every right

278
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,242
to pursue the best
possible medical care
that he can afford.

279
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:23,245
Mr. Soprano is suffering
from a very benign illness,

280
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,247
a few clogged arteries,
your honor.

281
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:27,249
I'm leaning towards releasing
this man from lock- up

282
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,754
unless you can demonstrate
a serious flight risk.

283
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:35,758
Mr. Soprano,
if i approve this

284
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:39,261
you will be under
what is called "house arrest".

285
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,763
Do you understand
this concept?

286
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:42,264
Not really.

287
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:46,268
It means that you must remain
in your primary residence

288
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,770
and cannot leave,

289
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,774
except for
doctor's appointments,
food shopping.

290
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,275
Your honor,

291
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,778
the government asks for
an electronic bracelet.

292
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,281
Your honor, while we certainly
agree to house arrest,

293
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:04,286
we are asking that mr. Soprano
not be further persecuted

294
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,789
for yet to be
proven allegations.

295
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:11,293
He shows no prior arrest
since 1968.

296
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,795
He pays his taxes,

297
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,297
and he's a veteran
of the second world war.

298
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,800
Mr. Soprano,
do you have any problem

299
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,803
with wearing
an electronic bracelet?

300
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:23,305
It sounds like
nazi germany to me.

301
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:27,810
Obviously, you need
a history lesson, sir.

302
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,813
I don't think that we--
you and i,

303
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:35,317
should let our shared
sorrow or biases
enter into this, judge.

304
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,319
He's wearing
a bracelet...

305
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:44,326
to avoid any risk
of flight.

306
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,841
Who are you?

307
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:00,843
Jesus christ, you scared
the shit out of me.

308
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:03,345
Jesus ain't got
nothing to do with it.

309
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,848
Now what do you
want here?

310
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,851
Looking for your son,
is he around?

311
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:09,852
You a friend?

312
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:11,353
Is he around?

313
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:15,858
He'll be
back here soon.

314
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,860
Well, c'mon in.

315
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,874
You were a good- looking
guy back then.

316
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,376
Still am.

317
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,379
Still got the same teeth
as in that picture.

318
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,380
Oh, yeah?

319
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,883
Go on and laugh.

320
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:44,887
Picture was taken
57 years ago.

321
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,889
So that makes you...?

322
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,390
Old.

323
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,392
C'mon,
how old are you?

324
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,393
75.

325
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,395
Add eight more
and you got it.

326
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,397
83, get the fuck
out of here.

327
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,399
What do you want
with my son?

328
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,902
Got a little business
i gotta discuss with him.

329
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,904
If you say so.

330
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:05,908
So, you're 28 years old
when world war ii starts.

331
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,911
That's a little long
in the tooth, isn't it?

332
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,413
'43, they was
taking everyone,

333
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:13,415
no matter how old
or how ugly.

334
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,418
Even took this
fat boy i knew.

335
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,421
He was already 34.

336
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,424
Wasn't no good to nobody,
except he could cook.

337
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:25,427
I swear he was more dangerous
with that stove

338
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:28,430
than he was
with that rifle.

339
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,432
You ever watch
the history channel?

340
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,433
Television?

341
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,435
No, this is
the history channel.

342
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:34,937
I think
you'd like it.

343
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:37,439
They even do a lot of
that bible shit.

344
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,441
Only shit in the bible
came out of pharaoh's ass

345
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,944
when moses
parted the red sea.

346
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:46,448
Parted the red sea,
praise his name.

347
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:51,453
Never underestimate a man's
determination to be free.

348
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:00,963
Um...

349
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,465
i'll catch up with your son
another time.

350
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,482
You break that,
you're paying for it.

351
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,994
If i'd have known you
were gonna get out so fast
with this medical shit

352
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,496
i never would've talked
to that calzone with legs.

353
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,998
He gave me
the message.

354
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,500
Don't fucking pout.

355
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,005
Be grateful
i'm letting you earn.

356
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:46,508
What's on your mind?

357
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,510
How'd you swing this?

358
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,513
This dr. Schreck,
he's monty schreck's kid.

359
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:55,517
Monty, the bookie's son?
He's a cardiologist.

360
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,519
That's not bad.

361
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,521
Law says feds can't
bug your doctor's office.

362
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,523
Let's me use this place
whenever i need to

363
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:04,526
to conduct business.

364
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,030
So, you heard about
masserone construction?

365
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,532
Bacala is
taking care of it.

366
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:13,535
The joint- fitters
know he speaks for me.

367
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,537
It's gotta go
60- 40, my way.

368
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:17,039
Did you do
what i asked?

369
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,541
What did you
ask me to do?

370
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,043
You know,
make peace.

371
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,045
You listen...

372
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,547
that's enough with that shit,
that woman is dead to me.

373
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:27,049
You let it go!

374
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,051
Why the fuck should i
? she's my brother's wife.

375
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,053
She doesn't realize
what she says half the time.

376
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,055
Let's put our cards
on the table here.

377
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:37,059
I heard your radio debut
on those tapes the feds
made at green grove.

378
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,561
So she doesn't know what
she's saying half the time.

379
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,563
Which half
did you listen to?

380
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,065
The half that doesn't
make any sense,

381
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,567
or the half that
we both know played you
like a fucking child?

382
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,069
Nobody played me.

383
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:50,572
She didn't know that she was
setting you up to get popped.

384
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:51,573
That's right.

385
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:54,576
Your uncle isn't
as dumb as you think.

386
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:57,079
You and that
miserable fuck, altieri.

387
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,081
That rat bastard,
all of my capos,

388
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,083
meeting behind my back.

389
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,584
Let sleeping dogs
lie, okay?

390
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,088
I have my reasons.

391
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,090
I'll tell you one dog
you left still barking,

392
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,591
that fucking
freddie capuano.

393
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:13,095
That motherless money- grubbing
little son- of- a- bitch--

394
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:16,598
the guy who owns green grove
retirement community?

395
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,600
He's like
an old fucking lady!

396
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,602
He's been going around
telling soprano business

397
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,604
to anybody
who'll listen!

398
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:24,106
He's the one that's been
saying that shit

399
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,108
about you trying
to whack your mother.

400
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,110
Even implied
that me and her...

401
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,113
that hairpiece
motherfucker.

402
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:43,125
Did everybody take a vow
of silence or something?

403
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,127
Nobody's got
anything to report?

404
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:48,130
I gotta write a report
on dna for biology.

405
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,132
Isn't that
interesting?

406
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:52,634
I just saw
on "inside edition"

407
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,138
how there will be
no more unknown soldiers

408
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:57,639
because of
dna now.

409
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,642
They will be able to
identify every single
casualty of combat.

410
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,644
Pass me more of that
macaroni and cheese.

411
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:05,147
You know, tony,

412
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:08,150
i know you don't like
to talk about her, but...

413
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,152
that woman
is impossible.

414
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:16,658
She's a complete narcissist,
i mean,"me, me, me".

415
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,660
Really kudos.

416
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,162
You are a saint.

417
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,664
You were right the first time,
i don't want to talk about it.

418
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:26,668
You talking
about grandma?

419
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:29,671
She pushes those buttons,
she's a big baby.

420
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,673
You know?

421
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,680
Excusez- moi.

422
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,183
Tony.

423
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,185
This is my house.

424
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,187
How many times
i gotta say it?

425
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,189
Thank you,
il duce.

426
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:48,690
You got
something to say?

427
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,192
The little girl who's
about to get her license

428
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,194
might want to use one of
those cars in driveway

429
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,196
in the next
hundred years.

430
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,198
It's my fault, med.

431
00:21:56,198 --> 00:22:02,204
I wasn't sensitive
to his feelings.

432
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,206
Thank you.

433
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:05,707
You see that?

434
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:08,210
You see how
easy that was?

435
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,712
So, mr. Delegated
power of attorney,

436
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,215
have you given it
any thought?

437
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,217
Can my girlfriend
have the listing?

438
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,219
You know,
of the house?

439
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,720
As long
as it gets sold,

440
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:24,726
i don't give a fuck
who lists it.

441
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,229
Hey, what did one prick
say to the other prick?

442
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,730
You see that?

443
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:32,234
See what happens with you
cursing at the dinner table?

444
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:14,276
Thanks for this,
aunt par,

445
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,778
it's hard to find people
over 25 to drive with.

446
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,780
Just don't let them know
you drove me to buy some pot,

447
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,282
which should
be legal.

448
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:22,784
It's the only things
that works for these hands.

449
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,286
Med, wasn't that
a stop sign?

450
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:26,788
I just hate the way
he thinks he can talk to you.

451
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:27,789
It's so obnoxious.

452
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,291
He's insecure.

453
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,792
He's afraid
to leave new jersey

454
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,795
and he's threatened
by anybody who's broken free.

455
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,297
He's too pathetic.

456
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,299
How about grandma
in that rehab center?

457
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,801
I know, i'm dying
to go over and see her,

458
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,303
but i've had
so much homework,

459
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:43,805
plus all this community service
you have to do

460
00:23:43,805 --> 00:23:45,807
to even think about getting
into a decent college.

461
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:47,809
I bring food
to homeless shelters.

462
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,811
You know grandma
pretty well,
don't you?

463
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:51,313
I guess.

464
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,315
What is she into?

465
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:56,818
I don't know,
negativity?

466
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:57,819
Seriously,

467
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,322
there must be something
that gives her pleasure.

468
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,823
Isn't there anything
she likes doing?

469
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:04,326
My dad used to try and find her
these old records,

470
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,329
these sisters.

471
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:11,333
Oh, the de castro sisters,
right.

472
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:15,337
The andrews sisters
would have been too easy.

473
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:17,839
He used to bring her
that mario lasagna guy.

474
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,842
Oh, yuck,
i hated that shit.

475
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:33,855
Your glasses
will be ready on thursday.

476
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,857
Thursday,
that's good.

477
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:37,859
Did you see me
on tv?

478
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:39,861
You were on tv?

479
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:41,363
What show?

480
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:42,864
The evening news.

481
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,366
Oh, yeah.

482
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:46,868
What about it?

483
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:48,870
How'd i look?
Be honest.

484
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,374
You looked, you know,
like you.

485
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:53,875
You looked good.

486
00:24:54,376 --> 00:25:01,383
I didn't like
the way i looked.

487
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,885
Maybe i should get new frames,
what do you think?

488
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:08,390
What's wrong
with them?

489
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,893
How much those frames
set you back?

490
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:14,396
Insurance pays,
i never see the bill.

491
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,897
Nice country.

492
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,400
I got cataracts.

493
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,902
My father told me,
"never get old."

494
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,904
I should have
listened to him.

495
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:26,908
Yeah.

496
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:30,412
A chinaman goes
to see the eye doctor,

497
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,914
after the exam
the doctor says,

498
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:34,916
"i know why
you're having trouble."

499
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,418
Chinaman says,
"why?"

500
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:38,420
Doctor says,
"you have a cataract."

501
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,925
Chinaman says,"no,
i have a rincoln continental."

502
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:46,428
You don't
get it?

503
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:50,432
I get it,
he drives a lincoln.

504
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:51,933
What?

505
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,970
Excuse me,
where's the men's room?

506
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:31,973
Through the doors
to the left.

507
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:02,504
You're awake.

508
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,506
What--
what is that?

509
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:06,508
That music?

510
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:08,510
"Non ti scordar di me."

511
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,512
Pavarotti.

512
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,013
Did you bring it?

513
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:16,518
I never forgot how much
you liked a good tenor.

514
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:19,521
Remember when we saw
mario lanza on tv?

515
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:22,023
You and me and daddy
on the sofa,

516
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:25,527
watching ed sullivan.

517
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:28,029
I don't think we ever
missed a sunday.

518
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,032
Oh, my god
, my children.

519
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:33,535
Music hath charms, ma.

520
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:35,537
Thank god, huh?

521
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:54,616
I think it's time for you
to start to seriously
consider salads.

522
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,618
What do you mean?

523
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,620
What do i mean.

524
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,624
Get off my car before
you flip it over,
you fat fuck.

525
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,126
Junior wants
to know when.

526
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:08,630
Tomorrow morning.

527
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:16,638
We're short a couple of guys,
so make sure you're there.

528
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,640
Consider it exercise.

529
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,149
"Fat fuck."

530
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,151
Why don't you look
in the mirror some time,

531
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:35,657
you insensitive
cocksucker.

532
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:38,660
Tony,
we're sitting down!

533
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,662
Ma, dna,
it's invisible, right?

534
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:44,165
But guess how many nucleotides
are in each strand.

535
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,166
Just tell her.

536
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,168
A hundred million.

537
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,670
Wow,
that's amazing.

538
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,172
She knows
what time we eat.

539
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:55,677
I don't want you
setting a place for her
if she's not here.

540
00:29:56,177 --> 00:30:01,182
Anthony jr. ,
want to do the honors?

541
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:04,686
Bless us our lord
on thy gifts
we're about to receive...

542
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:08,189
hello!

543
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,191
You guys started
without me.

544
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:12,694
Good, great.

545
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:16,197
Bless us
our lord, amen.

546
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:18,199
Janice, you know
what time we eat.

547
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,202
If you're gonna be late, call,
or you're not gonna eat.

548
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:26,708
Don't send me
to bed hungry, daddy.

549
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,711
Everybody, guess who passed
her driving test today?

550
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,212
She learned
from the best.

551
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:32,714
Go, girl!

552
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:35,216
I had to parallel park
behind this van

553
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,718
and i was so nervous.

554
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,720
The guy was a
real dork with a
clipboard and everything.

555
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,223
Oh, wow,
fascist martinet.

556
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,726
Salsice, janice?

557
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:46,728
Oh, i forgot,
you don't eat pork...

558
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,229
no.

559
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,233
...in that way.

560
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,735
Oh, i get it.

561
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:57,238
There's nothing to get,
she's a vegetarian.

562
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:14,255
I missed the fireflies
out west.

563
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:18,760
That's why
i moved out here.

564
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,266
Little bit
of nature.

565
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,768
When you were
in seattle,

566
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,270
you ever drive
by jimmy hendrix's house?

567
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,772
Mm- mmm.

568
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:40,281
You know, tony,

569
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:43,284
i know it's not your
favorite subject, but...

570
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:47,288
we had some really great news
about ma at the hospital today.

571
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:51,292
Her rehab therapist says
she's making tremendous strides

572
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,294
and it's not gonna
be long before
they release her.

573
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,296
How can she make
tremendous strides

574
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,799
when there's nothing
wrong with her
in the first place?

575
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,300
It's called
face- saving therapy.

576
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,303
The patient has to believe
that they're getting therapy.

577
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,305
Believe me, medicare's
not gonna pay for it

578
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,808
if it's not
as necessary as real,
would they?

579
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:10,311
And the taxpayer
foots the bill.

580
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:12,313
It's not
much longer now.

581
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:15,316
But she's gonna
need a place to stay.

582
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:17,819
She's out
on the street.

583
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:20,822
Tony, it is
her house.

584
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,824
Dead people
don't have houses.

585
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:25,326
Daddy bought
that house.

586
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,834
Tell you what...

587
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,836
take her back
to green grove.

588
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,838
What,
the nursing home?

589
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:39,340
It's a
retirement community.

590
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:45,346
You know i don't have
that kind of money.

591
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:46,848
Fuck you.

592
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,359
You should've seen the look
on that blimp's face

593
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:00,361
when i told him
he had to be here today.

594
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:01,863
Bacala's always
been a lazy bastard.

595
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,365
You can't get nobody
good anymore.

596
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:05,867
They're either
on fucking drugs

597
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,368
or compromised
with the law,

598
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,870
or they're young and
don't listen to orders.

599
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,371
Please.

600
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,874
It's all
"me, me, me".

601
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,376
I hope you don't feel
that way about me, tony.

602
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,878
It's just this back.

603
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:18,379
You done plenty.

604
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,882
You paid your dues.

605
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:31,392
That's
tony soprano.

606
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,894
What the fuck?

607
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,395
Hey, tony!

608
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:39,901
This is what i'm talking about,
motherfucker.

609
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,403
Am i supposed to be seen here,
you fucking idiots?

610
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:45,907
Now we look
like jerkoffs.

611
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:55,416
Get out of
the way!

612
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:58,920
When do
we want'em?

613
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,922
We want to talk
to your foreman.

614
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,924
You want to talk
to the foreskin?

615
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,926
You a wise- ass
motherfucker.

616
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:08,429
Keep your mother
off the streets
and i won't fuck her.

617
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:23,945
Justice...

618
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:27,949
motherfucker,
c'mon?

619
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:37,959
Hi, ma.

620
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:40,461
Oh, nicholas antonelli.

621
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:43,965
Dead at age 73,
of heart failure.

622
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:46,968
Mmm...
so, ma...

623
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:49,470
you're gonna be
getting out of here soon.

624
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,472
Want to go home?

625
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:52,974
Home?

626
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:54,976
Back to the house?

627
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,478
My house?

628
00:34:57,478 --> 00:34:58,980
Uh- huh.

629
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,983
No, i don't think so,
i'll go back to
the other place.

630
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:03,985
To the nursing home?

631
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:06,487
That's for people
who don't have anybody
to look after them.

632
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,489
Oh, it's
not that bad.

633
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:10,992
And they give you
fresh towels every day.

634
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,494
Barbara said
you hated it.

635
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:14,996
It's too much
trouble.

636
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,498
No, ma, you can't
go back there.

637
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:19,000
Why not?

638
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,002
Because.

639
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:25,006
Because,
it's dangerous there.

640
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,008
What are you
talking about?

641
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:30,511
The owner...
is missing.

642
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,513
Mr. Capuano?

643
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,016
They suspect
foul play.

644
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,517
Yeah.

645
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:45,026
Ma.

646
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:49,530
Ma, you okay?

647
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,032
Nurse!

648
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:56,037
It's my mother.

649
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,538
What is it?

650
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:59,040
What's the matter?

651
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,541
Are you okay,
mrs. Soprano?

652
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,043
Oh.

653
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,544
Take a deep breath.

654
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,046
Breathe.

655
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:08,049
Why do they make
cookies that way?

656
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,051
You scared me, ma.

657
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,553
Would you just stop it,
stop it!

658
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:16,557
Just give me a minute,
go, go, stop hovering.

659
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:24,565
Perhaps this is a good time
to talk about this.

660
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:27,068
There's no emergency provision
for your mother on file.

661
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,570
I tried to talk
to her about a dnr

662
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,572
and she got
very agitated.

663
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:32,573
Dnr?

664
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:34,075
"Do not resuscitate."

665
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,077
It's to save the family
a lot of anguish and decisions

666
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:37,578
at a difficult time,

667
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,081
when there is
no quality of life.

668
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,084
Janice, where are
my glasses?

669
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:46,087
I can't find the tissues,
janice!

670
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,089
I'm sorry, tony,

671
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,092
but the hospital is gonna
need a decision on this.

672
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,593
Auxiliary "b",
what the fuck?

673
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,096
It you're gonna have
power of attorney, tony,

674
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,098
you're gonna have to
act like one.

675
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,100
Who gives a fuck,
dnr, no dnr?

676
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,102
Yeah, okay, great,

677
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,604
so then what happens
when she goes into a coma

678
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,606
and they have to keep her alive
with tubes and machines,

679
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,108
because you won't
sign the dnr?

680
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:08,109
What?!

681
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,610
When she becomes
a vegetable

682
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,112
she's not gonna
give a fuck about anything!

683
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:13,614
To deprive your mother
of a place of live.

684
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:18,119
To deprive me my chance
to make peace with my mother.

685
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,120
You know what,
janice?

686
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,621
Take her,
you can have her.

687
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,124
The two of you in that house,
you deserve each other.

688
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,625
It'd be worth it
just to watch.

689
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:28,129
It'll be like,
"whatever happened to
baby janice over there."

690
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:34,135
I'll give you
your fucking dnr!

691
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:36,137
Mom, i can't
find the keys.

692
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,139
Keys to what,
to the car?

693
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:40,141
You got
a driver's license,

694
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:43,144
not a license to g
o carousing around
on a school night.

695
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:46,147
Mother, i was going to take
anthony to visit grandma.

696
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,648
You said
we can visit her.

697
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,650
If you want
to drive us, fine.

698
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,652
Now you want to
visit grandma?

699
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:55,156
Can we mom?

700
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,658
No funny business.

701
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,660
You go to
the hospital and back.

702
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,163
The level of trust
in this family,

703
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,165
check the mileage
if you want to.

704
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:09,170
God.

705
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,672
You go ahead,
i'll come down later.

706
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,174
Why, where are
you going?

707
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,676
Hunter's back in
"eating disorders"
upstairs.

708
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,178
No, that's not fair.

709
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,679
I'm just gonna
say hello.

710
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,681
I'm telling.

711
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:24,185
I was gonna let you
drive in the ibm
parking lot this sunday.

712
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:43,704
Look who's here!

713
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,206
Anthony,
come over here.

714
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:48,209
Give your
grandma a kiss.

715
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,210
Oh...

716
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,711
ah...

717
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,713
i thought
you were janice.

718
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:57,718
She comes over everyday
to play pinochle with me.

719
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:01,722
Daughters take better care
of their mothers, that's why.

720
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:06,227
She's home,
i think.

721
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:09,730
You didn't ride over here
on your bicycle in the dark?

722
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:11,732
No, meadow
drove me.

723
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,735
Meadow?
Well, where is she?

724
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:16,737
I don't know.

725
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:17,738
She's another one.

726
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,740
They don't care
what happens to you, johnny.

727
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,243
They stick you
away somewhere

728
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:24,245
and they forget
you ever existed.

729
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,746
I guess.

730
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,748
Have a torrone.

731
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,251
No, i don't like
those italian candies.

732
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:32,753
Go ahead,
take one.

733
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,261
He's not even
washing his hands.

734
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:43,764
You know the thing about
louisiana food,

735
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:47,268
is that it's not really spicy,
it's just well- seasoned.

736
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,769
Don't we season
everything down there?

737
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,271
Absolutely.

738
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:52,773
So what we're
gonna do is i got a
little cayenne pepper...

739
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:55,276
grandma, what's dnr?

740
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:56,777
Who?

741
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,279
Dnr, it's initials,

742
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:00,281
like, i had to do
this report on dna,

743
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:03,784
but i heard dad and
aunt parvati talking
about your dnr.

744
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:05,786
So, is that
like similar?

745
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:08,789
Aunt?
You mean, janice?

746
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:12,793
Janice? They were
talking about me?

747
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:13,794
About your dnr.

748
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,297
'Cause that's what's confusing,

749
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,299
like, dna,
everybody's got that.

750
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:21,302
She thinks
i should have a dnr?

751
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:23,804
Or that dad should
give it to you or something.

752
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:26,807
Because what if you went
into a coma or something?

753
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:30,811
But dna doesn't
prevent coma's,
does it?

754
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:35,316
I don't know, i gotta
do this report by monday.

755
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:44,325
Very good, livia,
that's perfect.

756
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:46,327
I know my alphabet.

757
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,828
Guess what, ma?

758
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,831
I got great news.

759
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,835
Tony's not gonna
sell the house.

760
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:59,840
When you get released,
we're gonna take you back home.

761
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,841
Really?

762
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,343
Yeah.

763
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:04,345
And i'm gonna
live with you.

764
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,347
Why?

765
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:10,351
So you cannot
resuscitate me?

766
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:11,852
So i can what?

767
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:16,357
Oh, i seen that movie
with richard widmark.

768
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:17,858
Movie, ma?

769
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:19,360
Oh, mrs. Soprano.

770
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,861
No, take this one.

771
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:24,865
She gets her ballet shoes,
she sells them

772
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:26,867
and she takes the money
to newark,

773
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:29,870
and she buys
amphetamines.

774
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:32,373
She was
a child then.

775
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:36,377
I think you should go
live with your daughter,
mrs. Soprano.

776
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:41,382
I think i'm gonna leave
all my money to you, honey.

777
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:46,887
What are you
talking about, money?

778
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:52,393
I've gotta catch up
on some charts.

779
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:55,896
Janice, what'd
i tell you last week?

780
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:59,900
Where'd
i put my money?

781
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,903
You know,
this is very important.

782
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:06,407
I must have
put it somewhere.

783
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,410
Oh, c'mon, settimia.

784
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,913
No, you don't
fool me.

785
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:15,416
I know what
you're thinking about.

786
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,917
My name's janice.

787
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:18,919
Janice, ma.

788
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,921
You named me.

789
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,924
It's something else
you threw away of mine.

790
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:30,931
Are you sure?

791
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,934
I didn't tell you
where i put that money?

792
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:36,937
Let's not
worry about that.

793
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:38,939
Let's just
get you better

794
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:40,941
so you can go home

795
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,944
and i can take
good care of you.

796
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:45,946
And if it's there...

797
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:48,449
we'll find it.

798
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:10,471
Your sister's cunt!

799
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:23,984
That was wonderful, reverend,
thank you.

800
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:26,487
Now you call us
if you need anything.

801
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:27,988
Thank you.

802
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:29,990
Goodnight.

803
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,002
What's all this?

804
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:44,505
My father'
s passed away.

805
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:46,507
I was just
talking to him.

806
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,008
He lived well.

807
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,010
God blessed hi
m with longevity.

808
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,515
What are you gonna do?
We all will have our time.

809
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:58,519
My father didn't know about
our business arrangement.

810
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:01,522
He wouldn't
have approved.

811
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:07,027
Yeah, i got
that feeling.

812
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:08,529
Your moms and pop
still here?

813
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:10,531
My old man's
been gone for years.

814
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:11,532
Moms?

815
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:15,035
She still around,
she's too miserable to die.

816
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:18,038
Their generation's
almost all gone.

817
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:20,541
When the
last one goes,

818
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:24,044
we become the old folk
s at the family functions.

819
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,046
What are you
talking about?

820
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:28,048
We're still fucking kids,
for crying out loud.

821
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:30,050
Don't you
believe it, tony.

822
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:33,554
When the last one dies,
it signals the beginning
of the last stretch for us.

823
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:36,557
Don't get me wrong,
i'm not looking to go
no time soon,

824
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:38,559
it's just...

825
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:46,066
just feels funny now
being...an elder.

826
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:58,078
This is your end of
the demonstration bust- up.

827
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:00,581
Your guys went
a little too far.

828
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:02,583
Rasheen taylor
almost lost an eye.

829
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,085
How'd you do
overall?

830
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:08,589
Masserone gave me
five no- shows.

831
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,591
We whack it up
two and a half each.

832
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,092
Three- two.

833
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:13,594
I should be looking for
three- two my way.

834
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:16,096
I got to kick upstairs
to uncle junior.

835
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:17,598
Two and a half each.

836
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:19,099
All your guys
are in on this shit.

837
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,102
These protesters find out
i'm lining my pockets
with their blood,

838
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:24,104
it's me
they're crying for.

839
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:25,606
Hell, no,
three- two.

840
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:27,608
I'll think about it.

841
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:31,612
What'd you hear about
the public school
asbestos removal project

842
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:33,614
over in kearney?

843
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:36,116
Just waiting to see
who gets the bid.

844
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:39,620
Alright.

845
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,122
Hey, rev...

846
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:49,129
sorry about
your old man.

847
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:57,638
Hello.

848
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:59,139
He did?

849
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:00,641
Where is
he now?

850
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:06,647
Hello?

851
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:08,148
Oh, you're home.

852
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:10,150
How dare
you call here.

853
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,653
I called now on purpose.

854
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:15,155
Because i know
johnny's at work.

855
00:46:15,155 --> 00:46:17,658
Anthony, your son,
anthony.

856
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:19,660
He harbors resentment
against me

857
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,664
and to this day
i don't know what i did.

858
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:24,665
I'm hanging up.

859
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:26,667
I just want
you to know

860
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,170
what pennies i have,
i leave to the children.

861
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,674
Your children
and barbara's children.

862
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:36,677
I raised three children
of my own.

863
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:41,181
I did a pretty
good job on two.

864
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:43,684
They are all unhappy.

865
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:46,186
Sure, you listen
to that janice.

866
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:48,188
Be very careful,

867
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:50,691
because she's a real
snake in the grass.

868
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:53,694
She has no work ethic,
why is that?

869
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:57,197
If anything
happens to me...

870
00:46:57,197 --> 00:46:58,699
hello?

871
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,701
Hello?

872
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:05,205
Oh.

873
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,210
Where is he?

874
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,712
Did you
call an ambulance?

875
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:13,714
I don't need
no fucking ambulance.

876
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:17,718
See?

877
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:19,720
Oh, yeah, sure,
look at you.

878
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,722
C'mon, we're going
to the emergency room.

879
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:23,724
Fuck that,
i'm alright.

880
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:31,231
Why don't we just
go down there and make sure?

881
00:47:31,231 --> 00:47:32,733
Uncle jun.

882
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,741
Hey...

883
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,743
you still here?

884
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,745
No fucking ambulance.

885
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:49,249
I'll drive you, okay?
Bacala will come.

886
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:50,751
Yeah, sure.

887
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,252
We'll all go.

888
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:55,255
Help me up.

889
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:56,757
Can you walk?

890
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:59,259
I think
he broke his hip.

891
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:00,761
Oh, fuck you.

892
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,763
Take it easy,
hold on a minute.

893
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:04,264
I'll be okay.

894
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:06,767
Give me a minute
to catch my breath.

895
00:48:13,774 --> 00:48:16,276
Alright.

896
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:17,778
What are you doing?

897
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:21,782
What, do you
want a piggy- back?

898
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:23,283
Get the door.

899
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:25,285
Anthony...

900
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:27,788
don't let me go to my grave
with this guilt.

901
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:29,790
You listen to me,
you old prick,

902
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,792
you're not
going anywhere.

903
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:38,298
Make things right
with your mother, please.
