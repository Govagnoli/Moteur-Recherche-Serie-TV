1
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,544
You miss your first session,
they won't refund my money.

2
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,047
I forgot, i gotta take
care of this first.

3
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:23,576
Here he is.

4
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,578
How's it goin', buddy?

5
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,580
Don't you own
a fuckin' mirror?

6
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:34,587
You look like you
been french kissing
the pillsbury dough boy.

7
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,590
Alright, c'mon, what do
you got for me, man?

8
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,601
What the fuck, dominic?

9
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,103
It's half.

10
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,604
Three fuckin' weeks
in a row now.

11
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,605
Business slow!

12
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:57,110
We tell you!

13
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,611
We pay security,
what for?

14
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,612
Kid break window,
you do nothing!

15
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,114
We pay no more!

16
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,115
What'd she fuckin' say?

17
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,616
Nothing,
don't listen to her.

18
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,118
C'mon, honey,
let's go.

19
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,619
Honey, out front.

20
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,621
C'mon.

21
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,623
Now!

22
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,127
Fucking bitch.

23
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,628
You got money for blow,
but not for us?

24
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,631
Chris, please,
i'm sorry--

25
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,633
"business slow."

26
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,636
Half the fucking
neighborhood's out there
waiting for blow jobs.

27
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:29,642
You drug- addict
motherfucker.

28
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,145
This shit's
unacceptable.

29
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:41,654
How's everything?

30
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,658
How you doin', hon?

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,162
Third time
this week, artie.

32
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:56,169
He can't turn
down a four- top.

33
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,670
You're done already?

34
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,672
About time
you came back.

35
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,673
I was about to
start on your drapes.

36
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,175
What the fuck is that?

37
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,676
Quail, ala' bucco.

38
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,679
Baby quail stuffed
with fennel sausage.

39
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,681
Can i get aids
from eating this?

40
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,185
Hey, artie,
didn't i see this guy

41
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,687
in the park this morning
takin' a shit on a statue?

42
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:19,192
Jesus christ,
i'm tryin' something new.

43
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,693
Hey, broaden
your horizons.

44
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,695
Forget this fancy shit,
you know what you need here?

45
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,198
Top- notch moozadell' maker.

46
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,699
Like that kid
from the other side.

47
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,201
The best fuckin' cheese
you ever had.

48
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,202
The best.

49
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,703
They get the real milk.

50
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,705
Seriously, this kid,
all he does 24 hours a day

51
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,707
he makes buffalo moozadell'.

52
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,209
He's a master
cheese maker.

53
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,213
So's paulie.

54
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,215
Oh, yeah,
alright, alright.

55
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,217
Arthur, the bank!

56
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,218
Enjoy.

57
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,719
I'll catch you later.

58
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,221
You better run.

59
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,223
Why don't she go
to the bank?

60
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,726
Swing by after she takes
her broom for an oil change.

61
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,727
I'll be right back.

62
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,229
Good wine, no?

63
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,230
Delicious.

64
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,739
Artie.

65
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,241
You know that guy
i was talkin' about

66
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,242
over there with
the cheese?

67
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,243
He's my cousin.

68
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,244
Oh, yeah?

69
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,745
Yeah.

70
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,247
I haven't told anybody yet,
but he's coming over.

71
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,748
I thought maybe
you can hire him,

72
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,251
you know, help me out
with the immigration.

73
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,753
Kitchen's pretty
packed, tony.

74
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,255
I can barely pay myself.

75
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,256
Did i ask you
to pay him?

76
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,257
I'll take care
of the money.

77
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,758
Why's he want
to come in here

78
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,759
if he's already got
a job over there?

79
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,262
You know what, either do me
the favor or not.

80
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,265
Third grade on up,
you needed something,

81
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,766
i was there,
no questions.

82
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,769
Does he at least know
his ass from his schamozz'?

83
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,278
The actor is the instrument
for conveying ideas.

84
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:51,784
During the next...

85
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,785
this is
"acting for writers"?

86
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,787
And your first assignment
is to act like a writer

87
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,789
who gets here on time.

88
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,291
Sorry.

89
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,294
The tunnel.

90
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,296
As writers, you'll find
it enormously helpful

91
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,798
to walk a mile in
the actor's shoes.

92
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,302
Imagine being
an architect

93
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,305
who's never
lifted a stone.

94
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,808
Over the next few
weeks, we'll focus on
improv and scene study.

95
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,811
Why don't we begin by
introducing ourselves?

96
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:23,316
What your experience is,
where you're from...

97
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,317
mitch mcdermott.

98
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,818
Born and raised
in hartsdale,

99
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,820
but please,
don't hold that against me.

100
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,323
B. A. In english lit
from ithaca,

101
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,325
i've written a few specs,

102
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,327
haven't actually
sold anything yet.

103
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,828
Right now i'm on
the sales team

104
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,830
down at chick brauer,
porsche/audi.

105
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,832
Great, welcome.

106
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,842
My name is
chris maceveety.

107
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,844
I work on wall street.

108
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,847
Not on wall street,
but you know, stocks.

109
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,349
You write?

110
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,350
Yeah...

111
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,851
i want to writ
e for the movies.

112
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,353
"Goodfellas",
shit like that.

113
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,855
Any special reason
you chose this class?

114
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,357
I didn't.

115
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,359
It's a birthday present
from my girlfriend.

116
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,362
I had some problem
s with my screenplay

117
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,363
so, i bought that book,

118
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,865
"how to write
a movie in 21 days".

119
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,368
That was like a year ago.

120
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,371
Well, i can't guarantee
you'll write any faster,

121
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:23,376
but hopefully you'll
learn a few things.

122
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,878
My name is cynthia weller.

123
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,380
I was born in savanna,

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,383
but my family moved to
hempstead when i was five.

125
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,386
Despite soprano's recent
medical furlough from jail,

126
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,388
where he was
awaiting trial,

127
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,390
sources in the u. S. Attorney's
office indicate that

128
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,393
nephew anthony soprano
probably remains
the de facto boss

129
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,395
of the north jersey mob.

130
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,897
Soprano, seen here in an
fbi surveillance photo,

131
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,401
with family associate salvatore
"big pussy" bonpensiero,

132
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,404
was believed to be
the target of a botched
murder attempt last year

133
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,406
jesus fuckin' christ.

134
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,910
How come every piss i take
is a fuckin' news story?

135
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,913
Oh.

136
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,925
Let's walk.

137
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,927
I had coffee with
your friend from the railroad.

138
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,929
Sounds like mag
and custom wheels.

139
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,931
Could be sweet.

140
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,934
I need you to head
out to newark for me.

141
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,436
Airport?

142
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,437
Al italia.

143
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,439
Friend of ours
is coming in.

144
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,441
Who,
mauro zucca's wife?

145
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,943
No, furio.

146
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,445
Furio?

147
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,946
Coming here?

148
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,448
What, to see what indoor
plumbing looks like?

149
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:41,454
I'm making
some changes.

150
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,456
Well, thanks for
fuckin' tellin' me.

151
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,957
When was this decided?

152
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,959
I do something wrong?

153
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,464
Sunday, my house, box of
mallomars on the counter?

154
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,966
Fuckin' empty.

155
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,470
You think i don't
know it was you?

156
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,974
I'm kiddin', you fuck.

157
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,977
Listen, him coming
over is good, you're
gettin' a bump.

158
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,481
Fuckin' mallomars,
i thought you lost your mind.

159
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,484
Listen, the way things are,
i gotta step back.

160
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,487
Feds find an excuse,
i'll do a dime for jaywalking.

161
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,988
Not like the old days.

162
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,490
Furio being here,

163
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,992
frees you up,
frees me up.

164
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,495
It's me, then you
and sil together.

165
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,996
That's the new
pecking order.

166
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,498
What about puss'?

167
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,000
Pussy reports
to you guys...

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,502
directly.

169
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:36,008
Same with furio.

170
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,511
This means
a lot to me, t.

171
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,012
It was a downpour.

172
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,514
He couldn't see anything.

173
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,516
It was impossible.

174
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,018
Where are you
in the dream?

175
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,021
I'm there.

176
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,023
I could observe
everything.

177
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,028
He's driving, he starts
to hyperventilate.

178
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,532
He grabs for a bottle
of prozac, but it's empty.

179
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,033
And all the while
this is happening

180
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,036
that song from
"the wizard of oz" is playing.

181
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,538
"Over the rainbow".

182
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:12,545
No, that other one,

183
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,050
they're in
the poppy field.

184
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,555
That one.

185
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,558
Anyway, he goes into
a full- blown panic attack

186
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,561
and he passes out.

187
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:38,571
He crashes into
this huge truck.

188
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,573
Out of the woods.

189
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,575
The fact that he can't
see the road ahead

190
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,578
suggests my abandoning him.

191
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:53,085
Who in "wizard" would
your patient be?

192
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:58,591
Given the fact that he's
a powerful, dominating male...

193
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,594
oz himself.

194
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,096
What, elliot,
with the eyebrows already.

195
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,099
"The wizard of oz",

196
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,101
what memories
does it conjure up?

197
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:18,110
My parents' house,
watching it on tv.

198
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,618
Hiding under the blanket
with my sister.

199
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm gaining weight.

200
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,128
Why do we love
roller coasters, jennifer?

201
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,631
Scary movies?

202
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,635
To experience the thrill
of being terrified

203
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,638
without the consequences.

204
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,640
That's very good, elliot.

205
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,142
Great film, but some
terrifying moments.

206
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,144
That's very perceptive...

207
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,648
i'm concerned that treating
a mobster provides you

208
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,651
some vicarious thrill.

209
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,654
It wasn't
exactly vicarious.

210
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,657
I had to go into hiding,
remember?

211
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,658
And wasn't
that thrilling?

212
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,660
Fuck you!

213
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,663
You think
this is funny?

214
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,665
You smug cocksucker!

215
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:17,670
Fuck you!

216
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,192
Hello.

217
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,195
Who's this?

218
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,197
She's not here
right now.

219
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,700
This is her brother.

220
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,204
No.

221
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,206
Yeah, that's m
y mother's house.

222
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,208
On the what?

223
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:01,213
Yeah, i'll give he
r the fuckin' message.

224
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,215
That fuckin' bitch.

225
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,717
What's the matter?

226
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,218
It's a bank.

227
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,220
She's trying to take out a loan
on my mother's house.

228
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,221
Parvati?

229
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,222
Janice.

230
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,224
Her name is
fuckin' janice, okay!

231
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,226
She gave'em the wrong
social security number

232
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,227
or something!

233
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,729
Alright, tony,
calm down.

234
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,230
It's not enough that
she's livin' rent free,

235
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:25,237
she's gotta try
to squeeze money out of
the fuckin' house, too!

236
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:29,742
Fucking goddamn
fucking bitch!

237
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,244
Goddamn it, tony!

238
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,251
What did i say, a. J.?

239
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,253
Go get dressed.

240
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,262
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,265
Why don't you
grow the fuck up?

242
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,283
I forgot to tell you i got
a job with radio shack.

243
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,786
Product testing.

244
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,789
Giving that phone
an "f" for durability.

245
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:52,825
Janice, it's me,
open the door!

246
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,828
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

247
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,329
Where's my sister?

248
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,832
The store.

249
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm making breakfast,
you want some eggs?

250
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,343
Do i want some eggs?

251
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:15,347
Why don't you put
your fuckin' pants on?

252
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,349
Let's have
some coffee.

253
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,360
So, what the fuck, rich?

254
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,863
The mattress at the shelter
a little too lumpy?

255
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,365
We're adults, tony.

256
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,868
We got history
together.

257
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,869
Yeah.

258
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,370
Israel and fuckin'
palestine.

259
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,371
People change.

260
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,372
I was away a long time.

261
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,375
I thought a lot about her.

262
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,877
Ten years,
you thought about janice?

263
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,880
There are men in the can
better- looking than my sister.

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,382
To each his own, tony.

265
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:55,387
Each his own.

266
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,390
I hope you're not thinkin'
about movin' in here.

267
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,394
It was late,
i slept over.

268
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,396
We're taking
it slow, okay?

269
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,899
Pickin' up where
we left off.

270
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,400
High school.

271
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,903
Grabbin' blow jobs on
my mother's couch.

272
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,912
You crossed the line
on me once, anthony,
and i held my tongue.

273
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,416
She may be your sister
, but back the fuck off.

274
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,418
All due respect.

275
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,921
Respect?

276
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,923
What the fuck do you
know about respect?

277
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,425
I put you back in business,
you cocksucker.

278
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,927
Did you go see beansie?

279
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,929
Fuckin' paraplegic.

280
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,931
Why don't you make him
some fuckin' eggs?

281
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,433
Hello?

282
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,435
Hey, i thought
that was your car--

283
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,938
where do you get the balls to
take a loan on this house?

284
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,939
What?

285
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:47,940
You heard me!

286
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,441
What is it,
his fuckin' idea?

287
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,443
Like you could
pay it the fuck back!

288
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,445
I'm quite capable of
getting a job, tony.

289
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,947
Yeah, with your
carpel tunnel syndrome?

290
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,448
How you gonna hold
a beggar's cup?

291
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,450
I never begged
a day in my life.

292
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,451
Oh, you're right.

293
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,953
Fake disabilities
don't count.

294
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,455
I applied for the loan
simply because

295
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,958
i'm trying to make
this place habitable for ma.

296
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,459
Oh.

297
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,961
I'll take care
of the loan.

298
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,464
Don't worry about it,
i'll give you the money.

299
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,466
Oh, look at this.

300
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,469
Ozzie and fuckin'
harriet here.

301
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,471
That's beautiful.

302
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,473
Stay as long
as you like, rich.

303
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:27,479
She's your fuckin'
problem now.

304
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,481
This is a no- stopping zone,
ma'am.

305
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,483
The sign's
right over there.

306
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,485
Oh, i'm sorry,
i didn't see it.

307
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,488
I left my glasses at home.

308
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,491
It says here you're required
to wear them for driving.

309
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,996
Now, into this mix
comes brenda's husband, omar,

310
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:52,504
who's just leaving the market
with a bag of oranges.

311
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,007
What's the trouble
here, officer?

312
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,508
Your wife's
getting a ticket.

313
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,511
Maybe i can
change your mind.

314
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,513
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

315
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,517
You're dropping your
fuckin' oranges.

316
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,520
Very good, chris,
great improv.

317
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,022
There we have it.

318
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,023
Listen.

319
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,525
Any questions?

320
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,029
Okay, then, let's see what
the pros have to teach us.

321
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,530
For next time.

322
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,033
Phil and joanne...

323
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:27,539
scene two,
"barefoot in the park".

324
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,542
Chris, mitch
and cynthia...

325
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:35,047
scenes six and seven,
"the glass menagerie".

326
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,049
Chris, you are
the gentleman caller.

327
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,050
Okay.

328
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,056
Bob and amy...

329
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,568
the breast milk,

330
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,071
little each eye.

331
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,073
Nobody
tells me nothing.

332
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,075
Who's the zip
anyway?

333
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,577
He's a friend of ours.

334
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,580
We'll talk later.

335
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,592
What's the matter?

336
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,095
Nothin'.

337
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,606
Come here.

338
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,108
You having a good time?

339
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,109
The food's good, right?

340
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,110
Your home...

341
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,611
this is spectacular.

342
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,115
The television,
the...the...

343
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,616
satellite.

344
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,618
The amc.

345
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,620
"Two women" is on.

346
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,622
La loren.

347
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,624
We don't even show
this in italy.

348
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,626
Nobody care.

349
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:59,631
Tell'em what your favorite
tv program is.

350
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,634
The p. D. Blue.

351
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,635
Garden state's
a freakin' parking lot.

352
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,637
Oh, look who it is.

353
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,138
Christopher.

354
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,639
How you doing, man?

355
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,141
What the hell
are you doin' here?

356
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,643
I come, tony make
a party for me.

357
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,145
Hey, furio,
come here a second.

358
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,146
I want you to
meet somebody.

359
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,149
Scusa.

360
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,150
What the fuck?

361
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,651
He's on vacation?

362
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,654
Yeah, he saw a travel poster
for sunny new jersey.

363
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,655
He's with us now?

364
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,157
Mmm.

365
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,658
Guess i didn't
get the memo.

366
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,661
Would you've read it
if you got one?

367
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,663
Where the fuck
you been anyway?

368
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,666
Did you talk to that guy
down at the tanning salon?

369
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,667
He only had half.

370
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,669
Again?

371
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,672
Ask me, it's that chinese cunt
he's married to.

372
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,674
Bad influence.

373
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,675
She's a filipino.

374
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,678
I wasn't sure
what you wanted.

375
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,680
I want you to send him
a past- due notice,

376
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,682
what the fuck
do you think i want?

377
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:56,688
Alright, i'll take
care of it.

378
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,692
You know what,
leave it alone.

379
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,694
You sure?

380
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,198
Yeah.

381
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,701
Carmela.

382
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,703
What do you want?

383
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,705
I brought some cookies,
the pignolis.

384
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,208
Our relative from
the other side is here,

385
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,709
i should pay my resp--

386
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,717
"what did you say,
about glass?"

387
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,220
"Collection i said,
i have one."

388
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,724
"Know what i judge
to be the trouble with you?

389
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,227
"Inferiority complex.

390
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,729
"Know what that is?

391
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,732
"That's what they call it when
someone low- rates himself.

392
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,734
"For instance,

393
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,238
"that clumping you thought
was so awful in high school.

394
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,741
"You gave up your education
for a clump.

395
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:56,248
A little physical defect
is what you have."

396
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,250
Little physical defect?

397
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,751
She's a fuckin' gimp,
for chrissake.

398
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,253
You were doin' so good.

399
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,255
It doesn't
make any sense.

400
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,256
The guy's a player

401
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,757
and he's trying to
fuck this broad?

402
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,260
Where does it say he is trying
to fuck her, christopher?

403
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,761
Please.

404
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,763
Maybe he is not.

405
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,766
You ever think that's why
he's the gentleman caller?

406
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,269
Maybe he's a gentleman.

407
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,773
He's a douchebag.

408
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,774
So quit.

409
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,276
I'm not gonna quit.

410
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,777
I'll just get
a different scene.

411
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,281
I like you as an actor.

412
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,283
Joe pesci or something.

413
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,786
"This is jericho,
cell leader of the s. O. S.

414
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,789
"Let it be known
from this day forth

415
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,294
that lawlessness will
not be tolerated."

416
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,797
"Jimmy hollywood",
c'mon.

417
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,800
Hey, tony.

418
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,302
I'll just be
a few minutes.

419
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,305
Why don't you fix yourself
a drink or something, okay?

420
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,807
What's up?

421
00:22:55,807 --> 00:23:00,312
A guy named danny greco
called me.

422
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,813
Asked me for a loan.

423
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,315
Said you'll vouch.

424
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,316
Danny?

425
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,317
Yeah.

426
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:06,318
I told you danny was
good for whatever.

427
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:07,319
Oh, yeah?

428
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,820
Yeah, at
the steak house.

429
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,322
Oh, yeah, yeah.

430
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:17,329
Since i'm here, can i talk
to you about something?

431
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,332
It absolutely has to stay
between the two of us.

432
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,343
Alright, on any fuckin' scale
you want to use,

433
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,345
things are going good.

434
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,347
I'm firmly in charge,
no trouble there.

435
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,848
My family's healthy.

436
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,350
Right?

437
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,852
So, why the fuck am i ripping
phones out of the wall

438
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,354
in front of my kid

439
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,356
and screaming at my sister
all the fucking time,

440
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,358
although, she is totally
unimportant to me?

441
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,859
You got a lot
on your mind.

442
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,861
'Cause i'm the boss.

443
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,365
You see, that's the point.

444
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,867
You never saw
carlo or lucky...

445
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,370
or douglas macarthur going
around punching fucking walls.

446
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,875
What if i told you
i went to see a shrink?

447
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,378
I had an inkling.

448
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,889
Every once in
a while, i get...

449
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,393
anxious.

450
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,895
You know,
just in general,
no reason.

451
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,897
It's like,
i'm in my kitchen.

452
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,399
All of a sudden
i can't breathe.

453
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,401
It's like i'm suffocating.

454
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,902
I get to the point
where i fuckin' pass out.

455
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,404
Hmph.

456
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,406
It's just like
your father.

457
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:34,906
What is?

458
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:35,907
He had the same thing.

459
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,409
My old man had
anxiety attacks?

460
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,911
Well, in those days
we called it a "condition".

461
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,414
Didn't happen that often,
once or twice a year.

462
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,915
Holy shit.

463
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,918
He cracked his head open once
on a cigarette machine.

464
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,420
Did he go to a doctor?

465
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,921
Your father,
what, are you kidding?

466
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,923
It wouldn't have made
any difference in those days.

467
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,925
They wouldn't know how
to treat that shit.

468
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,927
Not much better now.

469
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,929
There was an article in
"new york times" magazine.

470
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,431
They've got this machine.

471
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,433
It can see images
of the brain

472
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,435
and how your brain
responds to fear.

473
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,936
Fear?

474
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,939
A person listening to a tape
of a parent criticizing them,

475
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,441
i'm talking about an adult,
mind you,

476
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,943
their fear center
kicks right in.

477
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,446
They can actually
see it in an mri.

478
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,955
I had this fuckin' weird dream
the other night.

479
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,457
When i had the polyps,

480
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,459
they put me through
that fuckin' mri.

481
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm telling ya.

482
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,462
I think they used my ass
to invent some new tests.

483
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,964
I was at the beach,
but i had a suit on.

484
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,966
And the shoes too.

485
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,969
They shove a camera up your ass
the size of a garden hose.

486
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,471
You wanna hear
this fuckin' dream or not?

487
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:45,977
Alright.

488
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,979
Got a sec?

489
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,481
Sure, what's up?

490
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,483
It's my scene.

491
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,485
Gentleman- caller guy.

492
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,487
It's...

493
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,488
it's not me.

494
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,989
It's not supposed to be.

495
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,491
That's why they
call it "acting".

496
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,992
I know, it's just...

497
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,495
i'd rather do
something else.

498
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,497
I already spoke to
what's his name?

499
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,998
Mitch. Cynthia, too.

500
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,500
They're cool
with changing.

501
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,501
Alright.

502
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,503
Alan's scene partner
dropped out,

503
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,006
so, i gotta find something
for him anyway...

504
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:19,511
"rebel without a cause",
james dean.

505
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,012
Copy it for
the others, okay?

506
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,514
Take it home,
get comfortable with it.

507
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,516
That's great, cool.

508
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,518
I don't want
a james dean impression.

509
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,519
Yeah.

510
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:33,525
No.

511
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,526
Poor ducks.

512
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,027
You are poor creatures.

513
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,529
Poor creatures.

514
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:44,536
You are such
poor creatures.

515
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,038
Don't give'em
that shit!

516
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,043
They like it.

517
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,044
Hey, what'd i tell you?

518
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,045
He's gonna choke!

519
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,047
Little pieces,
they're hungry.

520
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,550
Not for fuckin'
cheese doodles, they're not.

521
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,052
They eat bread and corn
and shit like that.

522
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,054
So, you know everything.

523
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,556
Yeah, i do.

524
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,559
Family of mallards lived in
my pool for two fuckin' months.

525
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,568
Yeah, you.

526
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,581
What'd he say?

527
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,082
Nothing.

528
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,585
A lot of fucking words
for nothing.

529
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,086
He said,"if i don't
like to fight,

530
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:40,592
i should find
myself a russian."

531
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,094
Tony, no!

532
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,096
You got a problem
besides those fuckin' pants?

533
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,097
You shouldn't yell.

534
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,599
Oh, yeah?

535
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,100
You should mind
your own fuckin' business.

536
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,102
I make business,
she is nice girl.

537
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,604
Are you
a family counselor?

538
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,605
You wanna get involved
in people's problems?

539
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,107
Here, now you're
fuckin' involved, okay?

540
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,110
These are balls, right?

541
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,111
Yes.

542
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,112
Do something.

543
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,114
You want to be involved,
now you're involved.

544
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,616
You let go!

545
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,117
I call police!

546
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,619
Mind your
fuckin' business!

547
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,120
Fuck you!

548
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,622
I call police!

549
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,123
Fuck you!

550
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,644
Fuck!

551
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,646
Get your shit,
we're going.

552
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:40,151
C'mon.

553
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,153
Move your ass!

554
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,661
Why do you always have
to ruin everything?

555
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,662
Huh?

556
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:55,667
Just move your ass.

557
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,167
"Help me.

558
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,169
"Daddy.

559
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,171
Daddy."

560
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,673
"You can depend on me.

561
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,674
"Trust me.

562
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:10,181
Whatever comes,
we'll face it together."

563
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,683
Oh, fuck this shit!

564
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:16,688
You said you weren't
gonna laugh.

565
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,189
I didn't laugh.

566
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,692
Baby, you were
doin' so good.

567
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,695
Nah, fuck this.

568
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,198
Christopher.

569
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,704
Absolutely not.

570
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,205
Just do the work
you were assigned.

571
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,707
Well, how about the scene
where i'm playing chicken

572
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,208
and i dive out of the car

573
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,711
right before that asshole,
buzz, goes off the cliff?

574
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,713
There's no dialogue
in that scene.

575
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,214
The knife fight, then.

576
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,215
No.

577
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,216
I already changed it once.

578
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,719
I gave you this scene
because it's challenging.

579
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,221
This russian fuck...

580
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,724
i'm friggin' lucky
i didn't get hauled in.

581
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,726
That would've played great
with uncle junior

582
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,227
and everybody else
after my ass.

583
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,731
I had to run like a bitch from
my own leisure- time activities.

584
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,733
Mmm.

585
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,235
If carmela would've known
who i was on the boat with...

586
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,737
okay, that's nothing new.

587
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,239
But my kids...?

588
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,741
It happens, okay?

589
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,745
What the fuck
is wrong with me?

590
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,747
Got some kind of a complex.

591
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,748
What kind?

592
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,750
Sleep always helps.

593
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,751
You want to go to sleep,
go ahead!

594
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,752
Hey.

595
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,753
Jesus christ.

596
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:26,758
Easy does it, laddy buck.

597
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,260
You know, i was never
particularly
good with my fists,

598
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,263
but there was one guy who
almost drove me to murder.

599
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,264
Lately, i feel this...

600
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,768
aversion to
my swimming pool.

601
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,269
It depresses me.

602
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,772
Cocksucker was a sound engineer
at one of my studios.

603
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,774
Talked about
germany all the time.

604
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,275
I actually find myself
avoiding the backyard.

605
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,278
He wasn't a nazi, he just kind
of rubbed me the wrong way.

606
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,280
One time, i was pulling
into a parking lot.

607
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,282
He was two spots over

608
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,284
and he was rotating his tires

609
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,287
like it was a goddamn
service station...

610
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,791
so i said to him...

611
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:05,296
"straight back, back as far
as they could take me.

612
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,801
"And then it all dissolved.

613
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,805
Everything dissolved."

614
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,306
That's it,
that's the end.

615
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,810
Very good, omar.

616
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,313
And just say,"scene"
when you're done, okay?

617
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:30,321
Chris, mitch, cynthia and alan,
our rebels without causes.

618
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,323
Okay, so, we are
at the planetarium.

619
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:36,828
Alan is jim's friend, plato,
who is about to get

620
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,830
mistakenly shot by
the police.

621
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,835
Mitch is his father and cynthia
is his troubled friend, judy.

622
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,342
Shut the lights!

623
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,844
Make them go away!

624
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:53,845
Plato!

625
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:54,846
Keep away from me!

626
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,347
I don't believe
you anymore!

627
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,348
Gunshot!

628
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,350
Jim!

629
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,352
I got the bullets!

630
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,355
Look!

631
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,356
Oh, god!

632
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,358
The cops swarm in...

633
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,860
let him alone,
that's my son.

634
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,364
When i saw the red jacket,
i thought...

635
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,366
hey, jerkpot.

636
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,368
What'd you do that for?

637
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,369
You can't help it, son.

638
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,872
You did everything
a man could.

639
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,380
Help me, daddy.

640
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,384
Daddy, help me.

641
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,887
Daddy.

642
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,388
You can depend on me.

643
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,890
Trust me.

644
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,893
Whatever comes,
we'll face it together.

645
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:47,899
It's okay, jim, stand up.

646
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,901
I'll stand up with you.

647
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:54,405
I'll try and be as strong
as you want me to be.

648
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,907
Poor baby got nobody.

649
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,910
Just nobody.

650
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,425
He was always cold.

651
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,441
Dad, this is judy.

652
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,443
She's my friend.

653
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:36,447
Scene.

654
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,950
Un- freaking- believable!

655
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,952
God, you were
really good.

656
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:45,957
Great job, chris.

657
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,459
How'd you make yourself
cry like that?

658
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,483
You wanna watch
your ashes, please.

659
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,494
I be outside.

660
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,496
You know, we should hit
a devil's game some night.

661
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,498
Still get tickets
from the greek?

662
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,500
Right on the fuckin' ice.

663
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,002
I'll bring my sweater.

664
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:37,508
Hey, chef of the future,
have a seat.

665
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,010
How you doin', foodio?

666
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:46,517
Furio.

667
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:52,023
You didn't stomp those grapes
yourself, did you?

668
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,025
Look at this group.

669
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,527
Hey, mr. New york.

670
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,529
What'd you do,
swim across that river?

671
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,530
Come over here, you.

672
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:00,531
Congratulations.

673
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:04,035
Thanks.

674
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,536
Don't get up.

675
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,038
I wasn't gonna.

676
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,539
You piece of shit.

677
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:13,544
Say hello to furio, friend of
ours from the other side.

678
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,048
Oh, hey, i heard
a lot about you.

679
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,050
Nice to meet you.

680
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,052
Yeah, me too,
my pleasure.

681
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:34,065
So, what's up?

682
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,068
Puss, you wanna
give us a minute?

683
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,077
I'm in the middle
of fuckin' eatin'.

684
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,078
I know...

685
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,580
do me a favor,
will you, sweetie?

686
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,583
Keep this warm.

687
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,585
Thank you.

688
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,088
Five minutes,
alright?

689
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,595
I gotta make
a call anyway.

690
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,603
It's like all these years
were for nothing.

691
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,105
What'd i tell you?

692
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,107
You think tony really gives
a flyin' fuck about you?

693
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,108
This thing of ours.

694
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,109
Fuckin' joke.

695
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,610
More like,
"this thing of mine".

696
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,611
It's the same all over.

697
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,612
Look out for number one.

698
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,614
You don't understand,
we go fuckin' back.

699
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,117
I mean, silvio, i get,
but fuckin' paulie?

700
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,119
He's probably dizzy from
all that hair spray.

701
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,620
And this other one,
the geep.

702
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,622
Foodio,
furio.

703
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,124
If ever there was a guy
in desperate need

704
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,625
of a fuckin' nickname.

705
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,626
At least he's italian.

706
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,128
Try being passed over
for a samoan.

707
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,629
Sesaga.

708
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,631
Three years out of quantico,
he's the new agent in charge.

709
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,633
You're fuckin' kiddin' me,
what happened to paterno?

710
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,634
Kansas city.

711
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,137
11 years doing this shit.

712
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,638
It's like tony
says himself,

713
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,142
"most of the guys in this life,
there's no fuckin' honor."

714
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,644
Forget your enemies, you can't
even depend on your friends.

715
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,646
Whole society's fucked.

716
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,647
And the ones comin' up?

717
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,649
Half of them are on drugs,

718
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,151
the other half are
fuckin' psychos.

719
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:07,658
A world full of scumbags.

720
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,161
I'm thinking about
taking my patient back.

721
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:14,165
That's a serious decision.

722
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,667
He's my responsibility.

723
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,670
Elliot, i abandoned him.

724
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,672
We've been over this.

725
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,174
Your life is in danger.

726
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,177
Not any more.

727
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,181
Do you realize what
i did last week?

728
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,683
I stormed out of here
like a child.

729
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:35,186
Cursing, threatening,
acting out.

730
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:42,693
That's exactly
what he does to me.

731
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,196
I'm feeling so...

732
00:37:55,706 --> 00:38:03,214
fuck, i don't know where
this is coming from.

733
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:11,722
You mentioned you've put
on a little weight lately.

734
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,224
Do you think the over- eating

735
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:18,729
has anything to do
with your patient?

736
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,731
What is it you're not
telling me, jennifer?

737
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,734
I don't know.

738
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:29,740
I don't know
what you mean.

739
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,242
Okay.

740
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,744
I don't.

741
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,746
What are you driving at?

742
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,749
Just watch your
intake of sugar...

743
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:45,256
and sugar substitutes.

744
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:48,259
Okay.

745
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,263
We spoke last time
about childhood fascinations

746
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,764
with danger.

747
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:59,270
I think seeing him again will
be very therapeutic for me.

748
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,272
It's not supposed to be
therapeutic for you.

749
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:06,777
This is your therapy, here.

750
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,281
Do you have sexual
feelings for him?

751
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,789
No.

752
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:23,294
I have feelings,
on a personal level.

753
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:27,798
He can be such
a little boy sometimes.

754
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,301
Alright, that's it,
the one with the palm tree.

755
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,804
There's a buzzer
under the desk, an
office in the back.

756
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,809
Tell me again
what i said.

757
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,312
It's not just dominic
who is the problem.

758
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:48,819
It's the wife, too.

759
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,321
Here.

760
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,843
May i help you?

761
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:13,844
Ah, what are you doing?

762
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,349
Stop, stop!

763
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,351
Ah!

764
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:48,379
No!

765
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:51,882
Oh!

766
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,891
Please stop!

767
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,892
Goddamn you!

768
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,896
Sonofabitch!

769
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:10,901
Cocksucker!

770
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:15,406
Go, goddamn!

771
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,408
You go!

772
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,410
We pay money!

773
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,432
God...damn!

774
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:46,437
Sonofa...bitch!

775
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,443
Yeah?

776
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:58,449
It's dr. Melfi.

777
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,452
Yeah, so.

778
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,455
I tried your
other number.

779
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,967
If you want, i could fit
you in tomorrow at 2:30.

780
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,975
So, do i put you down?

781
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,977
Nah, fuck it.

782
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,480
Why do you say that?

783
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,982
Gettin' by without it.

784
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,985
There's no cure
for life.

785
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,488
Well...

786
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,992
you think about it.

787
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,494
I'll keep
the hour open.

788
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,495
Yeah.

789
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,008
"A".

790
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,009
"B".

791
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,512
"A"!

792
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,014
"B".

793
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,516
"A".

794
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,517
"B".

795
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,018
Outstanding.

796
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,521
A case in point.

797
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,523
Words are only words.

798
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,025
You just saw two actors
have an entire conversation

799
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,029
saying only "a"
and the other responding "b".

800
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,031
Mitch, christopher?

801
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,533
Want to give it a try?

802
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,549
"A".

803
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,051
Stop it!

804
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,052
Christopher!

805
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,554
This is inappropriate!

806
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:50,561
We do not hit!

807
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,061
Oh, my god...

808
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:52,062
jesus!

809
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,564
Are you okay?

810
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:58,068
Are you alright?

811
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,570
Ah!

812
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,573
Oh, my god, sorry...

813
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,575
i think it's broken.

814
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,076
We should get
you to a doctor.

815
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,078
There's nothing they can
do for a broken toe.

816
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,580
They just tape it up
and send you home.

817
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,081
I've been there.

818
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,584
Babe, i don't understand,
the guy didn't say anything?

819
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,085
He didn't have to,

820
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,087
that was the point of
the whole fuckin' exercise.

821
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,590
But he didn't flip you off
or nothing.

822
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,592
You said so yourself.

823
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:26,597
Maybe doing that scene
brought up some bad feelings.

824
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,098
What scene?

825
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,100
You know, where he was
supposed to be your father.

826
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,102
You said the class all
clapped and everything.

827
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,604
I was fuckin' acting.

828
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,606
I was better than mitch,
that's all.

829
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,107
Even i knew that.

830
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,610
Maybe he really reminded
you of your father

831
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,612
and that's why you
got so into it.

832
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,614
And maybe that's why you
hit him tonight.

833
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,115
My father?

834
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,618
All those feelings you hav
e about how he died so young.

835
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,119
Oh, fuck that.

836
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,622
Acting is
mostly feelings...

837
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,625
unless the actor's
driving a car,

838
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,627
sword- fighting
or something.

839
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,628
You want to write?

840
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,630
Feelings is what
it's all about.

841
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,131
Revealing
your innermost feelings

842
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,633
is the best
kind of writing.

843
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,135
And how do you know
what it's all about, huh?

844
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,639
From writing down orders
at the fuckin' restaurant?

845
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,640
Ow!

846
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,141
Alright, take it easy!

847
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,143
Your whole thing
with script- writing,

848
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,144
who else is behind you?

849
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,646
Who even knows about it?

850
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,649
I hated seeing you suffer
with that writer's block.

851
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,151
When i read the
ad in the paper,
"acting for writers",

852
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,654
i couldn't wait to get it
for you for your birthday.

853
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,155
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:29,660
Adriana, i'm sorry!

855
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,705
Are you still taking
your medication?

856
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:20,210
Off and on.

857
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,715
Well, you should
either take it
or don't take it, okay?

858
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,225
In the coffee shop,

859
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,728
you mentioned that
you had a panic attack

860
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,229
that led to
an automobile accident.

861
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,232
That seems like years ago.

862
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,234
You mean, you're so busy,

863
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,237
or you mean that
you're angry with me

864
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,741
for not agreeing to
treat you then?

865
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,254
I found out a little
medical history.

866
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,257
My old man had
the same thing.

867
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,260
Panic attacks followed
by passin' out.

868
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,763
Cracked his head open
on a cigarette machine.

869
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:13,764
Interesting.

870
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,265
Interesting?

871
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,267
That's it?

872
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,770
You're not gonna send me for
fuckin' tests or something?

873
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,772
Did you read the article
in "the times"?

874
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:29,780
Anthony, what is it
you want to achieve here?

875
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,286
What i want to achieve?

876
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,287
I wanna stop passin' out.

877
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,790
I wanna stop
fuckin' panicking.

878
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:45,295
I want to direct my power
and my fuckin' anger

879
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:52,302
against the people in
my life that deserve it.

880
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:53,804
I wanna be in
total control.

881
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,306
There's no such thing
as total control.

882
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,808
Of course there is.

883
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:58,809
You want to be
a better gang leader,

884
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,311
read "the art of war"
by sun zu.

885
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,312
You know what?

886
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,314
Fuck you.

887
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,317
You know who i am
and you know what i do.

888
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:14,324
You called me.

889
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:19,830
You know where i was
yesterday when you called?

890
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,832
I was outside
a whorehouse

891
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,334
while the guy that
works for me was inside

892
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,336
beating the shit out of a guy
that owes me money.

893
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:31,842
Broke his arm,
put a bullet in his kneecap.

894
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,349
How'd that
make you feel?

895
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,852
I wished it
was me in there.

896
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,855
Giving the beating
or taking it?
