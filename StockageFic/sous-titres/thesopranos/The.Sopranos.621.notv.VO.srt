So what happens now?

Well, robert's already said

- what about sophia?
- nica is my daughter.

She's very much

Sophia's out of her mind

'cause that one even
got by me.

a shot with Bobby's kids.

Bobby would want it.

243
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,970
I put in a lot of effort
with sophia--

00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,073
Baking together...
I think we actually
have a bond.

245
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,412
I've had therapy.
I'm a good mother.

511
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,101
I know.

512
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:51,637
I want you
to skipper that thing.

513
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:55,274
- really?
- fucking thing is
one big ATM machine.

514
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,711
All our
construction with New York
folds right into your kick.

515
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,113
Yeah.

516
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,115
Jesus christ,
I thought you'd be pleased.

517
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,484
I didn't hand you
the diagnosis of the clap.

518
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:08,487
With due respect,
I'd like to just
mull it a little.

519
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,224
I'm no spring chicken
no more.

520
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:15,060
I don't want to have me
dying on you, leaving you
worse off than before.

521
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,829
Oh, you with
the dead thing.

522
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:19,131
You got the arms
and upper body of
a 20-year-old.

523
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:21,166
I gotta work at that.

524
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:24,169
And I had the prostate.

525
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:27,072
All right, sure.

526
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,074
Go ahead.

527
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:31,910
I'm a little miffled,
but yeah, sit with it.

528
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,313
Thanks, T.
This means everything,

529
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:36,982
Your faith in me.

530
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:56,301
In the line of duty.

531
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,137
But we're short-handed.

532
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,806
Anyway, mid-60s,

533
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,042
Probably used
the payphones.

534
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:06,345
We don't have payphones.
Just a couple of stations
have them anymore.

535
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:17,022
( window rolls down )

536
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:20,225
( hums sports theme )

537
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,295
Get in.

538
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:27,299
( hums the tune )

539
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,308
Activity--
that's good.

540
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,410
I can already
see a difference.

541
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,245
Yeah.

542
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,981
Gonna get
back at it myself.

543
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:49,755
Listen...

544
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,225
I'm gonna join the army.

545
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,829
What?

546
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:00,599
Did you sign any shit?

547
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:04,169
No, but this week
I will.

548
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:06,005
I gotta deal
with rhiannon first.

549
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,440
Rhiannon?
What about your mother?

550
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:11,543
- her too.
- are you nuts?

551
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:13,312
You wanna get sent
to Iraq?

552
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,347
Afghanistan.

553
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,116
The army's probably
good for my career.

554
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:19,118
You don't have
a career.

555
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,853
Right.
My ultimate goal is

556
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,955
to qualify for
helicopter pilot training,

557
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:24,857
<i>Afterwards go to work
for trump or somebody,</i>

558
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:26,525
Be their personal pilot.

559
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:28,527
( stammers )

560
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:31,130
I'm not even gonna
tell your mother
about this.

561
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:33,165
And don't you
do nothing

562
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,200
Until we've had
another chance to talk.

563
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:38,370
<i>- you hear me?
- yes.</i>

564
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:41,306
He's gonna join
the fucking army.

565
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:51,717
I gotta be frank,

566
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:55,220
You people got him out
of his room-- great--

567
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,723
So he can be
cannon fodder?

568
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,525
I wasn't aware
of this latest plan.

569
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,226
<i>( door opens )</i>

570
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,128
Sorry.

571
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,230
I should have gone
before we left the house.

572
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,767
Still on the army thing.

573
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:14,073
On the other hand,
I'm thinking maybe
he could benefit

574
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,508
From the training,
the discipline.

575
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,310
Maybe the army'd be
great for him

576
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:20,946
If there wasn't
a war going on.

577
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:26,618
Oh, I didn't tell you,
he spent $200

578
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,355
On a set of cds
that teach arabic.

579
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:33,092
Jesus Christ, come on.
"shish kebab"-- what else
do you need to know?

580
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,327
He used to just veg
in front of that tv.

581
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,132
He says he wants
to get past the hate,

582
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:43,102
<i>Focus it only
on the terrorists.</i>

583
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:45,037
I really can't
reveal much more.

584
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,506
Right.
Even though we're paying.

585
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:54,279
This whole therapy thing,
I gotta tell you--

586
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:55,714
What?

587
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,685
My mother was
a borderline personality.

588
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:02,054
So what?

589
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,525
- I don't know
if you knew that.
- no.

590
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:10,462
Well, I did not have
a very happy childhood.

591
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,864
No?

592
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,800
There was little love
in the house.

593
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:16,869
He's mentioned your mother
very briefly.

594
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:19,505
A very difficult woman,

595
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,473
Undermining.

596
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,308
I tried to place her
in a retirement community

597
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,077
<i>For her own good--</i>

598
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:27,246
She turned on me
completely.

599
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:34,019
You see, I never could
please my ther.

600
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,594
To what do I owe
this chance to go
sake bombing?

601
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:45,264
We used to have dinner
all the time.

602
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:49,068
You're gonna get married
and my chances are
flying by me.

603
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:51,603
- yeah.
- so, your brother,

604
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:52,705
Our little soldier boy--

605
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:55,207
What do you think is wrong
with that googootz?

606
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:58,077
The world is
a sad, fucked-up place.

607
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:00,612
If there's so much
suffering in the world,

608
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:03,949
- why did you go off
the pediatrician bit?
- we talked about that.

609
00:38:04,017 --> 00:38:06,085
You said you
wanted to be a lawyer
for black people.

610
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:08,387
Oh, that's all I said?
Really?

611
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,557
What I said was:
the state can crush
the individual.

612
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,792
- New Jersey?
- the government.

613
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:16,628
Specifically,
the federal government.

614
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:18,364
And what about
little babies

615
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:21,567
In the face
of meningitis?

616
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,569
You know what really
turned me?

617
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:25,971
Seeing the way
italians are treated.

618
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:29,475
It's like mom says.
And if we can have our
rights trampled like that,

619
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:31,844
Imagine what it's like
for recent arrivals.

620
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,979
- well...
- if I hadn't seen you

621
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,548
Dragged away
all those times
by the fbi

622
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:40,552
Then I'd probably be
a boring suburban doctor.

623
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:56,001
<i>( rock song playing )</i>

624
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:57,469
Bye-bye.

625
00:38:57,537 --> 00:38:59,938
<i>Wave "bye-bye, grandpa."</i>

626
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:02,274
- bye-bye, pop-pop.
- say "bye-bye."

627
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:05,277
- bye-bye.
- bye-bye.
( cooing )

628
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:09,615
I gotta make
a phone call.

629
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:11,850
I'll meet you
at the drugstore.

630
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:14,920
Tell the goddamn pharmacist
to call dr. Iaconis.

631
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:17,990
I should get
a 60-day supply
of the plavix.

632
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:22,628
Phil! Phil!

633
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,530
<i>Oh my god!</i>

634
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,533
Phil!

635
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,537
Oh my god!
Help!

636
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:33,305
<i>Help me!</i>

637
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,308
<i>Oh my god!
Oh my god!</i>

638
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:39,912
My babies!
Somebody help!

639
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,281
Help me!
The babies!

640
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,183
- somebody help me!
- okay, okay.

641
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:46,118
<i>Help me, please!</i>

642
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:49,288
Oh, god, they're
locked in there!

643
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:51,724
<i>- ( head squishes, pops )
- ( Patty wails )</i>

644
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:53,726
- oh!
- oh shit!

645
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,127
( retches )

646
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:57,162
( speaking arabic )

647
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:07,373
- seen metro news?
- no.

648
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,641
Your old beat.
Phil Leotardo got popped.

649
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:13,145
Damn.
We're gonna win
this thing.

650
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:30,095
Okay...

651
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:33,732
As your parents
we don't feel

652
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,868
Joining the army
is in your best interest.

653
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:38,837
This country is
in a crisis.

654
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:40,739
How can one soldier
stop it?

655
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:44,510
When my enlistment's up,

656
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:46,679
I could join
the CIA or something.

657
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,515
And with
a military background
I'll have a leg up.

658
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:51,917
And as an arabic speaker,
I'll be really useful.

659
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:54,119
I don't understand.
You're gonna ask
the donald

660
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:57,322
For some time off
from your pilot job
to go on CIA missions?

661
00:40:57,424 --> 00:40:59,992
- everything's a joke to you.
- I'm not having a good time.

662
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:03,095
Did you or did
you not want me to go
to military school?

663
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,365
But I started to cry.

664
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,368
At least you'd have
come out an officer.

665
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:11,470
Even then
I was opposed to it.

666
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:13,138
I hate this idea.

667
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,474
I'm applying for
officer's candidate school.

668
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:17,476
I want to be
a liaison officer

669
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:20,112
With the local
population anyway.

670
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:24,817
Officer's candidate school?

671
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:28,420
You have terrible grades.
You flunked out of college.

672
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:30,556
Here we go.
That's all this is
about, right?

673
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,691
No, Anthony, that's not
what this is all about.

674
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,760
You don't want
to go to college--
don't go to college,

675
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:37,563
- but don't get
your legs blown off.
- always with the drama.

676
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:41,400
So what does
your girlfriend say,
the fashion model?

677
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,603
She doesn't think
I should go either.

678
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,672
Well?

679
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:50,776
Not that long ago
you talked about
owning a club.

680
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,845
Right.
You had a problem
with that too.

681
00:41:54,247 --> 00:41:56,248
A lot of your friends
are in film school,
you say,

682
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:59,251
Especially the ones
you used to go to
the clubs with.

683
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,691
Uh...

684
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:08,660
So I got this screenplay
from danny baldwin.

685
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:10,929
<i>We met at your
cousin's movie.</i>

686
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,198
Danny hoped
I'd set him up
with some financing,

687
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:16,435
- but I never read it.
- well, you did now.

688
00:42:16,603 --> 00:42:19,104
Yeah, I did now and...

689
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,473
Well, long story short,
it's about a private
detective

690
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:24,476
That gets sucked
into the internet
through his, uh, data port.

691
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:27,212
And he's gotta solve

692
00:42:27,313 --> 00:42:29,982
Some murders and some
virtual prostitutes.

693
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,484
I read it.
It's scary.

694
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,453
Point is, I talked
to little Carmine

695
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,955
And he's interested
in developing it
through his company.

696
00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:39,191
He does porn.

697
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:44,897
He did "cleaver."
he's branching out.

698
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:47,299
<i>Carmela:
you would work
for his producer, inge.</i>

699
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,134
You would be--
what is the word--

700
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:51,904
Development executive
on this project.

701
00:42:51,971 --> 00:42:54,173
Really?

702
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:58,977
What's this gotta do
with clubs?

703
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,747
Hollywood and
gossip columns,
the nightspots...

704
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:04,983
And you get some
real-world experience
under your belt,

705
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:06,985
You come see me
and we will talk

706
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,721
About me investing
in a club.

707
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:11,323
Run that past rahoony,
see what she says.

708

<i>( dance music playing )</i>

709

grand jury testimony
on something.

<i>- so Carlo has flipped.
- we don't know.</i>

711
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,778
And subpoenas are flying.

712
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:42,454
My hunch--

713
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:45,858
80 to 90% chance
you'll be indicted.

714
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:47,593
<i>That fucking
gun charge--</i>

715
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:49,528
I get sick
when I think of it--

716
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:53,465
Plus interstate fraud
and if Carlo starts talking,
homicide--

717
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,100
Give me
the fucking thing.

718
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:04,443
Not like we haven't
envisioned this day.

719
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:06,078
No no, it's not.

720
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,981
Look, trials are there
to be won.

Gigi died

Doesn't mean
it's not part

He's not looking

766

A rat died in the wall

I moved the picture.
The fucking thing

768
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:51,076
Came to the new spot
and stared!

769
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,849
It's the abstract shapes
or something.

770
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,224
Tell you this:

771
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,226
Since he's dead,

772
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:10,396

done a 180.

Yeah?

778
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:34,520
One time at the bing,

779
00:47:34,587 --> 00:47:37,523
I was alone to meet
eddy lind--

780
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:41,694
I saw the virgin mary.

781
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,868
Why didn't you
say something?

782
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,771
Fuck strippers,
we coulda had a shrine,

783
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,140
Sold holy water
in gallon jugs.

784
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,142
Coulda made billions.

785
00:47:57,277 --> 00:48:00,045
I tell you something
deep in my heart
and you laugh it off?

786
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:02,181
I'm not saying
there's nothing
out there, Paulie,

787
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:05,384
But to not live your life?
What the fuck are
you gonna do?

788
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:09,621
You don't want the job--
you don't want the job.

789
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:12,224
I can put patsy in there.

790
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:14,693
He's gonna be
part of my family now.

791
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:17,496
It'd be good.

792

get it for me.

public transport out here.

00:52:41,594 --> 00:52:44,363
I'll hold on
to it as a guardian,
for Bobby's kids.

851
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:48,267
- you remember Bobby?
- sure.

852
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:56,241
You don't know
who I am, do you?

853
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,786
Remember johnny--
johnny boy,

854
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:10,389
Your kid brother?

855
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,561
( sighs )

856
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:22,634
"this thing of ours."

857
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:27,573
I was involved with that?

858
00:53:27,741 --> 00:53:30,576
You and my dad.

859
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:32,511
You two ran north Jersey.

860
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,514
- we did?
- yeah.

861
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:37,516
Hmm.

862
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:39,752
Well, that's nice.

863
00:54:04,544 --> 00:54:07,346
<i>- ( pop song playing )
- ( people conversing,
laughing )</i>

864
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:01,734
<i>( song playing )</i>

865
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:18,684
<i>( song continues )</i>

866
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:21,286
- hey.
- hey.

867
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:40,639
- what looks good tonight?
- eh, I don't know.

868
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:43,208
( sniffs )

869
00:55:45,545 --> 00:55:46,945
Where's googootz?

870
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:50,149
He just called.
He's on his way.

871
00:55:50,283 --> 00:55:53,919
Mead's coming separately.
She had to go to the doctor,

872
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:56,455
Switch birth control.

873
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:08,600
Did you talk
to mink again?

874
00:56:10,403 --> 00:56:12,771
It's Carlo.
He's gonna testify.

875
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:30,589
Mmm, onion rings.

876
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:33,092
Best in the state
as far as I'm concerned.

877
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:55,948
Shit.

878
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:02,121
<i>( song continues playing )</i>

879
00:57:14,968 --> 00:57:16,635
How was work today?

880
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,471
All I'm doing is
getting coffee and placing
endless phone calls.

881
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:21,874
You may not realize it
but you are making contacts.

882
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:23,876
It's an entry-level job.

883
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:26,612
So buck up.

884
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:28,614
Right, focus
on the good times.

885
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:30,649
Don't be sarcastic.

886
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,618
Isn't that what
you said one time--

887
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,319
"try to remember the times
that were good"?

888
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:36,155
- I did?
- yeah.

889
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,393
Well, it's true,
I guess.

890
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:21,700
I went ahead
and ordered some
for the table.
