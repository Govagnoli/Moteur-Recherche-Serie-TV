1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,000
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,600
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,000
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,300
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,300
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,100
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,900
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,800
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,000
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,800
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,200
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,900
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,400
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,700
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,300
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,300
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,600
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,800
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,000
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,300
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,700
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,200
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,200
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,200
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,400
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,400
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,000
# I was all right #

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
# For a while #

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,200
# I could smile... #

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,300
There he is.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
Black Jack Massarone.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,400
I saw this
and I thought of you.

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,600
- Ho, look at that!
- Guy's local.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,900
He makes them as part of a program
for disabled vets.

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,800
A little gift
to show my gratitude

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
for all our work
together.

41
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,700
Thanks.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,900
- Look at those guys, huh?
- Mmm.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,700
They had some times, huh?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,100
You know we're finally
gonna cut the ribbon

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,700
for the museum
on the 22nd.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
They're gonna ask me to make
a little speech

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,400
on the challenges of contemporary
urban development.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,100
Thank you.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,500
- Somethin' for you?
- Oh, um...

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,100
I'll have what
he's having.

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,100
Listen, my buddy
in city plan check

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
says he just pulled
a permit

53
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,200
to turn the old bus station
into a mixed use.

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,700
The thing is, Zellman still hasn't
given me a number.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,300
Has he said anything
to you about another bid?

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, we don't
talk much.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Take your hat off.
Relax.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, I just started
on the Rogaine.

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Listen, you think maybe
you could ask Ron

60
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,600
if this falls under
the same arrangement?

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,700
Kinda soggy, you
wanna know the truth.

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Tony, this is federal
redevelopment.

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,500
I'll look into it.

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,800
- So, a speech, huh?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,600
The Museum of Science
and Truckin'.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,900
I just wish my mother
could've seen it.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,700
Well, wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,700
Actually, I think I know
exactly where she is

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,700
and it's pretty
fuckin' hot.

70
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,800
You had one of those,
too, huh?

71
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,200
Gentlemen.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Is everything
okay here?

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah, sure.
Just talkin'.

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,300
Okay then.

75
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,600
Have a good night.

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,400
So they go through labor.
Big deal.

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,100
Try a prostate exam.

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
This is great.

79
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,300
And I usually don't
like modern art.

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
The Rat Pack.

81
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,300
Do you know
a Joseph "Joey" Cogo?

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,500
Not much, I mean,
I met him...

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,500
last week.

84
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,400
Me and Chrissy
were havin' dinner

85
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,500
with Tony and his
friend, Valentina.

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,900
Joey Cogo sent over
a bottle of Veuve.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Wanna show
her those?

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Oh my God.

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
Was this man
with him?

90
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,200
Yeah.

91
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,800
I saw him.

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,700
- You're sure?
- Tuesday night.

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
Jesus, 'cause
of what I said?

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,300
You're supposed
to be earners.

95
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,100
That's why you got
the top tier positions.

96
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,300
So each one of ya go out
to your people on the street,

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
crack some fuckin'...
Create some fuckin' earners out there!

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
So, what's he sayin'?

99
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
The way I remember
he said,

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,200
"That's why you got
the top tier positions."

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,600
This other inaudible
is "Crack fuckin' heads,"

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,500
not legs.

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,000
I need a signature.

104
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,700
Now that's it.
That's all I gotta say.

105
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,500
Frankly,
I'm depressed and...

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Depressed and what?

107
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,000
"Depressed
and ashamed."

108
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,900
So what about my Alan Stewart
shirt from that meeting?

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,300
Ralph Cifaretto spilt
my coffee and ruined it.

110
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,500
I can petty cash it.
Resubmit, okay?

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,900
This Crazy Horse pole camera's
working out really good.

112
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Paulie Gualtieri's car again.
She's still lying.

113
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Listen, any chance
you could ask Ron

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,100
if this falls under
the same arrangement?

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
It's kinda soggy, you
wanna know the truth.

116
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,800
- Pie. He was eating.
- Tony, this is federal redevelopment.

117
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,700
I'll look into it.

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,900
- So a speech, huh?
- The sound quality is amazing.

119
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
New hats. Mic's right
in the button.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,900
Museum of Science
and Truckin'.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,900
I just wish my mother
could've seen it.

122
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,700
Give it to Angela
and shut the door.

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
Wherever she is,
I'm sure she's proud.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
What happened to the jury
tampering investigation

125
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,500
- on Junior Soprano's trial?
- Actually, l...

126
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
You guys just drop
the ball on that?

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
Massarone's
a huge asset.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,200
- Couple him with...
- What? Three-year-old airline tickets?

129
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,400
Some ties to
the Bevelaqua murder?

130
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,700
Even if Massarone

131
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,900
and 1,000 other
snitches pan out,

132
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,800
we've still gotta
put Tony on trial.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,600
That's useless
until we find out how

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,900
they penetrated
the anonymous jury system.

135
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
And what? Jury duty's
not tough enough?

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,900
You know we don't like
to dig into some citizen.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,000
Tough shit. One of those
citizens is a felon.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,100
Get on it.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,100
You know what's
goin' on here, right?

140
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,200
He fucked up his six-figure future
with O'Melveny & Meyers

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,800
when he blew
the Junior Soprano trial.

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,700
Of course he'll keep tryin'
him until he fixes that.

143
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,300
- Hey!
- Hey.

144
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,000
There he is,
John Barrymore.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
- How are ya?
- All right.

146
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
I thought nobody
ever comes to see you.

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,400
I was droppin' off
some dandelions.

148
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,000
Saw a beautiful patch
in a vacant lot over by 15th Street.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,600
- Nice salad.
- Any word about Tony B?

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,300
Yeah, yeah,
should be any day now.

151
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,800
Aunt Quintina's gonna call
the moment she hears.

152
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,300
He's a good kid,
your cousin, huh? Smart.

153
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Fuckin' weirdo,
you ask me.

154
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,700
All right, the vacant lot
over on 15th Street?

155
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,300
That's where all the neighborhood
dogs go to piss.

156
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,200
You goddamn clown.

157
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
You got anything
lined up for the kid?

158
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, yeah, air-bags.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
We pull 'em
from boosted cars.

160
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,800
People buy 'em
like you wouldn't fuckin' believe.

161
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Hey, legit dealers,
body shops...

162
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,400
they reinstall
undeployed bags as new.

163
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,100
Top dollar.

164
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Brave new world.

165
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Jesus Christ, they didn't even have
shoulder belts when I went away.

166
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,500
So you'll let me know
when the kid gets out, huh?

167
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,400
Yeah, we'll have
a party for him.

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,300
- I love you, okay.
- All right.

169
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,900
Come on, eat.
Don't be so sensitive.

170
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
I was bein' polite.
It's like... it's like eatin' red fescue.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,900
I'll take an egg.
You want an egg?

172
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
Bobby, make
my nephew an egg.

173
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't want an egg.

174
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Tony B.

175
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Like a welcome
home present.

176
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,600
- What's that, a Motorola?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,500
Supposed to be
the best.

178
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,700
You know, I figured
he could use one.

179
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,300
Call me when
he needs me.

180
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,900
All the fellas
are gettin' out, huh?

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,900
The class of 2004.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,700
Old rats
on a new ship.

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
I think I'll take
an egg.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,700
Make us
a couple eggs.

185
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,100
I'm doin' it. You told me.
He don't want one.

186
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,900
- You and Tony Egg again.
- Tony Egg? Tony B.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,700
Like the time you two,
you took that camera in the bathroom

188
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,700
at your sister Barbara's
confirmation.

189
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Hello?

190
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh, that's terrible.

191
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,100
Where is he gonna
be laid out?

192
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,600
Who now?
God damn it!

193
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Well, let us know.

194
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Carmine Lupertazzi.

195
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,500
He passed
during the night.

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,100
What a fuckin' blow.

197
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
He was a great man.

198
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,200
My cousin told me it was Carmine
who invented point shaving.

199
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,500
C.C.N.Y. versus
Kentucky, 1951.

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Nobody beat the spread.
I bought a black Fleetwood.

201
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
Anthony. Anthony, did I ever tell you
I want to be cremated?

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
About four times.

203
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
And don't throw my ashes
in somebody's yard

204
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,500
or off some
fuckin' bridge.

205
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,800
I wanna be on the mantelpiece
surrounded by family.

206
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Yeah, under the moose head,
I know.

207
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
Keep jokin'. Let me
tell ya somethin'.

208
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
It's like that game
we used to play as kids...

209
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,500
crack the whip.

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
You run around like
an idiot holdin' hands

211
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,200
as tight as you can
and then the line snaps,

212
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,500
somebody lets go
and you're next.

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,100
Your father meant
a lot to all of us.

214
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
And not just
financially either.

215
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,500
How are ya?

216
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
What's up, buddy?

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,900
Nicole...

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,900
- you remember Mr. Petrille?
- What, honey?

219
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,400
He meant a lot to us.

220
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,700
- Ginny.
- Phil, how ya doin'?

221
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
- Hey, kid.
- Angelo.

222
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
I'm heartbroken.

223
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,400
- Nicole, you remember Mr. Garepe.
- Of course.

224
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,200
That was my aunt.

225
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,100
My cousin's out.

226
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,900
Aw, that's great news.

227
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,600
Start him off
small, T.

228
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,200
You hear that?
Your cousin's out.

229
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,100
- Oh, look who's comin'.
- What?

230
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,000
- Hey there, handsome.
- Hey, baby.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
- How are ya?
- Good.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,100
Lorraine,
you're lookin' good.

233
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,700
Yeah, keepin' it together
with pilates and gin.

234
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Sil, Paulie,
how's it hangin'?

235
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Still got the nice
manners, huh?

236
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
Ah,

237
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,200
this is my
nephew Christopher.

238
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,800
Lady Shylock,
you got some reputation.

239
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,800
Yeah, my mother said
that might happen.

240
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,100
I'd like to introduce you
to the love of my life.

241
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
This is my partner
Jason Evanina.

242
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,000
- Honor to meet ya.
- Hey, how are ya?

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
So Jesus leans off the cross
and whispers to Peter,

244
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,800
"I can see your house
from here."

245
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm so sorry.
This was such a shock.

246
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
- This is a very hard day.
- I just saw Ginny.

247
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,000
The flowers
are beautiful.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,300
- John, got a minute?
- Yeah.

249
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,100
Nicole, I'm sorry.

250
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,300
What's goin'
on here?

251
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,600
- What are you talkin' about?
- My father.

252
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,500
Look at his hands.

253
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,600
- He looks peaceful.
- I'm talkin' about his rosary.

254
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
The medal?

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,800
You think I don't
know what that is?

256
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,300
It's for Opus Dei.

257
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,500
The fuck
is that about?

258
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,200
In his later years,
your father was very sensitive about

259
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,500
- what's been goin' on in the church.
- Bullshit!

260
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Your wife is into
Opus Dei.

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You told Colombino
to put it there.

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
- You sure about that?
- Yes, John, I'm sure.

263
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,600
Body's not even cold.

264
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,300
No respect
for anything anymore.

265
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,100
And New Jersey housewife
fundamentalist shit?

266
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
I doubt it, John.

267
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

268
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,400
You yourself said
I was like another son to him.

269
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,300
I was bein' polite.
It was his deathbed.

270
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
I should've written
those words down.

271
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,400
Maybe you should have,
'cause they don't mean anything anymore.

272
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,000
I saw a huge
mushroom cloud

274
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
from the shell.

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,300
Jim Campbell
might be alive today

276
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,900
if he hadn't said to me,

277
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,700
"Heffron, you stay
here with your gun.

278
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
I'm going up."

279
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,200
All your life, you gotta remember
what one guy did

280
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,200
because he thought
it was his job to do

281
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,900
and he took
a shot for you.

282
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,800
This shit's not supposed
to run and here I look like a raccoon.

283
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You are irresistible
and you know it.

284
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Danny said I was clingy.

285
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Fuck him. He's the one
with self-esteem issues.

286
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,000
You don't know what
it's like out there, Ade.

287
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,800
You're marrying
Christopher.

288
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,100
He's handsome, makes money,
he's got great hair.

289
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,400
Oh...

290
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,300
Okay.

291
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,200
You know I love animals,
but this thing is so gorgeous.

292
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,100
Isn't it? My dad
almost had a stroke.

293
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,900
But I told him,
"Hey, asshole,

294
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm the one taking
all the fucking risk here.

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,800
I have to fake
the invoices."

296
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,200
Sometimes you gotta just take care
of yourself, you know?

297
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,000
Sure you do, honey.

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Come here.

299
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
- Oh.
- Mmm.

300
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,100
Come on. Let's don't
keep your date waiting.

301
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,200
He likes you,
I can tell.

302
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,500
We got a white
wine for Ade.

303
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,300
That's another
apple martini for you.

304
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,600
Thank you, my dear.

305
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,900
My Seven-and-7,
and nothing-and-nothing.

306
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Don't listen to him,
Chrissy.

307
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
I think what you're
doing's brave.

308
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,300
It's not for everybody.
Things are different

309
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,400
when you don't have
that crutch, you know?

310
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,900
We make up for it
other ways.

311
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,000
My God,
it's hot in here.

312
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,400
What do you expect?
You're dancing in a mink coat.

313
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,800
It's fox.

314
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,700
She's my fox
in a box.

315
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,200
Let's see her box,
or maybe her socks.

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Stupid.

317
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,400
Well, I have to wear fur
on the outside on account

318
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,000
of being bare
everywhere else.

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,800
- You believe this one?
- No shit.

320
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,400
Every place I go,
I got substances

321
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,300
I can't enjoy
shoved in my face.

322
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,700
But I guess asking you
for a little support system

323
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
in my own home
is way the fuck outta line.

324
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
You gotta have
some more wine.

325
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,900
Seemed to have
a good time tonight.

326
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,300
What the fuck
you talking about?

327
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,900
What, Tina?

328
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Come on, that cunt's
too full of herself, anyway.

329
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Cunt? She's my maid
of honor, Christopher.

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
She's no fucking maid,
let me tell you.

331
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,100
Great, now I'm upset.

332
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,700
See what
I'm talking about?

333
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,900
But I guess
it's all my problem.

334
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,500
I'm sorry, baby.
Okay?

335
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Please, stop.

336
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,300
All right, all right.
My handsome nephew.

337
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,100
Auntie Quin, look at you
all dolled up, huh?

338
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,200
I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

339
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, here ya are,
still here.

340
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
Where's Tony?

341
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,700
Downstairs getting
into one of his old suits.

342
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,700
- I'll buy him some new suits.
- He's fine.

343
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,300
I only wish he had more
to come back to.

344
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,100
That ex-wife of his...

345
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
she uses her
answering machine

346
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
to ignore me, so forget about
his seeing the twins.

347
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,300
How's Kelly?
How's she doing?

348
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,100
Well, she's lost
to us, Anthony.

349
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,100
But Tony says

350
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,200
he's gonna hire
a detective.

351
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,100
Look at this.

352
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,900
The two of you
were so cute.

353
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,700
Even then, my cannoli
was bigger than his.

354
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,500
Ooh, stop.

355
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,900
Aw, man.
There he is.

356
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,700
Ah.

357
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,700
God, Ton'.
Look at us.

358
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,300
- 15 fucking years.
- The language.

359
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,600
Go ahead say it.
I haven't changed a bit, right?

360
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,000
You look good,
you look good.

361
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,400
Say "provolone."

362
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,100
Surprise!

363
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,500
Shit.

364
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Very nice, you give me
a heart attack.

365
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Ma, it's enough,
all right?

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,600
Stop crying.
I'm embarrassed enough.

367
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,100
I don't know
what to say.

368
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Don't say anything.
Just eat.

369
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,000
- Oh, hey!
- Ha!

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,700
I got peppers been
marinating for 15 years!

371
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,600
Hey.

372
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,800
- What?
- Where's Tubs?

373
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,700
- Artie?
- Yo.

374
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
- What happened here?
- Still a ball-breaker, huh?

375
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,100
What the fuck's
with him?

376
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Ask him.

377
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,900
You guys
have a beef?

378
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,600
I loaned the guy some money
then he tried to kill himself.

379
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,900
And guess
who got the blame?

380
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh my God, Tony.

381
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,500
My God, we have
all missed you so much.

382
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
I swear, you look
exactly the same.

383
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,500
Oh, you're still
full of shit, huh?

384
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,200
Is Nancy here yet?
The twins?

385
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,900
No, Nancy
couldn't make it.

386
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
Her aunt in Bayonne,
the sciatica.

387
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,600
- What are you gonna do?
- Cousin!

388
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,500
Jan.

389
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Come, come, I want you
to meet my family.

390
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm talking
to him right now.

391
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,700
- Tony, you remember Bobby.
- Oh, yeah.

392
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,000
- Good to see you.
- Now my husband.

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,600
And guys, this is your
Uncle Tony Blundetto.

394
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,200
Hey, there.

395
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
How come we never
met you before?

396
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,000
I've been away
on business.

397
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,700
I've never even
heard of you.

398
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,100
Stop playing
with your ice, come on.

399
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,100
They let that kid
say anything.

400
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,700
- Welcome home, Uncle Tony.
- Oh, Jesus.

401
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,800
This is Meadow.

402
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,200
God, you turned out
beautiful, honey.

403
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,000
And this strapping
young man is Anthony Jr.

404
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,300
How's Kelly?

405
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,200
Our regular dinner,
out by you Thursday, right?

406
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,700
Yes, Daddy.

407
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,500
See with my family
now, you know, the separation,

408
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,800
you gotta make an appointment
to see each other.

409
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,600
I should go see
Uncle Zio.

410
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,700
- Yeah.
- All right.

411
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,500
- Show him the phone!
- Yeah.

412
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Tony.

413
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,200
I'll make this fast
'cause I know you're all hungry.

414
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,500
I remember growing up,
I was always asking

415
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,900
why I just used
to have sisters.

416
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,600
I said to my mother, I said,
"Can't you save up something

417
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,500
and then get me
a baby brother?"

418
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,800
And my mother said,
"What's wrong with your cousin Tony?"

419
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,100
And she was right,
'cause we were brothers.

420
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Except, you know,
we had the same name.

421
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,100
There was like 50 Tonys
in the family.

422
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,000
Some of you remember this.
My dad's name was Johnny

423
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,700
and his dad's name
was Alfred.

424
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,200
And so whenever we were out
running around and we'd hear

425
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,300
"Tony Uncle Johnny,"
that was for me.

426
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,600
And "Tony Uncle Al,"
that was for him.

427
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,500
And there was
"Tony Uncle Philly!"

428
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,700
- Remember?
- Right, yeah, yeah.

429
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,700
But he passed away...
buon' anima.

430
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,500
And Uncle Phil...

431
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,800
Uncle Phil, he passed away
a long time ago, too.

432
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
So...

433
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
anyway.

434
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Tony's being away
has been hard.

435
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,100
But he's back now,
for good.

436
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,900
So welcome home.

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,300
Salut.

439
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,100
Come on, let me hear it.
Welcome home!

440
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,700
Welcome home!

441
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,400
Tony, Meadow is incredible.

442
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
She's a fucking lvy Leaguer.

443
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,300
- You and Carm hit a home run.
- Yeah.

444
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,700
I'm sure Kelly's all right,
wherever she is.

445
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,600
Hey, her old man
was in prison.

446
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
We tried to do
everything we could.

447
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
I wasn't around.
What could I expect?

448
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,700
If things had gone different
way back when, who knows?

449
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,500
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

450
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,300
I'm just saying it's good
it wasn't both of us.

451
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,400
These things
happen, right?

452
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,400
You're gonna like this place.
This is nice.

453
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,900
This is the kind of place we always
talked about having.

454
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
Fucking weird.

455
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,800
My cousin
in the old man's seat.

456
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,500
It's like
Sun Tizzu says...

457
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,300
"A good commander
is benevolent

458
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,900
and unconcerned
with fame."

459
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,500
- What?
- Sun Tizzu.

460
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,500
The Chinese
Prince Machiavelli.

461
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,500
Tony turned me
on to him.

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,400
Tzu, Tzu!

463
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,700
Sun Tzu, you
fucking ass-kiss.

464
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
Hey.

465
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,000
Feech!

466
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,400
You know I missed you
by two weeks at Allenwood.

467
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,300
This'll help
you get started.

468
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,100
Jesus, you're on
your feet already?

469
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,000
You hit the ground running
and you don't look back, huh?

470
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,900
Thank you.

471
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,400
Come on.

472
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,400
So you in on the bus
station project?

473
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Massarone's waiting
on a number.

474
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,800
- How's he doing?
- Good.

475
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,900
We had coffee.

476
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,800
He used to bore me,
Jack.

477
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,900
But he ain't a bad guy
once you get to know him.

478
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,300
I always liked him.

479
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,300
I was very touched
by that funeral the other day.

480
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,400
- Real heart-grabber.
- That fucking little Carmine.

481
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,400
And after what?
Five years in Florida

482
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,000
fixing wet t-shirt
contests.

483
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,400
M'boy are you fat.

484
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
What did you say?

485
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
Reginald
Van Gleason III.

486
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,100
"M'boy are you fat."

487
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,400
That's good, yeah.

488
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,200
Oh!

489
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,200
So I got some ideas,
you know, for you.

490
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,000
Get you on your feet.

491
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,600
Unless, of course, you already know
what you wanna do.

492
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

493
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,400
- Well, yeah. I kinda got an idea.
- Yeah?

494
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,700
Like four years in I got
moved to Springfield.

495
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,100
You know, where they got
the big prison hospital.

496
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,900
It's mostly stab wounds,
detox.

497
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,200
Anyway, this guy I knew from Elkton,
he was telling me

498
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,600
how I could be
an orderly, you know?

499
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,700
And how it's easy
time and all.

500
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Well, you know,
so then you're the guy

501
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,800
that hooks everybody up.
That's smart.

502
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,800
Yeah, but it wasn't
business for me.

503
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,200
I mean I really got
into this shit.

504
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,100
Rehab block had guys
with broken limbs, muscle diseases

505
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,500
and we'd help
them back.

506
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,400
So, I think this might
be a thing I can do.

507
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,900
I got my associate's
degree already.

508
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,000
Took me five years.

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And now it's only
like six months more

510
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,800
for my massage license.

511
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,200
So you wanna run
a massage parlor?

512
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,500
No.

513
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm gonna be a licensed
massage therapist.

514
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,400
Look, I've been away
from all this a long time.

515
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,700
I mean if I got
a shot at staying out

516
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,200
and putting shit together,
I should take it.

517
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh.

518
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,300
'Cause I was thinking,
you know,

519
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,800
I got this air-bag
thing going...

520
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,800
Oh, Tony, thanks,
but...

521
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,600
I mean it's
a really nice offer,

522
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,200
but I need regular work
until I'm certified.

523
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Just regular work.

524
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,800
Well, I guess I know
this guy looking for...

525
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,500
a delivery man
for his linen fleet.

526
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,300
- Bobby Gociletto?
- No, no, no, Koreans.

527
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,300
You know, I don't got
my driver's license.

528
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
So you'll go to my guy
at the DMV.

529
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,100
As far as the union shit,
I can take care of that.

530
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,300
Wow, Tony.
Thanks.

531
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,200
Thank you.

532
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,100
- You're the best, you know that?
- Yeah, yeah.

533
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,100
- Out.
- Why?

534
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Because we are watching
a movie and you are studying.

535
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,300
And why must we keep
having that conversation?

536
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,700
Here it is. #1 on the American
Film Institute's

537
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Greatest American
Movies list.

538
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
- "Citizen Kane."
- Jesus, it's black and white.

539
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,200
That is what film club is all about...
trying new things.

540
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,700
Now, to give us
some background,

541
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
let's see what
Leonard Maltin has to say.

542
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,500
"A film that broke all the rules
and invented some new ones.

543
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,600
The cinematography, music
and Oscar-winning screenplay

544
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,500
by Welles and Herman
J-something are all first rate."

545
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,500
- Wow.
- So it was a sled, huh?

546
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
He should've
told somebody.

547
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,200
I think it's fascinating
the man had all that stuff,

548
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,100
but he died alone
with nothing and nobody.

549
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,800
Good.
Prick.

550
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I hated it.
"You supply the war.

551
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I'll supply the headlines."
How conceited.

552
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,200
There was
the cinematography.

553
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,700
Yeah, that
was very good.

554
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,000
- Oh my God.
- What?

555
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,700
I saw Laura Basi
in the dressing room at Loehmann's.

556
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,500
Definitely
had some work.

557
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,200
D-cup at least
and a lift.

558
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,100
Well, she said she was
remodeling her upstairs.

559
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,700
But I had no idea.

560
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,000
So, Carm,
how you doing?

561
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,900
I'm okay.

562
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,400
My lawyer, he's a top guy...
Robert Greenberg.

563
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
He says that New Jersey

564
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,500
has this equitable
distribution law.

565
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,000
So apparently 20 years entitles me
to at least half his money.

566
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,600
Well, it should.

567
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,800
You made Tony a home,
you raised his children.

568
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,400
Does this guy know
how to get it?

569
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,600
Well, it's mostly
cash, obviously.

570
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,000
God, all those years
and you could get nothing.

571
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,100
This other lawyer, Dan Minditch
says that we should play hardball.

572
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
You know, go after
the real assets.

573
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,500
Marriage is beautiful
in the beginning,

574
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,600
but two,
three years later?

575
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,500
You'd think there'd be
some romance at least.

576
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,200
Janice, you're
a newlywed.

577
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,400
I know. Six months and Bobby
still hasn't found my rosebud.

578
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Maybe he should
hire a reporter.

579
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,200
So the movie's over
and they all start talking

580
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,300
about their marriages
and how miserable they are.

581
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,600
Bitterness.

582
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
So besides
the movie night?

583
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,100
- You have kids?
- No.

584
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,200
So did you attend
Carmine Lupertazzi's funeral?

585
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,000
I didn't know him.

586
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,500
Movie night
was fun, though.

587
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Who was there
at the Tony Blundetto homecoming?

588
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,800
I told you,
just family.

589
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,800
God, is that all you think about
is your fucking work?

590
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,900
You don't care how
I feel about anything.

591
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,300
Okay.

592
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,400
I was married
to an agent.

593
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,700
What happened?
Did he cheat on you?

594
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
While we were trying
to get pregnant

595
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,100
he climbed right over me
to become an assistant supervisor

596
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
on the Milken
task force.

597
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Moved to Los Angeles and jumped
a pay grade without me.

598
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,100
My God, that's terrible.

599
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,000
So where were we?

600
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,000
What am I doing?

601
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
I can't talk to you.
I can't even talk to Christopher

602
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
and he's my soul mate
for God's sake.

603
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,900
I can't talk
to my friends.

604
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,200
I am being ripped
apart here

605
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,100
just snitching
on people.

606
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,400
For what? What do
I get out of it?

607
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Take some comfort in the fact
that you're trying to do the right thing

608
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,200
- by helping your government.
- No, seriously.

609
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,300
For me, it was when
I was in college.

610
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,800
My sister's
boyfriend Kyle

611
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,700
traded our TV
for six handguns.

612
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,200
He sold five
to a high school kid

613
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,800
then used the last one
to open a coconut.

614
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,400
The ricochet left
my sister a paraplegic.

615
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,100
I knew I had to do something
about guys like him.

616
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,600
And nowhere but the FBI
is the line clearer

617
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,900
between the good guys
and the bad guys.

618
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,300
And you're with
the good guys now.

619
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,900
Wow.

620
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,400
Jesus.

621
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,400
- Hey.
- TB.

622
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,500
I didn't call
for no linen delivery.

623
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,000
What do I find
at the pork store?

624
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,800
A bunch of guys
beating the meat.

625
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,600
- Wanna deal me in?
- Absolutely.

626
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,400
Stakes might be
a little high for you.

627
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,700
You know you can't
pay us in napkins.

628
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,300
You got to let that dry
before you put on a second coat?

629
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,700
Fucking Grandpa
Munster over here.

630
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh!

631
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,700
You gonna deal those?
They're not candy bars.

632
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
You can let
some of 'em go.

633
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,900
What the fuck's that for?
Drying shirts?

634
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
It's a Tao master
massage chair.

635
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,200
I had no idea
I was so tense.

636
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,200
It's like my back
is on vacation.

637
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,100
Well, it could
definitely use one.

638
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,900
What the fuck
is this?

639
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,300
Hey T, you gotta
try this.

640
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
He's really
fucking good.

641
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,100
Nothing like being
in the joint

642
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,800
to teach you how to ease
another man's tensions.

643
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,600
Jesus Christ,
I'm gone for one hour.

644
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,800
All of a sudden it turns
into a fucking slumber party.

645
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,600
Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

646
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
Could I talk
to you a minute?

647
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
None of your
fucking business

648
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,300
which side of the bed
I wake up on.

649
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Jesus, it's just
an expression.

650
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,900
Bullshit. Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

651
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,700
All that Reggie Van Gleason,
"M'boy are you fat."

652
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Things have changed
around here.

653
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,400
I'm the boss
of this fucking family.

654
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,600
You're crowding me.

655
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,600
You don't make fun of me.
Got it?

656
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,900
Got it.

657
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,200
And knock off
the massage shit.

658
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,500
It's a place of business,
not a Jack LaLanne.

659
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,100
# Beauty queen
of only 18... #

660
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,900
You gotta
declare all that?

661
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,800
Most of it, anyway.

662
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,300
Well, if you had
a good bookkeeper...

663
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
Hey, you got change?

664
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Been fucking sliding
this stupid bill in and out

665
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,100
of the cigarette machine
for like an hour.

666
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,200
An hour?
I bet you can go longer than that.

667
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,900
Listen to you.

668
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,300
Why do you always
talk like a whore?

669
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,800
Because men like it.

670
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,100
Yeah?

671
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,500
I think you're
right about that.

672
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,500
# Somehow,
I want more #

673
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,600
# I don't mind
spending every day #

674
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,900
# Out on your corner
in the pouring rain. #

675
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm telling you I'm
having a fucking time.

676
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Stay out late, come home drunk,
fuck anyone I want.

677
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,800
Yeah, so what's
the difference?

678
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,600
I don't know.
It's a mindset.

679
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Jesus Christ.

680
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,500
Tony, I was hoping you'd be here.
I gotta tell you,

681
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,300
you shouldn't eat up there
in Fairfield no more.

682
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,300
What the fuck
you talking about?

683
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,300
I went to collect
from my cop up there

684
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,500
and he gave me a heads up.
His buddy on the force saw some car

685
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,000
out by Napoleon's Diner
a couple of weeks ago.

686
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,700
And I remembered
how your goomah lives up there.

687
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,500
- Yeah?
- Guy thought maybe they were fags,

688
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,000
but he ran the plate

689
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,900
and it bounced
back a no-hit.

690
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,300
Feds.

691
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Cop said they were
just sitting there in the rain.

692
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,400
They always do that, but I know
it wasn't me they tailed that night

693
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,600
'cause my whole life's
in the fucking rear view.

694
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,800
- Mine, too.
- Absolutely.

695
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,000
It's Massarone.
Aw, Jesus Christ.

696
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,200
If he flipped
I'd be fucked.

697
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,500
We all would.

698
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,400
Well he ain't been
to the grand jury,

699
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,400
because we would have
heard from our girl up there.

700
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,700
They could be just following
him at this point,

701
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,400
see if they could
get anything on him.

702
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,700
Yeah, and eventually
they'll bring him in.

703
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,100
They've turned a lot fucking tougher
guys than Jack Massarone.

704
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,900
You want me
to take care of it?

705
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,200
No, we don't know
shit yet, right?

706
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,400
He did give me that
fucking painting, though.

707
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,100
There was that,
Tony.

708
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,700
Can't a guy be fucking
nice anymore? Friendly?

709
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
So what do
you wanna do?

710
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I wanna be absolutely
fucking sure.

711
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,700
That's what
I wanna do.

712
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,700
We arrange a meet.
I'll feel him out a little bit.

713
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,300
I gotta do it.

714
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,900
I know the guy.
I know the way he thinks.

715
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I know the way
he acts.

716
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,500
My old man was very good
at vibing people out, too.

717
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
If Massarone's
up to something

718
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
I'll pick it up.

719
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,800
You piece of shit.

720
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,800
I don't believe this.

721
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,600
Hold on.

722
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,900
Yeah.

723
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,700
I just wanted to thank you for taking
the components out of the home theater.

724
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,700
Hey, I bought that for us to watch
movies as a family, okay?

725
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,900
Not to entertain
your girlfriends.

726
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,900
I talked to my lawyer about filing
a separation agreement.

727
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,700
I'm not paying
a lawyer.

728
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,200
We should be able to settle
this thing like adults!

729
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,900
Then stop taking shit
out of the house!

730
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,800
- Hey Tony, what's up?
- Let's take a walk.

731
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,100
There he is, huh?

732
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,900
Hey, how you doing?

733
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,900
- Good, good. How are you doing?
- Okay.

734
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,200
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, watch the curb.

735
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,800
Hey, wait a second.
Before you say anything,

736
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,900
have you lost
a little weight?

737
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,000
You think, huh?
I don't know.

738
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,200
Listen, I talked
to our friend.

739
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,700
- The one that celebrates Hanukkah?
- Uh-huh.

740
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,900
- It's in the works.
- Oh great, it's good news.

741
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,100
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

742
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,500
So I been meaning
to ask you

743
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
you noticed
anything lately?

744
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,200
What are we
talking about?

745
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,000
You weren't followed
here, were you?

746
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,200
No, l...
I don't think so.

747
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm... I'm pretty
careful.

748
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,000
All right.

749
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,200
Everything else okay,
good EKG and shit, huh?

750
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,800
- Yeah, I guess.
- All right.

751
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,600
But I gotta tell you,
I don't like what I'm hearing.

752
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,100
Relax.

753
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,300
It's not worth
losing your hair over.

754
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,600
- Right?
- Okay.

755
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,200
All right.

756
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,300
I couldn't tell shit.

757
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,900
What the fuck am I,
a mind reader?

758
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,600
So what's the next
step here, Ton'?

759
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
What?

760
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,100
Said I looked like
I lost some weight.

761
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,500
Oh.

762
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,800
The motherfucker.

763
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,400
Yeah?

764
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,200
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

765
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
hold on.

766
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
That Korean... Kim.

767
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,600
Something about your
cousin... I don't know.

768
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,300
Yeah?

769
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,200
It's your fucking
linen truck.

770
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,600
What do you want me
to do about it?

771
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Fire him. Go ahead.

772
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,300
Put him out in the fucking
street for all I care!

773
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,800
If Tony B wants
to pick up some scratch

774
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,600
he could do this Massarone thing...
if it goes.

775
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,200
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

776
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
The man is trying
to go straight.

777
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,000
Don't you give a fuck
about your cousin?!

778
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,600
I'm sorry, T.
You're right.

779
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,100
That was a great party
the other night.

780
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,300
Fuck him.

781
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,500
Guy is fucking
useless to me.

782
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,200
Was that a yes
on Massarone?

783
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,500
Tony's got
his own process.

784
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,300
What's to process here?

785
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,200
Honestly, Carm, this is a lot better
than watching "Casablanca."

786
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I didn't need to see
that movie again anyway.

787
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Even if it kills Tony,

788
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,700
I will have that system
back for next time.

789
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,300
So what is next
on that list?

790
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
Number three...
"The Godfather."

791
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,500
Look at us. We'll kill ourselves
for these cigarettes.

792
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,400
You know they had
a bear back here?

793
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,000
So how come Angie Bonpensiero
don't come?

794
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,300
Please. She's not
welcome here.

795
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,300
I thought everybody
liked her.

796
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Don't you know
about Pussy?

797
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,300
He went in the program.
He turned on everybody...

798
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,900
us, the people he knew
his whole life.

799
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,000
Who knows why people
do what they do?

800
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
But what kind
of person does that?

801
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,600
I mean it's like
Judas or something,

802
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,000
eating that last
supper with Jesus.

803
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,400
And the whole time he knows
they're gonna crucify him.

804
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,600
I mean, at least Judas
didn't go into any

805
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,800
apostle protection
program.

806
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,300
He hung himself.
He knew what he did.

807
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,200
Oh, look at you.
You're shivering.

808
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,700
I didn't know it was
that cold, sweetie.

809
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,600
I'll tell you, I don't know how
I'd be holding up.

810
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,200
It's just...

811
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,700
I guess you all are
really important to me.

812
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,800
Aw, Carm,
you'd do the same.

813
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
We love you so much.

814
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,000
Ade, you okay?

815
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,900
What's the matter?

816
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,800
I'm not what you think.

817
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't know
what to do.

818
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I need...

819
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,700
I wanna tell you
all something.

820
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,500
It's driving me crazy.

821
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,000
You know you can
tell us anything.

822
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,900
Oh God.

823
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,600
She's been drinking
like crazy.

824
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Where are you going?

825
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,800
Oh, my God!

826
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,800
Ah!

827
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,000
Honey!

828
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm fine, okay?
Just leave me alone.

829
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,300
No, you're bleeding.
Let me drive you.

830
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,500
Ton'? It's like 3:00
in the morning.

831
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah, yeah.
I couldn't sleep

832
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,300
so I wanted to see
if the phone worked.

833
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, yeah,
it works great.

834
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,400
I'm in my mother's basement
and I can really hear you.

835
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,700
Listen, you should
know that...

836
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
that boss there, Kim,

837
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,800
he's after your ass.

838
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
I rub him
the wrong way.

839
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,500
Maybe you shouldn't
be a masseuse then.

840
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,800
Oh.

841
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,400
Tony, the reason I called,
about the other day...

842
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,400
look, you can kid
around with me, okay?

843
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,900
But not when the other
guys are there.

844
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,200
I gotta maintain respect.

845
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,300
No, I know.
You're the boss.

846
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,000
Jesus.

847
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,400
See you gotta be careful
what you say on this phone.

848
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,600
It doesn't affect you,
but it affects me.

849
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,400
Right.
I'm sorry.

850
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
Is everything
good over there?

851
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,400
You know, my mom's
on my case.

852
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,800
Who'd have thought
we'd both be on our own again?

853
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,400
Well, you can get back together
with Carm if you want.

854
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,300
'Course she thinks
it's up to her

855
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,100
and she goes from zero
to bitch every time

856
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,100
I try to show
any warmth, you know?

857
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,900
That's gotta be tough.

858
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,600
Listen, Tony, I gotta
be up in two hours.

859
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
So go to sleep.

860
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,000
But you're my cousin
and my best friend.

861
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,500
You gotta know
we could always talk.

862
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,200
Yeah, well I'll buy
a fucking lunch box.

863
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,800
All right, go to sleep,
go to sleep.

864
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,300
We gotta talk about
my compensation overall.

865
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,500
Interferon for my son's MS?
That's 20 a year now.

866
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,400
Right. You said you
were gonna get us

867
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,200
a making ceremony
which you didn't do.

868
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,300
And here you are
asking for a raise.

869
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,700
Can't you talk
to the higher-ups?

870
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,600
Okay, we made
Vito Spatafore

871
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,300
as running Ralph Cifaretto's
construction business.

872
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,700
Has Chris ever
confirmed that?

873
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,200
- You wanna know something?
- What?

874
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,700
This girl, she's totally
ripping off her employer.

875
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,600
Probably over 100 grand.

876
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,400
What do you mean?

877
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,000
Tina Francesco's
her name.

878
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,900
She's a bookkeeper
for this furniture wholesaler.

879
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,600
So she makes up vendors,
but she writes them real checks.

880
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,600
Then her father cashes them.
Is that a federal crime?

881
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,100
How many checks?
I mean, how much?

882
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,000
Like I said, probably
over 100 grand.

883
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,300
Tina?

884
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,400
Francesco.

885
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,800
The father's
name's Victor.

886
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,600
It's Brettler
& Son's lmports.

887
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,000
# Hear the screams
of Center 42 #

888
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,600
# Loud enough to bust
your brains out #

889
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,900
# The opposition's tongue
is cut in two #

890
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,700
# Keep off the street
'cause you're in danger #

891
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,600
# 100,000 disparus #

892
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,200
# Lost in the jails
in South America #

893
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,100
# Cuddle up, baby,
cuddle up tight #

894
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,400
# Cuddle up, baby,
keep it all out of sight #

895
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,400
# Undercover, keep
it all out of sight #

896
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,300
# Undercover
of the night #

897
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,800
# The sex police are out
there on the streets #

898
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,400
# Make sure the pass laws
are not broken #

899
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,700
# The race militia
has got itchy fingers #

900
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,200
# All the way from New York
back to Africa #

901
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,200
# Cuddle up, baby,
keep it all out of sight #

902
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,600
# Cuddle up, baby, sleep
with it all out of sight #

903
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,100
# Cuddle up, baby,
keep it all out of sight. #
