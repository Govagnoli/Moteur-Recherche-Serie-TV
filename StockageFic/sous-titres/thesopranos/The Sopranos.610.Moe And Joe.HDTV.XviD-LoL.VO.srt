1
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,101
tony, hey.
i tented the bulbs.

2
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,600
oh, good.

3
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,901
i've been meaning
to ask you...

4
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,801
the sacrimoni's--

5
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:59,034
i've been doin' his yard over
there a year and change now...

6
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,534
and?

7
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,234
i guess
what i'm asking is

8
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,001
how much longer do i have to
keep doin' this on the arm?

9
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,168
oh, so it was okay
when we were gettin' you

10
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:10,934
out of your feech la manna
problem, huh?

11
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,801
but suddenly--
short fuckin' memory?

12
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,034
i appreciate that, tony.
don't get me wrong, but--

13
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,201
you're a selfish prick, sal.
you know that?

14
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:19,801
her husband's in jail. don't
you think this is the time

15
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,268
when mrs. sacrimoni
needs you the most?

16
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,534
the federal prosecutors
and myself have been told

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,634
to clear our calendars
for the next five months.

18
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,801
so trial is upon us.

19
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38,967
and the feds have reached

20
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,034
a complete accounting
of your worth.

21
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:47,001
"the vintage wurlitzer"?

22
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,967
they go through
my fuckin' sock drawer?

23
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:50,967
they shot a video
the day of your arrest.

24
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,967
they even tracked down
the 180 grand

25
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,367
in boca raton
under your father's name.

26
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,801
they estimate your net
worth at $5 million...

27
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,201
while ginnlives
on scraps.

28
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,234
...between your cash
and portlios

29
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,967
with fidelity and vanguard,

30
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:08,700
your 401k and verance parachute
from essany scaffolding,

31
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,234
condo in deal beach
at 450,

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,268
maserati, ginny's yukon,

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,901
and the house and its contents
valued at a million two.

34
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,600
is this all part
of your plan, ron--

35
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,634
make me so fuckin'
depressed that i hang myself?

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,634
it's my obligation to raise
the idea again of cooperating.

37
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:28,767
flip?

38
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,767
let me explain something
to you again, ron,

39
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,700
but differently.

40
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,700
being a rat,
where i'm comin' from,

41
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:39,201
that's like asking a person
where you're comin' from

42
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,400
to become a fuckin' nazi.

43
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:44,700
i don't wanna hear
that shit again.

44
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,567
good.

45
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,001
because, frankly,
i don't represent turncoats.

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,801
'cause it would kill
your practice.

47
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:06,500
huh...

48
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:11,867
what happened
to my stuffed pork loin?

49
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,101
you ever hear
of knocking?

50
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:15,767
i ordered it special.

51
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,834
you had them send it up
to carmela?

52
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:21,168
you get
what you pay for.

53
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:23,567
hi.

54
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:28,901
she's your little twin.

55
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,967
bacala's got
no fuckin' genes at all.

56
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:34,300
you never miss a chance
to shit on him, do you?

57
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,034
i'm joking, come on. she
looks like you, that's all.

58
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,801
<i>i don't know why you
just can't admit</i>

59
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:41,067
that you blame us
that you got shot.

60
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,400
unfortunately, i have
only myself to blame.

61
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,534
"unfortunately." oh-ho.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,101
so obviously you'd like
to blame somebody.

63
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,534
i have only myself
to blame.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,634
you don't blame me
for the shooting?

65
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,534
well you fuckin' blame
me for something!

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,500
- jan, the baby. - you know,
marrying the boss's sister--

67
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,967
usually it's a step up.

68
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:09,600
but you keep your
goddamn foot on our necks.

69
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,333
you punish bobby
because he's my husband.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,500
- will you stop, huh?
- to be his age and not to be a captain?

71
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,600
oh, now i see what this
little visit's all about.

72
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,500
he works so hard
for you,

73
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,268
and what does he get?

74
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,101
merciless ridicule--

75
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:27,534
about his weight, about
his model railroading.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,567
- he's a grown man!
- oh, but it's okay for neil young.

77
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,400
he owns lionel!

78
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,634
domenica! take care
of your things.

79
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,433
i don't know
where it comes from--

80
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,101
all your anger,
your hate for me.

81
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:47,467
i'm your sister.

82
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:51,834
i know i'm not perfect.

83
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,234
i know i annoy people.

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,101
i think about you

85
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,001
lying in that
hospital bed...

86
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,600
i cried for you.

87
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,500
i sat with you.

88
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,034
i know it.

89
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,500
and i appreciated it.

90
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,433
but we both know

91
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,168
no matter
how much help i gave,

92
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:35,201
you'd still be here
fuckin' complainin'.

93
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,734
oh my god,

94
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:41,201
there's nothing holding us
together but dna.

95
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,034
i'm askin' what else you
got besides slot machines.

96
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,400
that single-deck
blackjack?

97
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,600
okay, thanks.

98
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,234
i can't believe this.

99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
<i>- i was-- - is this what
you're doing all day?</i>

100
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,634
i knew there was a reason you wouldn't
let me read the galleys of your book.

101
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,201
i'm doing research.

102
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,534
i guess rocky marciano
was a fan of the greyhounds

103
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
'cause i found a fucking
trifecta box ticket in my trash!

104
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,134
hold up.

105
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,700
it's complicated shit.

106
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,867
are you even
a sports writer?

107
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:46,333
i mean, here we are talking about taking
the next step in this relationship.

108
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,300
i ask you to share my home and
you can't ev be straight with me.

109
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,001
fuck this.
nice knowing you, vincent.

110
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,134
<i>jimbo, come on.</i>

111
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,400
i'm not a writer, okay?

112
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:06,467
i'm not from scottsdale

113
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:09,600
and the car's not
my sister's.

114
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,667
i'm actually
from new jersey

115
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,834
- i knew it.
- some shit went down.

116
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,700
i had to leave--

117
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,834
my home,
my contracting business...

118
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,901
my wife, my kids.

119
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,600
are you drunk?
it's not even 11:00!

120
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,600
you think it's easy?

121
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,700
i miss home so bad
my heart's a fuckin' lump.

122
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,700
i'm barely holding
together,

123
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,867
stuck in the sticks,
running out of money

124
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,867
and now this?

125
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,333
you think i was
looking for you?

126
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,734
a wife and kids.
of course.

127
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:43,600
i've been divorced
for a few years.

128
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,333
where do they think
you are?

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,433
you can never
tell anybody, ever.

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,967
i'm not
fuckin' around here.

131
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,734
i was married too,
remember?

132
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,667
i was only gonna say
you need some money.

133
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:02,400
you worked construction.
maybe i can help you get work.

134
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,201
i know some people could
always use a good handyman.

135
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,734
happy birthday!

136
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,201
- mwah!
- stop blubbering. it's a party.

137
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:19,600
you think we'd let you
turn 50 alone?

138
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,667
- happy birthday.
- thank you.

139
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:26,867
hi, sal!

140
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,767
god, he's such a mope.

141
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,234
the girls come around
enough, and that helps.

142
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,333
allegra's a little bitchy, but
it's painful for her to be here.

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,567
plus she thinks
i resent her happiness.

144
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,634
- newlyweds.
- she's probably freaked out

145
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,234
that she's not
happier herself.

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,934
ginny, that kitchen...

147
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,634
and this room,
the light...

148
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,600
not his decision to make.

149
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,201
i'm running that shop,
not him.

150
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,634
<i>my days are
completely full.</i>

151
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
- i shouldn't.
- hey, it's your birthday.

152
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:01,600
- yeah.
- i've always loved this place.

153
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,333
it reminds me of the palladian
villas i saw in italy.

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,500
thank you.
sometimes i forget.

155
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,168
and it's embarrassing. i
spend most of my time upstairs.

156
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,634
<i>- wellbutrin.
- i wish there was a pill--</i>

157
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,101
john in that place?

158
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:15,567
of course i can't say my
pain's worse than anybody's.

159
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:18,567
yeah yeah.
we're both grownups.

160
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:21,300
<i>i'd rather go
with my own instincts.</i>

161
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:46,534
your feet are like
fuckin' icicles.

162
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,101
hands too?

163
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,467
dinner was good.

164
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,234
shh.

165
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,034
hey, i found
a woodland mountain.

166
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:25,600
27" peak,
clump foliage and snow.

167
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,001
- bobb
- i'm listening, okay?

168
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,034
where are you going?

169
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:36,134
rafe's brother's making a
music video. they got dry ice.

170
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,268
where's your helmet?

171
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,934
check out
the moe and joe action.

172
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,634
hey, you know what?
let's do a race,

173
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,567
the polar express one.

174
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,333
we could trash it.

175
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:55,168
i can't.

176
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:09,201
i see the grey cloud
hanging around your head.

177
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,534
<i>where's prince albert?
still sleeping?</i>

178
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,567
who knows?

179
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:23,001
tony, i've been very patient
with you because you've been sick.

180
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:26,834
you were going to talk
to the building inspector.

181
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:30,168
- my spec house.
- oh, yeah. yeah yeah.

182
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:32,700
i sent little paulie.

183
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,534
they made some headway
with the supervisor,

184
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,500
but the other guy, the
inspector, he's a piece of work.

185
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,534
next i'll get sil
on it.

186
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,268
gotta pay a visit to the
montville building department.

187
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,268
to what end?

188
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,333
i've been promising carm
i'd lean on this inspector.

189
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,367
completely went
out of my head.

190
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:01,234
the guy's name is,
uh, ron senkowski.

191
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:06,934
ginny sack's brother,
anthony.

192
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,700
ah, the lord
of the lenses.

193
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,567
actually we just started
carrying these.

194
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,634
the newest
cross pen.

195
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:30,034
hmm, a rollerball.

196
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,534
you want
a classic fountain?

197
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,534
nah. have a seat.

198
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,101
so how's your
brother-in-law?

199
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,001
john's fuckin' made
of steel.

200
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:46,734
i was told
your ears only.

201
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,767
oh, that's why
he didn't get a pen?

202
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,333
- no, i-- - he's fuckin'
with you, anthony.

203
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,600
johnny's a silent partner

204
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,034
in this heavy equipment
leasing thing in new orleans.

205
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:10,101
good. fema's down there handing
out krugerrands in buckets.

206
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:13,600
he said post-katrina you had some
knowledge of business and the area.

207
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,801
well, let me say this.

208
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:19,268
dick cheney for president...
of the fuckin' universe.

209
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,300
on account of john's, uh,
liquidity problems--

210
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,934
the asset freeze--

211
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,101
he'd love you
to contact these brothers,

212
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,801
the owners,
and turn it into cash.

213
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,934
- me?
- says phil leotardo shouldn't be involved.

214
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:40,201
just know john's
asking as a friend.

215
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:42,467
and obviously
there's a finder's fee.

216
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,001
what the hell's this,
a siesta?

217
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:18,268
what?
i wasn't sleeping.

218
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,067
i was resting my hips.

219
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:23,934
i'm supposed
to have surgery.

220
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:28,734
am i early?

221
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,234
- what do you mean?
- dinner.

222
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,101
i am interviewing a new
contractor for my spec--

223
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,534
bill degillio.

224
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
he built
the sacrimoni house.

225
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:44,001
he did decent workmanship.
ginny says he works for a price.

226
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,801
- so?
- well, your sister loves that house.

227
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:49,634
she said it reminded her
of a villa in italy.

228
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,634
what, is he
coming here now?

229
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,268
i picked up a couple of
sandwiches from italianissimo.

230
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,367
you know, your father
did this house

231
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,467
and it was more than
decent workmanship.

232
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,433
you think about replacing
him before you rush off

233
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,634
into something that could maybe
cost you a lot more of your time.

234
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:28,367
why do you suddenly care
so much about my dad?

235
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,967
and i like that she has
these little projects

236
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:42,300
and charities,
what have you.

237
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,101
makes her happy,

238
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,500
keeps her busy.

239
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,333
but...

240
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,367
even in bed she's
a million miles a way.

241
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:56,967
sounds like you want to
encourage her with this house

242
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,700
as long as it doesn't
interfere with your life.

243
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:03,801
carmela and me, we--

244
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,333
we came
to an understanding

245
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,967
when we reconciled--

246
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:11,234
i would financially back
her spec house

247
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,067
and she would have more of
a don't-ask-don't-tell policy

248
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,967
towards my work

249
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:21,201
and my recreational life
outside of the home.

250
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,201
but you tell me
there hasn't been

251
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,600
much recreating
since the shooting.

252
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,867
no, and that's okay.

253
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,834
fucking janice came
to visit me at work.

254
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,967
that doesn't happen often.

255
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,034
well, she shops
for meat there.

256
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,101
we get it free.

257
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,400
and by the way, again,
if you ever need a roast

258
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:56,101
or any specialty
kind of cut,

259
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:57,801
please just ask.

260
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,934
my dad used to
drop us off there

261
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,801
when he had
to run errands.

262
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:08,001
we'd go into the back
and we'd steal cigarettes,

263
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,433
play house, you know,
shit like that.

264
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,467
anyway, she was all upset.

265
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:16,567
she said that i was mean

266
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,367
to her and her husband.

267
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,467
- what did you say?
- well, it doesn't matter,

268
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,467
'cause she's right.

269
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,801
i love it when i can
take a shit on her

270
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,834
and her husband.

271
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,600
<i>what's that about?</i>

272
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,433
even when they told me that
uncle jun' might need diapers,

273
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,134
i thought about bobby
having to change him.

274
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,333
i still get
a kick out of it.

275
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,834
it makes bob seem weak?

276
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:46,034
your sister too?

277
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:49,734
these are acts of kindness.

278
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:52,101
janice only does
acts of janice

279
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:53,901
trust me.

280
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,268
you two have never
really gotten along?

281
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,268
well, not never.
she was my older sister.

282
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,567
i thought
she was pretty cool.

283
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,268
and she gave it back
to my mother.

284
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,333
let me tell you,
that was some heroic shit.

285
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,067
because she defended y.

286
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:10,300
please. it was
every man for himself.

287
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:15,867
i remember one time my
parents left her in charge.

288
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,634
go ahead.

289
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:27,967
well, she stood in the
hallway and she tape-recorded

290
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,867
me and barb
having a fight.

291
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,367
and she held that cassette
tape over my head for a month.

292
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,067
fuckin' extortion.

293
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:43,433
made me make her bed,
get her shit.

294
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,433
did she do that
to barbara too?

295
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,667
well, that's not
the fuckin' point.

296
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:51,201
i've been coming here-- i
don't know-- five years now

297
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:54,834
and you still don't understand what
it means to tape somebody in my family?

298
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,834
you still don't fucking
get this?

299
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,801
listen, as far
as that thing goes--

300
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,767
the coffee
with the chicory--

301
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,034
- what the fuck is that?
- oh shit.

302
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:12,567
i suck at talking like
this, john. i'm sorry.

303
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:15,367
our friend with
the stomach.

304
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:20,433
in town or near home?

305
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,367
your neighbor.

306
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,034
- a. s.--
- yeah, all right.

307
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,934
just say, "the thing i asked you to do."

308
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:30,067
"the coffee with
the fuckin' chicory."

309
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,433
<i>- is he gonna get it for me?
- yes.</i>

310
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,067
bad news is he wants
10 cups for himself.

311
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:41,367
not seven.

312
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,700
all right. done.

313
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:52,234
did you pick up the birthday cake
for gin with the marzipan flowers?

314
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,834
the stuff behind
the pool?

315
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:58,734
no, an actual
fuckin' cake.

316
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,967
it's her birthday.

317
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,901
- what are you doing?
- i'm comin' with you.

318
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:25,300
okay, but stand clear.

319
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,901
- what's going on?
- pastor heard water running,

320
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,700
went down, basement's flooded and
they're trying to shut down the pipe.

321
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,667
but the pastor's trapped,
standing on a milk crate.

322
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,901
- anybody go get him?
- there's an arcing wire hanging.

323
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:41,001
these assholes skipped a
conduit when they remodeled.

324
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,467
i spent years
as a contractor.

325
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,600
electrical is where
i got started.

326
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,734
<i>way to go, vince!</i>

327
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,168
what the fuck
did i tell you?

328
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:08,101
fuck you. the guy was gonna get cooked.

329
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,801
what are you trying
to be, a big man?

330
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,867
- back the fuck off!
- what the fuck, jim?

331
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,400
boys, boys, calm down.

332
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,367
okay, now let's cut the
bullshit, get the water turned off

333
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,467
and pump out
the damn basement.

334
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:27,967
i gotta say, i thought you guys
were morons for doing this shit,

335
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:30,600
but now i can see
it's a fuckin' rush.

336
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,234
you should join
the department.

337
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,567
we could use
another moron.

338
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:37,168
of course it's a
commitment, firefighting.

339
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:38,534
every day it's there.

340
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,001
you have to have
a passion, really.

341
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,967
i've got these bad hips.
supposed to have surgery.

342
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:46,467
<i>well, this is all
bullshit talk anyway.</i>

343
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,467
you're probably gonna
forget this crap hole

344
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,734
<i>the minute you hear
from your publisher.</i>

345
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:55,767
hey, darts! five bucks

348
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,168

00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:15,268
good week, even with
the fuckin' dolphins.

352
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,234
<i>night, boss.</i>

00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,268

354
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,667

355
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,101
<i>you beat, nigga. what?</i>

356
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:34,433
you come out the bookie's?
you a winner or a loser?

357
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,300
you're making
a big mistake.

358
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,034
damn! three g's.

359
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:43,101
you got what you want.

360
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:46,001
please don't.
i got kids.

361
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,500
yo man, look at his mouth.

362
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:48,834
look at his fuckin' mouth!

363
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:50,300
fuck this. do him.
do him now.

364
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,168
jesus, no. please.
no, please.

365
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,500
shit!

366
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,234
what the fuck are you doing,
man? why you pull that trigger?

367
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,600
well, according to john, the
retail value of bayou leasing

368
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,667
is around six mil.
seem about right?

369
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:12,134
- between five and six.
- let's do this again, cher.

370
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:17,734
well, you're gonna have to find a
buyer and deliver john's half to me

371
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:21,333
and in about 30 days, give you a
chance to get a couple of bidders.

372
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,034
- his half?
- yeah.

373
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,600
i don't think
that's up for debate.

374
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,901
had you controlled
your fuckin' football jones

375
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,234
we wouldn't even have
no fuckin' silent partner.

376
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,700
that man floated me
50 grand. 50.

377
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,801
next thing i know he's buying
in for half a fucking million.

378
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:41,333
look at him sitting there like
they don't do this shit every day.

379
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,134
you took john's loan.
he helped you expand.

380
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,101
now it's time
to cash in.

381
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:50,168
listen, mr. soprano, that's
what i've been saying all along.

382
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,101
you know, you two
don't seem like brothers.

383
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:58,333
in-laws. he married my little sis.

384
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
15 years
of womanly company

385
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:03,567
but i had to come all the way to
new jersey to get truly fucked.

386
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,934
you know, i'm doing this
as a favor to john.

387
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,867
and i don't need
another headache.

388
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,367
so do we got
a problem here?

389
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,834
no, sir.
i'm buying a boat.

390
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:20,767
now you fancy yourself
a businessman.

391
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:24,734
would you sell now with all that
money pouring into new orleans?

392
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,268
john sacrimoni
asked me to.

393
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,767
well, we're
very different people.

394
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,034
<i>- yeah.
- heard about bobby bacala?</i>

395
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:02,500
yeah, my sister called
with the breaking news.

396
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:05,168
<i>that fuckin'
part of newark--</i>

397
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,101
even the cops
don't go there no more.

398
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:10,034
so you heard
everything.

399
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,234
doctors said the slug blew bits
of sidewalk into the eye there.

400
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,934
yeah, i heard.

401
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:18,101
<i>- but they're optimistic.
- right, doctors.</i>

402
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:21,300
it's always good news
till it ain't.

403
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,034
speaking of that, whatever
the fuck happened to you

404
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,034
with the prostate?

405
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:30,433
well actually, t, i've
been dealing with some shit.

406
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,168
cancer, to tell
you the truth.

407
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,234
what the fuck, paulie?

408
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,667
it was early.
maybe i caught a break.

409
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:40,901
<i>still encapsulated.</i>

410
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,867
i'm taking a course
of radiation

411
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,600
to knock the psa back
into the single digits.

412
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:49,734
well, are you all right?
the hair and shit?

413
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,367
heh, knock wood.

414
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,433
i must have done
good things in my life.

415
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,367
<i>yeah.</i>

416
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,667
all right.

417
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:03,168
<i>the cancer--</i>

418
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:05,201
your ears only.

419
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:06,934
<i>absolutely.</i>

420
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,300
you hear about bobby?

421
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:13,967
- yeah.
- should've seen him.

422
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,201
put a patch over his eye
like hathaway.

423
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,300
he was really rattled.

424
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:21,667
still, let's face it, it was kind
of stupid to be out there that late.

425
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:24,268
ton', cops don't even
go there no more.

426
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,300
anyway, bobby's vision's
fucked now.

427
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:29,134
they're hoping
the repair will take.

428
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:31,467
he could be a candidate
for a cornea transplant.

429
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:34,067
he should be a candidate
for brain transplant.

430
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:36,034
to his credit,

431
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:39,101
all he was thinking about was
straightening up for the week.

432
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:42,234
fuck that honor
and loyalty shit.

433
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,734
it was a maneuver, carlo, 'cause he
knew it was his own fucking fault.

434
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:57,534
what?

435
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,333
<i>don't give me
that look.</i>

436
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,400
including the wife's i.r.a.

437
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:10,067
and his pension,

438
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:13,467
we'd go for 240 months.

439
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:17,834
20 years and 90%
of his assets?

440
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,934
makes trial seem like
a risk worth taking.

441
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,901
have you seen
the discovery evidence?

442
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,567
you came to us.

443
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,600
my client insisted
the house is off-limits.

444
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,201
he wants his wife
provided for.

445
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:30,734
so what do you have
in mind?

446
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:35,001
renee, again, the shit that
has nothing to do with him:

447
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:38,367
the house, the i.r.a.,
the yukon,

448
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,400
the deed
on the daughter's condo.

449
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,667
- and 12 years.
- for a conspiracy to commit murder?

450
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:47,567
get back to me
when you're sober, ron.

451
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,101
it's broken.
wanna switch?

452
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:03,534
oh no no.
i'm good.

453
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,234
carm just called. she's still
getting her folks in the car.

454
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,667
where's barb and tom?

455
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:10,367
i asked them
to bring wine.

456
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,934
we'll see how long
that takes.

457
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,101
did you take
the vicodin?

458
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,001
<i>giants, huh?</i>

459
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,168
fucking blowing 'em out.

460
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,168
as long as they
don't beat the spread.

461
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,667
- where are you going?
- out.

462
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,867
<i>the giants are kicking ass here.</i>

463
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:41,134
- i'm going to eric's to watch the chargers.
- what channel's that on?

464
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:44,034
someeople aren't too cheap
to buy the satellite package.

465
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:46,333
sit down.
this is a giants house.

466
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,101
- i hate the fucking giants.
- ho! what'd we say about that language?

467
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,101
a.j. didn't have
to come to sunday dinner.

468
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:55,634
a.j. has a job. do
you wanna go get a job?

469
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,667
go ahead.

470
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:59,400
but first go get
your last report card

471
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,700
and read it out loud
to everybody.

472
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,567
no? i thought so.

473
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:13,300
now go finish your spanish
report before dinner.

474
00:30:15,268 --> 00:30:17,067
set the table,
honey.

475
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,967
my brother-in-law almost
got his fucking eye put out.

476
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,367
some fucking
crackhead animals.

477
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,667
- that is terrible.
- yeah, it is, but...

478
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,534
jesus christ, it's one thing
after another with her family.

479
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,400
you mean the bad luck?

480
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:41,500
or do you feel like
somehow they deserve it?

481
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:44,801
i don't know, but...

482
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:47,367
fucking janice
attracts drama.

483
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:50,600
she creams
over the misery.

484
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,268
does she remind you
of anyone?

485
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,201
when we were growing up,
she had something,

486
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:01,034
you know. she--

487
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:04,001
she had beautiful hair
and she was built and...

488
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,700
guys her age were always
buying me ice cream,

489
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,667
giving me baseball cards,
kissing my ass

490
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:13,834
<i>to get in good with her.</i>

491
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,734
sounds a little
like jealousy.

492
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:21,300
no guy wants his sister
to be the town pump.

493
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,567
you weren't
sexually threatened?

494
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,901
oh, jesus christ, will you
make up your fucking sick mind?

495
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,268
first it's my mother.
now i wanna fuck my sister?

496
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,700
it's normal, not sick,

497
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,734
that she functioned

498
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:40,367
as the focus of your
early sexual feelings.

499
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,467
in fact,
it was probably mutual.

500
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,333
oh, jesus christ.

501
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,567
<i>you describe her
as "built."</i>

502
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:51,567
all those afternoons in your
father's office, playing house.

503
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,467
<i>whatever your bond,</i>

504
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:58,834
what happened
between then and now?

505
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:04,700
she fought it out with my
mother and finally took off

506
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:07,333
first minute
she could.

507
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,067
what if you
had taken off?

508
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,801
well, that never
would have happened

509
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,834
'cause i wasn't like that.
i did what i was told.

510
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,901
your father's son.

511
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,934
yeah, at's right.

512
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,634
and all that went with it.

513
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,634
that's right. all the
success and the money.

514
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,600
but beyond that, what else
did you inherit?

515
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:30,867
i'll tell you
what i inherited--

516
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:32,934
my mother.

517
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:36,700
janice got laid.
she took off.

518
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:39,067
she laughed
at all this shit.

519
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:41,667
then the trip's over and
she's back and she's one of us.

520
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,234
and she wants
her piece.

521
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,367
well, let me tell you,
she get nothing!

522
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:48,801
'cause i got the scars!
so it's mine!

523
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,001
what are you doing?

524
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:19,934
cooking.
how was the call?

525
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:23,067
it was nothing. it was
a laundromat on webster.

526
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,901
thought i'd make a little
dinner like we do back home.

527
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:37,667
<i>we got pasta badan--</i>

528
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:39,901
macaroni and potatoes,

529
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,534
real peasant food.

530
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,767
we got a little salad.

531
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:49,300
then pork chops

532
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,034
and vinegar peppers.

533
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,634
i fuckin' miss
this shit, i gotta say.

534
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,600
i can see why.

535
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,934
you gotta wait for that.

536
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:25,467
- what?
- nothing.

537
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:28,333
i just realized--

538
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,567
the other night when you cut
the power to the church...

539
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:35,034
i was a real dick.

540
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:38,600
- yeah.
- but it was only because i was worried, you know.

541
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,667
something could've
happened to you.

542
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,600
that's a nice thing.

543
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,101
you don't understand.

544
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:53,001
vincent,

545
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,101
i love you.

546
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:00,934
i love you,
johnny cakes.

547
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,634
<i>10:30, gotta be.</i>

548
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,500
<i>hour and half, lunch.</i>

549
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:25,934
<i>the halfway
fuckin' point.</i>

550
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:29,534
<i>don't look at your watch.
not yet.</i>

551
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,500
<i>save it.
treat yourself.</i>

552
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:39,367
<i>10:50,</i>

553
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:42,534
<i>maybe 10:55.</i>

554
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,001
<i>don't look.</i>

555
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,001
<i>think of those sandwiches
jim made.</i>

556
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,534
<i>when you've eaten
the last bite,</i>

557
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,901
<i>this fuckin' day
is halfway gone.</i>

558
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,734
<i>11:30, has to be.</i>

559
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:03,034
<i>look at the angle
of the sun.</i>

560
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:05,001
<i>maybe even 11:45.</i>

561
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,333
<i>okay, look.</i>

562
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,901
<i>now.</i>

563
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,700
fuck me!

564
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:30,168
vincent?

565
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:32,700
jiggle the toilet after.

566
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:39,034
vincent!

567
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,168
vincent.

568
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:16,101
moment of truth.

569
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,234
it's still
up to the judge,

570
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,168
but they're gonna
recommend 15 years

571
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,134
and $4.1 million.

572
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,034
you keep the home,

573
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:34,700
the 45k in equity from the
girls' variable life insurance,

574
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,734
and ginny's i.r.a. which
is worth about 110 grand.

575
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,934
- and?
- that's it.

576
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:45,767
or go to trial.

577
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,901
15 fucking years.

578
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:52,467
you're a young man.

579
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:55,433
in 15 years,
you'll be 67.

580
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,767
the golden years.

581
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:59,300
grandkids.

582
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:09,333
do i have to to do
the allocution?

583
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,834
you know the allocution
is always part of it,

584
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,934
practically
the whole point.

585
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,700
i'll take it.

586
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:33,700
that i.r.a. of ginny's--

587
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,667
she worked the tie counter
at wanamaker's.

588
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,734
that's where we met.

589
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,534
no mocha mix?

590
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,300
i was looking forward to
fresh blueberries this morning

591
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:12,934
but mom hasn't shopped.

592
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:20,201
what are you doing
hanging around here?

593
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,333
finn asked me into the city
to see a movie,

594
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,467
but i didn't want to go
and i told him he could go

595
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,001
if he wanted to
and he went.

596
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:32,101
- really?
- yeah, really.

597
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:33,934
don't give it
to me, okay?

598
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,534
i know.
i'm sorry.

599
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,101
it's just...

600
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:47,433
he doesn't
fucking get it.

601
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,600
i don't even know
what he's thinking lately.

602
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,367
he spends more time at
jeffrey's apartment than with me.

603
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:03,234
come on.

604
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:08,934
you know who's really good
to talk to about stuff?

605
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:10,967
your mother.

606
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:15,400
this whole year off together,
i've seen such a selfish side.

607
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:19,034
"i'll come back early." he said
that. he actually said that.

608
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,367
all right, well...

609
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,967
maybe he thought
you wanted him to go.

610
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:33,734
i mean, you did say it.

611
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:36,300
yeah, or maybe
subconsciously he's done.

612
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,734
<i>- we sleep together
at jeffrey's apartment,</i>

613
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:41,901
and finn sleeps
on the floor half the time

614
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:45,834
and i'm right there
for him.

615
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,734
okay, well, honey, when you're
living in sin with some guy,

616
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:51,567
- you can't expect--
- living in what?!

617
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:55,934
<i>jesus christ.</i>

618
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:59,634
you should talk to your
mother about this shit!

619
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:05,268
did you go see that guy at
the building department yet?

620
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,834
i was going to go on friday
when the schedules are looser.

621
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,700
well, don't.

622
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,534
fuck!

623
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,867
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

624
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:49,034
jesus.
are you all right?

625
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:51,034
what the fuck are you doing
parked out here?

626
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:53,801
excuse me?
i'm getting my mail.

627
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:56,300
<i>you're driving
like a maniac.</i>

628
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:59,767
my god. how come your
airbags didn't go off?

629
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,600
somebody took it out.
they sold it.

630
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,867
sold it? who would do
such a thing?

631
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:09,400
look, i'm really sorry.
i was in a rush.

632
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,134
so you admit
it was your fault.

633
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:12,934
yeah, absolutely.

634
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:16,400
let me get the damages
here and i'll be on my way.

635
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,001
mmm, we should file
a police report.

636
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,901
- you got a phone?
- no, seriously.

637
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:24,567
what do you say,
500 bucks?

638
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:27,134
look, i took
the worst of it.

639
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,134
and then you call your
insurance on me? no, thank you.

640
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,367
i'm not gonna
do that. six?

641
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,801
look, i don't want
an argument here.

642
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,767
my place is just
up the drive there.

643
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:39,067
we'll call the police.
they'll come right out.

644
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:45,400
<i>turn on your hazards.</i>

645
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,934
let me get
my registration.

646
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:23,001
motherfucker!

647
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:27,801
<i>fucking
cock-sucking cunt!</i>

648
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,834
fuck!

649
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:38,134
tony! hey!

650
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,967
i was just coming
to see you.

651
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,567
i'm on my way home.

652
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:43,433
it's just i haven't
heard from you.

653
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,433
uh, the fuckhead
from fuckland?

654
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,600
- yeah.
- it's gonna be too much effort.

655
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,134
well, john was really
counting on this.

656
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,134
and ginny needs the money,

657
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,967
for allegra,
for the family.

658
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:03,967
what?

659
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,567
he changed the terms.

660
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,934
what, a bigger piece
for his fat mouth?

661
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:17,300
no, smaller,
actually.

662
00:44:17,367 --> 00:44:19,534
but it's the house.

663
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:23,433
he wants you to unload it
to his sister

664
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,967
at a reduced price.

665
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:27,667
half, actually.

666
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,300
but the new orleans
thing--

667
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,600
they'll knock 2% off
his finder's fee

668
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:36,067
and he'll make sure
those pricks sell.

669
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:41,801
i guess beggars
can't be choosers.

670
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,268
and the worst part is

671
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,367
i gotta sell the idea
to ginny somehow.

672
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:53,734
gab took me to her moroccan tile place.

673
00:44:53,801 --> 00:44:55,734
by the way-- i don't
wanna pester you--

674
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:55,834
did sil make
a visit?

675
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:00,367
yeah, i meant
to tell you.

676
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:02,500
he didn't have any luck
with that inspector.

677
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:04,667
really? you're kidding.

678
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:08,734
no. sorry about that.

679
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:10,567
did he bring him a gift?

680
00:45:10,634 --> 00:45:12,268
cash.

681
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,567
so how hard
did he lean on the guy?

682
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:18,801
carm, sil knows
his business.

683
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:21,367
look, i know
you're disappointed, but--

684
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:23,034
i just gotta
put this out there--

685
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:25,567
just sell it.
you'll get a good price.

686
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:27,734
30% return
on your investment.

687
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:31,867
so that's it?
you-- you just give up?

688
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,700
i don't think i ever
heard that before.

689
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:37,001
look, the guy said no.

690
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,067
how far do you wanna
push this thing?

691
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:46,101
oh, those sons
of bitches.

692
00:45:46,168 --> 00:45:49,867
all my planning
for a fucking year!

693
00:45:49,934 --> 00:45:53,168
and they let people build
those fucking monstrosities!

694
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:04,367
you wanna go out to dinner
tonight at least?

695
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:08,034
why not put
a runner here

696
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:11,634
or a large diameter
round oriental?

697
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,500
it could cut down on
the echo and warm it up.

698
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:17,567
well, i'd rather we spend
on what we have to right now.

699
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:19,467
window treatments.

700
00:46:19,534 --> 00:46:22,801
<i>mr. sacrimoni,
during the time period</i>

701
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:26,400
<i>beginning approximately
january 1, 1996,</i>

702
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:31,367
through today, were you
employed by or associated with

703
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:35,201
the new york faction of an organized
crime family of la cosa nostra?

704
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,500
yes.

705
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:43,201
<i>sacrimoni
allocuted in federal court,</i>

706
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:46,634
<i>admitting at least a 10-year
connection with la cosa nostra.</i>

707
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,168
fucking nauseating!

708
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:51,667
could have been worse.
he could have flipped.

709
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:53,300
are you fucking
kidding me?

710
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:56,901
you don't ever admit the
existence of this thing. ever.

711
00:46:56,967 --> 00:46:58,700
he should have stood
trial like a man.

712
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:01,400
i did 20 fucking years.

713
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:12,500
what?

714
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,867
johnny sack pleaded guilty.

715
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,567
<i>it was just on the radio.</i>

716
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:21,867
he got 15 years.

717
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,367
fuck!

718
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:35,901
hey! hold on.

719
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:37,467
wait a fucking minute.

720
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:39,467
- are you the owner of this vehicle?
- yeah.

721
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:42,500
i got a spot in the garage. i
went in for a half an hour, tops.

722
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,134
douche bags make
that a red zone?

723
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:47,801
this is a seizure order for all
assets belonging to john sacrimoni.

724
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:50,300
no no. i bought it
from his wife.

725
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,734
well, if she sold it, she violated
a court order freezing his assets.

726
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:57,934
of course she sold it. i paid
her fucking 25 grand cash.

727
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,300
it's going to be auctioned
in may up in parsippany.

728
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,101
you like it so much,
buy it again.

729
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:04,967
this is fucking insane, you
cock-sucking motherfucker!

730
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:08,734
keep talking like that. i'm gonna
get a truck out here for you.

731
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,634
to think that piece of
shit was my friend once.

732
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,333
i hope he dies in there.

733
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,201
you know
how this looks?

734
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:22,534
i wish i was on the courthouse
steps to throw acid in his face,

735
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,700
just to distance
myself.

736
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,234
excuse me, tony.

737
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,934
i've been meaning to ask
you-- i was just wondering

738
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:37,467
about the sacrimoni place.

739
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:39,134
what about it?

740
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:41,934
well, now that
mr. sacrimoni is guilty,

741
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,333
do you think i could maybe
take him off my route?

742
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:48,700
what the fuck
did you just say, sal?

743
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,333
i don't know.

744
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,967
the fucking lawnmower man
just said john was guilty, t.

745
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:58,834
<i>he pled guilty, sal.
okay?</i>

746
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:00,234
yeah, okay.

747
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,234
with this government,
no fucking trial.

748
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,967
maybe they stuck tasers
on his balls

749
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:07,234
and beat him mercilessly
with a rubber hose.

750
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,067
- ever think of that?
- no.

751
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:12,034
but of course,
it makes sense.

752
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:15,333
don't besmirch
the man, sal.

753
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,767
so about the yard--

754
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:20,201
do you believe
this fucking guy?

755
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,067
you're done with that.

756
00:49:26,134 --> 00:49:29,001
