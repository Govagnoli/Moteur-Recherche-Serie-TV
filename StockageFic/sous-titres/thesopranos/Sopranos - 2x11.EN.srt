1
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:30,583
Stop!

2
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,584
Stop!

3
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,086
What are you doing?

4
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,088
What are you doing
, you closing me up?

5
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:40,093
Mister, where do you
suppose you are going?

6
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,594
Stop!

7
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,095
Stop!

8
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,097
I demand you stop!

9
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,600
I demand you come back here
this instant!

10
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,604
This instant, you motherfucker!
You motherfucker!

11
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,107
Motherfucker!

12
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,608
Motherfucker!

13
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,611
Yeah.

14
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,113
Zanone brothers.

15
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,116
This fuckin'
series, huh?

16
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,118
Your driver,
he comes here,

17
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,621
he dumps the garbage
all over the place!

18
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,622
He did, huh?

19
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,624
What "he did"?

20
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,625
How about
those nets, huh?

21
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,127
You come
get it know!

22
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,128
Get what, sir?

23
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,131
The goddamn,
goddamn garbage.

24
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,633
We thought you
wanted it back.

25
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,634
What?

26
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,636
What?

27
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,637
The raghead
from the deli.

28
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,140
Hello,
where are you?

29
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,643
You called yesterday
to complain?

30
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,146
That's our policy,
it's written on our trucks.

31
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,148
Double your garbage back
if you're not satisfied.

32
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:43,156
I complain because you
didn't make full pickups
on 12, 16, 20th.

33
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,658
And then i get
charged double for it!

34
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,161
Right, we had to
come out twice.

35
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,665
You charge me double
for pickups you miss?

36
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,668
My dispatcher asked you
if you're not satisfied

37
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,171
did you want
your garbage back?

38
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,173
Of course i don't
want garbage back.

39
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,675
Then you're satisfied.

40
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,678
You are speaking
shit to me.

41
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:10,183
We'll try to send
a truck out tomorrow.

42
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,690
What are we talking,
eight to ten?

43
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,697
For godsake alan, i can plea
him out of three to five.

44
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,701
Alright, talk to mike gendler,
see what he says.

45
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,703
What's all this?

46
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:35,208
You looked thirsty
last time i saw you.

47
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:41,714
Oh yeah, you know what?
I knew i left this someplace.

48
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,715
New?

49
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,217
Ah you know,
keeping busy.

50
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,219
Carmela, the kids?

51
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,220
Good.

52
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,221
You know,
school shit.

53
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,223
You bet that
game last night?

54
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,224
Yeah.

55
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:55,228
What do you think
i need this for?

56
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,731
So what do i
owe you, counselor?

57
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,234
You'll pay me when i actually
have to do something.

58
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,236
Let's hope that fuckin' day
never comes, right?

59
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,238
It almost did
very recently.

60
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,741
Here we go, the neil mink
lecture series.

61
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,744
We'll isn't it fair to say
we were staring into the abyss?

62
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,247
A very close call, that brush
with a murder beef.

63
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,250
I told you
i was home alone.

64
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,252
You and macaulay culkin.

65
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,755
Except that neither one
of you would have been alone.

66
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,758
Champagne's nice.

67
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,760
But you want
to give me a real gift?

68
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,763
Insulate yourself
from these shenanigans.

69
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,764
I told you
once already.

70
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,266
I do.

71
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,267
I am.

72
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,268
What the fuck
you want from me?

73
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,770
Use one of the businesses
we've got you in,

74
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,773
for something besides
showing income on a tax return.

75
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,276
Spend time
at garden state rendering.

76
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,779
Oh please, you know what
boiling fat smells like?

77
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,282
You have an office
at barone sanitation.

78
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,286
Get your ass out of that
strip club and go there.

79
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,788
Alright, i hear you.

80
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,790
The feds are
a business, anthony.

81
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,793
Millions of tax dollars
invested in watching your ass.

82
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,796
Sooner or late
r just like you,

83
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,799
they're gonna want a return
on that investment.

84
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,303
Mother of fucking mercy.

85
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,805
What'd you take
a sledge hammer to my balls?

86
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,808
That's just the incision
where i inserted the stent.

87
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,810
You're gonna feel
a little tenderness.

88
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,312
Okay, almost there.

89
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,313
Easy.

90
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,316
You should use
the bedpan next time.

91
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,318
I'm not a cat.

92
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,319
I don't shit in a box.

93
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,321
You have to watch
your heart.

94
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,822
My heart's fine.

95
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,825
When i get out of here
we're going to a discotheque,

96
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,826
you and me.

97
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,830
Discotheque.

98
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,834
What's so funny?

99
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:42,835
Mr. Soprano.

100
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,837
I'm michael mcluhan from
the u. S. Marshall service.

101
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,842
Here to reattach
your electronic bracelet.

102
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,844
They you give you
the important jobs, huh?

103
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,347
Excuse me.

104
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,848
Your name's really
mcluhan?

105
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,849
Right.

106
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,353
So that makes you
marshal mcluhan.

107
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,357
That's right.

108
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:04,857
What?

109
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,859
What's the fucking joke?

110
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,364
Alright, you may feel
pressure in your chest.

111
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,866
That'll go away
as the blood flow
to heart increases.

112
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,369
Just stay in bed,
plenty of fluids.

113
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,371
Get you home tomorrow.

114
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,874
Lucky fucking me.

115
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,381
Sandwich
or something?

116
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,384
Did you hear me with my balls,
who can fucking eat?

117
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,900
...new york's only
classic rock station, q104.

118
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,412
What are you
looking at?

119
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,414
Nothing.

120
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,417
Just looking
out the window.

121
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,919
Gettin'
my eyebrows done.

122
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,984
Remember...

123
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,487
one mouth, two ears.

124
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,990
Listen
to each other.

125
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,993
I'll see you next week.

126
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,996
Okay.

127
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:28,060
So, what's up?

128
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,564
I don't know,
i'm...

129
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,566
i'm bored
or something.

130
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,068
I don't want
to come here no more.

131
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,571
Well...

132
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:44,076
not the first time
we've heard you say that.

133
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,583
No offense
but let's face it,

134
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,585
this is starting to feel
like a waste of time.

135
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,586
I'm sure for
the both of us.

136
00:10:54,086 --> 00:11:01,594
I don't feel that way.

137
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,596
Like the other day
i'm watching this movie

138
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:08,601
with brad pitt and
that blonde, gweneth paltrow.

139
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,102
"Sliding doors"?

140
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,604
Fuck no,"seven".

141
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,107
It's a good movie,
and i never seen it before.

142
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:20,112
But halfway through it,
i'm thinking, this is bullshit.

143
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,615
A waste of my fucking time.

144
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,617
Why do i give a shit
who the killer is?

145
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,120
What difference
is that information
gonna make in my life?

146
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,122
Very true.

147
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,624
So i shut it off.

148
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,626
Good for you.

149
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,629
What did you
do instead?

150
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:43,135
I went out in the yard
and burned ants
with a magnifying glass.

151
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:49,642
A little sense
of humor here.

152
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,143
What's the matter?

153
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,646
You still in mourning over
the coming of managed care?

154
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,148
Go on.

155
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,149
What's the point?

156
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,152
You go to italy,
you lift some weights,

157
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,153
you watch a movie.

158
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,157
It's all a series of
distractions'til you die.

159
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,159
I hear
depression talking.

160
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,662
Yeah well, i'm not
up on my dosage.

161
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,664
Medication
, medication,

162
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,165
medication, what do i
got to show for it?

163
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,668
Who knows where you'd be
without the medication?

164
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:23,175
Anyway, some people take
pleasure in the simple
doing of things.

165
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,178
Yeah well, the things i
take pleasure in, i can't do.

166
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,684
Currently trying
to change my business profile,

167
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,185
if you kno
w what i mean.

168
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:37,189
So it's all about
your legal problems.

169
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,713
I'm gonna
get the car.

170
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,715
Don't disappear,
meet me out front.

171
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,217
Corrado?

172
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,720
I thought that was you.

173
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,222
Catherine...
romano.

174
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,225
Catherine.

175
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,729
Mr. Soprano, you have
to stay in a wheelchair
until you leave the building.

176
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,230
Hospital rules.

177
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,231
So call a cop.

178
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,734
A little procedure,

179
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,736
you'd think that they'd
worry about the sick people.

180
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,738
It's all about
the insurance.

181
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,740
You remember my chuckie?

182
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,742
Little chuckie,

183
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,746
you drove the bike
for the butchers.

184
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,248
I got to call karen, ma.

185
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:40,252
He's a cop now
, like his father.

186
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,253
A detective.

187
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,255
He's a good egg, your lou,

188
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:48,761
a real straight shooter,
he had a lot of class.

189
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,262
Hodgkin's, no?

190
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,764
It's been
almost 15 years.

191
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,265
That long?

192
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,770
The week
the shuttle exploded.

193
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,272
The pension helps.

194
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,273
The grandchildren.

195
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,276
You look good, corrado.

196
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,277
You healthy?

197
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,279
A little heart trouble,
nothing much.

198
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,283
You broke your ankle?

199
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:16,288
Bunions.

200
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,791
You still
in belleville?

201
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,794
Same house,
watsessing avenue.

202
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,798
I'm right on ampere parkwa
y near our beloved alma mater.

203
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,301
Maybe we could
have coffee.

204
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,302
Catch up.

205
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,304
There's an ihop
by the dry cleaners.

206
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,308
The doctor says i'm not
supposed to leave the house.

207
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:42,314
Too much stress.

208
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,315
Sir.

209
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,318
The chair.

210
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,854
What the fuck, i don't
show up for eight years,

211
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,856
all of a sudden you turn
my office into a storeroom?

212
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,860
No, i'm gonna get
this shit cleaned right out.

213
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,361
Connie!

214
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,863
Connie!

215
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,366
This is mr. Soprano.

216
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,868
Tony.

217
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,869
How ya doing?

218
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,370
Connie desapio.

219
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,873
What happened
to diane?

220
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,376
A little self indulgent when
it came to office supplies.

221
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,379
Connie, mr. Soprano's
been out the in field,

222
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,882
but he's gonna be spending
some time with us here at hq.

223
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,885
So let's get ralphie
in here and danny too.

224
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,387
And let's move these
boxes out, the books.

225
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,388
What should
i do with them?

226
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,891
I don't know,
make room.

227
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,894
I'll put them
by the copy machine.

228
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,900
Nice rack.

229
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,402
Born- again christian.

230
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,404
Oh yeah?

231
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,407
Listen, while
i have you here,

232
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,909
we may have
a little problem.

233
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,910
Richie aprile.

234
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,912
Yeah i know,
i heard.

235
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,413
He tipped a truck
at a deli in nutley.

236
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,414
That fucking guy.

237
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:23,916
But that's not it.

238
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,919
One of zanone's drivers,
the illustrated man.

239
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,922
Richie's got him
running an operation,

240
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,924
selling blow
along the routes.

241
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,427
Now the department of sanitation
i can handle, tony.

242
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,931
But if the d. E. A. Gets involved
we're gonna lose our 901.

243
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,935
Sonofa- fuckin'- bitch.

244
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,938
I'm sorry, i don't like
to break your balls.

245
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,942
You know that piece of shit's
gonna be my brother in law?

246
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,945
Nice, huh?

247
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,446
The rico act, elliot.

248
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,450
We sat there and we talked
about the fucking rico act.

249
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,954
You treat
different patients.

250
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,456
Your base
of knowledge expands.

251
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:08,961
Two years ago i thought
rico was a relative of his.

252
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,474
Cards- on- the- table time.

253
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,976
How's the drinking?

254
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,978
I don't know.

255
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,480
Worse, i guess.

256
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,984
Are you an alcoholic?

257
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,993
I am drinking
in between sessions.

258
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,996
That's very serious.

259
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,998
Just on the days
that i see him.

260
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,001
I can't take it.

261
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,503
Finally, thank you.

262
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,007
Are you taking steps
to seriously end it?

263
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,509
He wanted to end it.

264
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,012
He said last time
he wanted to stop coming.

265
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,513
But i talked
him out of it.

266
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,015
Why?

267
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,018
If i was at sloan and
he had a pituitary tumor,

268
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:13,025
would i stop
him from coming?

269
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,528
Elliot, it's like that thing
with watching a train wreck.

270
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:21,533
I'm afraid and repulsed
by what he might tell me.

271
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:26,538
But somehow i can't stop myself
from wanting to hear it.

272
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:41,553
Okay.

273
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,554
All set.

274
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,557
It'll ramp up
to eight pounds per cubic inch.

275
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,559
Keep your airway open
when you're sleeping.

276
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,561
I don't snore.

277
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,063
Ah, don't be embarrassed.

278
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,065
Obstructive sleep apnea
is serious.

279
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,068
Every time your airway
closes down and you wake up
fighting for breath,

280
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,071
it puts tremendous strain
on your heart.

281
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,573
Dr. Schreck is absolutely right
in prescribing this for you.

282
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,575
Makes me look
like a sick man.

283
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,077
You're not sick.

284
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,081
But testing shows rem- wise,
you have 40 arousals per hour.

285
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,084
More since i met you.

286
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,088
Such a thing to say.

287
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:21,093
Arousals mean a change
in your stages in your sleep.

288
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,595
You are such a flirt.

289
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,099
I'll stop by tomorrow okay?
See how you did.

290
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,600
Be counting the beats.

291
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,104
Who's that?

292
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,106
Judge crater,
how should i know?

293
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,607
The one who ordere
d the house arrest?

294
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,110
Answer the door,
it's a goddamn expression.

295
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:45,117
I'm gonna go
wash my hands.

296
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,619
Hello, i'm catherine,
a friend of corrado's.

297
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:55,127
Fuck me.

298
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,629
Oh catherine,
what a surprise.

299
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,132
I would've called,
you're unlisted.

300
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,634
I brought manicott'.

301
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,137
How's your foot?

302
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,638
It's better, thanks.

303
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,640
Heart?

304
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,143
Better.

305
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,146
Is this a bad time
for a visit?

306
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,148
Actually, the nurse
just got here.

307
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,650
We were about to
have my examination.

308
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,654
Oh well,
maybe friday then.

309
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:29,661
I volunteer at the bingo
since louis past.

310
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,662
Well...

311
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,165
enjoy the manicott'.

312
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:38,170
Thank you,
i will.

313
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,172
You're awful.

314
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,675
Neighbor lady,
she went to school
with my older brother.

315
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:48,180
I'll see ya tomorrow.

316
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,190
What did you send
that lady away for?

317
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,691
I thought you were bored.

318
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,692
Talking to that
dreadnought would help?

319
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,195
She seems alright.

320
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,197
What the hell would
we have in common?

321
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:11,703
Bunion, you know how
i feel about feet.

322
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,213
Look at this.

323
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,714
You believe this one
with the cleavage?

324
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,217
Finger food is better
than last year.

325
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,220
It's not the landfill,
the problem is the limit.

326
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,722
Right know we're
at two grand a day,

327
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,725
but with dos breaking our ball
i got to fuck with ins and outs.

328
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,228
Oh yeah, what's that?

329
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,730
The paperwork,
you know?

330
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,232
List the gross tonnage.

331
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,234
I got to file it
in triplicate every day.

332
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:47,739
Right.

333
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,740
How ya doing?

334
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,742
Is that your wife,
dickie?

335
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,245
Yeah, c'mon,
i'll introduce you.

336
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,249
I'm getting
engaged myself.

337
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,750
Hey some place, huh?

338
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,752
That landscaping
is gorgeous.

339
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:04,256
Janice, you're
completely transformed.

340
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,757
What can i say?

341
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,260
You look good, janice.

342
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,262
You look
pretty good, janice.

343
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,764
You are a giant asshole,
you know?

344
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,266
C'mon.

345
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,267
...nirvana.

346
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,770
You got a minute?

347
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,773
Jesus christ,
let me get a drink.

348
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,275
Naw, we'll grab
a waiter, c'mon.

349
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,777
I'll see you.

350
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,279
Excuse me ladies.

351
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,780
Have you met
helen barone?

352
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,282
Hi, jan soprano.

353
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,783
Nice to meet you.

354
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:35,287
Nice to meet you.

355
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,290
Got any blow?

356
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,291
What?

357
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,792
Blow, you know coke.

358
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,795
What, you don't
keep it on you?

359
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,297
I got to go
to the deli in nutley?

360
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,798
Tony.

361
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,799
You don't sell that shit
along those routes,

362
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,800
you understand me?

363
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,801
I'm working
with junior on this.

364
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,803
I don't give a shit
if you're working with walmart,

365
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,804
knock it the fuck off.

366
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,307
Trying to earn here,
we're saving for a house.

367
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,309
You got enough in your plate
just picking up garbage.

368
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,811
Not if you and
that fucking association,

369
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,813
and that cocksucker barone
don't let me expand.

370
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,316
Are you fucking
stoonad or what?

371
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,817
After five years.

372
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,819
The cops are finally
leaving garbage alone.

373
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,322
A drug bust on one of
those routes is different story,

374
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,824
you got the fbi, the d. E. A. ,
those fucking pricks

375
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,826
are gonna be breathing
down our necks again.

376
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,828
It's only coke.

377
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,830
What is the big deal?

378
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,831
You and my uncle,

379
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,334
you want to deal drugs,
that's your business.

380
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,337
You do it on
association garbage routes,
it's my fucking business.

381
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:30,842
It stops today,
you got it?

382
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,344
Don't give me your
fucking manson lamps,

383
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,845
just fucking stop.

384
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,848
Another thing, don't tip
a truck on a problem customer.

385
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,353
I fucking hate the way
you make me fucking ride you.

386
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,856
Now get the fuck
out of here.

387
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,381
...municipality
went private,

388
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,383
so now we're
bidding on a landfill
down in west virginia.

389
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,386
I started reading
the epa's new guidelines,

390
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,887
on curbside recycling.

391
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,390
I'm telling you,
listen, i'm telling you.

392
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,391
Just liste
n to me, guys.

393
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,893
I got it right through
the transfer station.

394
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,896
And listen to this, it
scaled out at nearly 3, 000 tons.

395
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:29,401
3, 000 tons.

396
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,403
...talking about instituting
a yard waste ban,

397
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:36,408
in half the states
on the eastern seaboard.

398
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh.

399
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,922
Oh my god, tony.

400
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,424
Call an ambulance.

401
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,926
Jesus christ.

402
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:55,927
Turn him over,
carmela.

403
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,928
Tony.

404
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,933
Watch his head
, watch his head.

405
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,935
The pills,
the analysis.

406
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,438
You pay her a fortune,
what is she doing for you?

407
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:07,939
Will you leave me
the fuck alone?

408
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,441
If it was a man
you'd ring his neck.

409
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,444
I got a fucking rash now,
last a week or two.

410
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,945
Leave me alone.

411
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:14,946
Putting a wing
on her house.

412
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,449
Mr. Soprano.

413
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,951
I have your results.

414
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,453
Yeah.

415
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,455
Just preliminary, but as far
as i can tell, it's...

416
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,956
nothing physical, right?

417
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,460
For chrissake,
i just passed out,
if it's nothing physical,

418
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,961
then what the fuck
is wrong with me?

419
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,464
I would think
you'd be relieved.

420
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,466
I'll be relieved when
somebody puts their finger on

421
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,468
whatever the fuck it is
that's wrong with me.

422
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,970
I wish it was physical,
so i can have it
ripped the fuck out.

423
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,973
I'm sorry, it's just
very frustrating,

424
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,475
i know you're only
trying to help.

425
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:48,980
You know, losing
some weight wouldn't hurt.

426
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:58,990
Shit.

427
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,513
Did you get
the lady fingers?

428
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,014
Nah, they were out.

429
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,016
I got crumbcake,
the entenmann's.

430
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:29,521
Disposal again?
Leave it,

431
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,023
i told you, i gotta
get the flange.

432
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,024
When, st. Smithen's day?

433
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,528
Who was at
the door before?

434
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,530
That lady from
the other day.

435
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,532
Catherine?

436
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,033
The one with
the manicott'.

437
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,535
I said you
were sleeping.

438
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:48,039
Why didn't
you wake me?

439
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,543
Roberta sanfilippo
didn't call back, did she?

440
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,545
I got to be honest,
junior,

441
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,047
when i ran into her at
fountains of wayne that time,

442
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:01,052
she was very cold.

443
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,554
What was she buying?

444
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,057
Fountain,
kid pissing.

445
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,559
Must've bought a house.

446
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,061
Great ass.

447
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,063
Jesus.

448
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,566
Talk too much, but
what a piece she was.

449
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,068
And game as they come.

450
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,072
Listen, i'm gonna go.

451
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,575
Got to take
my kid to karate.

452
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,584
No i read it, i did.

453
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,586
That's it,
that's the way of life.

454
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,088
But in "angela's ashes" you
were laughing with him at least.

455
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,592
Every paycheck
squandered on alcohol.

456
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,594
Please, you know
the irish and their liquor.

457
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,597
The "weakness"
he calls it, right?

458
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:49,100
How he can make such
heartache funny is beyond me.

459
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,102
My god,
with that father?

460
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,104
It's true, we don't know
what poverty is in this country.

461
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,607
Did you feel in this one
the mother came off
a little nicer?

462
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,108
It's all
in the writing.

463
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,110
It's like he makes
certain choices about

464
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,112
how he is going
to portray people.

465
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,114
Like the nuns
in that convent.

466
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,116
Please, catholic school here
wasn't any better.

467
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,618
He used to be
a school teacher, you know.

468
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,619
Some school
in manhattan.

469
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,123
My god, the way
he treated that wife.

470
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,627
She'd be better off
if he beat her.

471
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:20,632
Hello.

472
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,133
Yeah t, it's me.

473
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,134
Hey.

474
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,637
Listen, that
container came in.

475
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,139
From the other side.

476
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,142
Supposed to
go to that guy...

477
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,144
great,
about fucking time.

478
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,647
It's better than she said,
it's un- fuckin'- believable.

479
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,149
It's all original
world war ii shit.

480
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,151
You're fucking
kidding me.

481
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,152
I know nothing!

482
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,654
Nothing!

483
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:47,158
I'm looking at the fucking
history channel here.

484
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,660
You got to
come down here.

485
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,161
You'll love this stuff.

486
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,163
Nah.

487
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,666
We got eisenhower's
dinnerware

488
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,668
from allied headquarters
in london.

489
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:01,172
We got a couple
of herman goerings personal
pearl handled lugers,

490
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,174
and get this...

491
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,177
we got the jeep that patto
n drove around in, in sicily.

492
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,180
We have ways of dealing
with you mr. Soprano!

493
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,182
Aaaah!

494
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,684
Put that thing down.

495
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,685
Put that down,
it's expensive.

496
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,186
No, i better
listen to the lawyer.

497
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,187
Are you sure?

498
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,689
Yeah.

499
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,190
You guys go ahead
without me.

500
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,193
Alright,
talk to you later.

501
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,695
Alright.

502
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,197
How'bout a mystery?

503
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,199
The mystery
is that rosalie read...

504
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,705
what? I liked it.

505
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,208
What about something like
"cider house rules"?

506
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,711
Yeah, but not so sad.

507
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,721
So, how's that
english class going?

508
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,724
Comparative literature,
whatever.

509
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,726
Comp lit
was last semester.

510
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:59,731
I told you i'm taking lacan,
deconstructive theory.

511
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:04,235
Ooh, deconstructivist,
excuse me.

512
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,744
Incredible,
they could care less.

513
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:17,749
This is delicious.

514
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,251
And your grandfather
a contractor.

515
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,756
Deconstructivism.

516
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,757
Ah.

517
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,259
My droll mom.

518
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:33,264
Excuse me, could you
move your cigarette?

519
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,266
Pardon me?

520
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,268
It's blowing
into my son's face.

521
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,770
Thank you.

522
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,271
We're allowed to smoke.

523
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:44,275
Unfortunately an area where
new jersey is woefully behind,

524
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,277
but could you move it?

525
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,779
Mom, it's no big deal.

526
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,781
It's no big deal
to move it either.

527
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,282
I don't think so.

528
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,784
I'm sorry?

529
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,785
I'm not
gonna move it.

530
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,286
Why not?

531
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,288
Because you're very rude.

532
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,291
I said excuse me,
quite clearly.

533
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,793
Your tone.

534
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,795
It's a health hazard,
move it.

535
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,296
No.

536
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,298
I'm a physician,

537
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,801
do you know what you're
doing to the rest of us?

538
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,804
My son has taken the trouble
in his own life,

539
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,806
to live in
a smoke- free dorm.

540
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,808
My salutations.

541
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,809
Mom.

542
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,811
This isn't
a smoke- free restaurant.

543
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,815
Look, this is silly, could you
just move the fucking thing?

544
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,316
Not when you
talk like that.

545
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,819
Just move
the cigarette, please?

546
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,820
No.

547
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,321
No?

548
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,322
No.

549
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,824
Mom!

550
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,825
Well?

551
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,826
You bitch.

552
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,827
She must be drunk.

553
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,829
Excuse me,
what did you say?

554
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,330
Ma'am, c'mon.

555
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,332
I saw what happened
let's just, shall we?

556
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,834
Will you
call the police?

557
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,836
I don't think that's warranted,
but ma'am--

558
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,337
oh no, please,
call the police,

559
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,840
because i'm not the one
with a lethal weapon here.

560
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,844
Ma'am, i'd like
you to leave.

561
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,854
C'mon jason.

562
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,355
I'm outta here.

563
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:21,873
Hello.

564
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:22,874
In here.

565
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,375
Uncle jun'?

566
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:29,380
In here,
the kitchen!

567
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,882
Where you been?

568
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,384
I've been calling you
all afternoon.

569
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,887
My fucking hand
is stuck down the drain.

570
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,389
And i can't reach
the fucking phone.

571
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,894
Good thing i'm nice,
'cause i can start tickling you.

572
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,395
Jesus christ.

573
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,397
How long you
been standing there?

574
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,398
Six hours!

575
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,401
Now get the fucking detergent
and lubricate my wrist.

576
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:55,907
Motherfuckin'
sonofabitch.

577
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,909
I thought
you were bobby.

578
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,911
Why didn't you
just call a plumber?

579
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,413
With what,
my fucking toes?

580
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,415
Relax.

581
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,417
Relax.

582
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,919
Let it go limp.

583
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,922
Limp, you're flexing!

584
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,423
Let it go limp.

585
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,425
Limp.

586
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,928
That's it,
you're flexing.

587
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,430
Limp, that's it
simmer down.

588
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,932
Simmer down.

589
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,934
Easy.

590
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,937
Oh, jesus
fucking christ.

591
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,940
Oh, this fucking house.

592
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,441
I'm dying here.

593
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,945
Just take
it easy, okay?

594
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,452
You're coming to
the engagement party
at least, right?

595
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,954
We'll special
permission.

596
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,957
I'll make
some coffee.

597
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,460
I don't give a shit
if you do or you don't.

598
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,971
It's light.

599
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,973
You got your nephew
to thank for that.

600
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,474
What do you mean?

601
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,478
I ran into him the other day
at the garbage man's ball,

602
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,980
whatever
the fuck it is.

603
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,484
He said we can't sell coke
on the route anymore.

604
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,485
What?

605
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,486
That's what he said.

606
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,488
I guess nobody
should eat, but him.

607
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,991
You should have seen him
in the golf outfit,

608
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,993
he looked like
wallace beery.

609
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,997
Where does he
get the effrontery?

610
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,498
He's the boss.

611
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,002
Whether he has
grand mals or not.

612
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,503
And this shit
is okay with you?

613
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,006
I know how much
you love him, jr.

614
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:44,015
I don't want to say
anything disparaging.

615
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,517
You know how it is
, they're bureaucrats,

616
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,019
they nit, they pick.

617
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,021
It's passive- aggressive,
pure and simple.

618
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,023
They have their lives,
themselves.

619
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,025
I know, i know,
they're not out in the field.

620
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,028
What can i do
? it's mandatory.

621
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,030
Okay, hold on.

622
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,034
Connie, get me the paperwork
on the separation requirements

623
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,035
for new jersey.

624
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,536
Where is it?

625
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:12,543
I don't know, i put them
with the recycling files.

626
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,544
Can i get
you something?

627
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,547
Coffee?

628
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,548
No.

629
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,549
No, i'm alright.

630
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,553
I'll be going home soon.

631
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,066
I embarrassed my son.

632
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,568
How's he supposed
to know,

633
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,571
where this type
of behavior is coming from?

634
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:44,075
Think it's time you considered
a 12- step program?

635
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,577
I'm not an
alcoholic, elliot.

636
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:51,082
Besides i have you, this.

637
00:35:51,082 --> 00:36:00,091
Therapy isn't a substitute,
you know that.

638
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:04,595
I won't drink
with my son anymore.

639
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,598
We're bargaining now?

640
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,601
I'll go
to a meeting.

641
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,109
I'm also
prescribing luvox.

642
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,610
Luvox?

643
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,613
Is for ocd.

644
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,615
Among other things,

645
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,617
i've had success
with it treating other
compulsions as well.

646
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,119
Compulsions?
Elliot, c'mon.

647
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,121
You're patient,
jennifer,

648
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,124
your inability to bring
the therapy to a conclusion.

649
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:39,130
Elliot, i honestly believe
that he's not ready.

650
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,631
Refer him
to another doctor.

651
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,633
You really think
that i'm--

652
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,635
obsessed?

653
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:59,650
Luvox.

654
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,655
Jesus christ.

655
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,158
That coke provides
a nice income stream.

656
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,660
Do you have any ideas
the bills i got?

657
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,163
Just keep it away
from the garbage routes.

658
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,665
The lawyers, the doctors,
the prescriptions,

659
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,667
a double sawbuck
for a plastic pillow,

660
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,169
just so i can
sit comfortably.

661
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,671
Why don't you just sit on that
nice pile of cash you got?

662
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,175
My finances are nobody's
goddamn business.

663
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,676
And that garbage
is my business.

664
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,679
I don't want you and that
other shit- bird fucking it up.

665
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,181
Your business.

666
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:36,187
Yeah, why don't you get that
true that bald dome of yours?

667
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,189
Why does everything
have to be so difficult?

668
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,693
You know, back in the'50s
we worked together.

669
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:46,697
Even rival families settled
their differences, amicably.

670
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,700
Oh yeah, i remember that picture
of albert anastasia lying there

671
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,202
all amicable
on the barbershop floor.

672
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:58,209
There were exceptions,
i'm just saying.

673
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,710
Oh i'm sorry,
should i come back?

674
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,212
It's alright.

675
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,214
We're done here.

676
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,717
Bad night
last night, huh?

677
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,720
Let's see if we can't
get you a more comfortable
fit on this mask.

678
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,723
That little cupcake,
she never came back.

679
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,726
The one with the mask.

680
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,228
Tracey?

681
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,731
Sent her a bottle
of shalimar.

682
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:26,237
She never mentioned it.

683
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,739
You should
be happy at least,

684
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,241
the stent was
a complete success.

685
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,744
Let's not tempt fate
by taxing the heart.

686
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:37,248
How many migs
you shoot down last week?

687
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,763
Where's that
fucking manicott'?

688
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,266
It's gone.

689
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,268
Half a fucking
tray in there!

690
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,769
I was hungry.

691
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,272
Sonofabitch.

692
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,774
It's not my fault
you got your hand caught.

693
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,277
Why do you have
to be so nasty?

694
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,797
Directory assistant,
what listing?

695
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:30,301
Belleville, i need a number
for a catherine romano.

696
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,803
Thank you,
for what city?

697
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,306
Cocksucker, belleville!

698
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:42,313
Please hold
for an operator.

699
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,815
Any allergies,
shellfish, perhaps?

700
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,317
No, i eat shrimp
all the time.

701
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,321
Msg? Any change
in medication?

702
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,822
No.

703
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,326
A new laundry detergent,
something like that?

704
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,328
I don't know,
i don't think so.

705
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,832
Have you been under
any undue stress lately?

706
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,334
Is that the only word
you people know?

707
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,337
Sometimes pressure can result
in contact dermatitis.

708
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,838
Oh is that what
that is?

709
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,340
See know i knew
that was bad.

710
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,841
It means rash.

711
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:14,845
Look at it,
it's bleeding, for chrissake.

712
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,347
You've been
scratching it.

713
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:20,351
You said you work at
a sanitation transfer station.

714
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,355
Dollars to donuts,
you're being exposed t
o an irritant in the air.

715
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,856
I sit in an office.

716
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,860
I'll write you a scrip
for cortisone cream.

717
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:36,367
Dr. Cusamano says you've
been seeing a psychotherapist.

718
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,370
So?

719
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:48,379
I suggest you talk about
stress management with him.

720
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,900
To tell the truth,

721
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,902
i was surprised
to hear from you.

722
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,906
I was sorry we
missed our visit.

723
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,908
I had the feeling
you weren't interested.

724
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,410
No.

725
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,911
No.

726
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,414
I stopped by the other day
but i guess you were out.

727
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,915
It was odd.

728
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:29,920
I thought i heard
you hollering.

729
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,921
Funny how life works.

730
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,923
The different paths.

731
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,927
Yeah.

732
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,930
All leading
to the cemetery.

733
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,441
Can i ask you
something, corrado?

734
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,943
Was my lou ever...

735
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:56,447
you know,
on the take?

736
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,449
No, of course not.

737
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,952
Why would you ask
such a thing?

738
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,456
Sometimes you know,
i'd find money.

739
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:09,960
Hundreds of dollars, cash,
in his pockets at night.

740
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,962
Probably won it
at the racetrack.

741
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,964
You think so?

742
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,466
Sure, why not?

743
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:19,470
Somebody has to win.

744
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,482
Well the kitchen needs
some work but, you know,

745
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,484
a little marble,
maybe some new fixtures.

746
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,986
It's nice.

747
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,490
You think he'll come
down on the price?

748
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,991
I don't know.

749
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,994
Tony,
it's your sister,

750
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,996
would it kill you to
take a little interest?

751
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,498
I'm here,
ain't i?

752
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,999
Sorry we're late.

753
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,502
The paper says
fox hill lane,

754
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:56,006
she takes me
to stag trail road.

755
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,009
Not bad, huh, carm?
Oh, wow.

756
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,011
If we have kids, ma's house
is just not big enough.

757
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,014
And like tony says,
it's not our house anyway.

758
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,016
Come here, you gotta
see this bedroom.

759
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,519
You can make a den
out of the closet.

760
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,527
Talked to my uncle
the other day, rich.

761
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:21,031
Yeah, i heard.

762
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:27,037
So we're clear on this
drug shit, right richie?

763
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:31,041
Now the reason i'm asking you,
850 grand's a pretty big nut.

764
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,543
I don't know
if your parole job

765
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,545
at the fish market's
gonna cover it.

766
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:39,049
Tell me about it.

767
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,553
These walls,
skim- coat.

768
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,056
Not that plain
sheetrock shit.

769
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,560
They put in a lawn
this year, it's new.

770
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,563
When did you
put your lawn in?

771
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,065
Richie.

772
00:43:55,065 --> 00:44:01,071
This is a great
school district.

773
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,072
Are you alright?

774
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,075
I got to go.

775
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,076
What's the matter?

776
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,077
Nothing, just--

777
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:12,583
i feel hot.

778
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,586
Oh my god, your all clammy,
let's get you home.

779
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,588
No, no, you stay with them
and help them.

780
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,591
I'll see you later.

781
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:58,128
Oh, you poor bastard.

782
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,633
Hey tony,
you got a minute?

783
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,636
Yeah, sure,
what's up?

784
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,639
What are you doing?

785
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,641
Organizing
a basketball pool,

786
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,143
for the people
in the office.

787
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,145
Yeah sounds great,
should be fun.

788
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,647
Yeah.

789
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,650
I got a call from
a friend of mine in nutley.

790
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,651
Guy's a cop.

791
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,154
They got richie's
driver on video.

792
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:28,158
He sold three ounces of coke
at an arcade down there.

793
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,160
It's alright,
i talked to richie.

794
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,663
This was last night.

795
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:38,669
Guess we'll have to
torch a truck or something.

796
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:42,172
Oh, but you don't
want to hear that.

797
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,676
I sure as shit
didn't say it.

798
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,187
Dick, i'm trying to work
on this office pool.

799
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,190
Sure, i'll
leave you alone.

800
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,224
Hello.

801
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,726
Corrado?

802
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,228
What the fuck are you doing
calling my home?

803
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,730
Now listen,

804
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,733
i'm the only person in
this family who doesn't curse,

805
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,235
so just do me the favor.

806
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,738
I want to see
how your feeling.

807
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,740
Is that so horrible?

808
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,741
I'm fine.

809
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,744
It's not easy being
abandoned, is it?

810
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,746
Look to yourself.

811
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,249
I had a stroke, corrado,
did you hear?

812
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,252
Of course i heard,
i don't live in oshkosh.

813
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:07,257
I heard you're keeping company
with that catherine romano.

814
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,759
What the fuck?

815
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,260
Never you mind
about that.

816
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,762
Aw, she's so sweet.

817
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,765
I remember
my johnny told me,

818
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:19,269
she let him feel her up
behind "the sons of italy" hall.

819
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,272
Listen livia, what you
don't know could fill a book.

820
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:37,788
Is everything
alright?

821
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,790
My brother's wife.

822
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,292
Oh livia,
how is she?

823
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,794
I heard she
wasn't well.

824
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:44,795
She never was well.

825
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,296
Let's face it.

826
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,298
That woman's
life is very sad.

827
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,301
If she fell
into a sewer pipe,

828
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:57,808
she'd come up holding
a gold watch in each hand.

829
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,310
This was my father's.

830
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,813
Actually it
was his uncle's.

831
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:06,316
It's a little sweet, but there's
nothing like homemade wine.

832
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,319
The vinegar eggplant.

833
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,321
From four years ago.

834
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,823
Take some home.

835
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,825
I can't handle
the acidity.

836
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:19,830
If you like, i can
make us some lunch.

837
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,832
Why go to the bother,

838
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,834
there's a friendly's
on bloomfield avenue.

839
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,836
I can't.

840
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,339
Don't you enjoy
going out corrado?

841
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,841
It's not that
i don't enjoy it.

842
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,343
Well, what is it then,
your heart?

843
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,848
No, it's certain
legal difficulties.

844
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,350
The truth is
i can't go out.

845
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,852
I'm under house arrest.

846
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,355
Oh my god,
does it hurt?

847
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:50,861
It beeps.

848
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,363
Sends a signal
if i leave the house.

849
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,865
You can't go anywhere?

850
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:59,369
The choices
we make, huh?

851
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,871
Occasionally i can
get special permission.

852
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,374
Banking, the doctors,
certain family obligations.

853
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,877
For most part though...

854
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:10,881
i understand if you
don't want to stay.

855
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:14,885
I enjoy you, corrado,
i always did.

856
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:18,388
You stay,
i'll bring food in.

857
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,897
Trying to keep a low profile,
what's the fucking point?

858
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:35,906
I'm still a miserable pric
k and i'm still passing out.

859
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,408
Thing on the history channel
the other night,

860
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,910
on the american revolution.

861
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,412
You know we're the only
country in the world

862
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:46,917
where the pursuit of happiness
is guaranteed in writing?

863
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,920
You believe that, hmm?

864
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,922
Bunch of fucking
spoiled brats.

865
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,425
Where's my
happiness then?

866
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,428
It's the pursuit
that's guaranteed.

867
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,931
Always a fucking
loophole, right?

868
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,939
Well, you seem
very mellow today.

869
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,942
Let's talk about you.

870
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,945
You seem like you're on drugs
and i'm boring myself to death.

871
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,947
I'm ready for
the george sanders
long walk here.

872
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:21,451
Do you know why
a shark keeps moving?

873
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:25,455
They got to keep moving
or they'll die,

874
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,957
they can't breathe
or something.

875
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,961
There's a psychological
condition known as alexithymia,

876
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,963
common in certain
personalities.

877
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:38,969
The individual craves
almost ceaseless action,

878
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:46,476
which enables them
to avoid acknowledging
the abhorrent things they do.

879
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:50,480
Abhorrent?

880
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,982
What certain
personalities?

881
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,485
Antisocial personalities.

882
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:07,998
My future
brother- in- law...

883
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,001
ran over a guy,
no reason.

884
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:20,510
Guy's paralyzed, has to
piss into a cathode tube.

885
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,515
What happens when thes
e antisocial personalities

886
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:29,519
aren't distracted from
the horrible shit they do?

887
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,022
They have time to think
about their behavior.

888
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:36,526
How what they do
affects other people.

889
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:42,032
About feelings of emptiness
and self- loathing,

890
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:49,539
haunting them
since childhood.

891
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,042
And they crash.

892
00:51:58,548 --> 00:51:59,549
Which one
of them knew?

893
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,551
Knew what?

894
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:04,054
Jerry grill
had asthma...

895
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,058
he never was one
to let common sense

896
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,060
get in the way of
whatever he wanted to do.

897
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,066
What about
chris newman?

898
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:19,569
Grale's house was
the last thing standing
in the way of that new deli.

899
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,571
I'm sure chris is glad
to see him gone too.

900
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:22,572
What about howard?

901
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,574
Corrado.

902
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,076
Hmm.

903
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:31,581
I got caught in
the middle of the fight...

904
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,083
and you have
no broken bones?

905
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,085
Actually they
ignored me.

906
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,087
Fucking thing.

907
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:42,592
Shh,
with that talk.

908
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,094
...that he'd been
cheatin' on her

909
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,595
where'd you
hear that?

910
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,097
Her father told her while
i was standing there.

911
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:50,100
Every one of them
had a motive.

912
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,103
The thing is who
had the opportunity

913
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,106
and who was it
who knew he had asthma?

914
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:07,617
I threw.

915
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:11,121
C'mon.

916
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,623
Ho, our long
lost leader.

917
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,625
Somebody most
owe him money.

918
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,127
Tony, how you doing?

919
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:18,628
How's the clay pigeon?

920
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:23,133
I'm getting there.

921
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,635
You could knock cardoz
o law school all you want,

922
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,138
but his lawyer says
the gun charge will not stick.

923
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,140
Yeah, congratulations.

924
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,143
We were talking about
you know, down the docks.

925
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,146
Driving off some off
that japanese technology.

926
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,148
Hesh knows a guy.

927
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:43,153
Oh yeah?

928
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,154
So what else
is going on?

929
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,656
Nothing.

930
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,170
I'm having good luck
with swiss basics'
moisturizing formula.

931
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:08,178
Maybe i'll try it.

932
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,180
Oh!

933
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,184
Yeah!

934
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,692
What the fuck?

935
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,199
Holy shit.

936
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,201
Look at that.

937
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,702
It's that dipshit
carmine again.

938
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,705
Sil, go tell him no speeding
in neighborhood.

939
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,207
I'm on it.

940
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,208
C'mon.

941
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,709
What an asshole.

942
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,212
Carmine, what the fuck's
the matter with you?

943
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,213
How many times
we gotta tell you,

944
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,215
do not speed in this
fucking neighborhood!

945
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:52,722
C'mon, you hurt?

946
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,224
That's too bad,

947
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,226
you should be fucking crippled,
you fucking asshole!

948
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,228
Don't do that again
you understand me?

949
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,729
Understand me?

950
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,231
People could be fucking hurt,
you know that?

951
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,232
You know that?

952
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,733
You alright?

953
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:07,237
You sure?

954
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,739
Tony.

955
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,241
Oh, agent harris.

956
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,242
How are you?

957
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,243
Good,
good to see you.

958
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,744
I was in the neighborhood,

959
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,246
i wanted to introduce you
to my new partner.

960
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,247
Joe marquez,
tony soprano.

961
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,749
What's the matter,
no openings in the post office?

962
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,252
How'bout
those nets, huh?

963
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:23,753
What a series.

964
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,755
It's that guy,
williams.

965
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:26,756
Yeah, he's good.

966
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,259
That fourth quarter
was amazing.

967
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,760
How'd the knicks do?

968
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,262
It was close,
really close.

969
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,264
Look at this asshole.

970
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,765
Friend of yours?

971
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,269
He drives too fast, and he's
always fucking hitting shit.
