1
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,968
PIZZALAND

2
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:42,760
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes
the presentation of evidence for today.

3
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,103
I repeat my earlier admonition that you
not discuss the case among yourselves...

4
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,767
or with anyone else, including media.

5
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,646
Your Honor,
I have a logistical problem to discuss.

6
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,806
I'd like to call a witness out of order.

7
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,678
Now I missed the Early Bird Special!

8
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,245
Took half a chicken home the other night.
Got two meals out of it.

9
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,391
Big bombshell from the prosecution today...

10
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,227
with testimony detailing
misuse of Joint Fitters' 401(k) funds.

11
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,925
- Your reaction?
- No comment.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,491
Mr. Soprano, Allison Pak, Channel Six.

13
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,864
Mr. Soprano, are you hurt?

14
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,240
- Has he been shot?
- He got hit in the head by a boom.

15
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,279
John, I'm at the Federal Courthouse...

16
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:31,147
where reputed mob boss, Corrado Soprano,
just fell nine....

17
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,185
No, seven steps.

18
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,246
- How's our royal highness in there?
- She's doing good.

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,124
Lois, this is Carmela, my wife.

20
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,895
Great to see her run again. Had her
first full- speed workout this morning.

21
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,767
- Go to the fourth stall down, I'll join you.
- What is that, a goat?

22
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,862
Yeah, that's her friend.

23
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,606
Is she ready for the Toboggan Handicap?

24
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,573
Hello.

25
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,845
- She's something, ain't she?
- She is magnificent.

26
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,295
That's a good girl. You're feeling better?

27
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,225
See that? The second she saw you,
she came right over.

28
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,462
She likes it when you rub her muzzle,
right here.

29
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,728
Right, Lady Pie?

30
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,999
You ought to see her race.
She busts her heart to win.

31
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,780
You like the ponies. I'll take you.

32
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,516
Follow my finger.

33
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,390
He said they'll do this every hour.
Check the neurological.

34
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,156
You wanna go? The family's on the way.

35
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,091
Thank you.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,226
My daughter's addressing
the Irish Parliament.

37
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,098
Abortion issues.

38
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,681
I gotta go. I gotta catch a plane.

39
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,714
I'll be back Monday.

40
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,688
- Hope you feel better.
- Make sure Beppy gets my chicken home.

41
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,554
You didn't get to the Early Bird Special.

42
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,558
He was disoriented when he came in.

43
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,462
Scored low on his Folstein,
but that's due to concussion.

44
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:30,059
- We'll sue the goddamn Justice Department!
- His CAT scan's negative. So far so good.

45
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,863
He didn't seem like himself.

46
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,705
At his age, he might have been
suffering from dementia...

47
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,075
- and the head injury tipped him over.
- Alzheimer's?

48
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,741
That's one form of it.
That's why we want to keep an eye on him.

49
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,410
There's a good chance
this could all go away.

50
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,888
- Where is he?
- They took him down for an X- ray.

51
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,519
We gotta get him into the city.
Columbia Presbyterian Head Trauma Unit.

52
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,857
The best.

53
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,664
Why don't you take it easy?

54
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,763
- Had to be Paulie who told Johnny.
- You think so?

55
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,600
He hates my success.

56
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,738
I keep thinking about that birthday dinner.

57
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,876
Who was there
when I told the Ginny Sack joke?

58
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,075
Not Paulie.
I remember Albert saying he didn't get a gift.

59
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,279
It was Little Paulie,
the witless fucking nephew.

60
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,914
He told Paulie, Paulie tells Johnny.

61
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,115
Fucking telephone game,
like high- school girls!

62
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,621
You wanna play phone games?

63
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,298
That party was the only time
I ever mentioned Shamu's fat ass.

64
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,840
Hello, Verona Green Grove
Retirement Home something....

65
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,904
- Just connect me.
- What the fuck you doing?

66
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,006
Hello?

67
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,910
I'd like to talk to a Mrs. Gualtieri.
She's a resident there.

68
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,179
One moment, please.

69
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,591
- Hello?
- Mrs. Marianucci Gualtieri?

70
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,962
This is detective Mike Hunt, Beaver Falls,
Pennsylvania Police Department.

71
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,562
You have a son, Peter Paul?

72
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,437
Oh, my God, what happened?

73
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,909
He's all right, but he's in a little trouble.

74
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,348
We found him in a public men's room
in Lafayette Park.

75
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,742
I don't know how to put this delicately.

76
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,784
He was sucking a Cub Scout's dick.

77
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,449
No, it's a mistake.

78
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,284
Ma'am, I wish that was all.

79
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,488
We had to have emergency surgery
performed upon arrival at headquarters...

80
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,028
after discovery of a small rodent
in the rectal passage.

81
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,592
- Oh, my God!
- A gerbil, ma'am.

82
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,569
The County does not cover
medical procedures...

83
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,370
deemed caused by criminal sexual activity.

84
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,809
Section 4, paragraph 15.

85
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,740
We'll need an insurance number.

86
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,382
Marone. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield.
Is that all right?

87
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:02,750
Ma'am, could you hold on for one second?
I have the hospital on the other line.

88
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,063
Uncle Jun'.

89
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,131
- Nephew number one.
- How you doing today?

90
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,197
You look better.

91
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,374
Guess who came in earlier?
Tommy Formicola.

92
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,540
Tommy Formicola died a few years ago.

93
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,775
Not Tommy, you cidrule. The son Tommy!

94
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,822
Jesus Christ, you had me worried there
for a minute.

95
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,923
When you came in yesterday,
they said you were very confused...

96
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,388
you flunked your Holstein or something.

97
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,659
I'm 71 years old, for Christ's sake.

98
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,860
- You get hit in the head, see how you do.
- I'm glad you're better.

99
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,167
Better? This is Xanadu
compared to that courtroom.

100
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,739
I'm milking this thing for all it's worth.

101
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,642
Maybe you're not milking it enough.

102
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,272
What?

103
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,545
You don't have any headaches,
blurred vision, or anything, do you?

104
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,349
- Okay, then.
- Who're you calling? They charge a fortune!

105
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,964
Mel, what the fuck are you doing?

106
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,630
Just on our way to St. Stephen's Green
for dinner. Why? What's going on?

107
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,600
Back here in the States,
I think we got a mistrial.

108
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,434
Son of Gondor!

109
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,738
The bow is meant to find the ring!

110
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,941
Dick!

111
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,742
My turn!

112
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,227
- Mr. Ralph! Come, please, help!
- What?

113
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,054
For Christ's sake, what?

114
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,533
It's Justin, he's hurt very bad!

115
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,067
Justin, baby.

116
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,004
I don't know what to do.
The boy, he comes to the house--

117
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,549
Shut up!

118
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,018
All right, nobody move.
Don't touch him, okay?

119
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,715
I gotta get help.

120
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,245
How is he?

121
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,511
Couldn't get any breath in his lungs
for five minutes...

122
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,148
so there was no oxygen to the brain.

123
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,818
So, they don't....

124
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,225
- They just don't know yet.
- Thank God you were home.

125
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,497
Get to work.

126
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,907
It was an accident, all right?

127
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,778
Just kids.

128
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,485
That must be the surgeon.

129
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,901
Please, allow me to introduce myself.

130
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,836
This is my ex- husband,
Justin's biological father.

131
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,430
He was supposed to take them
to the archery range.

132
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,035
They were playing a video game, Ronnie.
I don't know what happened.

133
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,980
No, nothing's ever your fault.
I should never have let you near him.

134
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,882
- He's my son.
- Before going to your house, he can't sleep.

135
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,941
Ronnie, don't.

136
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,954
- Son of a bitch!
- Please!

137
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,084
- Please! Stop it!
- You scumbag! You son of a bitch.

138
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,626
You bought him the bow and arrow,
you stupid cunt!

139
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,628
Don't you talk to her like that!
Nobody talks to my wife like that.

140
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,223
- Nobody talks to her!
- Knock it off, this is enough!

141
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,289
Nobody!

142
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,461
- We were just fooling around.
- Just fooling around?

143
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,431
Stop!

144
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,350
Our psychiatrist will testify
as to your reduced mental capacity.

145
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,692
Of course, the government
will bring in their own expert.

146
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,232
We get you 24- hour- a- day nursing care...

147
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,791
because they still didn't rule out
the dementia...

148
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,633
you might be a danger to yourself and....

149
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,901
Which only bolsters our case.

150
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,235
If the court finds
you lack fitness to proceed...

151
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,172
the trial will be suspended...

152
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:58,239
and the charges against you
dismissed with prejudice, or delayed.

153
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,113
I called this woman.
She runs an elder care agency.

154
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,054
She's got an RN that'll play ball.
All you gotta do is act ubatz.

155
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,949
Crazy like a fox, my little nephew.

156
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,385
Now get me the fuck outta here.

157
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,189
This muffin basket
from you and your partners....

158
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,367
It's the least we could do.

159
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,514
- Rosalie, Jesus.
- I didn't know if I should come.

160
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,188
- I don't know what to do.
- I know.

161
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,683
I'm so happy to see you.

162
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,694
How is he?

163
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,166
Not as good as yesterday.

164
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,160
How are you?

165
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,331
I just didn't understand
what you were going through.

166
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,640
I didn't know anything.

167
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,777
I was stupid. I'm sorry.

168
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,203
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

169
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:07,684
I mean, there's no way to know what it's like
until it happens to you.

170
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,047
You were so strong
when Jackie Junior passed away.

171
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,154
- I don't know how you did it.
- Justin's gonna be all right.

172
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,525
You'll see. He's gonna be fine.

173
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,762
He's gonna be a vegetable.

174
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,827
At least I have a daughter. Ralph's all alone.

175
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,032
I told him he should go
and talk to Father Intintola.

176
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,905
- He should.
- He won't.

177
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,111
There's another one
who should talk to the priest.

178
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,381
- Is it true he took a sleeping pill overdose?
- Apparently.

179
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,613
I also know he and Tony are on the outs,
but Tony's not talking.

180
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,026
First question: What is today's date?

181
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,663
A blonde with big tits
and a hat full of Viagra.

182
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,107
Yeah, cute. Fuck around.

183
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,608
'Cause when that government shrink comes,
you better know how to fake this.

184
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,609
I could do it in my sleep.

185
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,216
- What's your name?
- My name?

186
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,755
You can't not know your name,
or they'll know you're fucking with them.

187
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,016
Listen to this:

188
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,651
"Give the subject a piece of paper,
ask him to draw a circle...

189
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,724
"fold the paper in half, and give it back."

190
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,459
These demented old bats can't do that.

191
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,666
Maybe you should wipe your ass with
the paper, so they know you're a whack job.

192
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,462
You think this is funny?

193
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,231
I'm a source of amusement.

194
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,606
I pretend to wipe my ass in front of people.

195
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,170
Take it easy.

196
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,737
I lived my whole life with dignity.

197
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,851
Now I gotta pretend
I'm a fucking drooling idiot.

198
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,078
Scumbari'.

199
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,677
It's just a good clean way out. That's all.

200
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,389
My poor fucking brother, Eckley.
How they mocked him.

201
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,926
Suppose it doesn't work?

202
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,988
- We'll go after a juror.
- Suppose nothing works?

203
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,060
Let's do another question.

204
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,943
- Fucking Grand Central Station!
- That must be the nurse.

205
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,641
Maybe she'll give you a sponge bath.

206
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,881
Svetlana! I've been wanting to talk to you.

207
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,518
I bring nurse. I don't come to see you.

208
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,250
I should never have taken your prosthesis.

209
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,253
- But it did bring me to the Lord--
- You're a boring woman.

210
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,865
How are you?

211
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,096
Good to see you.

212
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,865
This is Branca. She is registered nurse.

213
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,067
He is Mr. Tony. This is the uncle.

214
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,142
- Help me up. I gotta go to the bathroom.
- I do it.

215
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,243
- What's your problem now?
- Like anyone would care.

216
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,952
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you doing?

217
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,221
I feel like such a hypocrite.

218
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,163
I haven't been to church in years.

219
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,394
But we had a Mass for Justin's baptism...

220
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,638
for all the good it did.

221
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,962
See?

222
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,769
- What am I doing here?
- God understands.

223
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,836
That's why it's at times like these
he's the only one we can turn to.

224
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,971
God?

225
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,682
My son's lying in the hospital...

226
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,815
hooked up to a machine.

227
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,022
He never did nothing to nobody.

228
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,085
Our Lord gave his only begotten son
to suffer.

229
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,855
Nothing compared to this.

230
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:45,062
Were you there when Jesus Christ
had his moment of doubt and pain?

231
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,577
It's a great mystery to us
why things happen as they do.

232
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,015
- But God has a plan for all of us.
- Come on, Father.

233
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,176
I've done things in my life
that I shouldn't have done.

234
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,588
He's making my son pay for it.

235
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,421
- That's how he's punishing me.
- God is merciful.

236
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,623
He doesn't punish people.

237
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,602
I would do anything...

238
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,996
if Justin could even walk again.

239
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,234
Justin's in God's hands now.

240
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,575
And I assure you, God loves him very much.

241
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,075
Your job is you...

242
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,615
to get yourself right with God...

243
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,713
for yourself and for your son.

244
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,925
Would you like to make a confession?

245
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,862
I think I need a little more time...

246
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,499
you know, to do a good one.

247
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,000
But when I'm ready....

248
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,036
I understand.

249
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,397
Thank you.

250
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,800
Let's pray.

251
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,013
"Have mercy on me, God, in your goodness.

252
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,208
"In your abundant compassion,
blot out my offense.

253
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,753
"Wash away all my guilt.

254
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,025
"From my sin, cleanse me.

255
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,227
"For I know my offense.

256
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,656
"My sin is always before me."

257
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,839
- A scholarship at Rutgers?
- That's right.

258
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,843
In Jackie Junior's name, for $20, 000.
And that's every year.

259
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,271
Gimme a break.

260
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:39,681
That's not all. He asked Ro to marry him.
She had the presence of mind to say no.

261
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,915
Although she did say he went to see
Father Intintola, and they had a long talk.

262
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,250
No shit?

263
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,620
I know what you mean about Ralph.

264
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,091
Although, to see him like that...

265
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,096
and Justin hooked up to those machines....

266
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,230
Good morning, you.

267
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,768
- When have I ever asked for French toast?
- Just eat the bacon.

268
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,280
It's unhealthy,
this whole obsession with your weight.

269
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,620
Where were you out so late last night?

270
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,855
Nowhere.

271
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,324
Fooling around with blondie?

272
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,122
Quit it.

273
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,094
- Look at that guilty look on his face.
- Let him eat.

274
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,572
Mr. Tough Guy? Come on.

275
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,837
Jesus.

276
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,412
I have calls to make.

277
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,405
Ton', can I come in?

278
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,386
How's Justin? Any news?

279
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:28,182
It's the left side of the brain
that affects speech.

280
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,061
Right side of his body.

281
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,328
It's too soon to tell.

282
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,965
Sit down, come on.

283
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,268
You want something to eat?

284
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,605
I just came by to give you...

285
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,714
- from the thing.
- It could've waited.

286
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,552
I had to smack the guy around this morning.

287
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,246
Nice.

288
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,885
At least I'm good for something.

289
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,766
How could I let something like this happen?

290
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,296
It could happen to anybody, Ralph.

291
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,439
You know where I was on his 7th birthday?

292
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,502
Florida.

293
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,046
I was so high on coke, I forgot to call him.

294
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,721
Then I thought I did.

295
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,329
- You cut back on that shit, right?
- I'm a different man.

296
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,762
My poor baby.

297
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,274
My little boy.

298
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,637
Covered by
the Sheetrock and Plasterers Union, right?

299
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,634
Here.

300
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:47,191
He's covered on her husband's insurance,
as far as that goes.

301
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,461
You know, I'll take care of the rest,
whatever it takes.

302
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,800
I don't care if it breaks me.

303
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,772
He's gonna get the best care there is.

304
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,441
There's something....

305
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,279
I don't want you to hear it
through the grapevine, especially now.

306
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,121
I'm seeing that girl you used to date.

307
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,455
That Valentina.

308
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,739
I gotta go to the hospital.

309
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,276
Hang in there.

310
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,621
Maybe you should go see Pie.

311
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,553
- Take your mind off it.
- I know.

312
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,158
Lois called, and told me about
the Toboggan Handicap, Grade l....

313
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,372
- You look after it. I can't.
- I understand.

314
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,277
Give my best to Carmela.

315
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,506
- She's been a great help.
- I will.

316
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,014
I have bad luck.

317
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,176
I had to get hooked up
with that miserable twat.

318
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,182
Maybe if I'd met a girl like Carmela...

319
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,928
my life could have taken
a whole different trajectory.

320
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,690
See you, Ton'.

321
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,405
How's it going, pal?

322
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,846
Thanks for the flowers. They were beautiful.

323
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,685
That poor fucking guy.

324
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,157
Fuck him and his alligator tears.

325
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,857
His kid's in the hospital.
A little fucking sympathy.

326
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,795
That gives him a pass?

327
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,834
I don't care if he's got 100 kids in the ICU
with arrows in their heads.

328
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,302
He's a piece of shit.

329
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:10,273
- You know it, and I know it.
- Who got you those no- show jobs?

330
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,276
- And not a word of gratitude.
- He's a saint.

331
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,672
You forget the thousand incidents
with that guy?

332
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,710
Kid in the hospital.

333
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,944
Just take a look at how he fucking earns.

334
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,182
I know it was that miserable prick
who called Ma at the home.

335
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,555
They had to put her on Xanax
just so she could sleep.

336
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,118
She was in the hospital unit for an hour
with nervous bowel syndrome.

337
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,221
Whatever happened there...

338
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,563
- that was fucked up.
- Fucked up?

339
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,595
- You don't know it was him.
- Listen to your friend here.

340
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,470
I'll promise you something else,
on my old man's grave.

341
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,204
If I get proof it was him,
he's a fucking corpse.

342
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,109
Nobody's killing anybody.

343
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,612
All due respect, T...

344
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,149
there's a line in the sand
when it comes to mothers.

345
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,879
You lay a hand on him,
and you're gonna answer to me.

346
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,650
If you can quote the rules,
you can obey them, you hear me?

347
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,293
Don't just look at me. This is a business.

348
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,296
Did you hear what I said?

349
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,628
Yes.

350
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,998
That goes for all of you.

351
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,442
Now, listen.

352
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,707
I'm gonna visit your mother.

353
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,748
That was a terrible thing, whoever did it.

354
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,719
It's been too long now.

355
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,018
I'm gonna go pay my respects.

356
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,520
She'd love that.

357
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,458
All right, come here.

358
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,533
He has no fucking conception.

359
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,134
He's got no kids.

360
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,101
You can't expect him to understand.

361
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:00,079
I'm going to say three words,
and I want you to repeat them.

362
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,945
Boat, flag, shirt.

363
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,650
Boat.

364
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,118
Shirt.

365
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,928
Let me give you a hint.
We pledge allegiance to the....

366
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,124
United States of America.

367
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,699
Okay, let's move on.

368
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,235
Who is the President of the United States?

369
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,367
- I'm tired, I want to go to the bathroom.
- We're almost done.

370
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:29,038
- Who is the President of the United States?
- George Bush.

371
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,049
And who was the President
before George Bush?

372
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,052
John Kennedy.

373
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,489
You know where I was when he was shot?

374
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,548
I was getting a haircut.

375
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,371
- Hello?
- I'm sorry to bother you...

376
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,032
but I can't find Ralph.

377
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,303
He keeps to himself nowadays.

378
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,011
There was a fire at the stables...

379
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,543
and they lost some horses.

380
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,710
- Pie- O- My?
- She survived, but....

381
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,084
- Why didn't you tell me? I'm late!
- I'm sorry.

382
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,353
We did everything we could, but she had
to be destroyed. She was too badly burned.

383
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,281
Jesus!

384
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,150
It just went up?

385
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,393
The fire marshal says it looks electrical.

386
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,497
They found pieces of
a blown- out light bulb in a stall...

387
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,863
and the hay was a natural accelerant.

388
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,538
They'll investigate, but it's a formality,
considering the value of the stock.

389
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,408
- No, don't.
- Come on, it's all right.

390
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,073
I was just down at the stables.

391
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,508
I got some bad news.

392
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,910
Pie- O- My.

393
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,279
She was in a fire.

394
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,285
She's dead.

395
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,486
Oh, Marone. Oh, Jesus.

396
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:40,101
That's why Lois called me.
Four messages I got on the machine.

397
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,329
Three other horses, too.

398
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,734
Jesus.

399
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,975
Look, Ton'....

400
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,781
I just made some coffee,
if you want, eggs....

401
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,186
Sorry about the timing.

402
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:07,924
No, I actually just
got some good news on Justy.

403
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,993
They think it's just gonna be speech.

404
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,865
The poor kid will have to learn how to talk
all over again. Years of rehab.

405
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,708
That's good.

406
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,311
He'll walk. He'll use his hands.

407
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,515
Life goes on.

408
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,442
One day at a time.

409
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,078
Lois said the horse was still alive...

410
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,282
but it was burnt so bad
that they had to put her out of her misery.

411
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,318
I don't even want to think about it.

412
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:42,930
At this point,
the fire marshal says it looks accidental.

413
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,526
What sick fuck would
do something like that on purpose?

414
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,035
You know, Ton', Justin loves my eggs.

415
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,372
Sour cream is the secret ingredient.

416
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,640
Right.

417
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,406
What sick fuck?

418
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,678
What?

419
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,587
That's funny about God and fate,
and shit like that.

420
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,259
The horse recovers,
and we take out $200, 000 on insurance...

421
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,159
on the race coming up.

422
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,865
Suddenly there's a fire.

423
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,897
What, you think
I had something to do with it?

424
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,061
I didn't.

425
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,901
Anthony, what are you,
a fucking arson investigator now?

426
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,908
Come on,
they said it was an accident, right?

427
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,410
You know what?
Maybe I will have some eggs.

428
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,110
Toast?

429
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,351
How's Corky Ianucci?
You heard from him lately?

430
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,992
Sil used him in that restaurant fire.
Excellent work.

431
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,590
You know, I don't understand you, Anthony.

432
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,134
We got lucky.

433
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,663
That accidental fire was a bolt from beyond.

434
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,937
The horse was no fucking good,
with the fucking colic all the time...

435
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,343
and the fucking bills!

436
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,404
What are you saying? She bounced back!

437
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,009
This time! But each time,
it takes something out of them.

438
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,384
It was all downhill from here.

439
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,447
I know it's tragic to think this way...

440
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,084
but you can't argue with the fucking logic!

441
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,060
Jesus Christ, you did it.

442
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,860
- You cooked that fucking horse alive.
- No, I did not!

443
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,961
- But, so what?
- So what?

444
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,527
It was a fucking animal! $100, 000 apiece.

445
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,999
My kid's in the fucking hospital!

446
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,237
I don't hear you complaining
when I bring you a nice fat envelope.

447
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,212
You don't give a shit
where that comes from!

448
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,615
Don't give me that look.
It was a fucking horse!

449
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,309
What are you, a vegetarian?

450
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,516
You eat beef and sausage
by the fucking carload.

451
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,700
You fat fuck!

452
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:38,168
She was a beautiful, innocent creature.
What did she ever do to you?

453
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,814
You fucking killed her.

454
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,044
You fucking killed her.

455
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,621
Fuck!

456
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,526
- Hello.
- It's me.

457
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,497
I need you to call me back
from a pay phone.

458
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,664
Now?

459
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,905
You got three minutes.

460
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,363
It's me.

461
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,940
I called you half a fucking hour ago.

462
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,733
Adriana put my keys
where I couldn't find them.

463
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,368
Go to the drugstore.

464
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,936
Get two pairs of surgical gloves...

465
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,010
some bleach, come to our friend's house.

466
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,744
The contractor.

467
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,729
What's going on?

468
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,014
I found him like this.

469
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,660
Guy was a piece of shit.

470
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,422
Whoever did this,
it should've happened a long time ago.

471
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,326
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Get rid of the body.

472
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,470
Tried to move him myself, but I couldn't.

473
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,912
Why do we have to get rid of the body?

474
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,311
What, the fucking questions now?

475
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,109
When they find him like this...

476
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,984
and somebody will,
there'll be a major fucking investigation.

477
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:15,024
We got enough light shining on shit.
Junior's trial, and all that.

478
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,022
No body, no murder.

479
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,089
Can't take him out till after dark,
so we'll get him ready here.

480
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,671
What the fuck is wrong with you?

481
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,973
Nothing.

482
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,451
Don't lie to me. You're high.

483
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,087
I smoked half a joint before you called.
I'm fine.

484
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,592
Look at you, your nose is running,
you fucking junkie.

485
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,458
You promised me
you wouldn't do that shit anymore.

486
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,791
I didn't.

487
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,732
Jesus fucking Christ, can you even do this?

488
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,881
He was a captain, T.

489
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,412
He was the biggest earner.

490
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,159
You gonna lecture me now?
You fucking drug addict!

491
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,454
Not me.

492
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,830
But other people are gonna wonder.

493
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,569
Up!

494
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,072
Get the fucking mop. Get him draining.

495
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,516
Okay, I snorted a little H.
I was out on my collections...

496
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:59,154
and I just wanted to come down
so I could get some sleep.

497
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,495
See if he's got some Visine.

498
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,202
I'm fucking nauseous.

499
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,738
My eyes are fucking killing me.

500
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,852
Holy shit!

501
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,816
- I had no idea. Did you?
- Of course I did.

502
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,359
You're so high on scag...

503
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:33,124
you wouldn't know
if he had your mother's muff on his head.

504
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,629
I mean, I got all pissed off
when she said she couldn't have kids.

505
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,435
But this new doctor says maybe she can.

506
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,739
But I don't know if I'm ready.

507
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,641
Don't overthink it.

508
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,477
Either jump in with both feet, or don't.

509
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,787
Leave a message, and make sure
you leave your phone number.

510
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,020
With my schedule,
I cannot look up phone numbers.

511
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,122
I'll tell you one thing:

512
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,097
You can't be high on scag
and have children.

513
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,676
I mean, look at this shit with Justin.

514
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,114
It would fucking ruin your life.

515
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,845
Those kids on milk cartons.
Teenage girls, they run away.

516
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,551
God knows what happens to them.

517
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,216
Killed, I guess.

518
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,061
When it gets a little darker...

519
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:23,664
I want you to move my car away
and put yours in the driveway.

520
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,938
I wanna finish up
and get him the fuck outta here.

521
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:32,944
Listen.

522
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,249
About this...

523
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,914
fucking guy.

524
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,683
I came over.

525
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,925
He was still moaning.

526
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,690
He died almost right away.

527
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,633
The ambulance
wouldn't have helped him anyway.

528
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,469
Paulie was in New Paltz all day.
I know that for a fact.

529
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,708
Good.

530
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:51,027
I heard about your horse, T. I'm sorry.

531
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,068
What the fuck happened over there,
you think?

532
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,131
Tragic.

533
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,447
It was the bowling ball. Fell down the stairs.

534
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,185
Go get it. It'll help weigh him down.

535
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,951
All right, I'm not saying I'm a saint.

536
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,553
I've done drugs when I was younger.

537
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,892
I've even done coke with you.

538
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,458
You're acting like
I'm some kinda skeeve junkie.

539
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,766
I only do it once in a while.

540
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,897
Somebody gave me some
when they didn't have any money.

541
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,135
I'm sorry.

542
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:51,643
You got your whole life in front of you.
Don't throw it away on drugs.

543
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,681
One, two...

544
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:01,984
three.

545
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,410
Let's go.

546
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:32,012
Paulmice's farm
is all the way up in fucking Sloatsburg.

547
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,080
All right, this is good.

548
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,216
- Mikey's old man lives here?
- Retired here.

549
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,578
He's in a VA Hospital now.

550
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,283
He's having prostate surgery.

551
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,400
It's frozen.

552
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,536
Come on.

553
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,247
And there's Artie with three kids.

554
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:36,546
- Think he's banging that French broad?
- He fucking wishes.

555
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,116
Can you hotwire this thing?

556
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,819
Keep the scoop up!

557
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,492
You gotta put it up to move it!

558
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,857
The scoop, you raise it up.

559
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,226
What the fuck? Put it up!

560
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,828
You gotta put it up to move forward!

561
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,469
What are you doing?

562
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,439
All right, get out. Come on. Get out!

563
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,843
This is what I'm talking about.

564
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,908
That shit fucks up
your hand- eye coordination.

565
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,348
Over there.

566
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,710
All right, move.

567
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,618
Kick leaves and shit over it.

568
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,257
Where did you learn how to drive
one of those?

569
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,798
Grandfather's construction site.

570
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,469
He let me fuck around when I was just 13.

571
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,500
He was a good guy.

572
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,989
Here's the problem...

573
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,890
as I see it, with Ralph getting whacked.

574
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,323
People could take it the wrong way.

575
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,766
What are you trying to convey to me?

576
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,435
Friends of ours...

577
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,205
like it could happen to them...

578
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,043
without, you know...

579
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,809
the protection of the boss....

580
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,416
You're the only other one
that knows about it.

581
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,646
We were right to disappear him.
You're right.

582
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,509
For the business.

583
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,052
Take these out back later and burn them.

584
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,751
- Can I have some ice cream?
- What?

585
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,656
Wait there.

586
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,764
What are you doing? Come here.

587
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,937
Come back here. Come in the house.

588
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,463
- You'll catch cold, come on.
- I was getting the paper.

589
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,474
You'll catch cold. Come on.

590
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,315
I was just getting the newspaper.

591
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,555
It's your fault, you forgot
to get the newspaper this morning.

592
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:26,994
I make tea.
