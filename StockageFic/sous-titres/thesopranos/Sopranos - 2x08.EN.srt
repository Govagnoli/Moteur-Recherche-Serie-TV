1
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,541
While you were sleeping
we found out

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,043
hunter scangarelo
got into reed college.

3
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,044
Sayonara.

4
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,046
Can't you be
happy for hunter?

5
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,547
Reed was
her first choice.

6
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,549
She'd die
if she didn't get in.

7
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,551
Why do you always
think everything has
something to do with me?

8
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,553
Because you didn't
get in anywhere.

9
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,555
Anthony, nobody is hearing
anything for months.

10
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,558
Hunter took early acceptance,
so she found out early.

11
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,560
But that meant she could
only apply to one college.

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,064
Your sister, on the other hand
gave herself a lot of options,

13
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,567
such as bowdoin,
holy cross, georgetown.

14
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,570
You know that georgetown
is a total reach for me.

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,572
They'd be crazy
not to want you.

16
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,075
If i can get in there
that means i can
probably get into berkeley.

17
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,077
Over my dead body.

18
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,079
There are more
nobel prize winners in
the san francisco bay area

19
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,580
than anywhere
on the planet.

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,584
Nobel prize for what,
packing fudge?

21
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:35,588
Look, you know you can
go anywhere you want
to go to college.

22
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,591
But i'll tell you where
i'm not gonna pay for,
and that's berkeley.

23
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,593
I want to go to harvard
or west point.

24
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,596
You may see them on television,
but that's about it.

25
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,600
You want to go to
a college like that,
you gotta crack the books.

26
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,614
Stockings, chris.

27
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,616
How many you think
you gotta sell

28
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,618
to pay the nut
on this place?

29
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,121
How can i express
how little i give a fuck?

30
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,624
Shh, shh,
what's that?

31
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,626
Fucking rent- a- jake.

32
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,129
Want me to cave the rest
of your head in?

33
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,131
That's bent enough.

34
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,135
Get the crowbar,
pop the plate.

35
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,637
Sean, without fail,
every time we're
on a fucking job.

36
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,140
The adrenaline affects
everybody differently.

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,143
Big pussy bompensiero,
he started out
as a cat burglar.

38
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,145
One time he left
a load so big,

39
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,147
cop thought a bear
was in the place.

40
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,150
Pussy bompensiero started off
chipping safes like this?

41
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,152
Until he stepped up
for johnny soprano

42
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,154
during the unrest
of'83.

43
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,656
Back then,
when you did something
you got recognized.

44
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,159
Your time comes,
you either step up

45
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,660
or start looking
for a new career.

46
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:55,168
Selling stockings
door to door.

47
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,172
The profile toner
is a wonderful, affordable

48
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:04,677
easily- used alternative
to undergoing facelift surgery.

49
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,680
The profile toner is great
for any age and any body type,

50
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,682
even for those
hereditary...

51
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,185
you've probably
given up on.

52
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,686
Carm.

53
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:19,192
Why don't you take
a xanex or something?

54
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,694
What is this obsession
with berkeley?

55
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,696
What, is she trying
to get away from us?

56
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,698
Absolutely,
that's her job.

57
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,700
Go ahead, laugh.

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,702
What are you gonna do
if she gets into berkeley

59
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,704
and not into notre dame
or georgetown?

60
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,708
She's in the
national honor society,
for chrissake.

61
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,211
Don't be naive,
tony, please.

62
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,713
How do you think
hunter scangerelo
got into reed college?

63
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,715
Her uncle,
that's how.

64
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,717
Him and his wife
are graduates.

65
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,721
That's the only way
that little freak
was gonna get into college.

66
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,223
Second baby boom.

67
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,226
Grades, great sat scores,
it's not enough anymore.

68
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,728
It's all who you know
or how many buildings you give.

69
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,730
So, what you want me
to do, huh?

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,253
He here?

71
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,754
Hey.

72
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:26,759
Someone leave a cage open
at turtleback zoo?

73
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,761
Sit down,
for chrissake.

74
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,264
I want to talk to you
about beansie gaeta.

75
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,765
He may never
walk again.

76
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,267
Never say never.

77
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,769
No...
say never.

78
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,272
He's a shopping cart,
from here on out.

79
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,275
He gets home from rehab soon,
poor motherfucker.

80
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,776
You should
help him out.

81
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,778
Help him out?

82
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,281
You should build him
a ramp on his house
for the wheelchair.

83
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,285
You know, make the place
handicap accessible.

84
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,288
Maybe while i'm over there
i could fuck his wife.

85
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,790
C'mon, rich, you're
a fucking captain now.

86
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,793
And a salut',
so, exert a little pressure.

87
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,796
Call that nephew of yours,
vito, and other one.

88
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,299
They're in the building trades,
aren't they?

89
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,301
Are you
fucking serious?

90
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,303
Richie,
it's a gesture.

91
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,305
The man has
a lot of friends.

92
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,308
You're out of
your fucking minds.

93
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,311
Don't take
that attitude.

94
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,815
Richie, hey, you're gonna
build beansie a ramp.

95
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,318
I'll build a ramp
up to your ass...

96
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,322
drive a lionel
up in there.

97
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,832
Jeannie, hi!

98
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,834
You putting your roses
to bed, huh?

99
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,336
Carmela, hi.

100
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,838
I haven't seen you
at spinning class lately.

101
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,341
I went by and
rang the bell a couple times,

102
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,342
you weren'
t home either.

103
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,843
Really?

104
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,345
The other day,
i'm at the willowbrook mall

105
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,846
and i see you going
on the down escalator,

106
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,848
and i'm yelling,
"jeannie, jeannie."

107
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,850
That's when i realized
it was your sister.

108
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,353
Didn't she go
to georgetown?

109
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,355
Georgetown law,
georgetown law review,

110
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:06,859
regional secretary of
the georgetown alumni
association of short hills.

111
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,362
Because my meadow
applied to georgetown.

112
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,865
And i am hoping and prayin
g to jesus that she gets in.

113
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,367
She keeps
talking about berkeley.

114
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,369
Madonn', berkeley.

115
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,373
College already, huh?
They get big so fast.

116
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,875
Oh god,
is that the time?

117
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,377
Uh, jeannie.

118
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,879
I need to
ask you a favor.

119
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,882
I was wondering if
you would ask your sister

120
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,884
to write meadow
a letter of recommendation.

121
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,885
Is that
too forward?

122
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,388
Well, but she doesn't
really know meadow.

123
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,389
But you do

124
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,391
and you could give her
meadow's transcripts,

125
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,393
which are excellent,
by the way.

126
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,894
Her paper on
the melting icecap,

127
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,896
it made me cry,
it was so poignant.

128
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,898
It was published in
"the daily caduceus".

129
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,400
My sister,
she's so busy.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,902
Really, if there is
any way

131
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:55,908
you could find your wa
y to helping me out here.

132
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,410
I'll ask her.

133
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,912
Thank you, jeannie.

134
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:05,918
I'll let you get back
to your plants.

135
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,420
Good, good, good.

136
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,921
That's it,
push up.

137
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:13,926
Now bracing yourself
on the bedside hand.

138
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,428
Richie.

139
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,431
Could you excuse u
s for a moment, dear?

140
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,432
No.

141
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,434
Are you alright,
mr. Gaeta?

142
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,935
He's fine.

143
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:28,441
He's so proud, he won't accept
some friendly concern.

144
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,943
Just stay right out
in the hall.

145
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,450
What do you want?

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,952
Why don't you fuckin' kill me,
you cocksucker?

147
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,955
For chrissake,
look what you did to me.

148
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,457
Whose idea
was the ramp?

149
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,958
What ramp?

150
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,460
The fucking ramp.

151
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,463
If you need help,
i'll fuckin' help you.

152
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,466
You understand?
You talk to me.

153
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,470
I don't want jack shit
from you.

154
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,972
Okay...
i'll leave.

155
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:06,479
But if you go crying to
tony soprano one more time...

156
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,482
if you
open your mouth,

157
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:14,487
i'm gonna send your arms
where your legs are.

158
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,003
Liz, let me in,
i gotta see adriana.

159
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,004
She's not here.

160
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,006
Let me in,
i gotta talk to her.

161
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,510
You are not welcome
in this house.

162
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,513
What the fuck, adriana,
i'm sorry, okay?

163
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,014
How many times
i gotta call here?

164
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,516
Just go away,
christopher!

165
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,518
I hate you, i never want
to speak to you again!

166
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,519
I'm callin
g the police.

167
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,020
Don't be like that,
adriana.

168
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,022
I love you, i'm going crazy,
i miss you.

169
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,024
I'm dialing 911.

170
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,025
Why should i
listen to you?

171
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,027
So you can dump another
glass of wine in your soup

172
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,029
and embarrass me in front of
a whole restaurant?

173
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,030
Give me
the phone!

174
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,532
Go in
the other room!

175
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,534
Ow.

176
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,035
I want
to marry you.

177
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,537
What?

178
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,539
I mean it, adriana,
i love you.

179
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,040
I want to marry you.

180
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,543
Got you a ring
and everything.

181
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,544
Don't listen to him.

182
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,546
He's been jerking you around
for three years.

183
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,047
You're wasting
your whole youth.

184
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,050
Ma.

185
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,552
Open it.

186
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,555
Sure, i bet it was in
zane's window this morning.

187
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,057
I bet there's bits
of broken glass in it.

188
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,559
Mom, would you
leave us alone?

189
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,562
I hear you sobbing
in your bed at night!

190
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,566
Ma!

191
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,568
When you get hurt
next time,

192
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,570
this door
is closed to you.

193
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,581
Oh, my god.

194
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,083
Christopher.

195
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,085
It's three carats.

196
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,089
The guy said
you can bring it in,
have it sized or whatever,

197
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,592
if it's loose.

198
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,596
Christopher!

199
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,599
He had "the mummy"
before it was in the theaters.

200
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,602
Oh...
look who's here.

201
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,604
I was wondering why
the squirrels went quiet.

202
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,607
This nephew of yours,
he a real ball breaker.

203
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm telling hi
m about the tapes.

204
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,614
These are the real
hollywood quality
broadcast movies.

205
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,116
None of that
timecoding bullshit,

206
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,119
or blurry pictures those
nigerians sell on the street.

207
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,621
You're in
on this.

208
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,122
10, 000 units.

209
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,124
What's johnny sack
say about that?

210
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:38,130
Fuck new york.

211
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,132
I better run before that
wife of yours gets home.

212
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,135
Besides, i can't be seen
associating with known felons.

213
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,138
What's your excuse
for hanging out
with this undesirable?

214
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,640
The terms of
my house arrest

215
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,645
allow me to
do my grocery shopping.

216
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,648
Don't put handprints
on the finish!

217
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,649
Oh.

218
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,151
Last of the arugala rabe
from the garden.

219
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,654
Don't drench it
in oil this time.

220
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,657
He likes to mop with his bread,
it's not my fault.

221
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,661
What brings you to an
english- speaking neighborhood?

222
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,163
Fucking winghead
came to see me.

223
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,165
Paulie.

224
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,670
He said i got to
build a fucking ramp
on beansie's house.

225
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,672
Yeah, i know.

226
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,676
Wait, this was
your idea?

227
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,179
Jesus christ, tony, is this
how you spend your time?

228
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,683
Beansie gaeta would still be
selling nickel bags
on jefferson avenue

229
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,185
if it wasn't
for jackie.

230
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,187
Richie, build beansie
the ramp.

231
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:41,694
Terrible accident
that kid had.

232
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,196
Yeah,
it's done.

233
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,698
C'mon,
come here.

234
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,201
I got something
for you.

235
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,210
What's this?

236
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,713
"What's this"?
It's the jacket.

237
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,214
The jacket.

238
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,717
The jacket
i took off rocco dimeo.

239
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,719
Oh, yeah,
yeah.

240
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,222
Cocksucker had
the toughest reputation
in essex county.

241
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,725
But he never came back
after i got through with him.

242
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,226
He later died
of alzheimers.

243
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,728
Yeah?

244
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,229
Try it on.

245
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,231
It's your
fucking jacket.

246
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,733
You loved
this jacket.

247
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,235
You and my kid brother,
you would've killed
for this jacket.

248
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,738
Silk lining,
fine corinthian leather.

249
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,742
Nobody believed with my size
i could carry this jacket.

250
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,744
But with the belt
it was like rocco.

251
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,747
It's a nice jacket.

252
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,249
It's a beautiful
jacket.

253
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,252
But it's yours
to have now.

254
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:40,753
Why?

255
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,755
I gotta let go
of the past.

256
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,256
Like the tao says,

257
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,260
"you got to shut one door
before another one can open."

258
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,763
Is that
so hard to do?

259
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:57,269
You did it.

260
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,271
That's it,
that's it.

261
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,773
Oh!

262
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,775
Huh?

263
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,276
Perfect.

264
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,279
You look like robert evans
over here.

265
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,789
Thanks.

266
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,841
Is that all
tony said?

267
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,843
Did he say
anything else?

268
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,845
What the fuck do you
want him to do?

269
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,346
Give you a kiss
on the lips?

270
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,348
He said,"nice wagon,
where's his end?"

271
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,851
To kick upstairs
to tony soprano
would be an honor.

272
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,352
He the man.

273
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,354
I thought you said
i was the man.

274
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,356
He the man, i the man,
who the man?

275
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,859
"Are vee not men?"

276
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,866
Listen,

277
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,869
tony's cut from
this thing and that one,

278
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,871
that comes out of
your end, not mine.

279
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,373
That's how it is
in the beginning.

280
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,876
The dues concept,
we're down with that.

281
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,378
I laid out my whole take
on the diamond for ade anyway.

282
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,380
Adriana la cerva,

283
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,382
there's one hotty.

284
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,885
She loves me and these are
her child- bearing years.

285
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,387
I don't see myself
getting married though.

286
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,889
I get all
the'ho cake i need

287
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,892
and i can hire somebody
to wash my dishes
and iron my shirts.

288
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,894
Yeah, i could
see that.

289
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,398
No more burritos, or
you're not working with me.

290
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,901
Look at this
fucking place.

291
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:13,405
You imagine spending
day after day in here,
year after year?

292
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,443
Can i help you?

293
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,444
Miss gaeta?

294
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,946
We're here
to put in the ramp.

295
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,947
What ramp?

296
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,448
For your husband.

297
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,950
You're from rehab outreach
at st. Erasmus?

298
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,953
We're also supposed to
alter the toilets

299
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,456
and widen the doorways
and so on,

300
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,458
to make the house more
wheelchair accessible.

301
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,460
Who sent you
over here?

302
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,462
Richie aprile.

303
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,465
Richie aprile?

304
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,468
We should be done
by the time beansie's
home from the hospital.

305
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,970
Get out of here.

306
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,471
I don't want anything
to do with that man

307
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,475
after what
he did to peter.

308
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,477
She's got
her problems,

309
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:30,983
but i'm not gonna tell richie
this is not getting done.

310
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,994
Richie.

311
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,995
Donny!

312
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:47,499
This is matthew bevelaqua
and sean gismonte.

313
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,001
They're both
from west orange.

314
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,502
I'm back
to drinkwater.

315
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,504
It's fucking good
to meet you, richie.

316
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,006
My cousin louis gismonte
worked with you

317
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,008
in the prison sign shop
at east jersey.

318
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,009
Oh, yeah, lou.

319
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,011
About 5'8",
about 225.

320
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,014
I'm taking them over
to my uncle joey's lot
to look at iroc's.

321
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,017
They asked if they can
come by and say hello first.

322
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,518
You've been doing some things
with christopher molitsanti.

323
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,020
You know,
this and that.

324
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,022
The attitude on
that camel- nose fuck.

325
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,024
He ever lays his hand
on my niece again

326
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,526
i'm gonna tear him apart
piece by piece.

327
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,028
Camel nose!

328
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,529
You can't
make that shit up.

329
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,031
What the fuck are
you talking about?

330
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,532
I just did.

331
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,034
Did you ever notice
he's the only motherfucker

332
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,036
who can smoke
a cigarette in the rain

333
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,038
with his hands
tied behind his back?

334
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:31,043
That nose is like
a natural canopy.

335
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,045
The kid has
his good points.

336
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,547
I'm not saying
anything against him,
he's my homey.

337
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,049
Your what?

338
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,550
He lives up
near me.

339
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,052
Why didn't
you say that?

340
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,554
If you want to talk
like a fucking moulinyan,

341
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,057
we'll send you to
slip- and- fall school.

342
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,559
Fellas, c'mon,
time's up, let's go.

343
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,061
Richie, it was
good meeting you.

344
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,563
If there's ever anything
you can do for me

345
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,565
let me know.

346
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,573
Hi.

347
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,075
Oh, my god,
did we have a lunch?

348
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,077
I'm rushing out the door
to a deposition.

349
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,578
I was in
the neighborhood.

350
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,080
Downtown newark?

351
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,082
I think i goofed,
joannie.

352
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,584
I don't know how i got
into this conversation.

353
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,087
But carmela soprano,
from next door,

354
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,589
trapped me and asked me
if i'd ask you

355
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,592
to write her daughter
a letter of recommendation
to georgetown.

356
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,594
The gangster's wife?

357
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,595
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,598
She just blind- sided me
in the backyard.

359
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,100
What was i
supposed to say?

360
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,102
That i'm busy?
Which i am.

361
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,104
That i don't even
know the girl?

362
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,607
C'mon, you met meadow,
4th of july, at our barbecue.

363
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,109
That's not
what i mean.

364
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,111
You can't expect me
to do this.

365
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,612
It's just
a letter.

366
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,615
Bruce just wrote one
to u. V. M.

367
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,617
You do it
all the time.

368
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,620
Bring gangsters onto
the georgetown campus?

369
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,622
I don't think so.

370
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,624
Oh, spare me
the elitist bullshit.

371
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,625
They're
my neighbors.

372
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,127
Have you
lost your mind?

373
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,129
Carmela
asked me, joan.

374
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,630
What, are you
frightened?

375
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,132
What do you think
they're gonna do,

376
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,634
put you in cement boots
over a college application?

377
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,636
It's not that,
it's a question of manners.

378
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,138
What am i
supposed to say?

379
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,640
That i'm writing a letter
for someone else, which i am.

380
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,643
A wonderful young dominican boy
from the projects

381
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,145
with a 5. 2 average.

382
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,147
I have a reputation
to protect.

383
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,150
I knew
you wouldn't do it.

384
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,153
You want to be a doormat
for the rest of your life?

385
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:27,159
Just deal with it,
jeannie, okay?

386
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,661
It's no trouble at all
to add two more,

387
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,164
especially with miss meadow
among the missing.

388
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,165
Don't be silly.

389
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,166
We just dropped by
to pick up

390
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,168
some of ma's furniture
from the basement.

391
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,170
"Ma" now?

392
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,172
You, come over and sit
with me and anthony,

393
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,174
and let janice's friend
sit at the foot.

394
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,676
Grandpa, after dinner,
hot wheels?

395
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,677
Ooh.

396
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,180
Something
smells good.

397
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,681
See, it's much
cozier this way.

398
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,183
The more
the merrier.

399
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,684
This is what
it's all about.

400
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,187
Friends,
family.

401
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,189
That's what i missed
all those years.

402
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,191
You are always
welcome, richie.

403
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,693
I hope everyone's hungry
for crown roast.

404
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,195
Let me
help you.

405
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,696
No, ma, sit down,
sit down.

406
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:08,200
Janice, sit, i have
everything under control.

407
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,701
Oh, janice, sit.

408
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,204
Really, sit.

409
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,705
How's the jacket?

410
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,207
What jacket?

411
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,709
I gave your little brother
a beautiful leather jacket.

412
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,212
You still likin'
the jacket, ton'?

413
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,713
It's terrific.

414
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,715
Excuse me,
i gotta get the ginzu.

415
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:29,721
What jacket?

416
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,723
Where's my knife?

417
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,726
I want to compliment you
on your behavior out there.

418
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,729
I want him
where i can see him.

419
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,732
That's what we mea
n when we say family.

420
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm sorry,
i know i'm late.

421
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,243
I said you could stay
overnight at hunter's,

422
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,744
not miss
sunday dinner.

423
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,746
I said i'm sorry,
you could've paged me.

424
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,248
Was there any
mail yesterday?

425
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,250
It's right there
where it always is.

426
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,751
Go set yourself a place,
we have company.

427
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,261
What happened
to this?

428
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:10,762
Hello?

429
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,264
Carmela?
Hi.

430
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,266
It's jeannie cusamano.

431
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,268
Oh, hi, hi,
how are you?

432
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,770
Listen carmela,
i spoke to my sister

433
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,272
about the letter
for meadow,

434
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,775
and she's sorry, but
she can't do it, i'm sorry.

435
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,777
She can't,
why not?

436
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,281
Because she already wrote
a letter for someone else.

437
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,283
A wonderful young
dominican man

438
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,786
from the housing projects
with a 5. 2 average

439
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,788
and a crack- addict
mother,

440
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:42,294
and cerebral palsy.

441
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,796
So, what does that mean,
she can't send two?

442
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,300
Did you think about
asking one of the priests
at the church?

443
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,302
A letter
from father intintola

444
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,304
would probably mean
even more, i bet,

445
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,805
especially
at georgetown.

446
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,807
I gotta go, bye.

447
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,811
Good luck.

448
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,314
Who was that?

449
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,816
Can't send
2 what, mom?

450
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,318
It's nothing.

451
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,325
Joan.

452
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,327
I know you said you didn't
want to be interrupted,

453
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,330
but there's a carmela soprano
here to see you.

454
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,831
You're kidding.

455
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,333
She's not in your daytimer,
you want me to handle it?

456
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,836
Christ.

457
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,338
Send her in.

458
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,340
Excuse me.

459
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,841
Joan, hi.

460
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,843
Is this
a bad time?

461
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,345
Always.

462
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,848
C'mon in.

463
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,350
Ricotta pie
with pineapples.

464
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,352
I was in
the neighborhood.

465
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,354
My mother's foot surgeon
is over here.

466
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,357
Oh, thank you.

467
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,360
Listen, carmela, i think
i know why you're here.

468
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,362
My sister told me
you wanted me

469
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,865
to write a letter to georgetown
for "fielder", is it?

470
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,866
Meadow.

471
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,867
Sorry.

472
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,370
But i just
can't do it.

473
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,372
Well, i thought you would
at least want

474
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,874
to take a look
at her grades

475
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,376
and her sat scores
and some teacher comments

476
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,378
before you made up
your mind.

477
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,381
I think she would be
a wonderful addition
to the georgetown campus.

478
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,383
Then i'm sure
the admissions offices
will see that.

479
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,885
Well, i'm not
sure that's true.

480
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,388
The sad fact is that's just
not enough these days.

481
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,392
I'm sorry, carmela
, but i can't do it.

482
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,894
I don't think
you understand.

483
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,897
I want you
to write that letter.

484
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,899
Excuse me?

485
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,402
I said i want you
to write the letter.

486
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,403
Are you
threatening me?

487
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:32,904
Threat,
what threatening?

488
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,408
I brought you a ricotta pie
and high school transcripts

489
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,909
so you could write
a letter of recommendation

490
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,412
for my little daughter
to georgetown.

491
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,913
I'm an officer
of the court.

492
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,916
A lawyer.

493
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,419
Don't make me
beg here.

494
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,922
I've already written
my last letter of support

495
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,424
for this
academic year.

496
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:53,925
How about this,

497
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,428
i thought you could write
a letter to georgetown,

498
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,929
tell them
you discovered

499
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,931
that georgetown was not
that person's first choice,

500
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,933
and that in fact he was using
georgetown as a backup--

501
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,438
i'm not gonna tell you
what to write.

502
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,441
Oh my god, i left my mother
in the car with that foot.

503
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,444
Thanks for this.

504
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,957
Ask the kid
to fix me a burger.

505
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,459
Holy fuck,
shit.

506
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,961
We should've
at least said hello.

507
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:34,466
Or asked him what time
it was or something.

508
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,968
Think we should
go in?

509
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,471
How do i look?

510
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,473
Good.

511
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,475
Your hair, though,
yeah.

512
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,986
Hey, hi tony,
how the fuck's it going?

513
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:55,987
How ya doin'?

514
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,490
Matt drinkwater,
ivo bevelaqua's nephew.

515
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,991
My partner,
sean gismonte.

516
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,993
We're friends of christopher,
we worked the executive
card game.

517
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,496
I know,
how you doing?

518
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,498
That dancer,
destinee, out there?

519
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,501
I'd like to break my dick off
in that ass of hers.

520
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,014
Just so you know,
chrissy spoke to us about

521
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,017
you wanted we should give you
a taste from those tapes--

522
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,020
jesus fucking christ,
you stupid shit- eating twat.

523
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,024
You ever hear
of wiretaps?

524
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,526
Look what you did.

525
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,027
Because you made me
do all the talking.

526
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,029
You always
do that.

527
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,031
You get all quiet,
you leave me hanging

528
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,535
in the motherfucking
cocksucking wind.

529
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,038
What is so important
you're gonna make a man late
for the first post?

530
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,040
We heard from
gia gaeta

531
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,543
your little nephew
s ripped up the house

532
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,545
and then haven't
been back there.

533
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,048
I needed the guys
to do some work
on janice's mother's house.

534
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,552
Which all due respect
is also your boss's
mother's house.

535
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,554
Gentlemen.

536
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,055
Ton'.

537
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,559
These guys won't shut up
about this fucking ramp.

538
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,062
Richie,
relax, sit down.

539
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,064
I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

540
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,575
Where's
the jacket?

541
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,577
You're not
wearing the jacket.

542
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,580
It's in the car,
you want it back?

543
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,083
I gave tony a jacket
i took off rocco dimeo.

544
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,585
Cocksucker
had a reputation

545
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,087
as being the toughest guy
in essex county.

546
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:42,093
But he didn't come back here
when i got through with him.

547
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,095
...then we were doing
an interview and
i asked if i could do it...

548
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,599
carmela?

549
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,100
Hi.

550
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,602
Hi.

551
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,103
Jean, hi,
c'mon in.

552
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,104
Your plate.

553
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,107
My sister said
the ricotta pie
was delicious

554
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,610
and the family
loved it.

555
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,613
She also said that she reviewed
meadow's transcripts,

556
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,616
and she was knocked
the fuck out by those
teacher recommendations.

557
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,119
She sat right down
and wrote a terrific
letter to georgetown.

558
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,120
That's wonderful.

559
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,622
Yeah.

560
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,623
Do you have
a copy?

561
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,625
No, but i'll get you one,
no problem.

562
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,127
Thank you so much.

563
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:20,131
Jean, you are
a wonderful friend.

564
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,634
Did i tell you
how impressed joan was

565
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,136
with meadow's
transcripts?

566
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,138
You did,
thank you.

567
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,651
Howie t, bro,
blood's flaying on the mix.

568
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:45,156
We oughta score some vega's
to kick the fucking
bass up on this tv.

569
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,161
What the fuck,
what's that?

570
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,638
Fuck, it's that fucking
zip furio and somebody.

571
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,139
What the fuck?

572
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,642
Let him in before
he kicks the door down.

573
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,655
Furio, right?

574
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,156
We're here
for the money.

575
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:37,158
The money?

576
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,160
The boss money.

577
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,162
Oh, the money,
okay, sure.

578
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:47,669
Get tony's money.

579
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:49,671
Bella televisione.

580
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:53,675
Hdtv compatible.

581
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:56,678
You guys want
something to drink,
beer, soda?

582
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:58,680
Just the money.

583
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,188
10*, right?
75 hundred.

584
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:10,692
It's all there.

585
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:14,696
Give me
$1, 000.

586
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:16,197
$1, 000 more?

587
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,199
Christopher said
ten percent.

588
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,701
$1, 000.

589
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:21,202
I can't fucking
believe this.

590
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:22,704
You're ripping us off
for a g- note.

591
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,205
This is bullshit.

592
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:31,713
C'mon, hurry up.

593
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:51,733
What'd you
say to him?

594
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,234
Have a nice day.

595
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:15,757
Jesus fucking
mother of christ,
christopher.

596
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,259
You want one?

597
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:22,764
No, i'll have
a puff of yours.

598
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:23,765
Man.

599
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:30,271
I know.

600
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,274
If i knew it was gonna
keep getting better and better,

601
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,777
i would have asked you
to marry me sooner.

602
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,780
Like it wasn't
always good?

603
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,282
Ow.

604
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:43,284
Christopher.

605
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:45,787
What?

606
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:47,789
Nothing,
just--

607
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:49,791
i love my ring.

608
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,298
T was right.

609
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,801
He set me straight
that shit he said to me.

610
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,303
No more
distractions...

611
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:06,307
focus, no drugs,
eye on the prize.

612
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:09,310
I'm back on track,
adriana.

613
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,814
I'm rededicating myself
right down the line.

614
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,818
I don't know
why we always fight.

615
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:18,820
It's my fault.

616
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,822
I don't
communicate my needs.

617
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,824
We waste
so much time.

618
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:24,325
You're right.

619
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:30,331
Let's not--

620
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,333
i love you so much.

621
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,335
I love you, too.

622
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,353
Lilliana,
can you get that?

623
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,857
Richie!

624
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:58,359
What a surprise,
what brings you this way?

625
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,861
How are you
today, dear?

626
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,363
This is to thank you
for sunday dinner.

627
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:04,365
Some tripe and tomatoes
i made.

628
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:08,369
We gotta be the only two people
who still like tripe.

629
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,872
My god, richie,
thank you.

630
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:13,374
It's for you,
for later, for dinner,

631
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:15,376
for whatever
you want to do with it.

632
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,880
The kids are gonna freak out
when they see this.

633
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,883
I just made some fresh drip,
do you want a cup?

634
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:25,386
Sure, why not?

635
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,388
So, richie,

636
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:29,891
you and par--
janice...

637
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,893
this is no
flash in the pan.

638
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:35,396
Yeah, it's ironic
how life works.

639
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,398
She goes to sri lanka
or wherever,

640
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,400
i go where i went...

641
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:44,405
and here we are back
where we started 20 years ago.

642
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,408
For every shoe
there is a mate.

643
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:49,410
Mrs. Carmela,

644
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,914
sorry, but my husband has come
to get the extra tv set
from the basement

645
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,415
you said
i could have.

646
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:59,921
Sure,
go right ahead.

647
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:05,426
If there is one thing
we don't lack around here
it's television sets.

648
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:07,929
Lilliana, the remote is
down there somewhere, too.

649
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,931
It's on the shelves.

650
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,433
Hello, mrs. ,
thank you for tv.

651
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:16,437
Oh, please,
enjoy.

652
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,939
The poor thing.

653
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:20,942
In poland he was
a mechanical engineer,

654
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,443
here's he's
driving a cab.

655
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:25,446
What's the matter,
you alright?

656
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:29,450
I'm fine,
i'm fine.

657
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:30,952
I gotta go.

658
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:42,964
Answering machine.

659
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:44,966
Friggin' christopher,
where is he?

660
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:46,968
He's always here.

661
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,987
This is fucked.

662
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,488
What?

663
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:09,490
This, us,
look at us.

664
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,993
We're like two fucking
scared rabbits or something,

665
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:12,994
douchebags.

666
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:14,495
Don't say that.

667
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:16,497
Sean, for chrissakes,
grow up to reality.

668
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,999
We are nowhere.

669
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:21,002
Buying fish, punching safes,
what is that, for what?

670
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:23,004
We're just getting started,
it's what you do.

671
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,006
We got
stockbroker licenses.

672
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:27,508
I went to
pace college.

673
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:36,517
Fuck.

674
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,019
It's true, huh?

675
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:39,520
We're fucked.

676
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,026
We gotta do something
to get ahead in this world.

677
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:48,029
Mom, i don't believe it
and don't try to deny it!

678
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,032
I told you not to let
lilliana into my room!

679
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:53,534
Look at the money they waste
on these cd roms.

680
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:56,537
"Mindspring",
"earthlink",

681
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:58,039
what are these,
exactly?

682
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:00,041
I don't know and
don't change the subject,

683
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,042
it's my room!

684
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,543
There were clothes
a foot deep on the floor.

685
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:05,046
You had half
the bath towels in there.

686
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,047
Don't exaggerate!

687
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,049
Wet, it was
starting to smell.

688
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,051
It's my room and if
i want it like that

689
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,552
that's the way
i want it!

690
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:13,054
I don't bitch you out
about your room.

691
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:15,056
Your room
is in my house.

692
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,057
And as long as
you live in my house,

693
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:17,558
there are
gonna be limits.

694
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:19,560
I won't be here for long,
i'm 18 years old!

695
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,062
I'm going to be going
to college soon,

696
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:23,564
i can take care of myself
so just bug out, okay?

697
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:24,065
Oh, you can?

698
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:29,570
That's right!

699
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,572
You know what?
You're right.

700
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:34,075
You are right.

701
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,576
You can take care
of yourself.

702
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:37,578
Thank you.

703
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:41,582
You're gonna be going off
all on your own
to a wonderful college.

704
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:44,085
What right do i have
to interfere?

705
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,104
What's going on?

706
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,106
Nothing i can
think of.

707
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:08,609
Except
it's tuesday, 3:00.

708
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:15,616
So we gotta
talk about something.

709
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:18,619
Okay,
spin the wheel.

710
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,122
Here's something
that's been bothering me.

711
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,624
I gave
my daughter a car.

712
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:24,625
Really?

713
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,127
Yeah, used car,

714
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:28,129
one of those suv's,
a'92 pathfinder.

715
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:31,632
The thing is, it belonged to
a friend of hers from school,

716
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:33,134
and it came
into my possession

717
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:36,137
because of a debt
incurred to me
by the kid's father.

718
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,139
And this is the way
he elected to make payment.

719
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,142
You gave her
her friend's car.

720
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,144
It was a nice,
safe car,

721
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:45,146
to which
i had the pink slip.

722
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,647
What's bothering you?

723
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:49,150
I must've know
n that she'd know

724
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,652
that it was this
fucking kid eric's car

725
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:53,654
and how i got it,
you know,

726
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:56,157
and she'd freak out.

727
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,159
Then why'd
you give it to her?

728
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,164
I don't know.

729
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,166
For all these years

730
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:11,172
i've been shielding her
and protecting her
from certain truths.

731
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:13,674
So now i want to
rub her nose in it?

732
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,176
Any thoughts
on that?

733
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:23,684
This kid's father,
he's a fucking
degenerate gambler.

734
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:27,188
But he's also a respected
businessman in the community

735
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,690
and everything that
goes along with that.

736
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,192
One of your
happy wanderers.

737
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:36,197
How do you
remember this shit?

738
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:39,200
So, it becomes my fault
that he lost his kid's car?

739
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,702
I gotta look out for him
because he's a sick bastard?

740
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:43,704
My friend artie bucco's
got a restaurant, right?

741
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:46,207
Now, believe me,
no one's telling him

742
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,209
to refuse
a plate of fettucini

743
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:51,712
to some fat fuck
that wanders in that's
eating himself to death.

744
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:54,715
Maybe that's what you were
saying to your daughter.

745
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:55,716
What?

746
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:57,218
By giving her the suv,

747
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:01,722
wanting her to confront
some of these
moral ambiguities.

748
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:03,224
English.

749
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:07,228
Meadow's going to be going
away to college next year.

750
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:09,230
Yeah, that's why
she needs the car.

751
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,731
Leaving the nest.

752
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:12,733
Not those
fucking ducks again.

753
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:14,735
Maybe you were
preparing her for reality,

754
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,237
teaching her to fly.

755
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:17,738
You people
are something.

756
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,240
I gave my
little daughter a car

757
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,242
to rub her face
in shit,

758
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,745
and you're telling me
i did something noble?

759
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:30,751
We're getting
to something here.

760
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,253
Time's up.

761
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:34,255
We still have time
and we're doing good work.

762
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:37,258
What?
You feel you're cured?

763
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,260
Fine,
i'll sit here.

764
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,762
But i got
nothing else to say.

765
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:49,770
Yeah,
you called me?

766
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:52,773
Oh, get the fuck
out of here, paulie.

767
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:54,775
I'm supposed to go
all the way over there

768
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,777
to check on
a fucking ramp?

769
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,779
Yo, christopher,
what's up?

770
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:03,284
What's up, man?

771
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:07,788
Get that
motherfucker!

772
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:08,789
Get him!

773
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,292
Fucking seatbelt!

774
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:38,319
Richie.

775
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:39,320
Yeah.

776
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,821
Matt drinkwater,
bevelaqua.

777
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:43,324
You hear what happened
to christopher moltisanti?

778
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,825
Yeah, somebody
blew him up.

779
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:46,327
It was us,
me and sean.

780
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,329
You?

781
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,332
Sean is fucking dead,
christopher killed him.

782
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,834
So, what the fuck
are you doing here?

783
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,336
We did it for you
as a favor.

784
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:57,338
What the fuck
are you talking about?

785
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:58,339
'Cause you
don't like him.

786
00:40:58,839 --> 00:40:59,340
So what?

787
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,842
He hit
your niece.

788
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:03,844
Jesus, are you
fucking crazy?

789
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:05,846
That's all i need now

790
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,348
for that two- faced
ungrateful fuck

791
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:09,350
to think i had
any part of this.

792
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,851
You gotta
help me, man.

793
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:15,356
I'll help you,
i'll fucking help you!

794
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:17,358
You gotta hide me,
i'm with you now.

795
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:18,859
Who told you
to do that?

796
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,363
Get out of here,
you dumb fuck,
i'll kill you!

797
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:41,882
How can this happen?

798
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:45,886
How could
this happen?
