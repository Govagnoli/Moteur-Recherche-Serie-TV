NOBODY EVER WENT BROKE
UNDERESTIMATING THE TASTE
 OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

5
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,566
<i>THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS</i>

6
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,282
<i>POSTULATED SEVEN SOULS.</i>

7
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:06,705
<i>THE TOP SOUL</i>
 <i>AND THE FIRST TO LEAVE </i>
 <i>AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH</i>

8
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:10,049
<i>IS REN:</i>
 <i>THE SECRET NAME.</i>

9
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,343
<i>THIS CORRESPONDS</i>
 <i>TO MY DIRECTOR.</i>

10
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,493
<i>HE DIRECTS</i>
 <i>THE FILM OF YOUR LIFE</i>

11
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:17,880
<i>FROM CONCEPTION</i>

12
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,415
<i>TO DEATH.</i>

13
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:24,169
<i>"THE SECRET NAME"</i>
 <i>IS THE TITLE OF YOUR FILM.</i>

14
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:29,386
<i>WHEN YOU DIE,</i>
 <i>THAT'S WHERE REN CAME IN.</i>

15
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,163
<i>SECOND SOUL</i>

16
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:39,032
<i>AND SECOND ONE</i>
 <i>IS SEKEM:</i>

17
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:42,036
<i>ENERGY, POWER, LIGHT.</i>

18
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,514
<i>THE DIRECTOR GIVES THE ORDERS,</i>

19
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,663
<i>SEKEM PRESSES</i>
 <i>THE RIGHT BUTTONS.</i>

20
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:01,744
<i>NUMBER THREE IS KHU:</i>
 <i>THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.</i>

21
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,125
<i>HE, SHE OR IT</i>
 <i>IS THIRD MAN OUT.</i>

22
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,823
<i>NUMBER FOUR IS BA:</i>
 <i>THE HEART--</i>

00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:11,891
<i>OFTEN TREACHEROUS.</i>

24
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,941
<i>NUMBER FIVE IS KA:</i>
 <i>THE DOUBLE.</i>

25
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:24,133
<i>THE KA, WHICH USUALLY</i>
 <i>REACHES ADOLESCENCE</i>

26
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,773
<i>AT THE TIME</i>
 <i>OF BODILY DEATH,</i>

27
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:30,295
<i>IS THE ONLY RELIABLE GUIDE</i>
 <i>THROUGH THE LAND OF THE DEAD.</i>

28
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,176
WHO'S GONNA LIVE HERE?

29
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:35,883
A FAMILY.

30
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,280
I'LL HAVE IT
 FINISHED BY OCTOBER.

31
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,218
- I'M WORRIED, ADE.
 - EVERYBODY'S WORRIED.

32
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,766
NO. I AM WORRIED
 ALL THE TIME.

33
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,488
<i>NUMBER SIX IS KHAIBIT:</i>

34
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,370
<i>THE SHADOW, MEMORY,</i>

35
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:05,910
<i>YOUR WHOLE PAST CONDITIONING</i>

36
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:08,135
<i>FROM THIS AND OTHER LIVES.</i>

37
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:14,824
<i>NUMBER SEVEN IS SEKHU:</i>

38
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,168
<i>THE REMAINS.</i>

39
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:23,211
I'M HALFWAY TO CHINA.
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

40
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,262
40,000 I HAD--

41
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,607
MY SHARE OF
 THE BOHACK'S HAUL
 FROM THE '70s.

42
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:31,305
DID YOU WRAP IT RIGHT?
IT GETS MOLDY--
IT COULD'VE DISINTEGRATED.

43
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,402
- WRAP WHAT?
 - THE MONEY.

44
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,557
HE KNOWS I NEED THAT MONEY
 FOR MY FUCKING RETRIAL!

45
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:39,727
- WHO?
- YOU KNOW WHO.

46
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:42,279
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHO.
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU.

47
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,605
- MALANGA.
 - WILL YOU STOP WITH THAT?

48
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,126
PUSSY MALANGA'S DEAD
SIX YEARS NOW.

49
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,227
I SHOULD DIG HIM UP
ALREADY!

50
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:55,552
MOLES.

51
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,790
THEY CHEWING
THROUGH YOUR SPRINKLERS TOO?

52
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,204
40,000 I HAD--

53
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,170
MY SHARE OF
 THE BOHACK'S HAUL
 FROM THE '70s.

54
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,724
WE'LL LOOK LATER.
 YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE
 FOR YOUR DOCTOR'S.
 COME ON.

55
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,499
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING:
IS YOUR TIME
MORE VALUABLE
THAN MINE?

56
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:26,849
WHERE'S THE BABY?

57
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,429
Bacala:
SORRY, TON'. THE CAR SEAT,
THE OTHER STUFF--

58
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,532
PACKIN' IT IN THERE
 TAKES FOREVER.

59
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,488
YOU PROBABLY
 REMEMBER THAT.

60
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,260
NO, I DON'T.
I DIDN'T DO THAT CRAP.

61
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,211
HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
UNCLE JUN', HUH?

62
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,117
HE'S LATE ENOUGH, JANICE.
COME ON.

63
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:41,895
A HELLO TO YOUR NIECE,
 MAYBE?

64
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,548
HI, SWEETIE.
HOW ARE YOU?

65
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,481
HELP HIM GET READY,
 WILL YOU?

66
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,164
- YEAH.
- COME ON, JUN'.

67
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,038
- SO? HOW'S HE DOING?

68
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,998
- HE'S KNUCKLEHEAD SMITH,
 THAT'S HOW HE'S DOING.

69
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,742
HE'S PARANOID.
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER
WHETHER HE ATE OR NOT.

70
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,445
THE MAN IS NOT
COMPETENT, TONY.
 - NOT AGAIN, COME ON!

71
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,557
- HE HAS THE MONEY
 FOR ASSISTED LIVING.

72
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:06,923
HE'S GOT LEGAL BILLS
 UP THE ASS.

73
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:09,396
HE CAN SELL THIS MUSEUM
AND MOVE TO GREEN GROVE.

74
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:10,963
FUCK ASSISTED LIVING, OKAY?

75
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,713
REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID TO MA?
- SHE WAS THRIVING THERE, TONY.

76
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,643
- HE STAYS WHERE HE IS, JANICE.

77
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:18,078
HE'S OUR UNCLE.
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

78
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,698
SO THE SPLIT,
 YOUR FRIEND IN JERSEY

79
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:23,433
SAYS IT SHOULD BE THE SAME
AS THE OLD BUSINESS
WE DO OVER THERE.

80
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,682
THAT'S PUBLIC WORKS,
THIS ISN'T.
- I'LL HOLD THE LINE.

81
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,093
- DON'T TURN IT INTO
 WORLD WAR III.

82
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,529
SO DAY TO DAY,
 HOW ARE YOU GETTING
 ALONG WITH TONY?

83
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:35,154
YOU ASKED ME
 TO BURY THE HATCHET, JOHN.

84
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,361
I'M DOING IT
 OUT OF RESPECT TO YOU.

85
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,631
AM I STILL GRIEVING
 OVER MY BROTHER BILL?

86
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,350
IT'LL NEVER GO AWAY.

87
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,074
I APPRECIATE IT, PHIL.

88
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:48,387
- WITH ME IN HERE--
 - I HEAR YOU, JOHN.

89
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:55,822
YOUR BRIDE--

90
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,143
SHE'S A ROCK
 FOR YOU, KID.

91
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:02,072
<i>HER BROTHER'S</i>
 <i>FITTING ME</i>
 <i>FOR CONTACTS.</i>

92
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,833
WHEN THE TRIAL STARTS,
 I DON'T WANNA BE
 READING DOCUMENTS

93
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:06,769
IN THE COURTROOM
 WITH GLASSES. IT LOOKS WEAK.

94
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:13,635
- HEY, TON'.
 - <i>HEY.</i>

95
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,952
MY SPORTS BOOK
 DOWN IN ROSEVILLE,
 BACALA'S STILL MAKING
 THINGS UNPLEASANT.

96
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:21,581
- GOD DAMN IT.

97
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:22,878
- LISTEN, TONY,

98
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,589
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

99
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,188
FOR YOU, CARM, THE KIDS--
 DAVID YURMAN WATCHES.

100
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:32,350
18-KARAT GOLD,
DIAMOND CENTER.

101
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,679
WHY DO I GET THE FEELIN'
THERE'S A JEWELER SOMEWHERE

102
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:37,064
FILIN' AN INSURANCE
CLAIM TODAY?

103
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,408
ACTUALLY,
 THAT AIN'T WHAT IT IS.

104
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,171
- MY AUNT EDIE DIED.
 - NO?

105
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,734
THAT ONE THAT
MOVED TO CALIFORNIA
BACK IN THE '60s?

106
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:49,331
SHE WAS A GREAT LADY,
 THE ONLY PERSON IN MY LIFE
 WHO EVER MADE ME
 FEEL SPECIAL.

107
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,008
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

108
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:55,251
ANYWAY, THE SILVER CLOUD
IS SHE DID PRETTY WELL.

109
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,870
SHE WAS MARRIED
TO VICTOR BORGE'S AGENT.

110
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,568
SHE LEFT ME
 AN INHERITANCE, TON'.

111
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:01,731
JUST OVER TWO MIL.

112
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,028
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

113
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,554
MAKE SURE YOU INVEST IT.

114
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,225
WELL, YOU KNOW,
 THAT'S KINDA WHAT I WANTED
 TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

115
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,887
DEANNE AND ME
 AND THE KIDS,
 YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
 WE LOVE FLORIDA, RIGHT?

116
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,513
WHAT, DO YOU
WANNA PUT SOME MONEY
ON THE STREET DOWN THERE?

117
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,739
I WAS THINKING ABOUT BUYING
 A PLACE IN FORT MYERS.

118
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,060
- RETIRING THERE, ACTUALLY.

119
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,052
- RETIRING?
WHAT, ARE YOU
A HOCKEY PLAYER?

120
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:33,133
I'M GONNA BE 50
 IN THREE YEARS, TON'.

121
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:34,915
MY DAD DIED AT 52.

122
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,873
YOU TOOK AN OATH, GENE.
 THERE'S NO RETIRIN' FROM THIS.

123
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:41,631
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,
 AND THERE <i>WAS</i> JOE BANANAS.

124
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,627
( chuckles ) 
 COME ON, HUH?

125
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,515
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SPORTS BOOK,
 YOUR OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES?

126
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,784
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
 TO DO ABOUT THOSE?
BENNY?

127
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,945
WE KNOW
BOBBY WANTS IT.

128
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,745
IT'S JUST-- WE GO BACK
 A LONG WAY, TON'.

129
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,028
YEAH, WE DO.

130
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:05,775
FUCKIN' C.Y.O. BASKETBALL,
 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

131
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,474
IT'D MEAN A LOT
TO ME AND DEANNE.

132
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,068
WELL, LET ME
 THINK ABOUT IT.

133
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,277
OOH, LOOK AT THIS ONE
WITH THE POOL.

134
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,247
YEAH, WE COULD
GO SWIMMING.

135
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:28,075
GUESS WHO'S BLOCKING
 THE DRIVEWAY AGAIN.

136
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:29,301
DID YOU TALK
 TO TONY?

137
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,159
IT LOOKS GOOD.
 HE GAVE ME A HUG.

138
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,882
- DID HE LIKE THE WATCHES?
 - DO I KNOW MY PSYCHOLOGY?

139
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:36,007
THE REALTOR CALLED.
 SHE'S E-MAILING SOME PICTURES.

140
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:39,104
- THE ONE ON RIVER ROAD?
- THE SPLIT LEVEL--
 THE FOUR-BEDROOM.

141
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:40,797
THEY LOST THE BUYER?

142
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,333
HEY, THERE HE IS.

143
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:45,623
WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?

144
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,980
- KEVIN'S.
 - WHO ELSE IS
 GONNA BE THERE?

145
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,136
- GENE.
- I DON'T KNOW.

146
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,352
WHAT'S WITH THIS HOSTILITY
 ALL THE TIME? YOU WANT
 A SMACK IN THE MOUTH?

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,900
I TOLD YOU I'M NOT
 GETTING HIGH ANYMORE!
 - I BELIEVE YOU.

148
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,605
- STOP FUCKING TOUCHING ME.
- WATCH YOUR MOUTH
IN FRONT OF YOUR SISTER!

149
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,676
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
 WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE!

150
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,412
SPICY SHRIMP HAND ROLL,
THAT'S NORI'S FAVORITE,

151
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:26,693
SPECIAL YELLOWTAIL,
TORO SCALLION AND OYSTERS.

152
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,556
YOU TELL ME
WHEN YOU WANNA STOP.

153
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,111
WELL, KEEP IT COMIN'.

154
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,215
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
 BUT EVER SINCE WE FOUND
 THIS PLACE,

155
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,501
I CATCH MYSELF
 FANTASIZING ABOUT THIS.

156
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:38,440
ME TOO.
SOMETIMES DURING SEX.

157
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,813
SO I HAD A NIGHTMARE
THE OTHER NIGHT.
DID I WAKE YOU UP?

158
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,522
- NO.
- ADE WAS IN THE HOUSE,

159
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:48,036
MY SPEC HOUSE.

160
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,355
WAS SHE GONNA BUY IT?

161
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,188
WE WERE JUST TALKING.

162
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,773
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
 DID YOU CALL THAT GUY,

163
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,899
THE INSPECTOR
 AT THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT?

164
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,559
- I WILL. I PROMISE.
 - HE'S COMING ON FRIDAY, TONY.

165
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:02,419
THAT COULD BE MY LAST CHANCE TO GET
 A REVERSAL ON THE STOP-WORK ORDER.

166
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,162
ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL.

167
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,249
I WONDER WHERE SHE IS.

168
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,512
- ADE.
 - I TOLD YOU,
 SHE PROBABLY MET SOME GUY.

169
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,425
AND NOT CALL ANYONE
 FOR OVER A YEAR?

170
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,318
WHAT'S THIS,
THIS SAUCE ON THE SHRIMP?

171
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:17,366
SHIROMI, TEKKA MAKI,
 SALMON WITH TOMATO.

172
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,391
SO I WAS OVER
 BY GINNY'S--

173
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,771
THAT SITUATION IS
 NOT GOING SO WELL.

174
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,702
JOHNNY COOPED UP
 AND AWAITING TRIAL,

175
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,074
PLUS NOW THEY'RE FIGHTING
 AN ASSET SEIZURE.

176
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:30,344
THEY COULD LOSE EVERYTHING--
THE HOUSE, THE CONDO
AT THE SHORE.

177
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,786
YOU KNOW JIMMY PETRILLE,
THE RAT THAT GAVE UP JOHN?

178
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:36,997
HE'S LIKE AN UNCLE TO HIM,
HIS FATHER'S <i>COMPARE.</i>

179
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,901
WHY DO YOU THINK
I TOSS AT NIGHT?
AIN'T JUST THE APNEA.

180
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,496
I NOTICED YOU
 HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING
 YOUR ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

181
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,210
AND YET, THE BONEFISH
ARE BACK IN SEASON.

182
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,676
WE SHOULD COUNT OUR BLESSINGS,
THE KIND OF YEAR I JUST HAD.

183
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,752
YOU'RE RIGHT.
 WE'RE VERY LUCKY.

184
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:54,958
$40 FOR A PIECE OF FISH
THEY JUST FLEW IN FIRST CLASS.

185
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,702
I THINK WE'RE
 MORE THAN LUCKY.

186
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,641
GREAT FOOD IN THERE.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
 YOU WANNA KEEP
 THIS BAGGIE OR SHALL I?

187
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,349
- NAH, YOU KEEP IT FOR LUNCH.
 - OKAY.

188
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:06,967
WE'RE HERE.

189
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,950
THANKS FOR DINNER, HESH.

190
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:11,114
GREASE IS COMING THROUGH
THE BAG AS USUAL.

191
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,620
CHINESE FOOD--
 IT'S PART OF THE TRADITION.

192
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,546
WHAT THE--

193
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:27,216
COME ON, COME ON!
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?

194
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:29,789
GET OUTTA HERE,
 GET OUTTA HERE!

195
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,448
- OPEN UP, ELI!

196
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,385
- GET OUT!

197
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,528
- GET OUTTA HERE!

198
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:36,275
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
 I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!

199
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,391
FUCKING JEW!

200
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,934
HOLY SHIT, THEY'RE TRYING
 TO BURN US OUT!

201
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,031
- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
- GET OUT, HESH!

202
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:47,743
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

203
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,203
- JERRY WARNED YOU, ELI!

204
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:57,532
JERRY FUCKING TOLD YOU
 TO STAY OUTTA BROOKLYN!

205
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,974
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOIN'?
YOU'RE GONNA KILL THIS GUY.

206
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:03,769
FUCK YOU, GRANDPA!

207
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,832
I TELL YOU, ONE OF
THE BEST THINGS ABOUT
DROPPING THE WEIGHT,

208
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:14,420
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

209
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,869
I KEEP THIS UP,
I'M GONNA NEED
CLOTHING ANONYMOUS.

210
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,597
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED 
YOUR SPONSOR BEFORE YOU
BOUGHT <i>THAT</i> JACKET.

211
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,325
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

212
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,864
MEMBERS ONLY?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
 BEEN WEARING THAT?

213
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,391
<i>CUGINO MIO!</i>

214
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:31,384
YOU LOOK SHARP.
 HOW DO YOU FEEL?

215
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,171
TWO MILES I WALK
 EVERY MORNIN'.

216
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,491
I GOTTA TALK TO AUNT LENORE.
SAY HELLO TO MARIE FOR ME.

217
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:37,791
HOLD ON,

218
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,483
LET ME GET THAT NUMBER, THE CUSTOM CUFFLINKS.
- OH YEAH.

219
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,048
WHAT'D THAT PRICK WANT?

220
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,747
REALLY SOMETHING, ISN'T HE,
 WITH THAT JERK-OFF FACE?

221
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:47,642
THE EYEBROWS--
I FUCKING CAN'T STAND HIM.

222
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,428
I GOTTA TELL YOU THOUGH,
HE SURPRISED ME.

223
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:53,498
HE'S ACTING BOSS,

224
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:56,211
TAKES CARE
 OF JOHN'S BUSINESS,

225
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,525
PLUS THE WIFE
 WHILE JOHN'S IN JAIL.

226
00:13:58,696 --> 00:13:59,829
<i>NO COMPLAINTS.</i>

227
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,466
<i>HE'S REAL OLD SCHOOL.</i>

228
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:03,522
GOTTA TAKE
MY HAT OFF.

229
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:05,349
COCKSUCKER
WANTED ME KILLED?

230
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:06,797
WHAT'S PAST IS PAST.

231
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,351
LEAVE IT ALONE.

232
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,709
THINGS ARE
 GOING GOOD NOW.

233
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,480
YOU AND PHIL STLE
THAT OFFICE PARK SHIT?

234
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,443
WE SAID
 WE'D REVISIT IT.

235
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,134
AGENT HARRIS,
 WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

236
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,293
I GOT SOME NEW FEDERALE
 IN MY REAR VIEW
 FOR SIX MONTHS.

237
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,435
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN
 IN PAKISTAN.
- GET THE FUCK OUT.

238
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,227
- SERIOUSLY. I WAS TRANSFERRED
 TO TERRORISM.

239
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,201
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
RON GODDARD.
TONY SOPRANO.

240
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:30,084
THE TERRORIST
 SQUAD, HUH?

241
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:32,694
- WHAT, DID YOU LOSE
 A LITTLE WEIGHT?

242
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,409
YOU LOOK GOOD.
 ATKINS, RIGHT?

243
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:38,302
I CAUGHT A PARASITE OVER THERE.
 DOCTORS DON'T KNOW
 WHAT IT IS.

244
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,692
- WHAT DO THEY EAT, TABOULEH?
 - <i>ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHY</i>
 <i> I'M HERE.</i>

245
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:43,749
I'VE BEEN DYING
 FOR A SATRIALE'S
 VEAL PARM HERO.

246
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:51,505
FUCK HIM.
I HOPE THAT PARASITE
EATS HIS ASSHOLE OFF.

247
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,724
I KINDA FEEL BAD
FOR THE GUY.

248
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,201
SHIT, WHEN DID
 THIS HAPPEN?

249
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,431
HOLD ON.
TON' JUST COME IN.

250
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,202
IT'S HESH.

251
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,532
HERE, HONEY.
 IT'S ICE.

252
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,498
THANK YOU.

253
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:25,599
BETH, HOW'RE YOU DOIN'?

254
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,326
I'VE HAD BETTER WEEKS.

255
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:29,813
COULD YOU GET ME
 SOME COFFEE, SWEETIE?

256
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,165
- ANYONE ELSE?

257
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,487
- HOT WATER WITH LEMON
 WOULD BE GREAT.

258
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,582
MY SON-IN-LAW AND ME,
 WE'RE HAVING DINNER SUNDAY,

259
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:42,504
CHINESE RESTAURANT
 NEAR MILL BASIN,

260
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:45,739
- WE GET JUMPED
 BY THREE GUYS IN A LEXUS.
 - CHINKS DID THIS?

261
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,479
- ARE YOU TRYING
 TO BE FUCKING FUNNY?

262
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:49,776
- WHAT? I WAS SERIOUS.

263
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,421
- THEY'RE WITH
 YOUR COUSIN PHIL LEOTARDO.
 - I TOLD YOU HE WAS A PRICK!

264
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,669
- WE WERE JUST WITH HIM.
- LET HIM TALK.

265
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:57,003
I GOT SOME MONEY
 ON THE STREET OVER THERE.

266
00:15:57,232 --> 00:16:00,415
APPARENTLY, IT GOT BACK
 TO PHIL'S GUY
 - GERRY TORCIANO.

267
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:03,651
- THE HAIRDO?
 HE CLAIMS THAT HE FELT
 THAT ELI HERE WAS

268
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,957
SOME INDEPENDENT SHY
 TRYING TO POACH
 HIS CUSTOMERS.

269
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,623
- IS THAT A FUCKING CATHETER?
 - <i>MASSIVE INTERNAL BLEEDING,</i>

270
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:11,892
HALF HIS FUCKING SKIN
IS SHEARED OFF HIS HIPS.

271
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,715
MY DAUGHTER'S
 BESIDES HERSELF.

272
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,806
YOU SEND SOMEBODY TO BROOKLYN,
 AND YOU TALK TO PHIL
 ABOUT THIS MOOK, THIS

273
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:17,941
- GERRY TORCIANO.

274
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,054
SORRY I YELLED
 AT YOU, KID.

275
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,088
I'M INSTALLING GABLE JOISTS
 IN THE ROTUNDA.

276
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:47,812
I'M AFRAID
 I'M GONNA HAVE TO AGREE
 WITH THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT.

277
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,832
OH, FOR THE LOVE
OF MIKE!

278
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,108
THIS IS PINE, SIR--
 UTILITY GRADE.

279
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,125
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.
 I'VE BEEN BUILDING HOUSES
 FOR YEARS.

280
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,721
THEN YOU KNOW
 THAT THE CODE CALLS
 FOR DOUG FIR GRADE,

281
00:16:57,822 --> 00:17:01,092
STAMPED FOR ALL FLOOR
 JOISTS, CEILING JOISTS,
 LINTELS AND RAFTERS.

282
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,813
GET PUDGIE WALSH ON THE HORN.
HE'LL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.

283
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,938
PUDGIE WALSH RETIRED, SIR.

284
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:08,652
I'M AFFIRMING
THE STOP-WORK ORDER.

285
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,944
- OH, COME ON!

286
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,137
IS THERE NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO?
 - FOR GOD'S SAKE!

287
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,058
YOU CAN SCHEDULE
 A FURTHER APPEAL.

288
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,667
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
 I'D THINK ABOUT STARTING OVER
 WITH THE PROPER LUMBER.

289
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:25,078
GOD, 15 TIMES
 I ASKED YOU!

290
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,864
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS DOES
TO MY COST BASIS,

291
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,374
- TO START OVER WITH THIS?
 - IT'S BUREAUCRATIC BULLSHIT!

292
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:31,255
- IN MY DAY,
 THEY'D TURN A BLIND EYE.

293
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:34,802
- I HIRED YOU TO DO A JOB!
 - HIRED? I'M NOT FOR HIRE.

294
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,731
YOU PRESENTED THIS
 LIKE WE WERE PARTNERS.

295
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,240
- YOU DON'T LISTEN
 TO ANYBODY, DO YOU?

296
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:42,496
TO HELL WITH THIS.
 NO GOOD DEED GOES
 UNPUNISHED.

297
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:47,510
- ARTIE. HO.

298
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,763
MENUS.

299
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:58,282
- IS THAT PHIL?
- MY WIFE.

300
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,126
WHAT'S IT TAKE TO GET THAT GUY
 TO RETURN A PHONE CALL?

301
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:03,667
I WANT THIS HESH THING
SETTLED.

302
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,126
GENTLEMEN,

303
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,367
START YOUR ENGINES.

304
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:09,728
JESUS CHRIST, ARTIE,
 I CAN RECITE THAT MENU
 IN MY SLEEP.

305
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,423
WHERE DID HE
 GET THIS BREAD,
THE BREAD MUSEUM?

306
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,809
THE ANTIPASTE?

307
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,414
FUCKIN' PHIL.
 NOW I GOTTA GO SEE
 THE OPTOMETRIST

308
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,971
TO GET A MESSAGE TO JOHN
 ABOUT THIS.

309
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,493
GO THROUGH GINNY'S BROTHER?

310
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,578
HE'S A <i>STUNAD</i>
 OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE.

311
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,309
I NEED A BACK CHANNEL
 TO JOHN, OBVIOUSLY.

312
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,247
- WHAT THE FUCK IS IT?

313
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,315
I CAN'T CATCH
A FUCKING BREAK!

314
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,288
THIS IS TONY SOPRANO

315
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,846
TALKING ABOUT
THE ANGELO GIACOLONE MURDER.

316
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,713
THE SOUND QUALITY
 IS NOT GOOD,

317
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:44,910
BUT I CAN BACK IT UP
IN COURT.

318
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:46,556
HE SAID--

319
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,568
YOU ALL RIGHT, TON'?

320
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,426
YEAH.
THAT FORMALDEHYDE SMELL...

321
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,741
I KNEW THIS GUY ONCE,
 VIETNAM VET.

322
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,415
HE DRANK FORMALDEHYDE
OVER THERE JUST TO GET HIGH.

323
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:18,965
IT'S THE ALCOHOL.

324
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,055
DOES HE HAVE TO BE HERE,
YOUR FUCKING A.A. SPONSOR?

325
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,482
IT AIN'T JUST
 THAT HE HELPS ME
 WITH THE DISEASE, T.

326
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:27,676
THIS GUY IS GREAT
 AT FORGING DOCUMENTS.

327
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:30,317
- HE WAS A GOOD KID, RAYMOND.
 - THE BEST.

328
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,744
AT LEAST HE WENT FAST.
 NOT LIKE DICK BARONE,
 POOR FUCK.

329
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:36,438
- DICK BARONE DIED?
- LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE.

330
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,122
DID YOU EVER THINK
WHAT A COINCIDENCE IT IS,

331
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:41,088
THAT LOU GEHRIG DIED
OF LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE?

332
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:44,926
YOU GONNA MAKE
 THAT SAME STUPID JOKE
EVERY TIME THAT COMES UP?

333
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,162
SORRY.

334
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:48,480
EVERYTHING'S
 SO FUCKING MORBID.

335
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:49,780
THERE'S A MAN
LYING DEAD OVER THERE.

336
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,191
I'M GONNA GO SMOKE.

337
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,933
I DON'T KNOW
 WHAT I WAS THINKING.

338
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,414
FOR YOU.
 YOUR TASTE.

339
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,000
THE INHERITANCE.

340
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,791
I DIDN'T WANT
 TO SAY NOTHING,

341
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,739
WITH YOUR AUNT AND ALL,
 BUT THIS IS THOUGHTFUL.

342
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,471
- SO THAT THING
 WE SPOKE ABOUT...
 - STILL MULLING IT.

343
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,043
YEAH, WHATEVER.
 SURE.

344
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,650
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

345
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,505
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
 NOT A DAY OVER 76.

346
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,169
- FUCKING BALLBREAKER.
- HOW ARE YOU, RUSTY?

347
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:35,800
IS PHIL LEOTARDO HERE?
'CAUSE I WON'T STAY IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH THAT MAN.

348
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,132
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

349
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,579
SO YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT GUY
IN WESTCHESTER?

350
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,812
FUCKING CAPTAIN,

351
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,720
DOING HIS OWN RADIO BROADCAST
THE LAST THREE YEARS.

352
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:44,788
W.R.A.T.

353
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:46,334
- JESUS CHRIST,
 ANOTHER ONE NOW?

354
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:49,588
NO WONDER THE PAPERS
ARE CALLING THIS
THE YEAR OF THE RAT.

355
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,655
STANDUP GUYS LIKE THAT,

356
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,257
THEY'RE A DYING BREED.

357
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:55,345
AMEN TO THAT.

358
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:57,196
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

359
00:20:58,248 --> 00:21:00,622
ANYWAY, LET ME GO
PAY MY RESPECTS.

360
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,053
ALL RIGHT, RUSTY.

361
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:16,587
- YOU OKAY?
 - I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

362
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,868
HE'S THINKING ABOUT IT.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
 TO TELL YOU?

363
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:23,407
HOW MANY YEARS
 HAVE WE DREAMT ABOUT THIS,
 TO GET OUT OF THIS SHIT?

364
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,532
- EVERY TIME SOMEONE
 WE KNOW GETS ARRESTED--

365
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:28,130
- I KNOW. WILL YOU STOP?
 - I'M WORRIED, GENE.

366
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:29,951
WE'VE ALREADY MADE
 THE OFFER.

367
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,184
I'M DOING
EVERYTHING I CAN.

368
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,895
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING?

369
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:37,851
WE'RE NOT FIGHTING, SWEETIE.
WE'RE TALKING.

370
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:40,710
- HOW COME
 YOU'RE NOT IN BED, HMM?
 - I DON'T KNOW.

371
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:45,380
ALL I'M SAYING IS, HE HAS TO SEE
THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

372
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,306
GIVE THE MAN
TIME TO PROCESS.

373
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,279
- OH MY GOD,
 THIS EEL IS DELICIOUS.

374
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:55,008
OKAY, SPANISH MACKEREL NOW.

375
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,472
CAN I GET
 ANOTHER SAKE, HON?

376
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:02,613
LISTEN, I GOT SOME STUFF
I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF.

377
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,725
YOU OKAY
 TO DRIVE YOURSELF HOME?

378
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,289
I DON'T HAVE
 MY CAR, TONY.

379
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,784
OH, YEAH.
 SO TAKE THIS ONE.

380
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,630
- HEY, MRS. S.
- WHAT IS THIS?

381
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,541
OH MY GOD.

382
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,634
IS THIS THE NEW PORSCHE?

383
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:22,915
CAYENNE TURBO.
I GOT THE 4.5-LITER V-8.

384
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:25,578
WASN'T SURE
ABOUT THE COLOR,
SO I TOOK A SHOT.

385
00:22:25,682 --> 00:22:27,796
TONY, I LOVE IT.
 IT'S GORGEOUS!

386
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,386
I STILL WISH
YOU'D TALKED TO THAT GUY
AT THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT,

387
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:33,369
BUT OH MY GOD!
 WHAT A CAR!

388
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:52,067
HO, JOE COLLEGE,
 WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

389
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:54,729
SHE WENT TO THE OUTLET STORES
 WITH AUNT RO.

390
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,637
IS THAT THE JACKET
WE GOT YOU FOR CHRISTMAS?

391
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:00,468
I'M LENDING IT TO MATT.

392
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,637
HEY, HOW WAS THE INTERVIEW
 FOR THE INTERNSHIP?

393
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:07,329
GOT MOVED
TO NEXT WEEK.

394
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,433
WOULD YOU MIND KEEPING ME IN THE LOOP, 
THOUGH, SINCE IT WAS MY LAWYER THAT SET IT UP, HUH?

395
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:10,433
- OKAY.

396
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:18,720
- MATT DON'T HAVE
 HIS OWN CLOTHES?
 - HE'S BORROWING IT FOR PARTY.

397
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:20,399
OH, GOOD.
YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

398
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,848
YOU HAVE SUCH A LOW
 OPINION OF PEOPLE.

399
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,332
LET ME TELL YOU
 SOMETHING, A.J.

400
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:30,491
I DON'T CARE
 HOW CLOSE YOU ARE,

401
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,576
IN THE END, YOUR FRIENDS
 ARE GONNA LET YOU DOWN.

402
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:35,093
FAMILY.
 THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
 YOU CAN DEPEND ON.

403
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,305
HE WAS VITAL, MY UNCLE,
 ALIVE.

404
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,634
FOR ALL HIS FAULTS,
HE WAS SHARP IN HIS DAY.

405
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:52,626
BUT NOW...

406
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,665
WE STOPPED
 AT A LIGHT YESTERDAY,

407
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:04,220
AND I SEE THIS NANNY,
BLACK GIRL,
PUSHING A BABY CARRIAGE.

408
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:06,217
COMING THE OTHER WAY,

409
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,723
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE,

410
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,162
WITH THIS OLD LADY
 IN A WHEELCHAIR

411
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,668
STARING OFF INTO SPACE.

412
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,215
- THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.
 - THE CIRCLE JERK OF LIFE.

413
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:18,991
WHERE'S THE DIGNITY?

414
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:23,188
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
 IN THE END YOU CAN
 LET GO OF YOUR PRIDE,

415
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:25,160
LET YOUR LOVED ONES
 CARE FOR YOU.

416
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,231
I'D RATHER THEY HOLD
 A PILLOW OVER MY FACE.

417
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,710
I FIND IT INTERESTING
 YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

418
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,655
YOU TRIED TO SMOTHER
YOUR MOTHER WITH A PILLOW.

419
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,577
- WHAT?
 - IN THE HOSPITAL,
 AFTER HER STROKE.

420
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,148
THE FUCK I DID!

421
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,208
I GRABBED A PILLOW, BUT IT WAS...
 JUST TO KEEP MY HANDS OCCUPIED.

422
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:51,694
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
 GETTING YOUR UNCLE
 SOME LIVE-IN HELP?

423
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,193
WE GOT A GIRL
COMES IN DAYS,
SHE'S FROM TRINIDAD.

424
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:57,425
DOES HE HAVE THE MEANS
 FOR ASSISTED LIVING?

425
00:24:57,743 --> 00:25:00,757
DID YOU JUST SAY
 TO LET YOUR LOVED ONES
 TAKE CARE OF YOU?

426
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:03,536
- IF IT'S FEASIBLE.
 - WELL, HE'S MY UNCLE.

427
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,904
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

428
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,282
WHAT ARE WE
 TALKING ABOUT?

429
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,507
THE FACT THAT YOU STILL,
 AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

430
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:13,071
CANNOT ACCEPT
YOU HAD A MOTHER
 WHO DIDN'T LOVE YOU.

431
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:15,720
IN PITYING YOUR UNCLE,

432
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,877
<i>THE MAN SHE CONSPIRED WITH,</i>

433
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:21,697
YOU'RE TURNING THE BLAME
FOR WHAT SHE DID

434
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,541
BACK ON YOURSELF AGAIN,
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

435
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,277
WHAT WAS YOUR MOTHER LIKE?

436
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,198
DID SHE EVER LET YOU DOWN,
 HURT YOUR FEELINGS?

437
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:31,619
OF COURSE SHE DID.
 SHE WAS CONTROLLING

438
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:33,921
<i>AND MANIPULATIVE AT TIMES.</i>

439
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:37,584
- SHE ALSO NEVER
 TRIED TO KILL ME.
 - I PUSHED HER OVER THE EDGE.

440
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:41,238
BY PLACING HER IN A LOVELY
 RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.

441
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:42,727
IT'S A NURSING HOME!

442
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:45,189
IT'S LESS HURTFUL TO BELIEVE
 THAT THEY WERE RIGHT

443
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:48,179
<i>TO TRY AND DESTROY YOU</i>
 <i>THAN TO ACCEPT THE FACT</i>

444
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:49,966
THAT SHE DIDN'T VALUE YOU.

445
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,110
HESH IS A PERSONAL
FRIEND OF MINE,

446
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:02,042
AND THE KID IS
 HIS SON-IN-LAW.

447
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:05,010
NOW I KNOW PHIL'S GOT
A LOT ON HIS PLATE,
BUT COME ON.

448
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,089
I'LL TALK TO JOHN.
I WAS TAKING MY SISTER THERE
SATURDAY ANYWAY.

449
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:10,470
HOW IS GINNY?
CARMELA SAYS SHE'S GOT
HER HANDS FULL.

450
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,216
THE KID HAS THE WEIGHT
 OF THE WORLD ON HER.

451
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,675
RAY-BANS.

452
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,752
CLASSIC, AFFORDABLE.

453
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,729
I JUST PUT THOSE
ON SPECIAL.

454
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:23,934
YOU GOT SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE...CURRENT?

455
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:27,987
- LIKE THOSE.

456
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:34,189
ARMANIS.

457
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:37,585
FLEXIBLE ACETATE FRAMES,
 RIMLESS LENSES.

458
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:44,484
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LEFT MY WALLET IN THE CAR.

459
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:45,752
I'LL CATCH YOU NEXT TIME.

460
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,525
SOME PEOPLE
FROM THE I.R.S. CAME BY.

461
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:02,628
THEY WANT TO INVENTORY
THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

462
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:06,668
MAYBE I SHOULD
 SELL THE CAR,

463
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,745
AT LEAST GET SOME
LIQUIDITY OUT OF IT.

464
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,098
THE MASERATI?

465
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,915
CAN'T SAY I DISAGREE.

466
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:15,362
THAT BREAKS MY
FUCKING HEART.

467
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:18,469
CHRISTOPHER MOLTISANTI
CAME OVER TO THE HOUSE
ASKING ABOUT IT.

468
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,291
- HE'LL PAY CASH, HE SAID.

469
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:24,999
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE,
 JOHN,

470
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:26,518
PHIL RELATED.

471
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,989
THE HAIRDO, HE'S IN A BEEF
 WITH THE JEW.

472
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:32,616
WHAT?
 GOD DAMN IT, WHAT?

473
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:34,626
THE JEW'S SON-IN-LAW.
IT GOT PHYSICAL.

474
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:38,154
YOUR FRIEND FROM JERSEY
 GOT INVOLVED, BUT HE CAN'T
 GET PHIL TO FOCUS.

475
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:40,438
DO I NOT HAVE ENOUGH
ON MY FUCKING MIND?

476
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:42,735
THE GUY FROM JERSEY
 ASKED ME TO TELL YOU.

477
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:46,034
WELL, THEN CALL PHIL
 AND HAVE HIM FUCKING
 HANDLE IT!

478
00:27:46,194 --> 00:27:49,055
DON'T YELL AT MY BROTHER, JOHN.
HE'S TRYING TO DO RIGHT BY US.

479
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:59,415
THE PICTURES
FROM ALLEGRA'S SHOWER.

480
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,665
NOON HE SAID, RIGHT?

481
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,366
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
BULLSHIT.

482
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:27,859
I RECOGNIZE THAT IN PEOPLE
EVERY TIME NOW.

483
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,676
- THERE HE IS.

484
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:32,092
HO, FINALLY.

485
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:34,685
I WAS STARTING TO GROW
 MUSHROOMS OUT MY ASS.

486
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:35,952
THERE'S AN IMAGE.

487
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,413
SO GERRY FILLED ME IN
ON THE WAY OVER.

488
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:47,314
THIS WHOLE THING WAS
A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING.

489
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:50,726
YEAH, THIS ELI KID,
 I HAD ANY IDEA
 HE WAS WITH YOU,

490
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,094
- I WOULD HAVE NEVER...
- HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
 ABOUT HESH?

491
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,083
I ASKED WHO HE WAS.
 HE HIGH-HANDED ME.

492
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:57,305
I THOUGHT HE WAS A CIVILIAN.
- STILL, TO GET DRAGGED
 BY A CAR?

493
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,757
FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH,
 THE CAR THING WAS
 A HIT AND RUN.

494
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:03,503
SO WHAT DO WE DO HERE?

495
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,234
- WHAT DID WE SAY?
 - 25 SOUNDS RIGHT.

496
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:09,089
HE'S BLEEDING INTERNALLY.
 PAIN, SUFFERING--

497
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:10,842
SO YOU TELL ME. 50?

498
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:13,690
YEAH, FAIR ENOUGH.

499
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,925
COULD WE SEGUE NOW
INTO SOMETHING MORE PRESSING?

500
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,662
THE FLOOR IS YOURS,
 SENATOR.

501
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:21,837
I SPOKE TO JOHN.
THE SPLIT ON THE OFFICE PARK
IS WAY OUT OF WHACK.

502
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,325
SAME THING
 AS THE ESPLANADE.

503
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:25,801
APPLES AND BOWLING BALLS, TONY.
WITH FUEL COSTS NOW--

504
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:27,853
LIKE YOU'RE NOT
 PASSING THAT ON
 TO THE DRIVERS?

505
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,219
65/35.

506
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,240
WHY YOU ALWAYS CAVE
 FOR THIS PRICK?

507
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:47,343
I'M NOT CAVING.
 IT'S A STRATEGY.

508
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,993
JOHNNY'S IN JAIL.
 YOU KEEP HIM HAPPY,
 HE'LL KEEP A LID ON PHIL.

509
00:29:53,383 --> 00:29:54,598
TONY B.,

510
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:56,712
PHIL'S KID BROTHER,

511
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,823
THE BAD TASTE
 THAT LEFT WITH PHIL--

512
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:02,681
THERE ARE 200 SOLDIERS
 IN HIS FAMILY.

513
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:04,784
I'M NOT SCARED OF THEM.

514
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:06,544
- TONY LEFT?

515
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:09,171
I STOPPED BY STEWART'S.
I GOT A WHOLE LUNCH SET UP.

516
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:24,327
DID TONY MENTION
ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

517
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,376
ABOUT YOU
 MOVING TO FLORIDA?

518
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,688
DID HE SAY IF HE'S LEANING
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?

519
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:35,854
LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
 I NEED YOU TO DO.

520
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:38,481
I GOT A CALL FROM FRITZIE
 UP IN BOSTON.

521
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:42,221
THERE'S A GUY NAMED
 TEDDY SPIRODAKIS,
 OWES SOME MONEY.

522
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:43,440
- YOU WANT ME TO COLLECT?

523
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,796
- THAT SHIP SAILED. FINAL NOTICE TIME.

524
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,111
REALLY?

525
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:49,993
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
 WITH THAT?

526
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:53,991
NO. I JUST GOTTA RUN IT BY VITO.
HE'S MY CAPTAIN.

527
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:55,628
BELIEVE ME,
 VITO WILL BE DOWN WITH IT.

528
00:30:57,508 --> 00:30:58,659
SO THIS COMES FROM TONY?

529
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:01,114
IT'S COMING FROM ME.
 I'M NOT A FUCKING CAPTAIN?

530
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,936
ALL RIGHT, OKAY?

531
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:06,322
- HOW SOON?
 - ASAP.

532
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,745
LIKE RIGHT AWAY.

533
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,648
I'LL CALL WITH THE DETAILS.
 GET IT DONE.

534
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:13,512
I'LL PUT IN
A GOOD WORD TO T.
ABOUT THE FLORIDA THING.

535
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,246
THE REAR DECK,
 DIDN'T THEY SAY
 THAT WOULD BE REFINISHED?

536
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,949
<i>That's the old photo.</i>
 <i>It's been completely redone.</i>

537
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,782
THE WIRING
 IN THE POOL HOUSE?

538
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:44,127
TELL THEM THEY CAN KNOCK TWO 
GRAND OFF THE PRICE OR THEY 
CAN SELL TO SOMEONE ELSE.

539
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:46,498
<i>Listen, you're responding</i>
 <i>to their counter.</i>

540
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:48,722
<i>You should ask</i>
 <i>for whatever you want.</i>

541
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,400
OKAY, WE'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW.

542
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:51,910
<i>All right then,</i>
 <i>good night.</i>

543
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,230
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

544
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:57,696
THAT IF WE
LOSE THIS HOUSE,
I'M GONNA DIE.

545
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,862
<i>TON', WHAT DO YOU WANT</i>
 <i>TO DO FOR DINNER?</i>

546
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,645
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN!

547
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:18,054
128 KILOS

548
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,407
127 KILOS

549
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,455
YOUR NEW INSURANCE CARD.

550
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:50,614
OH, GOOD.

551
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,855
ANY THOUGHTS
ON DINNER?

552
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:58,951
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

553
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:05,437
I KNOW THIS IS INSANE,
 BUT I CAN'T STOP
 THINKING ABOUT NORI'S.

554
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:06,856
I WAS JUST THERE.

555
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:08,440
- TODAY? WITH WHO?

556
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:10,192
- NOBODY.

557
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,487
- YOU WENT THERE WITHOUT ME?
 - YEAH, I WAS HUNGRY.

558
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,854
- WHAT?
 - NOTHING.

559
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:19,590
- COME ON, WHAT?
 - I DON'T KNOW,

560
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:22,377
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WAS OUR SPECIAL PLACE.

561
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:24,751
- WELL, IT IS.
- WELL?

562
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,877
- I WENT THERE ALONE, CARM.
 - I KNOW THAT. YOU SAID.

563
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:32,062
IT JUST FELT NICE
 TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL,
 FOR US.

564
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:35,467
NO KIDS AROUND,
 WITHOUT MY PARENTS...

565
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,054
WE CAN GO IF YOU WANT.
 NO NO,DON'T BE SILLY.

566
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,088
ARE YOU SURE?

567
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,772
HOW'S THE CAR?

568
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,669
TEDDY, RIGHT?
 YEAH.

569
00:34:58,038 --> 00:34:59,385
- CARMELA.
 - GINNY, HI.

570
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:01,345
I TRIED CALLING,
BUT I KEPT GETTING
THE MACHINE.

571
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:03,123
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

572
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:06,058
SOMETIMES I DON'T
 ANSWER THE PHONE.
 GODDAMN CREDITORS.

573
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,311
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
I THOUGHT I MIGHT KIDNAP YOU
FOR SPA DATE.

574
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:11,672
WELL, THAT'S
 A NICE SURPRISE.

575
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:14,149
I THOUGHT MAYBE
 WE'D DRIVE UP THERE,
 MAYBE STOP AT OCCITANE.

576
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:16,114
IS THAT NEW?

577
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:17,993
OH, THE CAR?
YES YES.

578
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,947
PORSCHE CAYENNE,
LIKE THE PEPPER.

579
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:21,031
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, CARM.

580
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,262
- Vito: <i>FIVE MINUTES</i>
 AT NO INCLINE.

581
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:28,330
THEN I SWITCH TO FULL
 UPHILL FOR MY CARDIO.

582
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,791
I WAS TELLING TONY
 HE SHOULD COME WITH ME.

583
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,211
- DO HIM GOOD.
 - IT AIN'T JUST
 AESTHETICS, EITHER.

584
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:36,823
GOD FORBID HE EVER HAS
 A HEART ATTACK.

585
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,469
VITO, YOU'RE IN
 THE HANDICAPPED SPOT.

586
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:43,721
- THAT FUCKING
 GUY IS HERE AGAIN?

587
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,931
- THE MAN'S A FORMER JUDGE.

588
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:51,311
- HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

589
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,317
"IF YOUR NOSE RUNS
 AND YOUR FEET SMELL--

590
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,624
YOU'RE BUILT UPSIDE DOWN."
- FUNNY.

591
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,865
HEY, BY THE WAY,
 YOUR FLORIDA THING...

592
00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:07,831
TONY ASKED ME
 TO SPEAK TO YOU...

593
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:09,788
THAT'S A NO-GO.

594
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,874
- WHAT?
- <i>CAN'T BE ACCOMMODATED.</i>

595
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:13,792
YOU'RE PART OF THE TEAM.

596
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:17,339
- BUT I JUST DID THAT THING.
- THAT'S NOT MY DEPARTMENT.

597
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,218
WELL, CAN I TALK
 TO TONY AT LEAST?

598
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:26,805
I WOULDN'T BOTHER HIM.
 HE'S OUT ON THE NEW BOAT.

599
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:33,353
DOES HE THINK
 I'M GONNA TALK
 ABOUT SHIT UP HERE,

600
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:34,688
WITH WHAT I'VE DONE,
WHAT I JUST DID?

601
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:53,298
IT'S NOT SO SILLY
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

602
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:56,432
I'M A TOP EARNER NOW.

603
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,147
IT'S NOT OUT OF THE REALM
OF POSSIBILITY

604
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:02,484
THAT I COULD BE THE BOSS
OF THIS FAMILY ONE DAY.

605
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,780
I MEAN, GOD FORBID
TONY EVER GETS...

606
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,207
CANCER, CORONARY,

607
00:37:09,423 --> 00:37:10,860
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

608
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:24,321
<i>Hey, big brother.</i>

609
00:37:24,597 --> 00:37:27,282
<i>Listen, I know</i>
 <i>I was supposed to sit</i>
 <i>with Uncle Jun' tonight,</i>

610
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:29,906
BUT TOM JUST CALLED
 FROM LOCATION.

611
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:32,538
APPARENTLY,
SOME SMOKE EFFECT
WENT AWRY

612
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,660
<i>and he inhaled</i>
 <i>noxious chemicals.</i>

613
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:35,958
WELL, GO GO.

614
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:40,838
THE THING IS,
 UNCLE JUN' DOESN'T WANT ME TO.

615
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,882
HE'S EXCEPTIONALLY AGITATED
 TODAY AND HE'S BEEN NAUSEOUS.

616
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:49,304
WELL, DID YOU CALL JANICE?
 I MEAN, HER OR BOBBY
 SHOULD GO.

617
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:51,140
- I'M ALL THE WAY
 OUT HERE ON A BOAT.
 - THEY CAN'T DO IT.

618
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,016
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN'T?
 - <i>I don't know.</i>

619
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:55,727
SHE DIDN'T ELABORATE.
 IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
 SHE WANTED TO.

620
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,479
- AW, GOD DAMN IT!

621
00:37:57,739 --> 00:37:58,856
- I'M SORRY, TONY.

622
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:29,595
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'M THROWING ALL THIS SHIT

623
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:31,873
RIGHT IN THE GARBAGE!
 IT'S MY HOBBY, JANICE.

624
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,212
WHY DO YOU GOTTA
 BELITTLE IT?

625
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,851
WILL YOU JUST
GET READY PLEASE?

626
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:37,436
- YOU GO. I GOTTA WORK.

627
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:39,635
- YOU CAN DO YOUR COLLECTIONS
 TOMORROW!

628
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:42,498
I'M ON A SCHEDULE!
 IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY.

629
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,162
THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T
WATCH UNCLE JUN'?

630
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:46,945
I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK,
WE HAVE NICA'S PRESCHOOL
MEETING.

631
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:48,197
- HE'S 15 MONTHS OLD.

632
00:38:48,457 --> 00:38:51,450
- NO ONE WAS MORE COMPETITIVE
 THAN YOUR WIFE WHEN IT CAME TO 
 THIS STUFF WITH A.J.

633
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,246
A LOT OF GOOD IT DID.

634
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,840
THIS CHILD--
 CONSTANTLY WANTING
 THE BREAST.

635
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:57,944
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ALONE.
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
FEEL GOOD.

636
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:01,418
THE SCHOOL, THEY NEED
 TO MEET BOTH PARENTS
IF IT'S AN INTACT FAMILY.

637
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:04,338
SO CALL THE GIRL,
 THE NURSE.

638
00:39:04,598 --> 00:39:06,882
MISS TRINIDAD?
 RIGHT. EVERY TIME I CALL,

639
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:08,169
A DIFFERENT PERSON ANSWERS.

640
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:10,010
I'LL GO, TON'.
 I'M ON IT.

641
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,013
FUCK IT!
YOU WANNA GET SOMETHING DONE,
YOU GOTTA DO IT YOURSELF.

642
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:14,389
YOU WERE THE ONE

643
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:16,078
WHO WAS OPPOSED
TO ASSISTED LIVING.

644
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,151
YOU AND I ARE GONNA TALK.

645
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:28,758
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO WEAR YOUR FUCKING HAT.

646
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:30,173
SHIT.

647
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:33,867
SO HOW ABOUT YOU?
 ARE YOU DATING?

648
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,577
WITH MY HOURS
AT THE BODY SHOP?

649
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:37,287
LADIES.

650
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,789
DESSERT WAS ON ME.

651
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:40,332
THANK YOU, ARTIE.

652
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:42,793
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TWO
PATCH THINGS UP.

653
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,881
- SO SILLY.
 - I'M NOT EVEN SURE
 WHAT HAPPENED.

654
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:49,549
ME AND TONY DIDN'T SPEAK FOR MONTHS.
YOU PICK UP RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.

655
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,511
DID CHARMAINE TELL YOU?
 WE'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

656
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:54,680
NO, SHE DIDN'T
 MENTION IT.

657
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,251
- THAT'S TERRIFIC!

658
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:58,213
- WE'RE BOTH VERY HAPPY.

659
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:02,079
JESUS, WILL YOU
 HEAR ME OUT AT LEAST?

660
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,729
WE BUY HERE. LIVINGSTON,
 NORTH CALDWELL MAYBE.

661
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:07,414
- RIGHT NEAR TONY.

662
00:40:07,578 --> 00:40:09,653
BETTER SCHOOLS,
NEW FRIENDS.

663
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:12,309
WE GOT THE MONEY, BABY.
 $2 MILLION.

664
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:14,406
IT'S NOT THE SAME, GENE.

665
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,324
IT COULD BE BETTER.

666
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:19,871
THE SUMMERS DOWN THERE--
WE WERE IGNORING
THE NEGATIVES.

667
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:22,574
IT'S FUCKING BRUTAL
 WITH THE BUGS.

668
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:27,767
TONY AND SILVIO,
 ALL THEY UNDERSTAND
 IS APPEARANCES.

669
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:31,021
WE'LL BUY A NEW CAR.
 IT'LL RAISE MY PROFILE.

670
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,217
YOU WATCH,
 I'LL MAKE CAPTAIN.

671
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:46,231
I FOUND THIS

672
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:48,734
UNDER OUR SON'S BED.

673
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:04,500
FLORIDA'S ANY BETTER?
 IT'S THE DRUG CAPITAL
 OF THE WORLD.

674
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,918
LOOK, FOR TONY TO--

675
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:09,504
TONY, TONY!
WHY DON'T YOU KILL HIM? PUT A BULLET
IN HIS FUCKING HEAD.

676
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,922
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

677
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,008
WHAT, YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE?

678
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:19,014
- HE'S THE BOSS, DEANNE.
- THE BOSS OF WHAT? HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT!

679
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:25,270
IS OUR LIFE THAT BAD?
 IT'S YOUR MONEY.

680
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,093
YOUR AUNT'S MONEY.

681
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:29,774
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

682
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:36,239
THERE'S THIS WONDERFUL
 JERSEY CONTEMPORARY

683
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,283
I WANT YOU TO SEE WITH ME.
 IT'S CATHEDRAL CEILINGS.

684
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:40,189
YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE.

685
00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:43,872
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN SAY.

686
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,366
<i>Colonel Dax, you're</i>

687
00:41:56,374 --> 00:41:57,594
<i>a disappointment to me.</i>

688
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:00,692
You have spoiled
 the keenness of your mind

689
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:02,816
by wallowing
 in sentimentality.

690
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,015
You really did want
 to save those men

691
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:07,734
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

692
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,390
You're an idealist

693
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,441
and I pity you
 as I would
 the village idiot.

694
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:14,323
<i>We're fighting a war, Dax,</i>
 <i>a war that we've got to win.</i>

695
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,196
<i>Those men didn't fight,</i>
 <i>so they were shot.</i>

696
00:42:24,872 --> 00:42:26,248
- <i>HELLO.</i>
 - WHO'S THAT?

697
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:28,475
- IT'S ME.

698
00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:32,629
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 - I LOST MY UPPERS.

699
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:34,923
- PROBABLY UPSTAIRS.
 - GOD FUCK IT ALL!

700
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:37,050
RELAX, WILL YA?
WE'LL FIND THEM.

701
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:41,303
THE PHONE KEEPS RINGING,
AND THEN THEY HANG UP.

702
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:43,432
IT'S PROBABLY SALESPEOPLE.

703
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:44,766
- I KNOW WHO IT IS!

704
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,519
- PUSSY MALANGA, I KNOW.
WE'LL GET J. EDGAR HOOVER
 RIGHT ON IT.

705
00:42:51,174 --> 00:42:52,938
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU GO UPSTAIRS, YOU LOOK
 FOR YOUR TEETH.

706
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:55,489
I'M GONNA FIX YOU
 SOMETHING TO EAT, OKAY?

707
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:00,972
I HAD A BANANA IN THERE.

708
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:05,379
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL FIND THAT TOO.

709
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:14,629
I GOT IT.
WE BUY A VACATION PLACE
IN FLORIDA,

710
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,340
A CONDO.
 IT'S NOT THE SAME.

711
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,259
I MAKE ANOTHER RUN
AT TONY - SIX MONTHS,
A YEAR FROM NOW.

712
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,845
- A YEAR?
- YOU CAN GO AHEAD EVEN.

713
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,140
- WHAT?
- AND LET ME TELL YOU,

714
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,166
A YEAR, TWO YEARS FROM NOW

715
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:29,561
EVERYTHING COULD BE
DIFFERENT.
TONY COULD BE GONE.

716
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,296
- GO AHEAD.

717
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,031
HIS MASTER'S VOICE.

718
00:43:57,608 --> 00:43:58,722
NOW?

719
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:26,993
- GENE, THIS IS
 AGENT SANSEVERINO.

720
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:30,247
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN, BUDDY?
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU LATELY.

721
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,708
BUSY, YOU KNOW.
MY KID HAS SOME PROBLEMS.

722
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:35,170
THAT'S ROUGH.

723
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:38,129
THE THING IS, GENO,
YOU GOTTA KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH ME.

724
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,799
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO HELP
IN MORE IMPORTANT WAYS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

725
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:43,718
- WE LOST A MAJOR ASSET
 THIS MONTH.

726
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,304
- THE POINT IS--
 - WAS RAY CURTO
 A COOPERATOR?

727
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:49,641
THE WAY THINGS ARE SHAPING UP,
YOU'RE A DESIGNATED HITTER.

728
00:44:50,661 --> 00:44:52,648
LOOK, RON,

729
00:44:53,155 --> 00:44:54,801
WE'VE TALKED
 ABOUT FLORIDA, OKAY?

730
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:56,523
GENE, THAT'S NOT
 GONNA HAPPEN.

731
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:58,817
HERE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS
 IS WHERE YOU'RE USEFUL.

732
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:01,736
I TOLD YOU,
 YOU TELL YOUR BOSSES,
 I'D COME BACK FOR ANY TRIAL.

733
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,780
FLORIDA'S JUST
 ONE OF THOSE THINGS
 YOU GOTTA LET GO.

734
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:20,964
SO, THE FEAST OF ST. JOE'S,
TONY GAVE SOME RULINGS
ON THE UNIONS.

735
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:22,465
WERE ANY MADE GUYS
 FROM NEW YORK THERE?

736
00:47:09,796 --> 00:47:11,367
TEN MINUTES, UNCLE JUN'.

737
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:12,924
<i>WHO'S DOWN THERE?</i>

738
00:47:13,877 --> 00:47:16,183
ARTIE SHAW.
 TEN MINUTES.

739
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,637
<i>DON'T GO ANYWHERE.</i>

740
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:19,353
I'M NOT.
 I'M RIGHT HERE.

741
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:32,590
YOU GOT ANY WINE?

742
00:48:57,023 --> 00:48:58,556
WELL, HERE I AM.

743
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:00,308
IS THAT A PORSCHE?

744
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:02,477
HAD MY EYE
 ON IT FOR MONTHS.
 IT'S A GIFT FROM TONY.

745
00:49:02,843 --> 00:49:04,872
I THOUGHT ABOUT A BOXSTER,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

746
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:06,773
THE 'VETTE FELT
 MORE LIKE ME.

747
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:09,526
- YOU BOUGHT THAT
 YOURSELF?

748
00:49:09,786 --> 00:49:11,486
THE ACCOUNTANT
SAYS I'M BETTER OFF
OWNING IT OUTRIGHT.

749
00:49:25,684 --> 00:49:26,986
UNCLE JUN'!

750
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:29,375
CALL 911!

751
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:19,762
<i>911, where is</i>
 <i>the emergency?</i>

752
00:50:21,004 --> 00:50:23,476
<i>911, where is</i>
 <i>the emergency?</i>
