1
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,040
Fuck you doing?
Scared the piss
out of me.

2
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,543
Some things you don't
get into over the phone.

3
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,713
Got it.
Lorraine's at mass.

4
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,548
Watch out for Spencer.

5
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,219
- Who?
- Her fucking toy terrier's
a shit machine.

6
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,725
I talked
to some of the guys
about your misgivings.

7
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,293
Yeah?

8
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,933
Listen,
I've made a decision.

9
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,538
Take a walk in there.

10
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,074
What the fuck
you waiting for?
Get lost.

11
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,282
Historically, Carmine
always said the Sopranos

12
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,885
Are nothing more
than a glorified crew.

13
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,088
Plain and simple,
we decapitate

14
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,090
And we do business
with whatever's left.

15
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,960
- What?
- Nothing.

16
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,163
I agree in spirit,
but I gotta counsel.

17
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,498
This thing
should have been done
during John's era.

18
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,767
They got redundant
upper management--

19
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,569
Bleeds off
half the kick.

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,372
We take 'em out,
absorb the whole
fucking thing.

21
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,908
Take out an entire
fucking family?

22
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,177
Let me tell you
a couple or three things:

23
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,379
Forget Coco.
Forget fat dom

24
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,882
Who goes over to Jersey
and never comes back.

25
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,018
Forget my brother Billy.

26
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,553
Phil, Phil, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

27
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,823
Anthony Soprano has
no respect for this thing.

28
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,793
He's never been
in the can, not really.

29
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,430
He's a guy who stepped over
his own uncle to grab
the big seat--

30
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,365
His father's brother.

31
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,601
- Please, huh?
- I'm embarrassed.

32
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,803
I let him come
to the hospital
last Christmas

33
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,205
And I took his
fat fucking hand
in friendship.

34
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,374
Philly, you had
a heart attack.

35
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,078
Listen to me.
They make anybody
and everybody over there.

36
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,614
And the way that
they do it is all
fucked up.

37
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,716
Guys don't get
their finger pricked.

38
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,551
There's no sword
and gun on the table.

39
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,420
- Phil.
- No, Alb.

40
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,156
Either it has meaning
or no meaning.

41
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,893
And the Vito thing--
the man harbors a faggot.

42
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,228
- it's true.
- Five fucking families

43
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,231
And we got this other
pygmy thing over in Jersey.

44
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,771
There's no scraps
in my scrapbook.

45
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,345
Make it happen.

46
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,992
I like the way she
played basketball
yesterday.

47
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,294
Almost got my first
hard-on in, like,
a month.

48
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,031
Jesus, what's the meaning
of quiet time around here?

49
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,951
- Rhiannon?
- A.J.?

50
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,253
Jesus.

51
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,226
What are you doing here?

52
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,528
You first.

53
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,564
I have some food issues,
depression.

54
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,967
- You keep up with Hernan?
- He's a fucking slimeball.

55
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,703
I caught him finger-banging
my cousin on the ski lift.

56
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,305
Well, somebody said
you were modeling.

57
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,707
Yeah, I guess.

58
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,742
I signed with elite.

59
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,412
So you would say
he's responding
to the therapy.

60
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,448
Well, we don't do
traditional therapy
per se.

61
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,585
Kids in crisis mostly need
an environment of calm,

62
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,986
No stresses.

63
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,489
Do you want this?
Or I can pop it
in the mail.

64
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,364
Just one more week
of this.

65
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,034
$2,200 a fucking day.

66
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,830
Gabagool', provolone

67
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,967
And vinegar peppers.

68
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,981
You believe this
fucking weather?

69
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,585
End times, huh?
Ready for the rapture.

70
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:02,922
How's the antiterror
going?

71
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,525
Great if you don't
like sleeping, eating
or seeing your kids.

72
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,366
Listen, those arabs
from the bing--

73
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,067
- Mm-hmm.
- Let me ask you the truth.

74
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,403
They're in Jordan, right,
getting their balls zapped?

75
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,439
You're not gonna tell me?

76
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,408
I'm not really sure.
For all we know,

77
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,244
They may be harmless
pistachio salesmen.

78
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,581
Don't get so bent out
of shape. You're a big
boy, Tony.

79
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,817
You know, World War II,
your outfit protected

80
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,819
The Brooklyn navy yard.

81
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,121
You think Roosevelt
told Vito Genovese

82
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,991
- Where Hitler was holed up?
- Go fuck yourself.

83
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,173
Tony, Tony, hold up.

84
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,041
Tony.

85
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,643
What?

86
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,914
Look, I appreciate
what you did giving
us those names.

87
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,750
In fact, I've been
sitting here thinking...

88
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,655
Remember that thing
I told you about that
was supposed to happen

89
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,458
About a year ago,
your problem with Brooklyn?

90
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,128
It's on again possibly.

91
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,733
You, maybe people
close to you.

92
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,635
If it was real solid,
you would have been
warned officially

93
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,270
By the Newark office,
but my colleague in Brooklyn,

94
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,873
The one
with the collaborator,

95
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,042
Snitch is implying
the wheels have already
been set in motion.

96
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,710
Implying.

97
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,997
Where the fuck
you been?

98
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,233
Krista fell off
her shoes last night.

99
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,235
We had
to call an ambulance.

100
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,705
I had some shit
I was taking care of.

101
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,010
You're gonna
want a snort.

102
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,212
Come on, I just
finished my bialy.

103
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,414
Take it.

104
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,820
Burt Gervasi,
he's gone.

105
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,623
What happened?

106
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,758
I didn't want
to overload you with
A.J. In the hospital.

107
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,696
I don't wanna
hear that. Go.

108
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,464
Burt let me know
the other night

109
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,901
He's been playing both
sides of the fence
with New York.

110
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,670
- Burt?
- Measures were taken.

111
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,044
Burt wasn't speaking
for just himself.

112
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,946
Guys are getting
squeezed hard

113
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,681
To sway them towards
new management.

114
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,083
They thought you'd
be a part of it.

115
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,419
And he got an answer.

116
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,428
My hope is maybe now
Phil gets the message.

117
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,632
- You know, we can talk
this shit through.
- Talk?

118
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,843
Talking about Phil.

119
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,713
- We're gonna hit first.

120
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,452
And this all dovetails
with other information
I got that this cocksucker

121
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,921
Already has a target
on my back.

122
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:25,157
It's a big move.

123
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,393
So...

124
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,496
Buddha.

125
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,298
When he stuck you
with the tab for Vito Jr.,

126
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,634
I said let it go.

127
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,570
Obviously, truth is,
a fuck like Phil,

128
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,172
Appeasement don't work.

129
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,180
Oh, yeah.

130
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,308
Three pops
within a tight time frame,

131
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,411
24 hours, so there's no chance
for them to hit back.

132
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,947
<i>Top three guys.</i>

133
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,448
<i>- Paulie Gaultieri?
- No, management.</i>

134
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,884
Tony Soprano, obviously,

135
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,355
Plus Silvio Dante
and we think Bobby Baccalieri.

136
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,223
That mortadella's
number three?

137
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,292
He used to be
junior Soprano's driver.

138
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,895
And you used to sell
laser printers out the back
of your crown vic.

139
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,673
- You really slept.
- Yeah.

140
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,075
I wasn't asleep.

141
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,011
You want some oatmeal?
I'll make some.

142
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,446
You want instant
or the real thing?
I have half and half.

143
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,515
I can't find my belt.

144
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,418
It must be
up there somewhere.

145
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,653
What?
You hid it.

146
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,725
I'll make the real thing.

147
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,860
- You'll let me know
when it's ready?
- Sure.

148
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,205
You know,
my game has got--

149
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,945
Code six.
I have a casualty.
He's urgent.

150
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:26,980
<i>
i response,</i>

151
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:30,116
<i>The insurgents unleash
a devastating wave</i>

152
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,951
<i>Of ieds</i>

153
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:35,988
<i>- and suicide bombers.</i>

154
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,724
<i>who got hit?
You got contact with them?</i>

155
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,328
<i> on a small but
deadly road...</i>

156
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,163
<i>who's that gunner
right there?</i>

157
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,237
Anthony.

158
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,041
Regarding our friend
with the gray hair--

159
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,110
<i>I thought about it.
I want you to call Italy,</i>

160
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,345
Get some cousins
of ours over.

161
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,217
Who you want
to run the thing?

162
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,788
Got it.

163
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,157
Gotta get some tires
for Carmela's car.

164
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,730
- The wine's amazing.

165
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,067
Jennifer's our resident
italian wine expert.

166
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,137
Is Megan still in Prague,
Stace?

167
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:28,473
Jesus, her love life.
The girl she was
involved with, Cecily,

168
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,277
She's now having a torrid
pen-and-paper relationship

169
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,146
With an armed robber
in Attica.

170
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,115
What is this fascination
with criminals?

171
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,650
Rescue fantasy.
They think they
can fix them.

172
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,485
I'm worried for Cecily.

173
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,922
So I googled any new stuff
on sociopathic personalities.

174
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,525
Apparently,
the talking cure

175
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,827
Actually helps them
become better criminals.

176
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,762
<i>It was fascinating.</i>

177
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:55,133
The study was
by Yochelson and Samenow.

178
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,670
Studies turn around
every few years.

179
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,706
This other,
I think it was
Robert Hare,

180
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,708
Suggested
that sociopaths

181
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,710
Actually quite glibly

182
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,047
Engage on key issues,
like mother, family.

183
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,149
I seem to remember that
from residency.

184
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,151
Me too,
and I've read Hare,

185
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,720
But who's
a true sociopath?

186
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,890
<i>I had a guy
at the state asylum,</i>

187
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,260
Slow poisoner.
They even mimic empathy.

188
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,329
<i>They blubber and cry.</i>

189
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,731
Did you put her up
to this?

190
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,134
She just happened
to mention this study?

191
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:31,503
- Who? Me?
- Everything okay down there?

192
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,339
I don't know.

193
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,075
It's a study.
Food for thought.

194
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,676
She's blowing us off.

195
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,913
You just can't resist
rubbing my face in it.

196
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,515
I feel like
we should change the subject.

197
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,085
I only suggested you
reevaluate your work

198
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,288
With leadbelly
or be prepared
to deal with moral

199
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,357
<i>And possibly
legal consequences.</i>

200
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,226
- Leadbelly?
- Who's that?
Come on.

201
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,396
The answer is
a female opera singer

202
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,398
And gangster...

203
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,569
Elliot!

204
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,804
<i>Soprano.</i>

205
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,441
- Tony Soprano?
He's your patient?
- Wow.

206
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,111
<i>- That's pretty cool.
- Jesus Christ, Elliot.</i>

207
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,046
Chill out.
We're among friends.

208
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,648
We're all professionals.

209
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,221
So what's your verdict
on the wine, Jen?

210
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,390
All italians have
big noses.

211
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:28,060
If I had made that joke
about other groups

212
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,396
Represented
at this table,

213
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,464
I would be called
a bigot.

214
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>I meant italian reds.</i>

215
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,406
Still, it must be
fascinating work.

216
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,308
It is.

217
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,034
Have a seat.

218
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,371
<i>- What's up?
- Phil Leotardo.</i>

219
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16,275
Calls were made to zips.
They're coming over
from Naples.

220
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,377
You contact the guy
to contact the guys.

221
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,547
Phil's at his goomar's
every Friday night.

222
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,816
- T know about this?
- What?

223
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,785
- What kind of question is that?
- Watch your fat fucking mouth.

224
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:30,222
Hey, whoa whoa
whoa whoa. What are
you concerned about?

225
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,591
I lived through the '70s
by the skin of my nuts

226
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,793
When the columbos
were going at it.

227
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,463
There ain't a bigger
cocksucker than
Phil Leotardo.

228
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,865
I just wanna make sure
somebody knows

229
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,768
There could be a line
of cozarellis a mile long.

230
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,105
Duly noted. So there's
no problem then.

231
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,343
The criminal's

232
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:00,837
sentimentality

233
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:02,022
reveals

234
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,485
itself in

235
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:04,943
compassion

236
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:06,370
for babies

237
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,289
and pets.

238
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:11,735
The criminal

239
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:13,686
uses insight

240
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,013
to justify

241
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,721
heinous acts.

242
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:18,779
Therapy has

243
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,309
potential for

244
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,033
noncriminals;

245
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:24,520
for criminals

246
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,094
it becomes

247
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,477
one more

248
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,066
criminal

249
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,028
operation

250
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,694
Don't worry about them.

251
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,862
Paulie, those guys
are outside.

252
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,198
Fuck you talking
so loud for?

253
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,535
<i>Don't discuss this
until we're in
the piscia dun.</i>

254
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,540
It's all yours.

255
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,884
I just picked 'em up
at the airport.

256
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,603
<i>Anthony.</i>

257
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,286
So what do you clear
a year around here?

258
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,855
I don't mean
to pry, you know,
just round numbers.

259
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,798
I'm asking
because Meadow--

260
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,400
Well, I told
you she's taking
pre-med classes--

261
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,804
Well, she's not
gonna be a doctor.

262
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,241
She told us.

263
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,044
It's kind of sad,
isn't it?

264
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,646
Depends.

265
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,682
It's just a nice thing
to be,

266
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,417
Helping sick babies.

267
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,653
Her change of heart
bothers you?

268
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,756
Her mother too,
much more than me.

269
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,424
<i>I mean,
all that worrying--</i>

270
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,461
Which private school,
columbia university,

271
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,497
This and that,
and in the end

272
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,233
She'll get married,
squeeze out some kids

273
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,369
After what, a couple yea
in the work force?

274
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,605
- I'm still working.
- Yeah, but you're divorced.

275
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,844
Criminal law,
that's what she's taking up.

276
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,847
And I told Carmela,
it's not the end
of the world.

277
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,617
She's interested

278
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,387
In civil rights--

279
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,423
Muslims and blacks

280
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,293
And that and a dime.

281
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,930
Hopefully, she'll wind up
at a big firm--

282
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,901
White-collar crime.

283
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,505
<i>Just, you know,</i>

284
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,107
Dr. Soprano.

285
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,145
Sounds nice.

286
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,718
Your parents must
have been very proud.

287
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,420
I think so.

288
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,722
Look at all the people
like me you've helped.

289
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,326
With all
the human suffering
in this world,

290
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,927
You've done
something important...

291
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,733
Like those people

292
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,802
Who are trying
to help my son.

293
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,907
God bless 'em.

294
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,344
$2,000 a day
in that place,

295
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,746
But if it helps--

296
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,315
And as you know,
my plumbers' union
insurance

297
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,918
Only covers 10%
of mental.

298
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,490
He's really hurting--

299
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,759
A.J.

300
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,761
And you?

301
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,030
Although, maybe,
you know--

302
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,566
You know what?
Forget his hurts.
Maybe I should have just--

303
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,034
Put your shoe
up his ass?

304
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,271
Yeah yeah, frankly.

305
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,974
Well, we talked
about this.

306
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,043
Untalked about it.

307
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,945
Huh?

308
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,582
- Anyway, Carmela--
- Molly coddled him.

309
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,218
- My old man--
- Are you a shining example

310
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:02,288
For the huge collection
of wingtips and loafers

311
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,357
That must be lodged up
your lower bowel?

312
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,827
What's the matter
with you?

313
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,629
Is it because I said
that about being divorced?

314
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,032
You were saying.

315
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,401
He's my only son.

316
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,771
He's young.
Most of the time
they pull out of this.

317
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,874
But I've been depressed
for years. What if
he don't pull out?

318
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,043
So the boy who
never cared

319
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:26,078
About anything

320
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,814
Now cares
about too much.

321
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,616
Yeah, I guess.

322
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,819
And the daughter,
like all females,

323
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,023
Ultimately somehow
disappoints.

324
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,425
- I didn't say that.
- Oh.

325
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,027
What's with the tone?

326
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,329
You sound like
you're glad

327
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,165
I'm taking it
on the chin.

328
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,934
Maybe you're projecting
hostile feelings.

329
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,704
Bullshit.
If we had instant replay,

330
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,106
You'd see it
in two seconds.

331
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,042
Well, we don't have
instant replay.

332
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:59,545
I know that.
Jesus Christ, you sound
like my fucking wife.

333
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,348
- Your "fucking wife."
- You know what I mean.

334
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:05,017
The "departures"
magazine out there,

335
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,019
Did you give any thought
at all

336
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,156
To someone else
who might wanna read it

337
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:14,360
- Before you tore out
the entire page?
- What?

338
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,463
It's not the first time
you've defaced my
reading materials.

339
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,765
You saw that, huh?

340
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,701
People tear shit out
of your magazines
all the time.

341
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:25,271
They're a mess.
I try to read 'em.

342
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:27,473
I don't think
I can help you.

343
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,375
Well, change 'em.
Bring in some new shit.

344
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,143
I mean, therapeutically.

345
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,449
What are you
talking about?

346
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,352
I've only missed three
appointments since we
had that heart-to-heart.

347
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:43,088
The new big thing
these days is called

348
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,424
"psychodynamic therapy"

349
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,526
Combined with anafranil.

350
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,729
- Who?
- A medication. There's
a doctor in bloomfield

351
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,864
You could see.

352
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,633
Whoa whoa whoa whoa,
okay.

353
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,502
Now what the fuck
is this?

354
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,337
You're firing me

355
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:01,140
'cause I defaced
your "departures" magazine?

356
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:04,577
I'm giving you my considered
medical opinion.

357
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:07,079
Okay, I should
have asked you

358
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,348
For the steak recipe.

359
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,153
And missing sessions,
unfortunately, is part
of my condition.

360
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:17,156
What do you know
about your condition?

361
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:20,593
You miss appointments because
you don't give a shit

362
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,128
About commitments,
about what I do,

363
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:26,732
About the body of work
that's gone into

364
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,034
Building up
this science.

365
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,408
Go ahead, tell me again
I sound like your wife.

366
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,776
Well,
if the shoe fits...

367
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,881
We're making progress.
It's been seven years.

368
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,651
Do you want some names?

369
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,820
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna tell
you something

370
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:49,822
And you're not
gonna like it,

371
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,391
- But we can say anything
in here, right?
- Go ahead!

372
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,295
I'm chalking this
all up

373
00:24:56,296 --> 00:24:59,798
To female menopausal
situations.

374
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,967
You're not
my gynecologist.

375
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:05,070
Well, you don't need
a gynecologist to know
which way the wind blows.

376
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:15,547
So wait a minute,

377
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,249
You're telling me

378
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,084
After all this time,

379
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,554
<i>After everything
we shared in here,</i>

380
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,658
You're cutting me loose
just as my son got out
of the hospital

381
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,593
For trying
to kill himself?

382
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:32,331
Since you are in crisis,

383
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:34,266
I don't want to waste
your time.

384
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,904
I'm gonna be
fucking honest.

385
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,506
As a doctor,

386
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,075
I think what you're
doing is immoral.

387
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,253
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,188
d.H.L.

389
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,824
- Who?
- Package-a,

390
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:09,261
D.H.L. Express
for mr. Philip.

391
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:12,665
For sign.

392
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,371
For sign.

393
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,907
What are you doing?

394
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:30,469
Dad! Dad!

395
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:34,873
They have shot me, daddy.

396
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:00,681
Yeah.

397
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:52,898
- Yeah.
- It's done.

398
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,867
I think the love interest
got in the way, though.

399
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,304
<i>Couldn't be helped
apparently.</i>

400
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,140
<i>You ever see Phil
with the goomar?</i>

401
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,309
Once maybe.
Why?

402
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,944
Could he talk to her
in ukrainian?

403
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,413
Ukrainian?
The fuck do I know?

404
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,250
I gotta go.

405
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:20,559
Paulie, it's done.

406
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:34,840
Listen, I--

407
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,409
I quit therapy.

408
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,679
And this time
I'm never going back.

409
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,951
Except for that slight
improvement around
the shooting,

410
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,953
She wasn't doing you
much good anyway.

411
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,423
Here we go.

412
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:54,059
- Hi, strangers,
how are you?
- How are you?

413
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,029
- Good, not bad.
- Good good.

414
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,530
There they are.

415
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,133
So mead' was in here

416
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,635
With patrick parisi.

417
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,970
- Yeah.
- We are very happy.

418
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,805
Very happy.

419
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,041
Is it true what she said?
She's quitting pre-med?

420
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:12,878
Yes, thank god.
We are so relieved.

421
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,214
You know, with aids
and...

422
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,782
It's not just that.

423
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:19,518
I don't know one doctor
who is advising his
children

424
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,855
To go into medicine.
Between the insurance
companies

425
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,323
Over their shoulder,

426
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,158
The hospitals
are making cutbacks...

427
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,527
She'd have been good
at it, though, mead'.

428
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:31,263
Always intellectually
curious, even as a tyke.

429
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,666
But does compassion
come naturally to her?

430
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,468
Patience?
I'm not so sure.

431
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:37,970
What are you
talking about?

432
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,705
So what is she
gonna do now?

433
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,174
- Well...
- Law.

434
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,643
<i>- Oh!
- Constitutional law.</i>

435
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,979
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

436
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,481
What about A.J.?
How's he doing?

437
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,051
- He's good. He's good.
- Good.

438
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:57,823
Ton', you know
who's in tonight?

439
00:30:58,124 --> 00:30:59,425
"mangenius."

440
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,896
<i>The's the jets
coach, sweetie.</i>

441
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:07,132
- I should go say hello.
- Okay.

442
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,805
So Mead'
and Patrick Parisi?

443
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,009
Little awkward
though, maybe.

444
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,080
Patsy still works for Tony.
He's an underling.

445
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:24,917
Cupid's dart lands,
you know?

446
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:27,586
I'm gonna send some
limoncellos over
in celebration.

447
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,888
Great.

448
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:41,567
You don't answer
your fucking phone?

449
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,470
- I tried you 50 times
last night.
- Nah, we shut 'em off.

450
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,005
Gab came down
with a terrible case
of food poisoning.

451
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:52,811
You can pass the word
upstairs. The gray
goose is gone.

452
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:55,881
- Good.
- Apparently, the goomar had
to be taken out too.

453
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:58,017
But I say,
who gives a fuck?

454
00:31:58,018 --> 00:32:01,720
Remember that drunken
fucking scene she caused
at the "Jersey boys" party?

455
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,889
I actually felt bad
for Phil.

456
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:08,727
What's the matter?

457
00:32:08,728 --> 00:32:10,629
Whenever I think
of that fucking play,

458
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,098
I picture ma dying alone

459
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,001
Like a dog on that bus.

460
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:18,804
You're gonna make
someone happy with this
news today.

461
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:22,241
Think I'll ask
for some time off.

462
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:25,744
Hey, who does this
look like? Look.

463
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:51,003
Don't cry. Good little
girls don't cry.
Babies cry.

464
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,374
<i>Hey.</i>

465
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,177
- How's it going?
- Good.

466
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,613
Have my card game.

467
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,815
Carm volunteered
to take Nica.

468
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:06,852
Emptying the pool, huh?

469
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:09,722
- Cost a fortune to heat.
- Yeah.

470
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,492
What can I do you for?

471
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,661
Had a call
from Mario Diaco.

472
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,330
- Who's that?
- Uncle Jun's accountant,

473
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,901
The one with the artificial voice spot.
Says he's trying to reach you

474
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:24,770
<i>For two weeks.</i>

475
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:28,674
Uncle Jun's finally
out of money.

476
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,777
They think that
maybe there's some
squirreled around,

477
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:33,379
But he can't remember.

478
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,516
It's a fucking sin,
isn't it?

479
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:41,053
Plus, with the larynx,
he thinks Mario's

480
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:43,255
From outer space,
so...

481
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:45,224
<i>The upshot is
he can't pay</i>

482
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:47,293
For living at wycoff
psychiatric anymore,

483
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,828
And they're gonna move him
to a state facility.

484
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,232
I know, Tony,

485
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:56,435
But Jesus, those fucking
places are snake pits.

486
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,470
Then he'll make
some new friends.

487
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,408
I understand.

488
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,243
You gonna bail him out?

489
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:07,012
We don't have
that kind of money.
We'd contribute.

490
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:12,651
Bobby feels...

491
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:13,886
You know.

492
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,524
Right.

493
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,898
You got a lot of balls
coming to me.

494
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,402
And as for your husband,
Janice,

495
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:32,671
<i>- "Exile on main street."
- Don't say that.</i>

496
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:34,473
You trust a guy,
you bring him along

497
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,809
And for what?

498
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,612
<i>He feels sorry
for junior?</i>

499
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,420
Bullshit.

500
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,369
Ton', it's bad news.

501
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:12,411
Paulie said he wants
it known it's on him,

502
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:14,646
He takes full
responsibility,

503
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,915
But that he
didn't do nothing.

504
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:20,386
Shit.

505
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,889
Yeah, nobody,

506
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,226
I mean nobody, knows
where the fuck Phil is,

507
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,628
Four, five days now.

508
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:32,231
So we never really had
a shot at him.

509
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,402
How about the house
in Florida?

510
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:38,070
I had beans send
somebody past.

511
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:40,072
The house is all
shuttered up.

512
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:42,741
He put everything in place,
his moves on us.

513
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:45,277
He goes into hiding,
waits it out.

514
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,580
Going to ground,
they call it.

515
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,348
Who?

516
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:52,117
It's an expression.

517
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:56,822
Who knows what the fuck
he's got planned exactly.

518
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:59,758
You get word to everybody:
eyes in the back
of your head,

519
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,862
Break routines, collections,
all that shit.

520
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:08,833
- You tell everybody.
Got it.

521
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:12,938
In the meantime,
we keep trying.
Get a 20 on Phil.

522
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:41,934
- Beautiful.
- You never see a blue comet

523
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:45,170
In that condition.
I mean, look at the coaches.

524
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,906
Every window
still lights up.

525
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:50,142
If that train still ran
New York to A.C.,

526
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:53,312
Atlantic City would be
a much different place
today.

527
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:56,415
- Better class of people.
- I suppose.

528
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:59,118
Who the fuck
really knows?

529
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,622
Still, it's nice
to think that.

530
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:05,324
Imagine riding
in that club car,

531
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,959
<i>Sipping on a negroni.</i>

532
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,829
Eight grand
for the whole set, huh?

533
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,766
There's other people
interested.

534
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,841
I'm gonna go for it.

535
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:24,743
Your son will
like this too.

536
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,845
Looks fast.

537
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:31,250
He don't care.

538
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,997
- Hurry up,
for Christ's sake.
- All right, aspett'.

539
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,934
If I'm gonna be working
away from the office,
I should have this stuff.

540
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,168
You wanna make
yourself useful?

541
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,871
Get the girls' pay slips
over there.

542
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:28,874
Put 'em in a bag.
Or give 'em to me.

543
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,211
Come on.

544
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,750
All right.

545
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,199
Let's go.

546
00:38:56,536 --> 00:38:59,405
- Yeah, that's them there.
- Fuck!

547
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:01,440
What the fuck?

548
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:27,499
- Let's get the hell
out of here.

549
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:08,841
Wait here.

550
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:17,616
Melissa found a memory stick
in my prada bag that
wasn't printed.

551
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:19,952
God, remember what
a dick this guy was
at first?

552
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,188
<i>Yeah.</i>

553
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,025
I need to talk to you.

554
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:38,237
- Nobody called you?
- No. What's the matter?

555
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,075
Bobby's dead. He's shot.
Sil's in the hospital.

556
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:45,577
- What happened?
- Could be several things.

557
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,252
- "leave here"? What are you talking about?
- just temporarily,

558
00:40:53,253 --> 00:40:55,621
- till we get the situation
under control.
- what does that mean?

559
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,790
Carm, help me out here.
Don't argue.

560
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,959
- You mean they're after you.
- We should split up.

561
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,695
You and the kids go.
I'll be somewhere else.

562
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:04,330
<i>- Oh my god!
- Now look,</i>

563
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,365
Families don't get touched.
You know that, hmm?

564
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,234
<i>I just wanna know</i>

565
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,269
Every night that
you're not sitting here
out in the open.

566
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,850
Where should I go?
Where are you gonna go?

567
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:12,838
The house you just bought,

568
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,608
- The estate sale--
go there.
- Oh, Jesus.

569
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,643
A hotel then.
It doesn't fucking matter.

570
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,582
- Okay.
- You all right?

571
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:25,251
All right,
we gotta get moving.

572
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:26,519
And like I said,
it's just a precaution.

573
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,155
- What about your sister?
- She's gotta know by now.

574
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:32,324
We'll stop over there
after we're cleared out
of here.

575
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:34,760
- And Gab? How bad is Sil?
- We'll make some calls.

576
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,396
- Maybe I should go on ahead
of you over to Jan's.

577
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:38,931
- Carm...
- Meadow is basically living
at Patrick's, thank god.

578
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:40,699
A.J... how are you gonna
get him to go along?

579
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,369
- He won't leave the house.
- He's gonna leave the house.

580
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,037
- Tony...
- On a piece of plywood

581
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:47,039
If necessary, but he's
gonna leave the house.

582
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,175
Anything I can do?

583
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,476
- No.
- You heard?

584
00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:53,913
- Or maybe I should just leave.
- I'll call you.

585
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:57,849
It says shukrijumah
brought nuclear material

586
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,186
Into the country
from mexico in 2002.

587
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,087
Fuck.

588
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,591
Leave us alone, hon.

589
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:09,962
- Hang downstairs.
- Better yet, don't.

590
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:18,337
You just bust in?
We could have been
doing anything.

591
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:21,140
Yeah, but what
were you doing? Nothing.

592
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,709
We're just friends.

593
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:28,080
All right, listen.

594
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:29,648
Come, sit .

595
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,184
Come on.

596
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,691
Your uncle Bobby's dead.

597
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:42,294
- What?
- He's dead. He got shot.

598
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:44,396
- What do you mean,
"he got shot"?
- Listen to me,

599
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:48,367
And I don't have any time
to go into a debate about
any of this, okay?

600
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:51,504
And it's important
that we all leave

601
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:54,707
For a little while
until things settle down.

602
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,844
What? Holy fuck.

603
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,679
It's just a precaution.

604
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,916
The point is that...

605
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,819
I'm gonna be dependent
on you to help out
your mother.

606
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,954
- Help out how?
- Just do what she asks,

607
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:12,124
You know, chores,
tasks,

608
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,527
Whatever.

609
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:16,529
And don't add
to the problem.

610
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,864
What do you mean?
What the fuck did I do?

611
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:22,268
Don't break her balls,
all right, huh?

612
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:25,971
Just help her

613
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:27,873
With Aunt Janice,
whatever.

614
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:32,044
Uncle Bobby's dead.

615
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:34,346
Yeah.

616
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:38,984
This is really
depressing to me.

617
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,389
He was a good guy.

618
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:47,026
I was already having
so much trouble maintaining.

619
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:00,406
<i>My tailbone!</i>

620
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,641
Here, pack a bag.

621
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:05,144
Now!

622
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,746
And you won't need
no sandals or fucking
resort wear.

623
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,650
I'll be waiting
downstairs.

624
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:54,593
Oh my god.

625
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:56,595
Oh my god.

626
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:07,306
I called the hospital.
They wouldn't give
no info on Sil.

627
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:09,608
Gab's brother
finally phoned back.

628
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:12,477
Doctors don't think
he'll recover consciousness.

629
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,765
<i> look at the stems
on blondie.</i>

630
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:35,801
Heh!
He's riding high.

631
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:37,837
Nice to be young, huh?

632
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:44,703
I'm gonna bunk down here.

633
00:46:44,704 --> 00:46:46,639
All right, you go take care
of your wife,

634
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,308
That flu.

635
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:53,979
- You too.
- Where the fuck I gotta be?

636
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,548
Yeah, I'm gonna stay.

637
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:05,090
We order a pizz'.

638
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,426
Yeah.

639
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,601
<i>Get some meatballs
and sausage too.</i>

640
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:18,003
<i> - Couple of salads.
- No vegetarian pizza.</i>

641
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:59,278
<i>You probably don't
even hear it when it
happens, right?</i>

642
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,648
- Ask your friend in there,
on the wall.
