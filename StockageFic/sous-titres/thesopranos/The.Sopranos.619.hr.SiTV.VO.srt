1
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:31,194
6-19 - "THE SECOND COMING"

2
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:06,472
What's that?

3
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,760
I got a mysterious
package,

4
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:12,035
Postmarked Las Vegas.

5
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:16,059
Oh, "Baume & Mercier."

6
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,155
Oh my God.

7
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,113
This is so beautiful.

8
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:25,248
I had it engraved.

9
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,329
Here.

10
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,875
"You are my life.
love, T."

11
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:34,892
They couldn't fit
"Tony."

12
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:36,266
I believe that.

13
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:38,979
Thank you.

14
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,271
But I don't know
what it's for.

15
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,069
Well, like I said,
I was sorry

16
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,461
I had to go out
to Vegas when I did.

17
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,792
Once you explained

18
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:51,306
You had to take care of
Christopher's business interests...

19
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,506
God knows
Kelli'll need the money.

20
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,960
The baby.

21
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:15,965
I'm talking about
delay, right?

22
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,532
Just take care
of that, all right?

23
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,226
Bobby?

24
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,714
John Stefano.

25
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,737
You touchin' asbestos?

26
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,744
No, I don't work
with that shit.

27
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,726
It's okay.

28
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,688
Shame about
Chris Moltisanti.

29
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,860
These bozos?

30
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,159
Ecuadorians.
bunch of 'em polacks.

31
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,970
How come they ain't
wearing their space suits?

32
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,334
That's a union rule.

33
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,793
If I couldn't run this job
without that fucking contract,

34
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:46,455
Ain't none of us gonna
make any real scratch.

35
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,140
You don't got
an envelope?

36
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,736
You must have seen
fights before.

37
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,987
Your friends beating up
the african kid,

38
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,897
Why do you think that's
been impossible to shake?

39
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,923
They had my back after
all the shit with Blanca.

40
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:05,838
You know, they care
about me.

41
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:09,182
Did you try to stop
the beating?

42
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,923
I'm one individual.
what could I do?

43
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,646
I know kids on lexapro
who say it's great,

44
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,782
And I still feel
like shit.

45
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:28,080
I mean, why can't I
catch a fuckin' break?

46
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,091
Your classes,
how are you enjoying those?

47
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:34,217
English is boring.

48
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,128
And the other one's
kind of interesting,

49
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,053
But it's pretty
depressing.

50
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,304
The israeli-palestinian
conflict?

51
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,589
People blowing each other up
because their God says

52
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,129
They're allowed to live in a
certainatch of fuckin' sand.

53
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:51,682
Yeah, and other people's gods say
they're supposed to live there.

54
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:54,043
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken it.

55
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:56,764
You seem to be taking
it all personally.

56
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,975
These mujahideen assholes,
like in Indonesia,

57
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:02,085
And they, like,
want to kill everybody.

58
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,459
Have you considered writing
about your experience

59
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,434
with the somali boy?

60
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,769
A short story, perhaps?

61
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,416
Why would I do that?

62
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,738
It might help
clarify your feelings.

63
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,189
I was watching CNN...

64
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,586
And this story about these
kids in some iraqi hospital,

65
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,694
how the burn unit doesn't have
the right medicine or something.

66
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:29,618
And then they show
this story

67
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,159
about some mall
in Minnesota

68
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,729
And these gigantic
fat people

69
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,236
buying stuff

70
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,501
and eating all
this shit.

71
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,451
You know, it's like
my parents.

72
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:44,284
I mean, you should
see our house.

73
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,170
I mean, the stupid
coffeemaker they got,

74
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,895
the media room.

75
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,759
Then there's Blanca,

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,634
Her kid hardly talks.

77
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,867
She can't afford to send him
to a decent school.

78
00:06:58,157 --> 00:06:59,851
You think your feelings
about Blanca

79
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:04,350
In any way relate
to this african boy?

80
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:06,030
She's not black.

81
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,992
I mean,

82
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:12,510
She's pretty tan.

83
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:22,303
- Oh!
- There he is.

84
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:23,645
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

85
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,771
Welcome back, Ton'.

86
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,058
Good to see you again.

87
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,238
How was your trip?

88
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,817
Great.
Had a fuckin' blast.

89
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,511
Yeah?

90
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,905
Business too.
Christopher's shit.

91
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,791
Some fucking guys
out there owed him money.

92
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,702
Little Carmine took it on the
"cleaver" set. we had it framed.

93
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,718
Talk about a trip--

94
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:54,229
I met this girl,
she was fuckin' beautiful.

95
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,029
Oh yeah?

96
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,908
- Boys.
- Hey.

97
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,914
- We did peyote.
- Come on.

98
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,994
- Really?
- Bobby did mushrooms once.

99
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:06,328
Stuffed mushrooms,
a whole fuckin' platter.

100
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,759
- Fuck you, huh?

101
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:13,557
Anyway, that's--
that's some nutty shit,

102
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,108
The desert...

103
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,908
The light.

104
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:22,342
I did "x" once. the
fucking was incredible.

105
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:26,544
Oh, yeah yeah, you kiddin'?
Off the fuckin' charts.

106
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,733
- You wouldn't believe it.
- Really?

107
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,819
And the sun...

108
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,700
Came up...

109
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,463
Oh yeah?

110
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,579
Well.

111
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,783
We saw Stefano.

112
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:48,655
He didn't have
an envelope.

113
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,935
Any movement on that?

114
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,087
Eh, we should
probably see Phil.

115
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:59,353
I got dosed with acid
once, back in '68.

116
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:01,581
I was with your dad
and them at the copa.

117
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,566
Fuckin' b.o.a.c stewardess
put it in my drink.

118
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,275
Jerry vale started
singing and I look over,

119
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,350
Your uncle Jun's got laser
beams shooting out of his eyes.

120
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,123
I used to love
that house, but now...

121
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:19,314
It's so big,
especially at night.

122
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,507
You're afraid, you know,
all you got to do is call.

123
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,925
Right?

124
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,724
Two minutes,
I'll be over.

125
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:26,685
I know.
Thank you.

126
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:29,165
You've been so great.
Both of you.

127
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:31,837
Well, Meadow had another
mystery date.

128
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:34,009
That sounds exciting.

129
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,558
What are you doing?
Sit.

130
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,325
I made your favorite,
steak pizzaiol'.

131
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,225
You know they spray
a virus on beef

132
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:52,940
rather than clean the ratshit
out of the slaughterhouses?

133
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:55,123
- What is this now?
- Jesus Christ.

134
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:57,824
It's true.
Read the paper.

135
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:01,171
I do
read the paper.

136
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,775
Never heard that.

137
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,295
I'm not talking
about the sports page.

138
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:09,093
I mean, the F.D.A.?
They approved a virus spray

139
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,984
because it kills a similar
bacteria found on meat.

140
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:14,021
Must be
a good thing then.

141
00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:16,532
Yeah.
For the meatpackers,

142
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,123
the fucking God
of the bottom line.

143
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,333
All right,
that's enough.

144
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:22,768
- We're trying to eat here,

145
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,195
and you're upsetting people
that have been through a tragedy.

146
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,612
Fine. Bury your head
in the sand.

147
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,560
How about I bury yours
in that fuckin' wall instead?

148
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,241
- Tony.
- For 20 years, he won't crack a book,

149
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,007
all of a sudden he's the
world's foremost authority.

150
00:10:46,635 --> 00:10:48,717
At least he's getting
an education.

151
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,605
An education's to help you
get a better job.

152
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,473
He's actually reading.
This can't be bad.

153
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:57,097
"The blood-dimmed tide
is loosed,

154
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:59,770
and everywhere,
the ceremony of innocence

155
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:01,290
is drowned;

156
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:04,168
<I>The best lack
all conviction,

157
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:08,270
<I>while the worst are full
of passionate intensity.

158
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,432
Surely some revelation

159
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,903
is at hand."

160
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:15,416
"...Somewhere
in the sands of the desert

161
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,327
<I>a shape with lion body

162
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:22,069
<I>and the head of a man, a gaze
blank and pitiless as the sun,

163
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,169
<I>is moving its slow thighs,

164
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:28,353
<I>while all about it reel shadows
of the indignant desert birds.

165
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,756
<I>The darkness drops again;

166
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,762
<I>but now I know that
twenty centuries of stony sleep

167
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:37,572
<I>were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle,

168
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,107
<I>and what rough beast,
its hour come round at last,

169
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:44,153
<I>slouches towards Bethlehem
to be born?"

170
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:49,714
Hey, Tony.

171
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,691
You don't look
so good.

172
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:54,842
This job.

173
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:57,149
You want a sandwich?
a cannoli

174
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,378
on the house?

175
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,217
No, this microbe
of mine--

176
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:01,472
from Pakistan.

177
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,608
- Still?
- You got a minute?

178
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,296
We'd like to show you
some pictures.

179
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,494
Angelina Jolie,
I hope.

180
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,332
These the gentlemen?

181
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,311
That's them.

182
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,351
What the fuck?
what?

183
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:24,014
Don't know.
financing, maybe.

184
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,055
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:28,944
Honestly, I'm not even sure we
still have them in the country.

186
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:32,925
Thanks
for stopping by.

187
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,842
Next time we'll have
party hats.

188
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,205
Hey.

189
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,293
Your nephew's widow,

190
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,913
she get my flowers?

191
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:53,630
Well, if you sent 'em,
I'm sure she did.

192
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,303
Well, I won't expect
a thank you anytime soon.

193
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:59,843
The grieving process, it takes
time the closer you are to somebody.

194
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,489
Yeah, I know.

195
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,733
So, brass tacks,

196
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,088
what brings you
all the way out to the city?

197
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,266
Good news. the condos
at the navy yard--

198
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,976
Paulie's guy at
the joint fitters

199
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,705
says they're
breaking ground.

200
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:18,420
- Well, that is good.
- Good, yeah.

201
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,738
Uh, the other thing,
this asbestos--

202
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,576
I thought about
your offer.

203
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:29,391
What do you say
to 15%

204
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,086
plus we forget
about the balance

205
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,053
of what you owe me
on the vitamin truck?

206
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:35,683
First off,
it wasn't an offer.

207
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:39,205
It's my position: 25%.

208
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:41,347
That's it?

209
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,569
What else would you
like me to say?

210
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,816
Come on, Phil,
what's the problem?

211
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,260
I come here
in good faith,

212
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,205
I make a reasonable
counter.

213
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,746
Which I considered...
and rejected.

214
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:55,955
Do we need to talk
in private?

215
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,537
For what?

216
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:02,344
Okay then, in front
of everybody...

217
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,719
When you were sick

218
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,583
in the hospital,

219
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:08,799
we talked.

220
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:11,552
We shared a...

221
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:17,148
an understanding
about life.

222
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,964
This is business, Anthony.

223
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,917
Yeah, I know.

224
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,870
But I'm talking to you
here on a human level.

225
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:27,488
There's a limit, Phil.
Come on.

226
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:30,914
A point where business
bleeds into other shit,

227
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,390
feelings make things
financially unfeasible.

228
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,222
Charles Schwab
over here.

229
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,446
So that's it?

230
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,359
no leeway, no compromise,
Just stupid fuckin' jokes?

231
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:55,643
You want compromise?
How's this?

232
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:57,569
20 years in the can,

233
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,328
I wanted manicott'.

234
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,399
I compromised.

235
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:05,064
I ate grilled cheese
off the radiator instead.

236
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,906
I wanted
to fuck a woman,

237
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,594
but I compromised.

238
00:15:09,595 --> 00:15:11,769
I jacked off
in a tissue.

239
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,098
You see where
I'm going?

240
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,746
Yeah.

241
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:29,825
- Butch, Coco, didn't anybody call you guys?
- About what?

242
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:34,636
- Don't tell me the fuckin' checks are late?
- There ain't any checks.

243
00:15:34,637 --> 00:15:37,239
- The fuck you talkin' about?
- Silvio-- mr. Soprano's guy--

244
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,885
Came by this morning,
said to pull your jobs.

245
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,650
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Fuck that.

246
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,593
- Where's our money?
- I don't got it, there's no jobs.

247
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:46,328
Motherfucker.

248
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,128
I'm sorry, guys. somebody
really should have called you.

249
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,177
Hey!

250
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,052
- Jesus Christ!
- Ho!

251
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,269
Guys, that's enough, come on.
It's not his fault.

252
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,495
- Oh, yeah? Maybe it's your fuckin' fault?

253
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,833
Call the police!

254
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,740
Tony Soprano
owes you $320.

255
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:27,439
Hey.

256
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,849
I was just watching
"Borat" on cable.

257
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,442
You can watch that thing 50
times and it's still hilarious.

258
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,202
He brings that lady
his shits.

259
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:43,494
It wasn't fair
to the people involved.

260
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,636
You loved it
when it came out.

261
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,895
What do you want,
Meadow?

262
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:52,206
- How was your exam?
- I didn't take it.

263
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:56,756
Leave that!

264
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:59,510
Okay?
Thank you.

265
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,478
Why didn't you
take the test?

266
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,940
'Cause I dropped out,
okay?

267
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,922
What's going on
with you?

268
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,265
I'm your sister,

269
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:17,872
you have
to talk to me.

270
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,635
Is this still
about Blanca?

271
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:24,472
You know, I don't
know anymore.

272
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,724
I know how
you feel, okay?

273
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:34,383
When Finn and I split,
I cried every day

274
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,089
For, like, a month.

275
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,238
You realize we're
gonna bomb Iran?

276
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,189
You don't know that.

277
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,746
You watch.

278
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:45,470
Bush, before he
leaves office--

279
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,811
And you know
I'm right.

280
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,262
Okay.

281
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,420
But you need to learn
to shut stuff out.

282
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,687
Are you crazy?

283
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,081
I mean, do you hear
what we're talking about?

284
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,098
You say that,
but I come in here

285
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,423
and you're surfing
the web for porn.

286
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,275
It's not porn.

287
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,102
"Al Jazeera"?

288
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:18,344
Don't you ever feel like
there's no point to any of this?

289
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:22,161
Why don't you try
setting goals for yourself?

290
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:24,215
Maybe you
should move out?

291
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,720
Oh right,
in my condition?

292
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:28,537
I mean, I can't
hold a job.

293
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,145
Jesus, A.J., there has to
be something you can do.

294
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:34,433
Look, I'm ill, Meadow.
All right, I'm on medication.

295
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:37,362
Millions of people
take lexapro.

296
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,253
I need mom's cooking.

297
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,501
It could mess
with my blood chemistry.

298
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:43,486
Do mom and dad know
you dropped out?

299
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:45,722
No, and don't
tell them.

300
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,883
I took time off,
remember?

301
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,742
They broke my balls
but it really wasn't so bad.

302
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,485
Of course not.
I mean, you're their pet.

303
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:56,979
We're italian, A.J.
You're their son.

304
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:59,606
Do you have any idea
what that means?

305
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,815
You'll always be
more important.

306
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,789
You're awake.

307
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,941
I made Lincoln log
sandwiches.

308
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,536
Maybe later.

309
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,325
I am meeting Gab
for lunch,

310
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:26,400
and then we are
stopping at Nordstrom's.

311
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:30,899
If you go out, make sure
you set the alarm.

312
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,867
Okay?

313
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:55,805
Jeez!

314
00:20:56,616 --> 00:20:57,864
Ah!

315
00:21:43,873 --> 00:21:45,880
Somebody!

316
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,085
Help!

317
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:51,534
Help!

318
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,314
Help! My arms!
They're frozen!

319
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:04,448
A.J., what the fuck?

320
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,711
Dad! Help--!

321
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:08,524
Help!

322
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:17,789
No, dad!
Ah!

323
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,611
- My leg, it's stuck!
- On what?

324
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:24,472
Huh?

325
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,317
What the fuck
did you do?

326
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:30,006
Hel-- Help!

327
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,626
All right, I got you.
stop fighting me.

328
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:43,875
- All right...
- Don't--

329
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:46,193
All right, turn around.
Grab the side.

330
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,704
Grab the side
right there.

331
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:50,895
All right.

332
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,337
All right.

333
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,656
God damn it.

334
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,173
Hold that.

335
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:16,997
Help me.

336
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,874
All right,
climb!

337
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:20,635
Ah!

338
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:35,717
What's wrong
with you?!

339
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,893
All right.
Are you all right?

340
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,488
All right, come here.

341
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:49,595
Come on.

342
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,105
Turn around.

343
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:53,991
Come on, baby.

344
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,787
You're all right, baby.

345
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:59,673
You're all right, baby.
You're all right.

346
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:03,176
You're all right.

347
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,676
Well, here we are.

348
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:14,997
I'll get him settled. You can come
tomorrow during visiting hours.

349
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,206
I love you, sweetie.

350
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:20,656
- I love you.
- I love you too.

351
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,365
He's had a lot
of valium.

352
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,454
But he was better
for a while.

353
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:53,085
Look, it's not
your fault.

354
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:54,770
You warned us.

355
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,698
Come on, come on.

356
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:06,547
Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

357
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:08,125
It will, mom.

358
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,875
But he was always
so happy.

359
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:14,219
He was our
happy little boy.

360
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,964
I mean, God.

361
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,073
Come here, baby.

362
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:28,699
There you go.
White walls.

363
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:40,828
- Skip.
- Hey, Ton'.

364
00:25:44,248 --> 00:25:45,850
There he is.

365
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,465
You hungry, T.? You want, I'll
send the kid for Baja fresh.

366
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,815
Anything from Phil?

367
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:54,040
No, not yet.

368
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:05,719
All right, let's dispense with the
500-lb elephant in the room, eh?

369
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,509
My kid tried
to off himself.

370
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,389
We all fuckin' know.

371
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,622
That's it.

372
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:22,291
Nobody's got
nothing to say?

373
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:25,627
How's he doin', Ton'?

374
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:29,247
They got him
under observation.

375
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,416
Whatever the fuck
that means.

376
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,722
Stupid fuck.

377
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:41,417
Where did I lose
this kid?

378
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,215
What did I do wrong?

379
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:45,825
Whoa, come on.

380
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,767
Don't blame
yourself, T.

381
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:50,120
A lot of pressure
on kids today, Ton'.

382
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,509
Still, to try
to kill himself?

383
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,102
It's happens, skip.

384
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:57,060
Happen to your kids?

385
00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:59,391
Or yours?

386
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:01,283
They're all
different, Ton'.

387
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:02,626
My son Patrick?

388
00:27:02,627 --> 00:27:04,211
I love him to death,

389
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:05,984
but he can be a moody
prick sometimes.

390
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:08,757
Heather, you know,
she was 15,

391
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:11,081
she went through
a rough patch.

392
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:12,722
Jason, same thing.

393
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:15,192
And he's got the
hyperactivity to boot.

394
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:19,124
My son too.
The older one, James.

395
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,355
- He tried to kill himself?
- No no.

396
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:25,173
I don't know, he--
he gets the blues.

397
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:29,021
The important thing is A.J.'s
getting the help he needs.

398
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:33,090
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it's a chemical imbalance.

399
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:36,299
Ask me, it's all these
toxins they're exposed to.

400
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,399
It fucks
with their brains.

401
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,225
Between the mercury
in fish alone,

402
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:43,501
it's a wonder there ain't
more kids jumping off bridges.

403
00:28:06,045 --> 00:28:08,003
I can't
fuckin' shake it.

404
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:10,262
Shake what?

405
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:13,469
- I'm depressed.
- Excuse me?

406
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,267
I'm depressed.

407
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,539
I'm telling you,
don't you start now.

408
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,774
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

409
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:23,999
I have enough on my plate, I don't need
you adding to it with your bullshit.

410
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,476
Bullshit?

411
00:28:25,767 --> 00:28:27,257
It's an illness.

412
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:28,936
And it's fuckin'
hereditary.

413
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:30,051
Thank you, I know.

414
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:32,778
I am intimately acquainted
with the Soprano curse.

415
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,440
Your father, your uncle,
your great-grandfather

416
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:37,812
Who drove the donkey cart
off the road in Avellino,

417
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:40,394
- All of it.
- What, you think it's a joke?

418
00:28:40,395 --> 00:28:43,652
- Am I laughing?
- Then what are you saying?

419
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:49,758
He didn't get it
from my family,

420
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:51,588
that's all
I'm gonna say.

421
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,289
Your family don't
even talk.

422
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:55,676
Your father's
so bottled up

423
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:57,838
It's a wonder he's even
got a stomach left.

424
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,723
- As opposed to yours?
- At least my father was upfront about what was bothering him.

425
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,982
- Right, with a bullet through your mother's beehive hairdo.
- Oh, I knew it.

426
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:08,115
I was wondering how long it was gonna
take for you to throw that up at me.

427
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,681
You're amazing,
You know that?

428
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:12,901
In high school, you were
the happy-go-lucky rascal,

429
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:15,204
the comedian,
the rapscallion.

430
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,591
But all of that was
bullshit, wasn't it?

431
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,191
Oh, poor you.

432
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,466
She got married
under false pretenses.

433
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,404
You've been playing
the depression card

434
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:25,520
until it is worn
to shreds.

435
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:27,541
And now you've got
our son doing it.

436
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,671
Card? Card?

437
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:30,736
You heard me.

438
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,250
Oh, so it's
all me, huh?

439
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:35,050
Our sonny boy? you had
nothing to do with it?

440
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:38,555
It wears you down, Tony.
That's all I'm saying.

441
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,241
Do you have any idea what it's
like to spend day after day

442
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:43,967
with somebody who is
constantly complaining?

443
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:47,738
Fuck you.

444
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,390
It could have been
a cry for help.

445
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,291
Aren't you listening?
He did cry for help.

446
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:13,714
He's lucky I came
home and heard him.

447
00:30:14,342 --> 00:30:16,385
I meant
the botched attempt.

448
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
On some level,
he may have known

449
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:21,920
that the rope was too long
to keep him submerged.

450
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,188
Or he could just be
a fuckin' idiot.

451
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:26,638
Historically,
that's been the case.

452
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:33,696
Me and Carm were
getting along so good too.

453
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,467
My father and his
panic attacks,

454
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,605
my fuckin'
demented uncle,

455
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:45,369
not to mention the other one--
eckley the fuckin' retard.

456
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:50,019
You think there are other reasons
why your son is so unhappy?

457
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:53,246
He's got the world
by the balls--

458
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,856
Every fuckin' advantage--

459
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:58,761
And he hits one little pothole
and he goes into hysterics.

460
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:04,673
Yeah, I know.

461
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,067
I'm not taking
the rap,

462
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,696
not completely.

463
00:31:12,024 --> 00:31:15,184
She coddled him, his mother.
I said it before.

464
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,511
Every little problem,
she's right there

465
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:21,648
to pick him up
and wipe off his tears

466
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,741
on her apron strings.

467
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:26,279
Children need
to feel safe.

468
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:29,345
I'm sure that made him
into the man he is today.

469
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,262
Are you ashamed of him?

470
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:38,177
Yeah, actually I am.

471
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,108
The coward's way out.

472
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,125
Isn't that
what they call it?

473
00:31:43,126 --> 00:31:46,309
I think whoever said that
didn't understand depression.

474
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:50,476
But you do, don't you?

475
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:03,252
Where's dad?

476
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:06,407
Oh, Meadow got rear-ended
on Bloomfield Avenue.

477
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:09,574
- He'll come see you later.
- Is he still mad?

478
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:11,598
He was never mad, A.J.

479
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:13,247
He loves you.

480
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,145
How long do
I have to stay here?

481
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,972
Dr. Vogel thinks it
might be a good idea

482
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,514
for the time being
just to take a time-out.

483
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:25,083
Like I'm in preschool?

484
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,598
Did you see
Dr. Vogel today?

485
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,303
Today we have group.

486
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:52,311
Did you eat today?

487
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:55,724
I had some turkey.
It had no flavor at all.

488
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:58,496
I'll bring some
chicken parm tomorrow.

489
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,188
I don't think
that's allowed

490
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,448
On account of all
the bulimic girls.

491
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:11,210
So it's front-row mezzanine
at "Grey Gardens,"

492
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,137
- And the guy says--
- Excuse me?

493
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:17,012
- You're Tony Soprano's kid, right?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,918
Small world, running
into you like this, huh?

495
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:21,603
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

496
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:24,266
You got a little cream
on your mouth there, sweetie.

497
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,329
Be happy to add to it.

498
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,798
- What?
- Excuse me.

499
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,708
Lucky guy, her dad.

500
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,986
Must be fun tucking her
in at night, huh?

501
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:36,219
- Do you have a problem?
- Not yet.

502
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,879
Would you like one?

503
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,461
Coco, come on.

504
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:41,202
What?
I'm saying hello.

505
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:43,124
Come on,
let's go.

506
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,455
Hey, best to
your dad, huh?

507
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,227
What the hell
was that?

508
00:33:57,098 --> 00:33:59,689
...But that is not
for you to decide.

509
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:02,600
Don't say anything.

510
00:34:04,307 --> 00:34:06,731
What, are you two talking
about me again?

511
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,726
What's the matter?

512
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,082
Nothing.

513
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:17,825
What?

514
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:24,150
Do you know a guy
named Coco?

515
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,383
Why?

516
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:27,816
She was out
on a date last night

517
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,173
and he came over
and pulled some crap.

518
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:31,392
What?

519
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:34,706
How?

520
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,658
We were in the City,
Little Italy.

521
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,326
We were
having dessert, and...

522
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,848
He came up
out of nowhere

523
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:42,902
and just started saying
all this weird stuff.

524
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,521
What kind of weird stuff?

525
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,635
How he'd like
to tuck me in at night.

526
00:34:47,636 --> 00:34:48,690
Stuff like that.

527
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:52,756
- Tuck you in?
- I could smell the sambuca on his breath.

528
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,761
What exactly
did he say?

529
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,406
He came up to us

530
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,998
and he asked me if
I was your daughter

531
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:05,901
and then he said
I had whipped cream

532
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,416
on my mouth.

533
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:10,083
Yeah?

534
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,143
What else did he say?

535
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,522
It's all right.

536
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:24,068
It's okay.
He's an idiot,

537
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:25,929
but he's harmless.

538
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:29,184
I'll talk
to somebody.

539
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,597
So this boy
you're dating,

540
00:35:35,598 --> 00:35:38,568
this man,
who is he?

541
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,008
You promise not to start
with an inquisition?

542
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:43,674
Will you stop with all
the secrecy, please?

543
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,016
- It's Patrick Parisi, okay?
- You're kidding me?

544
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:50,806
That's exactly why I didn't
want to tell you guys,

545
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:53,040
and why he didn't tell
uncle Patsy.

546
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:56,933
I thought he--
Where are you going?

547
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:58,881
Meeting-- Sil.

548
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:01,064
We have Vogel later,
don't forget.

549
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:05,545
I thought Pat Parisi
was engaged.

550
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:07,108
They broke it off.

551
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,306
We kind of hooked up
at the "cleaver" premiere,

552
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:10,880
we started talking.

553
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,438
He's changed a lot.

554
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:15,623
I really like him.

555
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:18,155
So why the big mystery
all this time?

556
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:20,751
I knew you and daddy
never liked him.

557
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:22,505
No, it's not that
we didn't like him,

558
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:23,764
It's just...

559
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,814
So all those times
you told me

560
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:31,047
you were staying with your
friend Kimmie in the City,

561
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:33,470
I suppose you were staying
at his apartment?

562
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:34,835
Sometimes.

563
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:40,269
Look, there's
something else.

564
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,703
What?

565
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,382
I've decided not
to go to med school.

566
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:48,519
What? Why?

567
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,404
Oh, it's just too hard.

568
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:53,800
- Isn't anything that's worthwhile?
- You have no idea.

569
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:57,858
- Of course not.
- Don't get sarcastic.

570
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:00,429
I really think
it's law for me.

571
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:03,769
I mean, you should hear Patrick
talk about the justice system

572
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,560
and what it means.

573
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:08,236
It's really inspiring.

574
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:25,303
Obviously Sheila resents me.
I'm dating her father.

575
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,810
The sullen looks,
the transference to me

576
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,710
of her issues
with her mom...

577
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,528
As your favorite
patient says,

578
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:36,429
"maybe I should put
my shoe up her ass?"

579
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,213
Which patient of mine
says that?

580
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,057
Mine, Elliot.

581
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,229
Your favorite patient
of mine?

582
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,440
Oh.

583
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:48,222
He hasn't been
in the paper much lately.

584
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:50,078
You miss that,
don't you?

585
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:53,424
My father was a rabid
"untouchables" fan.

586
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:55,933
Make of that
what you will.

587
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,859
What, Elliot?

588
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:04,062
I ran into Nancy Duggan
last week.

589
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:07,150
- Do you know Nancy?
- Vaguely.

590
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,876
She's on staff
at Rikers Island,

591
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:12,020
works with a lot of
sociopaths, as you can imagine.

592
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:15,513
Anyway, she told me
something interesting.

593
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,530
A lot of studies
about talk therapy

594
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:20,793
as it relates
to sociopaths

595
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:21,992
and criminals,

596
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:25,753
one of them is the
criminal personality

597
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:29,383
conducted by Yochelson
at St. Elizabeth's.

598
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:30,872
essentially

599
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,425
it concludes

600
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,522
that talk therapy,

601
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:38,731
while not only being
useless with sociopaths,

602
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:41,577
actually serves
to validate them.

603
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:46,333
Yochelson says they sharpen
their skills as conmen

604
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,577
on their therapists.

605
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:52,566
Crocodile tears,
what have you.

606
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:54,573
Why are you smirking?

607
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:57,260
- I'm not.
- Oh really?

608
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,018
We showed data.

609
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:02,899
The one-year
reconviction rates

610
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,694
were higher for
offenders in therapy

611
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:09,071
than for those receiving
no treatment at all.

612
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,351
Uh, some peppers
and cheese.

613
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:23,608
Eh, gorgonzola,
all right? Don't forget.

614
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:27,948
Whoa whoa!

615
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,071
Sit down.

616
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:31,482
- Sit down.
- Easy easy.

617
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:37,167
You motherfucker.
my fucking daughter?

618
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:40,114
My fucking daughter,
you motherfucker.

619
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:41,423
My fuckin' daughter!

620
00:39:42,274 --> 00:39:44,167
Hey, want some
sambuca with this?

621
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:47,794
Tony, you're making
a big fuckin' mistake here.

622
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:51,472
How about I put a bullet
in your fuckin' head, huh?

623
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:01,768
Don't do it!

624
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:10,698
You want some?

625
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,470
Get a mop.

626
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:27,690
It's always what
you think, isn't it?

627
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,515
It's never how I feel.

628
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,956
Oh, poor you.

629
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:35,856
It's all your mother's
fault, isn't it?

630
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:38,560
- I didn't say that.
- You're a mama's boy.

631
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,614
You're gonna
call me names now?

632
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:43,225
No one is calling
anyone any names.

633
00:40:43,226 --> 00:40:44,958
How about
my confirmation?

634
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,635
You called me
an animal.

635
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,038
I did not!

636
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,025
I was in the garage
and you said,

637
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:53,408
"what kind of animal smokes
marijuana at his confirmation?"

638
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:56,728
He was using illegal drugs
in the home.

639
00:40:56,729 --> 00:41:00,565
Did it ever occur to you that I
might have been self-medicating?

640
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:03,716
Give me a break,
will you?

641
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:07,334
And how about
second grade?

642
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:10,083
You made me show up to
school in that dorky raincoat.

643
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:13,456
I got beat up
because of it.

644
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:18,121
You would hole
up in that room for hours.

645
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:23,472
Because I was never really secure
expressing my feelings in that house.

646
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,996
I mean, that's why.

647
00:41:32,302 --> 00:41:35,812
What kind of poem is that
to teach college students?

648
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,960
Would you like
to tell your parents

649
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,932
what your
grandmother said?

650
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:49,085
My mother?

651
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:53,885
Grandma--
dad's mom.

652
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:56,165
What'd she say?

653
00:41:56,885 --> 00:41:58,717
That it's all
a big nothing.

654
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:00,084
What is?

655
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,412
Life.

656
00:42:05,488 --> 00:42:07,535
That was her,
all right.

657
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:09,900
Okay, fine, she said
those kinds of things--

658
00:42:09,901 --> 00:42:11,971
She sat up in bed--

659
00:42:12,473 --> 00:42:14,471
When she could
hardly move.

660
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,590
She could hardly
breathe.

661
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,657
She said in the end that your
friends and family let you down,

662
00:42:22,658 --> 00:42:25,267
and that you die
in your own arms.

663
00:42:25,268 --> 00:42:26,837
When was this?

664
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:28,788
When she was
in that nursing home

665
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,139
and you used
to make me go see her.

666
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,445
We're not too young
to be grandpas.

667
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:46,213
Ton'?

668
00:42:46,214 --> 00:42:48,212
Carmine Lupertazzi.

669
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:51,469
- I'll see you later, skip.
- All right.

670
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:55,210
We should have dinner,

671
00:42:55,211 --> 00:42:57,347
You know, Carm,
donna, maybe the kids.

672
00:42:57,348 --> 00:42:58,374
Yeah.

673
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,412
I hear wedding bells
are in the air.

674
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:07,832
You want anything?

675
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:09,764
No, I'm good.

676
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:21,186
If there's anything I can
do, Tony, for Anthony Jr....

677
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:23,119
Thank you.

678
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:26,026
When Alexandra had
that bout of anorexia,

679
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,550
we had this terrific
psychologist.

680
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:31,150
she tried to kill herself,
your daughter?

681
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,560
No.

682
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:35,160
She had serious problems
though, didn't she?

683
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:37,849
Not really.
it's all under control.

684
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,464
So...

685
00:43:43,141 --> 00:43:44,886
The reason I'm here

686
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:46,922
you could
probably guess.

687
00:43:47,286 --> 00:43:49,603
What happened
at Coco's restaurant.

688
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,931
This alteration
you had with him--

689
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:55,548
You're at
the precipice, Tony,

690
00:43:55,663 --> 00:43:57,771
of an enormous crossroad.

691
00:43:58,025 --> 00:44:00,508
Phil's considering shutting
down the hackensack mall project

692
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,960
with a plumbing strike
as we speak.

693
00:44:03,272 --> 00:44:05,060
Fuck it.
let him.

694
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:07,554
Easy for you. I have
the scaffolding contract.

695
00:44:07,555 --> 00:44:09,590
Oh, is that what
this is about, Carmine?

696
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:10,894
What do I owe you?

697
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:13,841
Come on, huh?
You know me better than that.

698
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:17,076
My daughter, Carmine.
My daughter.

699
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:19,469
You got a little girl.

700
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,833
You almost
killed the guy.

701
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:23,568
I should've killed him.
I'd have had total support,

702
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:27,546
- but I held myself back!
- You were being prudent.

703
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:29,238
Fuck that.

704
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,916
I lost it.

705
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,853
Timing couldn't have been
worse, but what the fuck?

706
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:40,714
So you go to Phil,

707
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:43,299
I go with you,
hats in hand,

708
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,898
bended knees.

709
00:44:58,694 --> 00:45:00,736
Why me, huh?

710
00:45:01,482 --> 00:45:04,258
Doesn't every parent
make mistakes?

711
00:45:04,755 --> 00:45:06,463
Why not you?

712
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,364
'Cause I'm
a good guy...

713
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:10,091
basically.

714
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:13,879
I love my family.

715
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:19,075
There's a balance.
There's a ying and a yang.

716
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:20,525
Huh?

717
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:30,516
You think you know.
You think you learned something.

718
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,719
Like when I got shot.

719
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,833
Know what?

720
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:40,525
All right.

721
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:45,577
When I was in Las Vegas,
I took peyote.

722
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:48,742
Curiosity,
I don't know.

723
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:51,412
You were searching
for something.

724
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,072
Well, I saw some things.
not...

725
00:45:57,376 --> 00:45:59,232
things, per se,
hallucinations,

726
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:01,026
Roger Corman shit.

727
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:04,840
- It was kind of disappointing, there wasn't any of that.
- What was there?

728
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:07,172
It's kind of hard
to describe.

729
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:11,541
I mean, you've done it, right?
acid, shit like that.

730
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:12,742
No.

731
00:46:19,265 --> 00:46:21,241
All I can say is

732
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:24,629
I saw,
for pretty certain,

733
00:46:25,505 --> 00:46:27,051
that this...

734
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:29,709
Everything we see
and experience,

735
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,459
is not all there is.

736
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:34,199
What else is there?

737
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:37,073
Something else.

738
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:41,673
But that's as far as
I'm gonna go with it.

739
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,468
I don't fuckin' know.

740
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:46,786
Alternate universes?

741
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:49,009
You gonna be
a fuckin' comedian now?

742
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,216
I'm not.

743
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,027
Maybe.

744
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,356
This is gonna
sound stupid...

745
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,700
But I saw at one point
that our mothers are...

746
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,892
They're bus drivers.

747
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:16,467
They're--
no, they are the bus.

748
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:18,916
See, they're the vehicle
that gets us here.

749
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:22,743
They drop us off
and go on their way.

750
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,435
They continue
on their journey.

751
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:28,328
And the problem is that we keep
trying to get back on the bus,

752
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,051
instead of just
letting it go.

753
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:38,403
That's very insightful.

754
00:47:38,404 --> 00:47:40,101
Jesus, don't act
so surprised.

755
00:47:49,401 --> 00:47:50,601
You know...

756
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:54,990
You have these thoughts,
and you almost grab it.

757
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:57,066
And then...

758
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:59,174
Pfft.

759
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:07,109
Butch, how are you?

760
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,069
Phil is not accepting
visitors right now.

761
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,954
I just talked to him
on the phone, Butchie.

762
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,862
I just talked
to him in person.

763
00:48:13,863 --> 00:48:15,974
He ain't seeing nobody.

764
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:17,710
What's going on, Butch?

765
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:19,699
I just brokered
this thing.

766
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,752
He came here to make
a peace offering.

767
00:48:21,753 --> 00:48:24,444
A semi-trailer of drills--
makitas.

768
00:48:24,445 --> 00:48:26,588
We don't want
your fuckin' drills.

769
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:28,110
Fuck it.

770
00:48:28,268 --> 00:48:29,843
Let's go.

771
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:47,497
That's right, cocksucker!

772
00:48:47,512 --> 00:48:50,352
- Go back to new jersey!
- Phil, what are you doin'?

773
00:48:50,353 --> 00:48:53,246
Take that piece of shit
and get off my stoop.

774
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,189
But we just
talked about this.

775
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,361
Well, cooler heads
prevailed.

776
00:48:57,655 --> 00:49:00,415
- Uncle Philly!
- Uncle Philly my ass.

777
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,771
Will you just come down
so we can discuss this?

778
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:05,689
There's nothing left
to discuss, Carmine.

779
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:11,581
I don't understand.

780
00:49:11,968 --> 00:49:13,916
Why is he like this?

781
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,588
Hey, it's sleeping beauty.

782
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:23,927
I didn't
sleep a wink.

783
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,807
<I>I know, we've been
waiting for you.

784
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:27,122
<I>We have the chess set
all ready.

785
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:30,323
<I>- He cheats.
- Hello, honest Abe?

786
00:49:30,324 --> 00:49:33,192
<I>- Whatever.
- We just haven't played for so long.

787
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:35,551
I know, I just got
all this stress at work.

788
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:37,790
It's cool, it happens
to a lot of people.

789
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,667
- Really?
- Absolutely.

790
00:49:39,668 --> 00:49:41,602
More than half of adults
report experiencing

791
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,528
<I>Some kind of insomnia at
least a few nights a week.

792
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:46,393
<I>We just
want you back.

793
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:49,124
<I>- Thanks, guys.
- When you can't sleep...

794
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:05,136
No food in
the unit, sir.
