1
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,176
How are you feeling,
from your accident?

2
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:08,178
Fine.

3
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:10,180
Thank you.

4
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,189
Honestly?

5
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,691
If you told me five
years ago i would
be sitting here today...

6
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,202
anthony's attacks,
how do they make you feel?

7
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:37,707
Well, concerned
of course.

8
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:40,210
And helpless...

9
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,714
a little
frustrated maybe.

10
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,217
With your inability
to help him?

11
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:49,719
To tell the truth,
i was referring to your
inability to help him.

12
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,223
She has helped me.

13
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:54,724
What are you
talking about?

14
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,726
You've been coming here
for three years, tony.

15
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,728
You still pass out
on a regular basis.

16
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,733
I understand
your frustration.

17
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,735
Did anthony share with you
any of our insights

18
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,238
about his last
panic attack?

19
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:10,240
I told you,
remember?

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,741
The cappicola,

21
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,244
and my mother
when i was little kid.

22
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,745
Right, yes.

23
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,248
Do you think tha
t there's anything

24
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,750
in the prese
nt family dynamic

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,253
that could serve
as a trigger?

26
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,755
Something in you
r dialoguing perhaps?

27
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,257
'Scuse me?

28
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:28,758
I don't really
know you that well.

29
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:32,262
We're trying to ge
t to root causes.

30
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,264
Like maybe you
do things, you know,

31
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,765
that have some
effect on me?

32
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,767
Oh, really.

33
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,269
What?

34
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,271
People affect
each other in life.

35
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,273
Oh, i get it,
is this how it works?

36
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:45,275
You can't get any
answers out of him

37
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,277
so you start looking
for someone else
to point the finger at?

38
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,279
She's not
saying anything!

39
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,281
Why are you gettin'
so defensive?

40
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,782
You know what, tony?

41
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,285
Maybe you should explore
your own behavior.

42
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:58,288
Maybe you pass out because
you're guilty over something.

43
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,791
Maybe the fact that
you stick your dick
into anything with a pulse.

44
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,294
You ever thought of exploring
that as a root cause?

45
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,795
Very nice,
that's very nice.

46
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,797
Mm- hmm.

47
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,799
I told you months ago
i broke it off with
that russian person.

48
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,801
Right?

49
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:15,805
It's incredible.

50
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:17,807
It's like people who
smoke their whole lives

51
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:20,310
and then they sue
the cigarette companies
when they get cancer.

52
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,812
You know, you
agreed to come here.

53
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,315
Forget it,
this is fuckin' ridiculous.

54
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,318
Right,
just sit there

55
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:31,821
silence, anger.

56
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:34,824
Then you pass out
and you blame the rest
of the fucking world.

57
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,826
Yeah,
i love you, too.

58
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,834
You're both
very angry.

59
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,836
You must've been in the top
of your fucking class.

60
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,348
Ah, jesus christ.

61
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:02,852
What?

62
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,856
Great.

63
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,359
And i'm the one that doesn't
fuckin' communicate?

64
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,861
You want to know
what's wrong?

65
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,865
After 19 years of marriage,
i find it very sad

66
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,868
that we have to pay someone
to teach us how to interact.

67
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,870
You were
all in favor.

68
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,375
Slow down, stop driving
like a maniac.

69
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,377
Maybe we'l
l fucking die.

70
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,379
You think this is
easy for me?

71
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,880
It's like being
the new kid at school,

72
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,882
everybody jumps down
your throat every time
you open your mouth.

73
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,384
Who's picking
on you?

74
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,386
She took your side
with everything you said.

75
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,887
Will you, please?

76
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,390
I'm sure you'll have
a good laugh about it
the next time you're alone.

77
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,891
Yeah.

78
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:45,895
Oh, motherfuckin' fuck!

79
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:47,397
God!

80
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,399
Jesus christ.

81
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,415
Are you happy now,
what did i tell you?

82
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,917
It's a fuckin'
speed trap.

83
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,923
How you doing?

84
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,926
I got new shoes,
soles are a little heavy.

85
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:18,928
License, registratio
n, and insurance card please.

86
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,936
You're with
the township, right?

87
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:29,939
I think i had dinner
with your boss last week.

88
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,441
Tony soprano.

89
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,943
Would you please remove
the license from the wallet?

90
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,456
Do you know wh
y i stopped you, sir?

91
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,458
Yeah, i do.

92
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,459
I'll tell you what,

93
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,461
why don't you and your
wife have dinner on me

94
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,463
and you can
tell her about it.

95
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:55,465
Are you offering m
e a bribe, sir?

96
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,467
Of course not.

97
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,469
You gotta
relax a little.

98
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,971
Would you shut the
engine please, sir?

99
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,975
Just out of
curiosity,

100
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,978
what happens if
i don't feel like
shutting the engine?

101
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:11,481
Dispatch 5- 8- 2
, request back- up.

102
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,483
You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

103
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:14,984
Tony.

104
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,986
5- 8- 2, what's your 20?

105
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,495
Dispatch,
cancel back- up.

106
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:26,996
This the high point
of your career?

107
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:28,498
Wait in the car.

108
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,009
Our tax dollars
hard at fuckin' work.

109
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,511
It makes you sick.

110
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,513
You'd think they'd be out
arresting dope dealers.

111
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,517
You believ
e this shit?

112
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:50,019
This fuckin' smoke's
actually writing me up.

113
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,021
Stay in
the car, tony.

114
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,024
Affirmative action
cocksucker.

115
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:06,536
What'd freddie
want again?

116
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:08,538
I don't know,
peppers and eggs.

117
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,540
C'mon, help me
carry that shit.

118
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,541
Nah, i saw
a meter maid.

119
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,543
Bullshit.

120
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,546
Get me a manhattan special
if they got it, instead of
the coke, alright?

121
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,548
How the fuck
should i know?

122
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:20,550
Bullshit, every time
i hear your machine,

123
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,051
there's some new
motherfucker on it!

124
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,554
Fuck you, you shouldn't be
listening to my machine,
you loser!

125
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,055
Shut your mouth!

126
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:28,057
You know what?
Fuck you.

127
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:30,059
Don't call me
anymore!

128
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,063
Get back in the
goddamn car!

129
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,566
You think you can give
me a ride up to the point?

130
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,568
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

131
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,570
Uh, we're on a
job in teaneck.

132
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,071
C'mon,
it's two minutes.

133
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,073
Fuckin' twat,

134
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,575
Eat sh

135
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:48,578
C'mon, can't you just
do me this favor, please?

136
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,079
Look, why don't yo
u just go with him?

137
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,581
C'mon, can't you
just take me?

138
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,584
I can't, there's
a car service...

139
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,085
sal!

140
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,087
Fat piece of shit!

141
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,589
He didn't
do anything!

142
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,090
C'mon, you wanna
fuck her?

143
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,593
Sal, what are you doin'?
Stop, he didn't do anything!

144
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:06,095
Sal, what are
you doing?
Stop!

145
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,097

146
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,599
Get in the car!

147
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,101
Get in the
fucking car now!

148
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,112
Bryan, bryan!

149
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,120
Hey.

150
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,623
How are ya?

151
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,124
Thanks for
comin', tony.

152
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,126
How you doing?

153
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,630
Hey.

154
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,635
I brought hi
m some whitman's.

155
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,639
How's he doing?

156
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,142
I talked to him before,
i think he squeezed
my hand, but...

157
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,645
he's gonna be
a vegetable, tony.

158
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,647
A fucking retard.

159
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,649
No, he's gonna
be fine.

160
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,150
Look at
the bright side...

161
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,153
he wasn't that smart
to begin with.

162
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,656
C'mon, it's
a tense situation.

163
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:08,157
A little fucking
levity, huh?

164
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,161
What are
you doin' here?

165
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,664
I can't
visit my cousin?

166
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:19,168
I want this cocksucker t
o bleed from his ass, skipper.

167
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,671
You got it.

168
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,673
Just say the word,
my fuckin' pleasure.

169
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:25,675
Why don't you go
grab us some coffee?

170
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,677
C'mon, are you
kiddin'?

171
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,180
Better yet,

172
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,683
go to the ear, nos
e, and throat department,

173
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,185
get your
hearing checked.

174
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:46,195
Alright, obviously
you told the cops

175
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,697
you don't kn
ow who did this?

176
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,198
I'm upset,

177
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,201
but please, i know
how to keep my mouth shut.

178
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,704
Unless, of course, there's
a salami sandwich around.

179
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,706
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

180
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,207
We're trying to have
a meeting here.

181
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,210
Two minutes he's in charge,
he's fucking lee iacocca.

182
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,715
C'mon.

183
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,717
Not here,
c'mon.

184
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:15,224
There's no beef
between your broth
er and mustang sally?

185
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,727
Didn't owe him any money,
nothing like that?

186
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,729
No, nothing.

187
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,230
This kid's
a whack job.

188
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,732
Meadowlands,
last year,
remember?

189
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,235
Threw a hot dog vendor
off the second mezzanine?

190
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,237
Too many fuckin' onions
or some shit.

191
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,244
Geeg', you'll get him
under control?

192
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:38,247
With extreme
fuckin' prejudice.

193
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,250
We gotta go.

194
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,752
Alright.

195
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,253
Ton'.

196
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,755
Hey...

197
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,757
he's gonna be fine.

198
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:50,259
Thanks, tony.

199
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,788
"And if i go and
prepare a place for you,

200
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:22,792
"i will come back again
and take you to myself,

201
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:27,296
so that where i am,
you may also be."

202
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:31,300
This is
the word of the lord.

203
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,302
Thanks be to god.

204
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:39,809
There are many rooms
in my father's house...

205
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,812
most certainly
one for febby.

206
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,815
Febby lived
a full life,

207
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,317
a life of service
to others.

208
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,820
His 78 years saw him

209
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,823
serve his family
as a devoted father,

210
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:58,327
his country as
a supply sergeant
in the pacific theater,

211
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:03,833
and most importantly, our
lord, as a devout catholic.

212
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,336
When i last visited febby
in the hospital,

213
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:11,340
he had just finished
his last round
of chemotherapy.

214
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,843
Though frail
and extremely thin,

215
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,345
his fighting spirit
was still intact.

216
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:18,848
His body was
wracked with pain...

217
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,354
you know
greg d'aiuto?

218
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:27,356
His grandfather
died of cancer.

219
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,358
They froze his head
till they find a cure.

220
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,361
Mary...
carmela.

221
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,365
Hugh, hugh!

222
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,369
Oh.

223
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,872
For the poor box.

224
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,373
Thank you.

225
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,875
I'm goin' to
check out the hearse.

226
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,877
Don't
get lost, a. J.

227
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:58,888
Well, i'll
see ya at the...

228
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,392

father.

229
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,898
C'mere, you,
let me look at you.

230
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:11,400
Hey, c'mere!

231
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,904
Why didn't you tell me
your old man was coming?

232
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,405
He wanted
to surprise you.

233
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,407
You mean
old prick.

234
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:20,409
I thought you were in miami
playing shuffleboard.

235
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,411
It's too hot there.

236
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:25,414
I come up to see
the grandkids, you know?

237
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:26,916
And my
doctor's here.

238
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,418
Yeah, bobby said
you weren't feeling too good.

239
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,920
How you doin'?

240
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,922
I'm gonna brin
g the car around.

241
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,924
I'm sorry abou
t your uncle.

242
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:38,427
Actually febby
was carmela's uncle.

243
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:39,929
Buon anima,

244
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:41,430
he should
rest in peace.

245
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,933
94 pounds when he died
, carm's mom was saying.

246
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,435
He was always thin,
what do you expect?

247
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,940
As long as
i got you here...

248
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,443
your godson,
mustang sally intile,

249
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,946
he did a lee trevino
off a guy's head.

250
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,949
That little prick is
my godson in name only.

251
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,451
I only stood up as a
favor to his father.

252
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,954
I'm just saying
'cause...

253
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:07,957
this isn't
the first time.

254
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,960
You do whatever
you gotta do.

255
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,463
Just so you
heard it from me.

256
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:15,965
Thank you.

257
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,968
And i want you to know
that i appreciate
you looking out for bobby.

258
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:21,470
Bobby, what,
are you kidding me?

259
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,472
He's been a huge help
with my uncle.

260
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,474
That one don't
need any help.

261
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:28,978
Out of jail
on a fuckin' medical?

262
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,481
He makes me laugh,
your uncle.

263
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:37,486
That's right,
we're talking about you,
you cagey fuck.

264
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,487
Huh?

265
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,489
You got'e
m all fooled.

266
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:41,490
Yeah,
that's right.

267
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,994
There's bobby.

268
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:46,996
I'm sorry
for your loss.

269
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,998
See you later.

270
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,005
Hey, hey, hey.

271
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,007
What the fuck,
he's really sick?

272
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,508
That cough.

273
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:00,509
What do you want?

274
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,012
He smoked those camels
since he's in short pants.

275
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,513
Lung cancer?

276
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,015
Oh, fuck.

277
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,017
Another toothpick.

278
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:11,020
What the hell kind of way
is that to talk about
a sick person?

279
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,526
Goodnight now.

280
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,528
Goodnight.

281
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,030
Thank you.

282
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,539
42 years...
my god.

283
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,044
When it's righ
t it's right.

284
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:38,547
We said we'd save the barolo
for a big night?

285
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:42,551
Check out
these numbers.

286
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:44,053
Heh?

287
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,055
Oh, my god,
i knew we were busy--

288
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,556
not bad, eh?

289
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:56,065
I think i'm gonna pass
on the wine tonight.

290
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,570
A night like this you're
gonna make me drink alone?

291
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,573
What is it,
you okay?

292
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,078
Actually...

293
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,580
you know i love it here
and you're a great boss,

294
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,584
but christopher doesn't
want me working anymore.

295
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:18,587
Please
don't be mad.

296
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,589
No, i'm not
mad at all.

297
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,591
I'm happy for you.

298
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,593
You know, with
his change in situation.

299
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,095
You know
how he is.

300
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:28,597
You think i wanna
be stuck in this prison?

301
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:31,100
I really wanted
to give you notice,

302
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,603
i was supposed to
tell you two weeks ago.

303
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:38,107
But is it alright
if tonight's my last night?

304
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:42,111
Yeah, i guess i'll get
charmaine to cover.

305
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,613
Thank you!

306
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,615
I was so nervous
about telling you.

307
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,620
Christopher's picking me up,
so i'm gonna go fix my makeup.

308
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,122
Okay.

309
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:55,124
Of course.

310
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,644
You're not
gonna jump me?

311
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,646
What?

312
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:20,149
I'm open here,
i'll have to king you.

313
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,153
Fuck it,
i don't wanna play.

314
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:27,656
I don't really
wanna either.

315
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,162
What's with you
? all day, gloomy gus.

316
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,664
Sorry, it's just...

317
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,167
it's my father.

318
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,670
He's a tough man, he'l
l beat the fuckin' thing.

319
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,672
It's not the cancer,
it's tony.

320
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,674
Tony?
Well, what about him?

321
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:48,177
Stop speaking
in anagrams.

322
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:51,180
He okayed my dad to do
the hit on mustang sally.

323
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,182
The prick put that
spatafore kid in a coma.

324
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:54,683
Fuck sally.

325
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,186
I'm worried about my father,
he can't do this.

326
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,188
He's been retired
for seven years.

327
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,689
What's this we're in,
the navy?

328
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,691
It's not that.

329
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:05,694
This was
a proud man, junior.

330
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:08,697
He's over
the other night,

331
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:12,701
i had to help him off
the toilet he's so weak.

332
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,205
Will you shut the fuck up
with the toilets?

333
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,207
All this
goddamn morbidity?

334
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,715
I'm sorry,
you're right.

335
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,218
Fuck.

336
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,220
At this point
in a man's life

337
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,722
to have him
do something like this.

338
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:36,725
You know i never ask
you for anything.

339
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,228
You could tell tony
i'll do it myself if he wants.

340
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,231
Fuck what he wants,
i'm still the boss
of this family.

341
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,233
You're right.

342
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,735
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,737
Stop your crying
, i'll tell him.

344
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,240
Making me fucking
depressed now.

345
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:54,743
Old man bacala's
okay with this,

346
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,745
what do you
give a shit anyway?

347
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,748
What is it with you
and these power trips?

348
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,250
What the fuck are you
talking about?

349
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,253
Pardon me...

350
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,754

351
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,256
Yeah.

352
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,262
Your girl got
any coffee out there?

353
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,764
I think we can
rustle some up.

354
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,768
Tax code,
another client,
irs troubles.

355
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,770
Sorry, mel.

356
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,773
To find a place they're
not allowed to bug...

357
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:28,277
dr. Schreck's office
has a full waiting room.

358
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,779
I sit
too much anyway.

359
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,787
It has to be
the old man, huh?

360
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,289
There's no other way?

361
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,791
There's a million other ways,
but this one'll work.

362
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,793
It was gigi's idea,

363
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:46,295
i'm not cutting
his fuckin' balls off.

364
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,300
Mustang sally's m. I. A.

365
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,303
Two days ago he reaches out
to old man bacala for help.

366
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,305
Old man bacala's
his godfather.

367
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:59,808
He can get close
without arousin' suspicion.

368
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,311
It still
doesn't sit right.

369
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,812
He's done it
a thousand times.

370
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:05,314
He's a sick old man!

371
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,316
Good, it'll give him
something to live for.

372
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,326
So i told him,

373
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:18,827
i'd take those
duncan shiek records

374
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,829
and shove'e
m up his ass.

375
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:25,834
Wait a minute,
who let this one in here?

376
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,336
Oh, wolfgang fuckface.

377
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,840
Hey, artie.

378
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:39,848
The man wh
o stole her away.

379
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,353
Adriana,
she gave her notice.

380
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,367
Help yourself.

381
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,373
You better be good
to that girl...

382
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,875
you cocksucker.

383
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,378
No wonder
the food sucks.

384
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,880
You're supposed to cook
with the wine, artie.

385
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,382
Three years...

386
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:16,385
best hoste
ss i ever had,

387
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,388
this piece of shit
steals her away.

388
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,889
Artie, c'mon.

389
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:23,392
Ah, c'mon, he know
s i'm breaking his balls.

390
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,893
Alright.

391
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,900
Seriously though,
i'm you?

392
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,403
I'd hire
a food taster.

393
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,905
You don't want to fuck
with a chef, my friend.

394
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:38,407
What?

395
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,409
You think you're
the only one who knows
how to swing a meat cleaver?

396
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:41,910
Fuck you.

397
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,412
Artie...

398
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,914
i'm kidding, huh?

399
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,419
Wanna try cooking
with one fuckin' eye?

400
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,920
That's enough!

401
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,922
Go wait outside!

402
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:56,925
Now!

403
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,940
What the fuck?

404
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,443
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

405
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,445
She's his
fuckin' fiancee!

406
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,946
I loved her.

407
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:20,449
I fuckin'
love her now.

408
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,459
Artie...

409
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,461
do me a favor.

410
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,464
Don't ever fuckin'
say that again
to anybody ever.

411
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,966
What am i,
a joke?

412
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:42,471
Yeah, a stupid
fuckin' bald one.

413
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,973
Not to mention
married.

414
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,477
Can i tell
you something?

415
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,980
She's a cunt.

416
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:54,483
My fuckin' wife.

417
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:58,487
A girl like ad
e, that's a woman.

418
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,989
If i still
had my hair...

419
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:01,990
artie,
she's a young girl.

420
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,992
You could have hair like
fuckin' casey kasem,

421
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:05,994
it won't
make a difference.

422
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:07,496
Yeah.

423
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,507
Look,
go in the back,

424
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,509
get some coffee,

425
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,512
go home,
go the fuck to sleep.

426
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:25,514
I should
go apologize.

427
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:28,517
Not right now.

428
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,018
Let me
talk to chris.

429
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,020
You go home.

430
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,025
Call me tomorrow.

431
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:41,029
I got a business opportunity
over in newark.

432
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,537
Jesus fuckin' christ.

433
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:05,053
Mr. Spears for you
on three.

434
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,055
Seth,
i gotta take this.

435
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:09,057
Alright.

436
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,561
Hey.

437
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,563
So, what's the story with
this fuckin' speedin' ticket?

438
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:16,064
What?
I'm on it,
i told you.

439
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:17,566
I just got some fuckin'
letter in the mail.

440
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,067
Throw it out,
forget it.

441
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:21,069
What the fuck, i gotta call
my guy down at the dmv

442
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,571
to get
this squashed?

443
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:24,573
I told you, it's
a deplorable situation

444
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,075
and i'll take
care of it.

445
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:30,078
Hey, good news about the
riverfront esplanade thing.

446
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:31,079
We still on for thursday?

447
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,082
Just straighten
the fuckin' ticket out, okay?

448
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,090
Where's your father?

449
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,092
He called,
he stopped by the bakery,

450
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:46,595
wanted to pick up
a shortcake.

451
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,097
He never comes
empty handed.

452
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:56,104
Talk to tony?

453
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:58,607
No, i decided
against it.

454
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:01,109
I didn't
even call him.

455
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:03,612
You choose this life,
it comes with
responsibilities, bobby.

456
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:06,114
Nobody knows that
better than your old man.

457
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:07,616
I was asking
for me.

458
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,618
Teddy roosevelt gave
an entire speech once

459
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:11,620
with a bullet
lodged in his chest.

460
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,122
Some things are
a matter of duty.

461
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,645
Sonofabitch.

462
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:44,653
Are you alright?

463
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,154
I'm fine...

464
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,155
fucking steps.

465
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:48,657
Here,
sit down.

466
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,659
Jesus.

467
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:59,167
Fuck,
is that blood?

468
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,670
Jesus christ,
call a fuckin' doctor.

469
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,172
No, no, no.

470
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,174
It's the nodules
in his lungs,

471
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:07,676
it happens whe
n he's out of breath.

472
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,182
Blessed saint dennis,
is this what it comes to?

473
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:17,185
Get him some water
for chrissake!

474
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:19,688
These doctors,
what are they doing for him?

475
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:22,190
I don't know,
whatever theydo.

476
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:23,692
Water.

477
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:25,193
I want you
to call john kennedy,

478
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:26,695
he's the head of oncology
at saint barnabas.

479
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:29,698
Junior, i'm happy
with my guy.

480
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,199
What the fuck
is he doing?

481
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,701
Are you
taking the chemo?

482
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,703
Is he giving you
oxygen therapy?

483
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:39,207
The cure's worse than
the fuckin' illness.

484
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,712
Cocksucker!
This is an outrage!

485
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:46,715
He can't have you clip
someone in this condition!

486
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:50,719
Junior,
i wanna do it.

487
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,721
Eight years
sitting on my ass.

488
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:55,724
It'll feel good
feelin' useful for a change.

489
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,726
This sally's
a tough kid, bobby,

490
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,227
what if things
don't go your way?

491
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,730
If they don't,
they don't.

492
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,733
What the fuck?
I'm dead anyway.

493
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,745
Paul newman starte
d with the salad dressing,

494
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,246
now they're over
a hundred million a year.

495
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,749
And you know
how people love my sauce.

496
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,251
Arthur,
you run a restaurant.

497
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:27,255
What do you know
about mass production?

498
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:30,258
I have an associate's
in business, for god's sake.

499
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,762
How are we gonna gro
w if we don't take risks?

500
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:37,265
Going into business
with a gangster isn't a risk.

501
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,268
That is
a guaranteed disaster.

502
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:41,269
It's legitimate.

503
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:44,773
It's part of
the revitalization.

504
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:46,775
The city of newark
is giving tax breaks

505
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,777
for re- openi
ng old factories.

506
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,278
I'm trying to
work here, artie.

507
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:51,780
Fuck the vegetables.

508
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,782
We have a chance to
have our own company,

509
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,283
our own line
of products.

510
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,285
Then why is it
called "satriale's"?

511
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,287
The pork store
has a customer base,

512
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,289
name recognition.

513
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,291
Vesuvio doesn't?

514
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:07,295
Your grandfather
opened up in the 30s,

515
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:08,797
arthur.

516
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:10,298
Tony talked to thi
s marketing- research guy.

517
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,801
Product branding
s beginning with
the letter "v"

518
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,803
make people think
of vagina.

519
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:16,304
It's a turn- off.

520
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:19,307
What did you
just say?

521
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,809
Vaseline,
etcetera.

522
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,811
The whol
e thing is...

523
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,813
can't you see
the opportunities here?

524
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,815
Yes, to be a front
for a mobster.

525
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,817
Jesus christ,
already!

526
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,819
Oh, when are you
gonna learn, huh?

527
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:33,321
Be happy in
thine own self.

528
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:41,329
The dvd's
incredible.

529
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,331
Flat screen,
right?

530
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:44,833
Fuckin' surround sound.

531
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,335
"In this world
or the next,

532
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,338
i shall have
my revenge."

533
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,840
Here we go.

534
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,341
No, i'm
telling you,

535
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,343
it's like the chariots
are goin' through

536
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:56,845
the fuckin' house.

537
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:58,346
Skateboards,

538
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,849
Sweetheart,

539
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:02,350

He didn't hear i

542
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:12,360
Hey, i'm not tryin'
to butt in.

543
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,362
Junior reached out,
asked me to talk to you.

544
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,865
My old man worked
for him a lotta years,

545
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,366
he's just looking
out for him.

546
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:20,368
It does seem
a little extreme,

547
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,871
but, hey,
my man, gigootz,

548
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,372
he knows what
he's doing, huh?

549
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:26,374
Glad i have your
fuckin' approval.

550
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:28,376
Whatever
you say, cappy.

551
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:31,880
Alright,
here it is,
okay?

552
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,883
For you, junior and
anybody the fuck else.

00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:37,886
Gigi's captain
of that crew.

554
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:40,388
He gave the order,
i okayed it.

555
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,390
End of fuckin' story.

556
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:45,894
Tony, please,
no offense.

557
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:47,896
Obviously,
it's your call.

558
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,397
Yeah, obviously.

559
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,911
What?

560
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,412
Nothin'.

561
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,915
It's just,
you know,

562
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:09,417
sending
an old man,

563
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:12,420
what's he gonna do?
Gum the guy to death?

564
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,922
Anybody ask
for your input?

565
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,424
No, no, i'm
just saying...

566
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,927

let me doit.

567

I'll take this guy
apart at the joints,

568
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,433
with him conscious.

569
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,468

00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,485
May i help you
with something?

573
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,988
Yeah, i need

574
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:21,489
Unless you wanna come

00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:22,991
check on my birdbath.

576
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,993
Make sure it's
up to code first.

577
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,995
I'll check
the computer.

578
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:40,508
Hey, get your
ticket book.

579
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,011
Doesn't that constitute
indecent exposure?

580
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:46,014
Actually, i no lon
ger need my ticket book.

581
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,016
Your friend,

So, you're no longer
the scourge of cedar grove?

584
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:56,024
Nor am i eligible
for overtime.

585
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,526
Leon, take your
break at two.

586
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:07,535
Well, not that it matters,
just so you know,

587
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,537
i didn't tell him to do
any of that shit.

588
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,044
That was v
ery kind of you.

589
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:18,046
We're out of stock.

590
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,555

591
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:29,057

595
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:37,565

When i'm done.

599
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:47,075
Hello.

601
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,078
Oh, yeah, yeah,

603
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,583

the traffic cop?

604
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,085
It's done,

dy taken care of.

605
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,587
I know, i know,
it's just...

606
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:02,090
i don't know.

607
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,092
You got him busted
off the street?

608
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:06,094
Fuck him, isn't that
what you wanted?

609
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:10,098
Yeah, but, it's
kinda harsh, no?

610
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,600
Tony, i spoke to
his unit commander.

611
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,603
Nobody likes the guy,
he's a goddamn
rabble- rouser.

612
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:18,106
Yeah, maybe, but...

613
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,607
i don't know.

614
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:21,109
Believe me,
it goes beyond you.

615
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,611
The guy's depresse
d, he's all wound up.

616
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,612
They think
he might have

617
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:26,114
some serious
mental problems.

618
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,140
Cocksucker.

619
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,149
You're
a liar!

620
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:10,658
The old man?

621
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,160
I don't know,
what's he look like?

622
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,162
Like an ol
d fuckin' man.

623
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,164
He's all
coughing
and shit.

624
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:25,673
Uncle bobby,

625

More fuckin' stairs!

627
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:41,189
You should do
yourself a favor,

628
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,690
quit while
you're young.

629
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,692
Gotta die for from
somethin', papi.

630
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:46,694
Hey, fuck- asshole,

Over here.

634
00:35:57,205 --> 00:35:58,706
Who's this
little spic?

635
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,709
A guy i know,
he fucks the lady
whose house is it.

636
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,211
I'm sorry.

637
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:09,717
You know, you put that
kid in a fuckin' coma, sal.

638
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:13,221
And for what, talkin'
to some puttan?

639
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:16,724
I know i was wrong,

00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,230
he wasn't
some citizen,

641
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,233

642
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,235
I'm sorry,
uncle bobby,

Thank you.

646
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,747
Thank you
so fuckin' much.

647
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:47,255
It's good you called,
that's all i'm gonna say.

648
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:50,258
Tell tony it'll never
happen again, i swear.

649
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:51,259
Or if it does,

650
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:53,261
i'll at least yell "fore"
next time, huh?

651
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:56,764
I'm sorry.

652
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,266
I shouldn't
make jokes.

653
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:02,770
Get me a glass
of water.

654
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,771
Yeah.

655
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:10,778
You want ice?

656
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:12,780
No.

657
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,782
Let the wa
ter run, though,

658
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:16,784
make s
ure it's cold.

659
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:17,785
Are you alright?

660
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,288
I'm fine.

661
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:32,300
So, this guy's
still in a coma?

662
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:35,303
What do you think,

663
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,805
should i visit him o
r is that too fucked up?

664
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:40,808
Yeah, i think
you should go see him.

665
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:44,812
Eh, i don't know.

666
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:46,314
Maybe i should
send him something.

667
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:48,316
Some flowers
or some shit.

668
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:50,318
Oh, what
the fuck?

669
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:38,866
Eh, you fuckin'
grease ball, you!

670
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:41,369
C'mon, c'mon, an
y more smart remarks?

671
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,372
No, mr. Bacala,
please, please!

672
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:45,873
No more!

673
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,385
Mmmm....

674
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,962
all the fuckin' luck.

675
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:18,466
I told him
he shouldn't do it.

676
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:19,967
Had to go all
the way

677
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,970
to staten island
to identify him.

678
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,474
He's a cold- hearted prick,
that nephew of mine.

679
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:28,976
Cocksuckers didn't
even clean him up.

680
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:32,480
He still had bits
of glass in his hair

681
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,982
from the windshield.

682
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,984
What was
he, 71?

683
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:40,488
I don't know, 68.

684
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:42,990
So, what did
they say?

685
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,992
What was the cause
of death?

686
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,994
Who, what do
you mean?

687
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:48,996
The morgue,
the cause of death.

688
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,499
Was it the cancer
or the accident?

689
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,501
How advanced was
the metastasis anyway?

690
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,503
All due respect,
junior...

691
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,005
what do you care
about the details?

692
00:40:58,005 --> 00:41:00,007
All this
technical shit.

693
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:03,511
You're right.

694
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:07,014
The man's passed on,

695
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,517
we should let him
rest in peace.

696
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,022
He was a good man,
your father.

697
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,525
A good friend.

698
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,027
Motherfucker!

699
00:41:20,027 --> 00:41:23,531
Godammit,
dirty bastards!

700
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,037
Jesus fucking christ!

701
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,062
A customer
says goodnight,

702
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,063
you barely
look up?

703
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:59,066
I said it low.

704
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,573
"Miss personality"
over here.

705
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,575
What's with
the glasses?

706
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,078
I left
my contacts home.

707
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,079
You know,

708
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,581
i don't know w
hat your problem is,

709
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,083
but you've had a hair
across your ass all week.

710
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:23,090
Lower your voice.

711
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,592
What, are you
still pissed

712
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:27,094
'cause i told you
you couldn't go into
business with tony?

713
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:30,097
You don't tell me
fucking anything,
charmaine.

714
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,098
For your information,

715
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,600
i am going int
o business with tony.

716
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,103
If you do
this, artie,

717
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,606
if you choose
tony over me...

718
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,608
what, what are you
gonna do, divorce me?

719
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,617
Is that what
you want, artie?

720
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:50,618
What?
What'd i say?

721
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:54,622
This marriage
is over, arthur.

722
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:57,124
I'm serious, artie.

723
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:58,626
Good, it's about
fucking time.

724
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:00,628
And you're not getting
the kids either.

725
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:05,633
Son of a bitch!

726
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:14,642
Hey...

727
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,644
look who's here.

728
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,646
He volunteered
to mow your lawn.

729
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:20,147
No, i didn't.

730
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:22,149
Hi, anthony.

731
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,151
That time
of year again.

732
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,653
I brought you the last
of my sweet corn.

733
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,661
Well, what's
the matter,
you alright?

734
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:38,165
Anthony, be
a good boy, huh?

735
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:39,667
Wait outside,

736
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:41,669
i need to talk
to your father.

737
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:50,177
I'm telling you
right now,

738
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:51,679
if this is about
old man bacala,

739
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,681
i don't wann
a fuckin' hear it.

740
00:43:56,183 --> 00:43:58,185
I have cancer.

741
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:07,194
You have what?

742
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:10,197
Cancer...
the big casino.

743
00:44:10,197 --> 00:44:13,701
Jesus christ, when
'd you find this out?

744
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:17,705
Blood in my stool.

745
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:20,207
I had my first test
the day before

746
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,209
your mother's funeral.

747
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:24,211
That's why you been
actin' so fuckin' weird?

748
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:29,216
Is it, what is it,
where is it?

749
00:44:29,216 --> 00:44:31,218
Is it in your
colon, or...

750
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:33,220
my stomach.

751
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:40,728
Jesus christ,
uncle jun'.

752
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:49,737
Did they say
how bad?

753
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:52,239
They won't know
'til they open me up.

754
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,242
I go in
in two weeks.

755
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:57,745
This has to stay
between us, anthony.

756
00:44:57,745 --> 00:44:59,747
Yeah, of course.

757
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:07,254
Look, we'll
get you help,

758
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:10,257
we'll get you
the best there is.

759
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:11,759
First jackie
with cancer,

760
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:13,260
then febby.

761
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,763
Old man bacala had
it, but, now...

762
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:18,265
you'll get me help?

763
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:20,267
These things
come in threes.

764
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:31,779
Is that why you didn't
want the old man

765
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,281
to make the hit?

766
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:36,784
What'd you think,
if he died of cancer,

767
00:45:36,784 --> 00:45:38,786
he was gonna
take your place?

768
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:40,788
I asked you not
to make him do it.

769
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:44,291
Ah, jesus christ,
un- fuckin'- believable.

770
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:46,293
I'm serious, anthony,
what i said.

771
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:49,296
Promise me that you'll
dummy up about this.

772
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:52,800
Yeah, alright.

773
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,802
You're sick, people
look at you different,

774
00:45:54,802 --> 00:45:56,303
they treat you like
a fuckin' non- entity.

775
00:45:56,804 --> 00:45:58,305
I'm not kidding.

776
00:45:58,305 --> 00:46:00,307
You can't talk about
this with anybody.

777
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:03,310
Yeah, yeah,
of course.

778
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,312
Of course.

779
00:46:09,817 --> 00:46:11,318
Hello?

780
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:12,820
Uncle jun's
got cancer.

781
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:23,330
A lotta death...

782
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,332
...ma...

783
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:30,838
seems like yesterday
, pop and emphysema.

784
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:33,841
Uncle jun',
another toothpick.

785
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:36,844
Hey, jan,
a little respect.

786
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:40,347
I'm sorry, it's just
what ma used to say.

787
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:43,350
Yeah, that's right.

788
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,854
She said it about
her own brother,
remember?

789
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:48,856
Another toothpick...

790
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,859
jesus...

791
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:54,862
what was he,
like 36 years old,
uncle mickey.

792
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:57,364
Liver cancer.

793
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:02,369
Jesus, these
old timers,

794
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:07,875
i guess the more
hard- ass their attitude,

795
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:11,378
the more they coul
d suppress their feelings.

796
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:13,881
I think it's the
illusion of control.

797
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:14,882
Control?

798
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:18,886
You say the most horrible
shit you can think of

799
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:20,888
in the face
of tragedy,

800
00:47:20,888 --> 00:47:24,892
it's like saying
to god,"see?

801
00:47:24,892 --> 00:47:26,894
"You don't fool
me, asshole.

802
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:28,395
I know what
you're planning."

803
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,398
Yeah, like they're try
ing to ward off some evil...

804
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:33,400
or some shit.

805
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:36,403
Remember how ma,
she hated compliments?

806
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:38,405
Giving'em
or taking'em.

807
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:42,910
'Cause then, maybe,
at any minute, boom.

808
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,418
I've really been
coming to know christ.

809
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:58,425
Ma, febby, uncle jun',

810
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:00,928
always comes
in threes, huh?

811
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:03,430
And, then, there's
the holy trinity.

812
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,433
You think that's
a coincidence?

813
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:22,950
What happened to
sal bonpensiero, ton'?

814
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:28,956
Witness protection.

815
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:32,960
Would you like
to pray with me?

816
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:15,502
Two weeks ago?

817
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:17,004
Why didn't you
say anything?

818
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:18,005
Did you report it
at least?

819
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:19,506
To who,
the rent- a- cops?

820
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:21,008
Campus
security's
a joke.

821
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:22,509
Well, don't you think
they should know

822
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:23,510
they have a thief
preying on the school?

823
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,012
Who?

824
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:26,513
What are you
talking about?

825
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:28,015
Nothing.

826
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:31,018
Her bike was stolen from
outside the library
two weeks ago.

827
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:33,020
The ten speed?

828
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,521
Did yo
u lock it up?

829
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:36,523
They used
bolt cutters.

830
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:38,025
Some black guy
from the neighborhood.

831
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,027
One of the other
kids saw him.

832
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:46,033
What?

833
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:48,035
Did i say
anything?

834
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:59,046
A black guy.

835
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:00,047
Imagine that.

836
00:50:00,547 --> 00:50:01,548
Tony...

837
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:05,552
it's just, you kno
w, i can't believe it.

838
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,054
I am not listening
to this shit.

839
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:08,555
Why don't yo
u admit it?

840
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:10,057
You're thinkin' exactl
y what i'm thinkin'.

841
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,058
Tony, what
did i say?

842
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:12,559
What, is it my fault

843
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,561
you're twice as likely
to be robbed by a black?

844
00:50:15,062 --> 00:50:16,563
That is so
fucking racist!

845
00:50:16,563 --> 00:50:17,564
It happens
to be a fact.

846
00:50:17,564 --> 00:50:19,066
From who, david duke?

847
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:21,068
Why are they talking about
this in the basement?

848
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:23,070
Try the fbi,
i saw it on tv.

849
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,072
Oh, so now you're
quoting the fbi.

850
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:26,573
I don't think they're
in the basement.

851
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:28,075
But, the lamp.

852
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:30,077
That's right, it's
on battery back up.

853
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:31,078
Why?

854
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,579
For your
information,

855
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,081
crime is an
economic issue,
not a racial one.

856
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:36,083
White or
african- american,

857
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,584
you're mor
e likely to steal

858
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:39,086
if you're in a
lower income bracket,

859
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:40,587
which most
african- americans are.

860
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:42,089
Good, then you'll
feel better

861
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:43,590
when the next one
takes your car stereo.

862
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:45,092
You are such
a hypocrite!

863
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,094
This is what
i been trying to
tell you all along.

864
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:48,595
You stay with
your own people!

865
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:51,598
Wait a second,

866
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:52,599
where are you
going where that lamp?

867
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:53,600
I'm taking it.

868
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:55,602
The halogen nana gave me
gives me a headache.

869
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:57,604
Hey, don't chang
e the goddamn subject,

870
00:50:57,604 --> 00:50:58,605
both of you!

871
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:00,107
I'm out of here.

872
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:02,109
Be sure to call me
when you need some money!

873
00:51:07,614 --> 00:51:09,116
Good, now you
got something

874
00:51:09,116 --> 00:51:11,118
you can rat me o
ut about in therapy!

875
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:19,626
'Madonn,
this place!

876
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:21,628
You only
retire once.

877
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:33,140
Is that
an earring?

878
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,141
Huh?

879
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,143
Your ear, i never
noticed before.

880
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:37,644

So, i got a call from
eddie voehl, at the pba.

Your friend,
the cop?

932
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:37,324
He's bitching about
losing his overtime.

933
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:39,326
He's got some
black officers' squad

934
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:40,827

his case.

935
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,330
Oh, yeah?

936
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:48,335

938
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:55,842
You know what?

00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:17,864
The tony soprano wiretap

942
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:22,369
What do you mean?

943
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:43,390

What are you doing
, you're not ready?

946
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:56,403
I'm not going.

947
00:55:56,403 --> 00:55:59,906
They gave yo
u permission.

948
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:03,410
I can't,
i'm not up to it.

949
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,413
It's my father's
funeral, junior.

950
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:07,914
You hear me,
i don't feel up to snuff.

951
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:10,917
You look okay
to me.

952
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:14,421
Junior!

953
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:16,923
What's the matter,

954
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:18,925
didn't you get
the arrangement i sent?

955
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:21,428
My whole family's
in the car.

956
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:22,929
I gotta tell you,
junior,

957
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:24,931
i take this as
a personal insult.

958
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:26,433
What do you think,
i don't give a shit?

959
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:27,934
What am i supposed
to think?

960
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:31,438
You selfish fuck,
i can't go because i'm sick.

961
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:37,444
I have cancer.

962
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:38,945
Cancer?

963
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:43,950
Oh, my god.

964
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,453
Real wisenheimer,
now how do you feel?

965
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,960
Two weeks, i go in
for the surgery,

966
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,463
and they'll probably start me
on the chemo after that.

967
00:56:57,964 --> 00:57:00,467
Junior,
i'm sorry.

968
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:03,470
I don't know
what to say.

969
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,471
Yeah, yeah,
alright.

970
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:06,973
I'll say a prayer
for your old man.

971
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:14,481
My fathe
r, now you...

972
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:17,484

uck is happening?

973
00:57:21,988 --> 00:57:23,990
You'll miss the boat.

974
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:27,994
Lady, i missed the
boat a long time age.

975
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:37,504
Including
tax and delivery,

976
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:40,507
it comes to $897. 23.

977
00:57:41,007 --> 00:57:44,511

to my house in one piece.

978
00:57:48,014 --> 00:57:49,516
Come on...
