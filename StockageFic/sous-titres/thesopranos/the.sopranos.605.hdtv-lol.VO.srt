THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I COULD BENCH
OVER 300 LBS.

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,600

SORRY.

62
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,900
MY MOM SAYS
I SHOULD COUNT 10,
BUT I NEVER REMEMBER.

SO LET ME ASK YOU
RIGHT OFF,

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
OF A MERCY FUCK?

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
JUST KIDDING.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- YOU WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

69
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,400
A GUT SHOT IS
EVERYTHING THEY EVER
TOLD YOU IT WAS.

70
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,000
AND EMOTIONALLY?

71
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,800
I'M HAPPY TO BE ALIVE.

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO YOUR UNCLE
SINCE IT HAPPENED?

73
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,400
NO. AND WON'T.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,100
FINALLY GET TO SLEEP
IN MY OWN BED TONIGHT.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,700
HAD A HOSPITAL BED
IN THE HOUSE

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
- LAST MONTH
 AND A HALF OR SO.
- IS SLEEPING DIFFICULT?

77
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
- TYLENOL HELPS.
- WHAT ABOUT DREAMS,

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
NIGHT TERRORS,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

79
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,900
GLOOM IS YOUR BUSINESS,
AND BUSINESS IS GOOD.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,900
YOU WERE SHOT, ANTHONY,
BY A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY.

81
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,300
I KNOW.

82
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
AND UNLESS I KNOW
ABSOLUTELY <i>NOTHING</i>

83
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,600
ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING,

84
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,300
I THINK YOU AND I'LL
HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

85
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,100
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE TERM

86
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
"POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS"?

87
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,000
I GET IT, OKAY?

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,100
MY UNCLE
TRIED TO KILL ME,
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

89
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,900
THREE STRIKES
AND I'M OUT, RIGHT?

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,500
<i>WHO KNOWS? MAYBE I</i>
 <i>AM SUPPRESSING THINGS.</i>

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,500
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
I FEEL LIKE EACH DAY
IS A GIFT.

92
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
I TOLD MY SISTER.

93
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,700
AND THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA STAY.

94
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,100
FAIR ENOUGH.

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
IS THERE SOMETHING
ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO
TALK ABOUT THEN?

96
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,700
LET'S PICK UP WHERE
WE LEFT OFF BEFORE
THIS ALL HAPPENED.

97
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,100
A.J.

98
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

99
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
WORSE WITH THAT KID.

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
FLUNKED OUT OF COLLEGE.
HE WAITED TILL I WAS
IN A COMA.

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,000
DIDN'T YOU LEAVE
SETON HALL AFTER
A SEMESTER AND A HALF?

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
ALL RIGHT, FINE,

103
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,100
BUT WHY CAN'T HE COPY
SOME OF THE GOOD
THINGS ABOUT ME?

104
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,800
- DOES HE HAVE A JOB?
- BLOCKBUSTER.

105
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,800
FIRST STOP
ON THE SHITBIRD EXPRESS.

106
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,500
IN SOME WAYS,
THIS HORRIBLE SHOOTING
MAY PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY

107
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
FOR HIM TO LEARN
FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

108
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
MY MISTAKES--

109
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,600
I GOT CAUGHT UP
IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

110
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,800
YOU THINK IT CAN'T HAPPEN
TO YOU, BUT IT DOES.

111
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,100
BUT I WAS REFERRING
TO THE BIGGER PICTURE:

112
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
THE READY ACCESS
TO GUNS,

113
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,700
<i>THE USE OF VIOLENCE</i>
 <i>TO SOLVE DISPUTES</i>

114
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,300
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE
OF YOUR WORK,
YOUR UNCLE'S WORK.

115
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,600
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT MY UNCLE.

116
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,400
FINE, BUT FOR NOW
IS IT SAFE TO SAY

117
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,200
THAT THERE ARE WORSE
WAYS TO EARN MONEY

118
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,400
THAN BY STOCKING SHELVES
AT BLOCKBUSTER?

119
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
YEAH, THERE ARE.

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,100
- COME ON, YOU IN OR WHAT?
- DON'T FUCK WITH
 MY CONCENTRATION.

121
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,000
I'VE WARNED YOU BEFORE.

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,700
WHAT IS IT?
800 MORE?

123
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,300
FUCK IT. FOLD.

124
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,400
Sil: <i>CARDS.</i>

125
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
OH! THERE'S THE SKIP.

126
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,800
BACK WITH A VENGEANCE.

127
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- HOW ARE YOU?

128
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
WELCOME HOME, T.

129
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,800
- COME HERE,
 YOU MALINGERER YOU.
- EASY EASY EASY.

130
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
( laughing )

131
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,500
- GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK, T.
- FUCKING GREAT TO BE BACK.

132
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
- SIT, TON',
 I'LL CLEAR YOUR SPOT.
- WE GOT YOU YOUR BIALY

133
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,200
AS SOON AS WE HEARD
YOU WERE COMING IN TODAY.

134
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,000
NUKE THAT JOE
SO IT'S HOT.

135
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,000
OH, FUCK.

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,500
THE ONIONS--
I CAN'T.

137
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,500
OH, SCOOP OUT
THAT BIALY.

138
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
- I GOT IT.
- SORRY.

139
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,100
I GOT IT, TON',
NO PROBLEM.

140
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,600
THERE YOU GO.
I'LL GET YOUR COFFEE,
AND YOU'RE ALL SET.

141
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,600
SO THE MUNICIPAL
SWIMMING POOL--

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,900
- THE BID START ON THAT YET?
- I GOT A LUNCH TOMORROW.

143
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
THAT GUY DEUTSCH
FROM THE PLANNING
COMMISSION.

144
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,500
ANTIBIOTICS.

145
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,603
I HAD THAT
WITH THE SPLEEN.
STAVES OFF THE INFECTION.

146
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,907
SPLEEN, MY ASS.

147
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,100
BEAT THIS.

148
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,000
- OOF, MADONN'.
- FUCK THAT.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,500
- CHECK OUT THIS BAD BOY.
- ( groaning )

150
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,400
I HAD THE PLASTIC SURGEON,
TASCHLIN, DO THE OUTSIDE
SUTURES.

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,600
PLEPLER,
THE HEAD TRAUMA MAN,
HE DID THE INSIDE WORK.

152
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
HE DEALT WITH THE SEPSIS.

153
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I WAS THE FIRST GUY
AT THE HOSPITAL TO
HAVE THE V.A.C.

154
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,800
IT'S AN OPEN
INCISION SITUATION.

155
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,500
IT'S A BETTER WAY TO HEAL.
LESS PULLING ON THE OUTER
DERMIS LAYERS.

156
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
THE THING IS WITH ALL
THE ATIVAN AND THE DILAUDID
I WAS TAKING,

157
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,500
INTESTINAL BLOCKAGE
WAS A CONSTANT FUCKING
PROBLEM.

158
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
- SO IN THE LONG RUN--
- THERE'S YOUR COFFEE, TON'.

159
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
- YEAH.
- Dante: <i>TON',</i>
 <i> WITH YOUR MEDICINE,</i>

160
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,100
- YOU WANT I SET MY WATCH
 SO YOU DON'T GOTTA WORRY?
- NURSE BETTY OVER HERE.

161
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,500
WHEN MY MOM HAD THE LUPUS,
GOD REST HER SOUL,

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,500
'ROUND THE CLOCK CARE
I GAVE THAT WOMAN.

163
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,900
MEDICINE, FOOD, LIFTED HER
IN AND OUT OF THE TUB.

164
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,700
- THE MAN'S TRYING TO EAT.
- I'M JUST SAYING.

165
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,100
ANOTHER LIFE I MIGHT HAVE
GONE INTO HEALTH CARE.
I ACTUALLY ENJOYED IT.

166
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,600
HOW ABOUT A BANDAGE
OVER YOUR MOUTH THEN?
WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY.

167
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,500
- YOU CAN LIFT A GROWN
 WOMAN OUT OF A TUB?
- MM-HMM.

168
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
ISN'T IT IRONIC?

169
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
FUCKING HOSPITAL STAY
LIKE MINE,

170
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
YOU LOSE GODDAMN
MUSCLE MASS, NOT FAT.

171
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,400
FUCKING BELIEVE IT?

172
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,800
YOU'D THINK AT LEAST
SOMETHING GOOD WOULD HAVE
COME OUT OF THE SITUATION.

173
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,200
- YOU IN, TON'?
- Tony: <i>SURE, WHY NOT?</i>

174
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,400
- HE'S IN.
- SAME GAME,
 FIVE-CARD CALLS?

175
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,900
SAME GAME. WHY?
YOU WANNA CHANGE GAMES NOW
'CAUSE I WON THREE POTS?

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
Paulie:
 <i>KEEP THE CARDS</i>
 <i>DOWN, SIL.</i>

177
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,500
THE GOVERNMENT'S
OWN NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,700
CLEARLY FINDS
EVIDENCE OF DEMENTIA.

179
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,900
EVIDENCE <i>CONSISTENT</i>
WITH DEMENTIA.

180
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,700
NONETHELESS, I'M GOING TO
RECOMMEND HE BE SENT

181
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,400
TO A PRISON PSYCHIATRIC
FACILITY FOR FURTHER
EVALUATION.

182
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,200
HE'LL ONLY BE WAREHOUSED
IN A PUBLIC FACILITY.

183
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
NOW, YOUR HONOR, WE ASK
THAT MR. SOPRANO BE SENT

184
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,900
- TO A PRIVATE LOCKED FACILITY.
- WHY NOT A RESORT
 IN ANTIGUA?

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,400
YOU WANT HIS MENTAL STATE
IMPROVED SO YOU CAN
PUT HIM ON TRIAL?

186
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
JUST LET HIM GO
TO A PLACE WHERE
HE CAN GET BETTER.

187
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,500
YOU GOT UNCLE ANGELO
AT TABLE 19?

188
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,400
WHAT?
HE'S WITH CONNIE
AND THEM.

189
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,700
AND WHEN HE
SEES AUNT LORRAINE
AND THE HAITIAN BOYFRIEND

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
SITTING NEXT TO THEM...

191
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,300
- I THGHT YOU
 WERE ON TOP OF THIS.
- THERE'S 400 PEOPLE, JOHN.

192
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,300
I'VE HAD OTHER THINGS
ON MY MIND.

193
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,900
AND I'M IDLING
AWAY THE HOURS?

194
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,800
WHO'S NOT TALKING
TO WHO?

195
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,800
THIS ONE
CAN'T SEE THAT ONE.

196
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,300
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
TAKE IT EASY.

197
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,900
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WANTED A BIG WEDDING.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
CATHERINE, YOUR SISTER
HAS ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH
WITHOUT THE COMMENTARY.

199
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,500
I'M SORRY I BLEW
MY STACK, OKAY?

200
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,600
WE ARE GONNA GET THROUGH
THIS AS A FAMILY--
DIGNIFIED, PROUD--

201
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,800
DESPITE ALL THE PERSECUTION
AND ROADBLOCKS.

202
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,100
AND WHEN I SAY FAMILY,
THAT INCLUDES YOU, TOO, ERIC.

203
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,900
- THANK YOU, JOHN.
- THANK YOU WHO?

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
THANK YOU, DAD.

205
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
YOU...

206
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,400
I WANT YOU TO RELAX.
MAKE SURE YOU EAT.

207
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,300
- YOU TOO.
- ME? NO, THANK YOU.

208
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,300
I AM EIGHT POUNDS AWAY
FROM MY GOAL, AND I AM
FITTING IN THAT DRESS

209
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
- IF IT KILLS ME.
- JESUS, CAN WE <i>EVER</i>
 TALK ABOUT ANYTHING

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IN THIS FAMILY
BESIDES <i>FOOD?</i>

211
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,200
- THREE 6'S.
- BOAT, 10'S OVER JACKS.

212
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,100
- VITO, YOU AGAIN.
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT FOR ME.

213
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,300
- BANKER'S HOURS.
- PACE MYSELF, DOCTOR SAID.

214
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,400
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW MUCH ENERGY
THE BODY EXPENDS

215
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,100
- DURING THE HEALING PROCESS.
- PENNE ARABIATTA,

216
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,200

COOLED DOWN, WILL YOU?

217
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,000

 <i> WHAT I CALL HIM.</i>

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
RED PEPPER FLAKES

219
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,200
<i>HE'S A FUCKING HOT HEAD.</i>

220
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,600
TON',

221
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,600

THERE HE IS.
BACK IN BUSINESS.

223
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,800
- HOW'S THE LABONZA?
- OH, IT'S GOOD.

224
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,500
YOU GUYS LETTING HIM WIN?

225
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
LISTEN, I NEED
TO BEND YOUR EAR.

226
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,000
CAN'T IT WAIT?
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO

227
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,500
I JUST SAT IN TRAFFIC
ALL THE WAY FROM BROOKLYN.

228
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,100
I WAS UP BY JOHN.
HE SENDS HIS REGARDS.

229
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,400
HE'D LIKE YOU TO DO
HIM A FAVOR, THOUGH.

230
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,000
WHAT NOW?

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,600
OUR FRIEND THERE,
THE MAYOR OF MUNCHKINLAND,

232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
JOHN WANTS HIM GONE.

233
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
JESUS. RUSTY?

234
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,400
JOHN'S WORRIED HE MIGHT
FIND ANOTHER PUPPET LIKE
LITTLE CARMINE,

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
TRY TO RUN THE FAMILY
THROUGH HIM.

236
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,700
SO WHY ME HIT HIM?

237
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,400
YOU GUYS GOT MORE BUTTONS
THAN MY GRANDMOTHER'S
FUCKING CORSETS.

238
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,300
JOHN WANTS
THINGS TO POINT <i>AWAY</i>
FROM THE FAMILY.

239
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,600
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TELL HIM, "NO."

240
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,600
TIME AND AGAIN
I'VE DONE HIS BIDDING.

241
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,000
IT'S TIME TO SET
SOME LIMITS.

242
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,400
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

243
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,200
BE WELL.

( breathing heavily )

245
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,000
I THOUGHT
I HEARD THE DOOR.

246
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
HOW WAS THE FIRST DAY?

247
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,000
IT WAS GOOD.

248
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,800
- TIRED, THOUGH.
- YOU WANNA TAKE A NAP?

249
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
SMELLS GOOD.

250
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,100
DOWNY FRESH.

251
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
GOD, THIS FEELS GREAT.

252
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600

LISTEN, TON',
I DON'T MEAN
TO TALK BUSINESS,

379
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,300
BUT I HAD
TO TELL YOU.

380
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,700
I MET WITH THAT GUY
DEUTSCH, THE ONE FROM
THE PLANNING COMMISSION.

381
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,500
NOT ONLY IS HE IN CHARGE
OF APPROVING BIDS FOR
ALL CITY CONTRACTS,

382
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
HE'S ALSO A DEGENERATE
HORSE PLAYER.

383
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,400
SO HE'LL PLAY BALL?

384
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,100
HE'S FUCKING JOE DiMAGGIO.

385
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,800
AND THIS IS
FROM WEEHAWKEN,
THE STRIP MALL.

386
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
ENJOY YOUR DAY.

387
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,000
OH, HERE HE IS.
FATHER OF THE BRIDE.

 SO BEAUTIFUL.

389
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,700
- IT WAS SO MOVING.
- THANK YOU, HONEY.
 I APPRECIATE IT.

390
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,300
ALL THIS.

391
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,100
HEY, GOOGOOTZ, YOU WANNA
BE AN EVENT PLANNER,

392
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,500
YOU LEARN FROM THIS.

393
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,700
AN EVENT PLANNER?
WHERE DO YOU GET
THIS SHIT?

394
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,000
"STUFF" WOULD
DO NICELY, A.J.
WE'RE AT A WEDDING.

395
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,300
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MY FRIEND.

396
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,500
YOU TOO, JOHN.

397
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,900
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
- OBVIOUSLY, I COULDN'T COME
 VISIT YOU IN THE HOSPITAL.

398
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,200
WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED,
I WAS DEVASTATED.

399
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,900
THAT'S LIFE, HUH?

400
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,500
SO SERIOUSLY,
WHAT'S THE DAMAGES HERE?

401
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,600
WHAT AM I IN FOR
WITH MEADOW?

402
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,100
NOT COUNTING
THE HONEYMOON, 425.

403
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,700
SO ADJUSTING
FOR INFLATION,

404
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,500
I'M LOOKING
AT HALF A ROCK.

405
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,100
WHAT'S IT ALL FOR,
THOUGH, TONY, HUH?
WHAT WE PUT IN, THE GRIND.

406
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
ISN'T THAT
FOR THINGS LIKE THIS?

407
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,700
YEAH.

408
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
SO I HEARD PHIL
CAME TO SEE YOU.

409
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,800
LET'S GO SAY HELLO
TO YOUR DAD.

410
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
<i>( lounge music playing )</i>

411
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,000
SO HOW YOU DOING HERE?
YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?

412
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,400
- WHICH ONE ARE YOU?
- MY FRIEND TONY, POP.

413
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,100
HEY, I'M GONNA SAY
A FEW THINGS,

414
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
AND THESE PRICKS
ARE WATCHING,

415
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,000
SO I'M GONNA MAKE LIKE
I'M TALKING TO YOUR DAD
AND THEM.

416
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,800
HEY, AUNT... FARRIS.

417
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,400
<i>HELLO.</i>

418
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,300
WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO
WITH THE LITTLE GUY,

419
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,300
I CAN'T DO IT.

420
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,300
THIS FUCKING PRICK,

421
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,500
HE'S DISRUPTIVE.

422
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,300
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE BALLS
TO STEP UP HIMSELF.

423
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,400
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
- SO JUST KEEP HIM
 AWAY FROM PHIL.

424
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,100
HE'S A CANCER.
I CAN'T LET IT SPREAD.

425
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,800
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO USE ONE OF
YOUR OWN DOCTORS.

426
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>OH, I'D LOVE TO.</i>
 <i>BELIEVE ME.</i>

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,700
BUT MY POSITION IS
NOT COMPLETELY SOLIDIFIED.

428
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,900
YOU SHOULD CALL
DR. CUOMO.

429
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,200
- WE'RE JUST TALKING HERE,
 AUNT LOUISE.
- DON'T EAT THAT PEPPER!

430
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
- WHEN CARMINE DIED...
- WHAT?

431
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,100
...RUSTY COULD
HAVE BEEN BOSS.
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

432
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,300
<i>BUT HE DIDN'T WANT</i>
 <i>THE RESPONSIBILITY.</i>

433
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,500
LIKE I ADVISED YOU.

434
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,700
SAY NO MORE.

435
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
IT'S TOO FUCKING
LATE NOW ANYWAY.

436
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
I NEED YOUR HELP, TONY.

437
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,800
SOME OF THESE GUYS,
MY CAPTAINS,

438
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,700
THEY FIND OUT I'M BEHIND
THE MOVE AGAINST HIM?

439
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,200
MAKE THINGS WORSE.
I CAN'T TAKE THAT RISK
WHILE I'M IN JAIL.

440
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,900
STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,300
SO I'M SUPPOSED
TO PUT MYSELF AT RISK,

442
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,600
SHARE THE SAME FUCKING
JAIL CELL AS YOU?

443
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,800
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

444
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,300
FORGET IT, JOHN.

445
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,700
IT'S ALLEGRA'S
WEDDING, TONY.

446
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,600
THE WAY THINGS ARE,

447
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,900
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE
AROUND FOR CATHERINE'S.

448
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,000
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH TIME
RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

449
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000

491
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
IN THE MORNING.

492
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,200
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AT THIS TIME

493
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,100
OUR LOVELY BRIDE WILL DANCE
WITH HER FATHER.

494
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700

495
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,200
<i>( man singing</i>
 <i>festive song )</i>

496
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,000
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS,
I'M THINKING.

497
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,600
WE BRING SOMEBODY OVER
FROM NAPLES.

498
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,500
WHAT?

499
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,800
COMPLETELY INSULATE OURSELVES.
THEY DO RUSTY,

500
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,900
THEY'RE BACK ON A PLANE
OVER THE ATLANTIC
TWO HOURS LATER.

501
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,300
I DON'T KNOW, T.
YOU ASK ME, FARMING IT OUT

502
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,000
IS A PUSSY-ASS
MANEUVER.

503
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,900
EXCUSE ME?

504
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,500
TON', THE ROLLATINE!

505
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
HOLD ON.

506
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,100
IF WE'RE GONNA DO IT,
WE SHOULD DO IT OURSELVES,

507
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,500
MAINTAIN CONTROL.

508
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,300
BETTER YET, TELL NEW YORK
TO FUCKING HANDLE IT ALREADY.

509
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,900
JOHN JUST ASKED ME
 <i>SPECIFICALLY.</i>

510
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,700
SO IT'S LIKE
THE MOVIE THEN.

511
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,400
- WHAT MOVIE?
- ONE. THAT YOU CAN'T
 REFUSE A MAN'S REQUEST

512
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
- ON HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING DAY.
- NO, IT'S THE OTHER
 WAY AROUND.

513
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
THAT I SHOULD BE ASKING
HIM FOR SOMETHING
HE CAN'T REFUSE.

514
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,100
- SO DID YOU?
- NO.

515
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
- YOU SHOULD ASK
 NOT TO DO THIS.
- I ALREADY FUCKING AGREED.

516
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,200
LOOK, WE WANNA KEEP
HIM PLACATED, RIGHT?

517
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,200
I MEAN, THE SHIT WITH PHIL
AND HIS LITTLE BROTHER

518
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,200
AND THE PERPETUAL HARD-ON
HE'S STILL GOT WITH US.

519
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,400
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

520
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,500
WELL, I DIDN'T ASK YOU
WHAT YOU FUCKING THINK.

521
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
- COME ON.
- YOU'RE GOING ALREADY?

522
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,000
HE'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS
AT WEDDINGS.

523
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,100
YOU MAKE ME SOUND RUDE.
CRAB CAKES. I TOLD YOU
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

524
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,400
THEY DON'T KEEP
IN THIS HEAT.

525
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
VITO, LET'S GO.

526
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,600
FRANCESCA, COME ON.

527
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,900
GOOD NIGHT.

CAN HE HAVE
SOME CAKE AT LEAST?

534
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
YOU CAN PACK SOME
TO TAKE WITH YOU,
IF YOU'D LIKE.

535
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,000
HEARTLESS PRICKS.

536

- LET'S GO.
- STAND BACK, PLEASE.

550

- CAN YOU LET MY DAUGHTER
 LEAVE AT LEAST?
- DADDY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

551
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,300
I WILL NOT <i>ASK</i> YOU AGAIN.

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,700
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF HIM.

 FUCKING NECESSARY?

I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, AND I'M
NOT ASHAMED TO SAY IT,

566
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,200
MY ESTIMATION
OF JOHN SACRIMONI AS A MAN

567
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,800
JUST FUCKING PLUMMETED.

568
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,800
GIVE HIM A BREAK,
WILL YA?

569
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,800
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL DAY.

570
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,400
TO CRY LIKE A WOMAN?
IT'S A FUCKING DISGRACE.

571
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,300
HIS FUCKING COACH
TURNED INTO A PUMPKIN.

572
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,500
WELL, EVEN CINDERELLA
DIDN'T CRY.

573
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
WHEN IT COMES TO DAUGHTERS,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

574
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,200
I'VE SEEN TOUGHER GUYS
THAN JOHN CRY AT WEDDINGS.

575
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,400
WELL, LEME
ASK YOU THIS.

576
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,500
IF THEY CAN MAKE HIM CRY
AND IF HE'S THAT WEAK,

577
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,700
WHAT THE FUCK ELSE
CAN THEY MAKE HIM DO?

578
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,000

POOR GUY.

HE'S AN EMOTIONAL MAN.
HE LOVES HIS DAUGHTER.

582
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
I want to give you
a home, take care of you.

 SOME COLLECTIONS.
