1
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,072
Stop dumping.
Stop dumping.

2
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,675
- what is matter?
- lower your bed.

3
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,411
You can't dump here no more.
You need to talk to your boss.

4
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,879
Always we are
dumping here.

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,215
Caballero, put the shit
back in your truck.

6
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,018
What?
That is huge job!

7
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,119
Take it easy, boss..
well'handle it.

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,020
Clean this up!

9
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,393
Where I am supposed
to be dumping this now?

10
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,094
Fuck you doing?

11
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,094
Mundo made me miss my break.

12
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,995
You know what you're breathing
and eating on your food there?

13
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:17,796
Asbestos.

14
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,097
What's that?

15
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,246
I just now find out it's asbestos
you've been dumping over there.

16
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,382
What did you
think it was?

17
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,151
I never asked.

18
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,520
tampax...  what
the fuck do I know?

19
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
well, now you know.

20
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,257
You and your friend there stefano
have been pocketing how much

21
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,427
on this cowboys-and-indian
asbestos removal?

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,928
Billing the townships

23
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,098
like you're following
althe epa regulations.

24
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,567
You got the same scam, phil, so why
don't we cut through the bullshit?

25
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,703
how much you figure
you're owed on this?

26
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,005
- 25%.
- don't be an asshole.

27
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,808
You know, there's close monitoring
at every fucking landfill.

28
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,110
Maybe if somebody had been
upfront with me from the beginning.

29
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,979
Nobody's been hiding nothing. I had the
same dumping deal with what's-his-name,

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,616
the operation's manager since I've
been there at barone sanitation.

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,319
You're not there
no more. I am.

32
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,022
You're enjoying your
generous severance package.

33
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,892
25%... That's not
gonna happen.

34
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,662
You've got a backyard,
a pool, dump it there.

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,864
That's my only
other suggestion.

36
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,740
He's got us by the gazz'.
I'll tell you that.

37
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:29,609
Unless that guy at the pennsy
landfill decides to play ball.

38
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,779
That asshole's shitting his pants
he'll get pinched by the epa.

39
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,048
Frankly, ton',

40
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,083
I'm thinking maybe we
should meet phil's number.

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,787
Why? I think that would set a
terrible precedent right now.

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,722
Just bend over...

43
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,958
When he just became boss
of the family over there?

44
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,794
Yeah, well,
that's the flying ointment.

45
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,565
Even still,
I say let him have it.

46
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,334
Life's too short.

47
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,204
It's also too short to
live it as a fucking lackey.

48
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,073
True too.

49
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,244
What is this,
"make-believe ballroom"?

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,980
How many times you gonna
change the stations?

51
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,751
This "departed" soundtrack's
fucking killer.

52
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,753
- you got it?
- <I>yeah, it's good.

53
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,326
regarding, phil,
I gotta ask:

54
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,496
whatever happened to
"stop and smell the roses"?

55
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:29,769
You're right.
U're right.

56
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,106
You can't fight every
fucking battle, right?

57
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,212
Asbestos...

58
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,624
Each day's a gift.

59
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,727
Every time I look at my
kid, that's what I realiz

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,563
and that shit
with junior, please.

61
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,306
Just that peoplike phil,

62
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,074
they're not
on that page...

63
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,144
Take those rosesand stick 'em up
your ass, thorns first.

64
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,652
This system's got no balls.

65
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,785
so how was your party
that day at the hous

66
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,222
slow the fuck down,
will ya?!

67
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,514
Maybe you sh
go back, heidi.

68
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,983
Kennedy, I'm on my
learner's permit after dark.

69
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,229
Ton'...

70
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,234
You gotta...
Help me.

71
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,737
I'm coming.

72
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,941
I'll never pass
the drug test.

73
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,510
What?

74
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,645
You gotta get me out.

75
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,814
I'll lose my license.

76
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,901
Never pass a drug test.

77
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,636
Call me a taxi.

78
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,290
<i>911.</i>

79
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,992
we've been
in an accident.

80
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,062
old pumping station road...

81
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,831
past the reservoir.

82
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,653
- Sorry about that.
- My friend...

83
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,489
Guy I came with,
how is he?

84
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,293
your friend is dead.
paramedics called it in the ambulance.

85
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,829
breathe in,
please. hold it.

86
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,598
do you know a contact number
for his next of kin?

87
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,770
His wife.

88
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,618
- hello.
-  Hello, may I speak with carmela soprano?

89
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,054
- who is this?
- nurse al rosario,

90
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,491
<i>st. Clare's hospital, denville.
is mrs. Soprano there?</i>

91
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,493
yes, this is
mrs. Soprano.

92
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,396
I'm here with your husband.
He'd like to speak with you.

93
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,502
<i>- carm.
- tony, is everything okay?</i>

94
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,037
<i>are you sitting down?</i>

95
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,406
- I'm serious.
- yes, I'm in bed.

96
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,241
<i>all right, listen. </i>

97
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,476
<i>sweetheart,
there's been an accident. </i>

98
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,213
<i>we were coming back
from the city and... </i>

99
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,152
<i>- christopher's dead.
- oh my god!</i>

100
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,220
all right.

101
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,356
- carm.
- what happened?

102
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,360
He drove off the road
and the car flipped over.

103
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,996
- I'll tell you in detail.
- are you okay?

104
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,998
I just banged my knee,
the one from high school.

105
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,033
I'm fine, but...

106
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,236
He wasn't wearing
a belt.

107
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,872
Where are you,
st. Clare's?

108
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:16,042
Listen, they're gonna call
kelli if they haven't already...

109
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,179
Just get al and rita
on the phone

110
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,014
and get 'em started
over there.

111
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,884
All right, all right.
Oh my god, tony, he's dead?

112
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,053
Yeah.

113
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,423
All right.
L- let me get dressed.

114
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,231
Thank you.

115
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,726
mr. Tony,
mr. Sil is here.

116
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,028
Okay.

117
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,531
- mrs. Carmela say you should stay in bed.
- have him come up.

118
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,500
We're right here, ton'.

119
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
We came as soon
as we heard.

120
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,373
- ton'.
- patsy went over to chrissy's mom's house.

121
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,143
- yeah, that's where carmela is.
- carlo's coming up.

122
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,744
Yeah.

123
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,985
- how you doing, ton'?
- my knee got banged up.

124
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,087
they said it's
probably gonna be okay.

125
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,324
last thing
I remember was...

126
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,360
We pulled away
from phil.

127
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,929
Skid marks all over the
place, the cops told carm.

128
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,999
He had a heavy foot,
that kid, always.

129
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,534
Almost put me through
a billboard one time.

130
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,005
- hey, ton'.
- come on in.

131
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,407
I'm so sorry, ton'.

132
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,376
I still can't
believe it.

133
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,178
Thanks. I know
you two were close.

134
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,647
I was making
my collections

135
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,117
and anthony maffel
called me. Jesus.

136
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,758
- it's carlo, I bet.

137
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,294
fucking idiot didn't even
have his seat belt on.

138
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,265
His chest filled up.

139
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,068
Suffocated
on his own blood.

140
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,971
- oh, jesus.
- jesus christ.

141
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,241
Seems like that's
the cause of death.

142
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,645
It's not carlo.
I heard aj.

143
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,714
Carlo's coming up?

144
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,916
What's with you and carlfucking arrival?

145
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,453
- I'm just saying.
- they're gonna do a full blood test on him.

146
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,056
See, you know,

147
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,393
if alcohol,

148
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,896
- drugs or...
- it did occur to me.

149
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,399
He didn't seem high,
did he?

150
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,367
Are you kidding?
I would have been furi

151
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,436
I would have fucking
strangled him.

152
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,905
He'd been working the program
ever since he threw little paulie

153
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,841
- out that window.
- let's not go there.

154
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,610
Even before that
he was battling that shit.

155
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,379
he gave it his all.

156
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,616
Well, anyway,
he's gone now,

157
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,685
our chrissy.

158
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,688
Crazy fucking maniac.

159
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,858
The thing to take
to heart, t,

160
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,027
you're here.
You're all right.

161
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,029
You could have been killed,
for ck's sake.

162
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,432
What are you gonna do?

163
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,303
Thanks.

164
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,706
Whoa.
What are you doing?

165
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,208
No no no, I gotta
try and get up.

166
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,745
Gotta go and meet carm
over at chrissy's.

167
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,880
Kelli and all that.

168
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,384
I'll make you
a plate.

169
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,886
- get me a scotch.
- are you serious?

170
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,823
Yeah, and have
one yourself.

171
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,796
They were close,
two cousins.

172
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,570
You all right?

173
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,674
I know I had my
differences with that kid,

174
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:11,177
but maybe I didn't
do right by him, neither.

175
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,680
If you were his dad,
I was his dutch uncle,

176
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,117
and what the fuck did
I do but get pissed off,

177
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:20,920
fight with him over
cocksucking fucking money?

178
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,923
I'd break his balls when
he ied not to have a drink

179
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,026
or a little taste
of snow.

180
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,762
It's over, paulie.

181
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,570
did anybody ever hear
from the hospital?

182
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,005
I was waiting
till kelli woke up.

183
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,276
They found cocaine
in his blood.

184
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,513
- madonn'.
- 'cause of death was a hemothorax.

185
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,916
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs
when there's no other restraint.

186
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,419
They said he might
have made it,

187
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,753
but he didn't.

188
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,855
Couldn't have worn
his goddamn seat belt?

189
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,324
- no wonder. He was whack-a-doo.
- al, just stop it.

190
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,394
Aw, baloney. He leaves
our granddaughter fatherless.

191
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,764
My only child!

192
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,300
Drinking won't help,
honey.

193
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,302
Jesus christ.

194
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,875
Look at this.
Syracuse is losing.

195
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,782
I don't know
what to say.

196
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,318
- what?
- I just got a call from little paulie.

197
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,554
Nucci gualtieri died.

198
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,625
Stroke on the bus back
to the home.

199
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,195
They had gone
to see "jersey boys."

200
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,600
this is difficult.

201
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,503
This is pain

202
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,372
like I'm not used to.

203
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,775
We've said before he was
like a son in some ways.

204
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,044
To see him die
like that...

205
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,713
Practically
in my arms.

206
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,350
He was just starting
his life.

207
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,353
Yeah.

208
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,130
You know what?

209
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,300
- this is bullshit.
- what?

210
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,037
I haven't been able
to tell anybody this, but...

211
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,940
I'm fucking relieved.

212
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,876
Really?

213
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,978
He was a tremendous drag
on my emotions,

214
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,581
on my... Thoughts
about the future.

215
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,885
Every morning
I wake up thinking,

216
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,054
"is today the day that
one of my best friends

217
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,222
is gonna dime me
to the fbi?"

218
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,625
and a weak,
fucking sniveling,

219
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,161
lying drug addict? That's
the worst kind of bet.

220
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,230
The biggest blunder
of my career

221
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,533
is now gone.

222
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,070
And I don't have to be
confronted by that fact no more.

223
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,373
And as a relative,
a friend,

224
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,409
someone you can
count on...

225
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,779
I see.

226
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,553
Let me tell you
something:

227
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,789
I've murdered friends
before, even relatives...

228
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:12,359
My cousin tony,

229
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,928
my best friend...
Puss.

230
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:20,467
But this...

231
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,440
Was I talking
in my sleep?

232
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,809
Snoring.

233
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,611
I'm gonna put on the tv
if you don't mind.

234
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,481
I can't stay asleep
either. I'm all...

235
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,390
I mean, I can laugh and cry,
and I could always get the part.

236
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,226
- first time?
- first time. Never can keep it.

237
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,495
They got onto me
after a while.

238
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,264
I'd lose my voice, fall
down, get red in the face,

239
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,000
talk too fast
and couldn't act.

240
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,733
Can you make me
a cappuccino?

241
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,836
That fucking machine from paulie,
you need a pilot's license.

242
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,576
It's so hard not to think of
christopher as a child, isn't it?

243
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:40,046
Caity kind of looks likeim,
which makes it doubly hard

244
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,917
of course that's not
gonna do her any favors

245
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,553
when she hits puberty...
That schnoz.

246
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,189
A lot of women
found him very attractive.

247
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,294
I think to myself,

248
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:58,198
how could I have ever said
those things about him,

249
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,035
about him and adriana, what
her mother said he did to her?

250
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,410
Obviously he was violent as an adult.

251
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:14,147
His upbringing,
but he adored ade.

252
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,750
He could never let
himself take her life.

253
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,387
Why are we
so quick to blame?

254
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,122
What is
the attraction in that?

255
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,071
It's good.

256
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,073
Thank you.

257
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,245
When I called you...

258
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,746
The night after
the accident,

259
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,815
and you asked me,

260
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,651
"oh my god, tony,
he's dead?"

261
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,853
yeah.

262
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,156
And I thought...

263
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,159
Well, I thought
I picked up a twinge of...

264
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,197
- relief.
- what?

265
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,266
It just seemed like...
I don't know...

266
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,668
How could you say that? You don't
know what you're talking about.

267
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,103
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

268
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,105
Maybe if you did pick up
something like that,

269
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,341
maybe it's because
I warelieved...

270
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,376
That it was him
and not you.

271
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,379
Well, don't feel bad about
that. That makes sense.

272
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,151
To be going down
to the hospital again

273
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,220
at 2:00 in the morning?

274
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,627
And you know what?
When you were shot,

275
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,963
it was christopher
who held me.

276
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,704
You know
the baby's car seat?

277
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:48,875
A giant tree branch
came through the window

278
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,910
and demolished it.

279
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,316
She would have
been dead, caitlin,

280
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,485
mangled beyond
recognition.

281
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,099
I told her about
the baby seat

282
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,335
so she wouldn't
feel so rotten.

283
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,038
I mean, he was high as a fucking
kite. I didn't tell her that.

284
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,208
In retrospect,
maybe not the best approach.

285
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:25,412
Right,
I'm the asshole... Again.

286
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,649
What?

287
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,019
No, go ahead.

288
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:37,691
It's amazing
how things work.

289
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,261
His mother,
cousin joanne,

290
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,029
a lush.

291
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,965
Totally abandoned him
as a parent,

292
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,768
but now she's reaping
all the sympathy

293
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,970
and the tears.

294
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,707
How are you doing,
anthony?

295
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,211
There have been
some hard moments.

296
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,549
But a weak,
lying drug at

297
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,617
who fantasized
about my downfall,

298
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,053
who even showed people
his filthy thoughts

299
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,155
on a movie screen...?

300
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:14,127
Let me tell you I've
seen friends die before,

301
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,796
accidents,

302
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,965
even murder.

303
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,067
My cousin tony,
they shot his face away.

304
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:24,504
And I was fucking
prostate with grief.

305
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,139
But this?

306
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,342
I see.

307
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,644
And it occurs to me,
I hand-carried this kid

308
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,180
through the worst
crisis he ever had.

309
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:39,452
I can't go
into particulars, but...

310
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,788
Wives, girlfriends,

311
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,790
they can complicate life
in a major way.

312
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,992
I don't have to
tell you that.

313
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,298
Anyway, huge problem
of his own making.

314
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:57,303
And he cried.
He couldn't deal with it.

315
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,139
So...

316
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,975
I took up the slack.
I handled it.

317
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,044
I felt sorry
for him.

318
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,347
Now he talked gratitude...

319
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,684
But guess what py
produces in the recipient.

320
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,886
They shit
on your pity.

321
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,524
that's what broke
the camel's back.

322
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,994
How are you
handling all this?

323
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:23,797
The worst part,
truthfully,

324
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,066
is I gotta sit there

325
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,636
withple
who are hurting... Bad.

326
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:34,007
And I gotta have
the long face

327
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:37,010
and the sighing
and the platitudes.

328
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,547
But I don't feel it.

329
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,518
Then that makes me feel
like a hypocrite.

330
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,056
And that makes
me mad at them.

331
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:15,281
Oh, hi.

332
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,951
How are you?

333
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,424
Julianna skiffle,

334
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,260
this is my wife
carmela soprano.

335
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:28,728
Skiff.

336
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,930
Oh, yeah, right.

337
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:34,734
Julianna's a real estate
agent in the old neighborhood.

338
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,603
And you knew
christopher?

339
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,471
I used to buy my meat
at satriale's.

340
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:45,445
I'm a recovering addict.

341
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,449
- I owe him a lot.
- that's nice to hear.

342
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,055
- well, what are you gonna do, huh?
- nothing you can do.

343
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,557
That's my point.

344
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,259
He was too young.

345
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,897
Good-looking woman.

346
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,252
They did
a beautiful job on him.

347
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,595
Oh, I'm gonna go up.

348
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:39,666
I'll go up later,

349
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,669
give my seat to someone
in the meantime.

350
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:49,476
How are you doing?

351
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:55,215
- it's tough.
- yeah.

352
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,484
He loved y so much.

353
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,388
- yeah?
- well, you know he did.

354
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:09,396
I'll go up later.

355
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:29,482
There she is.
3 to 5, 7 to 9.

356
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,151
why do they call her that?

357
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,752
she never
misses a wake.

358
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,492
Oh, lord, oh, lord!

359
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,561
Fucking
james brown now.

360
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,933
I'm serious.
I can't take it.

361
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,503
It's all right.
We're here for you.

362
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,106
Oh my god.
Look at this.

363
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,513
- like a movie star.
- jackie kennedy.

364
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:21,301
- I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin, bro.
- thanks.

365
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:24,471
Me too, bro, me too.

366
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:26,706
He was a good guy.

367
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:31,211
Hey, don't let this linger
on your head now.

368
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,012
You know what
I'm talking about.

369
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:46,326
you know that night,

370
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:48,595
a tree limb came in
through the car window,

371
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:52,065
completely destroyed
the baby seat.

372
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,300
Tony.

373
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,303
You guys are gonna
hang in a while, right?

374
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:00,073
We really should make an
appearance at the other wake.

375
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,795
are we that late?

376
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,663
Glad you came.

377
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,932
- he'll appreciate it.
- oh, please.

378
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,817
I gotta
get out of here.

379
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,756
- paul.
- ton'.

380
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,992
Thanks for coming.

381
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,730
We are so sorry
for your loss, paulie.

382
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,865
How you hangin' in,
paolucc'?

383
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,400
As well as can be expected.

384
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,168
Must be very
hard for you.

385
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:04,170
I know how close the two
of you had become again

386
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,672
yeah.

387
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,474
Not much
of a sendoff here.

388
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:10,810
- the room is beautiful, paulie.
- nobody's in it.

389
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,579
What kind
of testament is this

390
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,347
to the spirit and
generosity of the woman?

391
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:16,082
We're here
for you, paulie.

392
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,817
You know that.

393
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,352
Okay.

394
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:26,326
It's a fundamental
lack of respect

395
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,228
and I'm never gonna
fuckin' forget it, neither.

396
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:31,264
Jesus, paulie, people your
mother's age, their friends die off.

397
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:33,166
What, she outlived
sil? Carlo?

398
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,868
They're all over there
at your nephew's.

399
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,537
- yeah, but...
- councilman carillo was here three minutes.

400
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:39,172
I clocked him.

401
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,473
He told Jerry he was going
to the Moltisanti wake.

402
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:44,377
People are comin'
and they don't, fuck 'em.

403
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,746
I got 500 prayer cards.

404
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,114
Well, carm and I aere.

405
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,349
What the fuck
is that? Nothin'?

406
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:52,185
No, ton', of course not.

407
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,888
- means the world.
- okay.

408
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,058
She suffered too,
you know.

409
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,061
Yeah, well, this isn't
the time or the place.

410
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:02,962
You're right.

411
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,034
How have you been
dealing witht?

412
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,970
It's really sad but it's
kinda the same as with blanca.

413
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,174
I mean, I don't really just keep
thinking about things the way I did...

414
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:16,376
Over and over,
you know?

415
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,379
Well, for one thing,
perhaps the meds are working.

416
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,649
Did you finally enroll?

417
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:24,718
I'm in a few classes

418
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,220
unofficially, until my
transcript clears from ramapo.

419
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,322
Beginning english.

420
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:31,891
Oh, and I went
to a class on the history

421
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,793
of the israeli-palestinian
conflict.

422
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:37,063
- wow.
- I mean, it's hard to pick up in the middle.

423
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,332
I might take it
xt semester.

424
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,468
I mean, it's so
dicked-up over there

425
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,904
and no one knows
who started it.

426
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,805
- are you sleeping?
- what? In class?

427
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:49,109
No. You were having
trouble, remember?

428
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,446
Wellbutrin xl
kicks ass.

429
00:31:53,513 --> 00:31:55,949
I'm hearing good things
about the lexapro.

430
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:58,084
Check it, paisan.
Long john shithead.

431
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:03,189
That kid's in my
south american lit class.

432
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,358
He had his toes amputated.

433
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,132
He said it was an accident
with his car battery.

434
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:13,800
Acid burned right
through his shoe.

435
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:32,352
oh, you litt
shfooyadell.

436
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:34,120
She should nurse.

437
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,890
At least somebody
feels like eating.

438
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,660
She doesn't know.

439
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,762
Isn't god wonderful
that way?

440
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:55,975
- hello?
- alan, it's tony. you busy?

441
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:57,711
usual shit...
Some japanese guy

442
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,946
got his suit ruined
at cirque du soleil.

443
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,982
- listen, I need a suite.
- so all the guys coming out?

444
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,884
no no. I'm solo.

445
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,854
Oh. We'll see what
we can do about that.

446
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:11,091
look, I just want to be alone.
peace and quiet...

447
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:13,727
- ... Chill out.
- you set for transpo?

448
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,196
I'll be happy
to send a plane.

449
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:52,599
no more bets.

450
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:58,038
33 black odd.

451
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:09,416
No more bets.

452
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,921
Five red odd.

453
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,157
It's hard to imagine
for a poet,

454
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,694
but wordsworth
was as rich and popular

455
00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:56,463
as, say, someone like

456
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,965
john grisham nowadays.

457
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:00,801
but wordsworth writes

458
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:03,737
"the world is
too much with us."

459
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:06,206
later, he invokes
nature again.

460
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:11,344
Why such strong words
against the material world?

461
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,425
that was fast.

462
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,260
The gatehouse
usually gives

463
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:02,395
shitty directions to
the east tower. Come in.

464
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,700
so...

465
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,004
you're a friend
of chris.

466
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:13,173
Yeah...
Tony, by the way.

467
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,241
No, I know.

468
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,676
He's mentioned you,
actually.

469
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:19,579
Well, I heard nothing
but nice things about you.

470
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:24,517
Except... You're more
beautiful than he let on.

471
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,686
- really?
- talked about ya...

472
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,689
a few times, told me more
than once to look you up.

473
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:31,091
Did he?

474
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,294
Well well well.

475
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,632
You want a drink
or something?

476
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:41,968
I got some pinot grigio
in the fridge.

477
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:50,443
I got some, uh...

478
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,645
Serious news.

479
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:55,048
- uh-oh.
- it's about christopher.

480
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,418
- he's dead.
- What?

481
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:01,354
It was a car accident,

482
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:03,823
happened
a couple days ago.

483
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,895
Oh my god.

484
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,665
That's fucking awful.

485
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:13,567
I'm sorry.

486
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:17,237
- what happened?
- bad wreck...

487
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:19,639
High-speed...

488
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:22,809
He was killed instantly.

489
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,811
Somehow, I walked away.

490
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,946
Jesus, that must
have been scary.

491
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:30,250
The fuckin' sound alone...

492
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,919
Did he ever...

493
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,588
Marry that one girl... The one wh-

494
00:37:35,655 --> 00:37:37,357
no.

495
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,260
Found a real sweetheart,
though... Kelli...

496
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,262
And...

497
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:44,030
They just had
a baby girl.

498
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,099
Maybe that's good,
you know?

499
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,770
I mean,
bad that he left her,

500
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,673
but good that he...
He left something.

501
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,614
I thought
you should know.

502
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:08,621
Well, um...

503
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,294
Extremely cool, you coming
over here. I appreciate that.

504
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:18,732
- how long you here for?
- I don't know.

505
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:21,801
Just play it as I go.

506
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:44,324
- what's up?
- it's stefano.

507
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:47,260
look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm here at the school.

508
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,095
the asbestos,
it's backing up.

509
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,797
I've gotta dump
this shit.

510
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:53,066
it's not wrapped to code and
all the other violations...

511
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:56,169
- yeah?
- I could get nailed big time.

512
00:38:56,236 --> 00:38:58,004
We're workin' on it, john.

513
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:59,473
I'm trying
to negotiate it out,

514
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,441
but the asshole's
taking a hard line for now.

515
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:04,010
Just hang in there,
let me do my thing.

516
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,945
All right.

517
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,353
- whoa.
- jeff'll clean it up.

518
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,221
Make him clean it
in his bare feet.

519
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,358
I got the venison steaks!

520
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:22,429
Oh!

521
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,597
Oh!

522
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:28,201
What the fuck?
You blind?

523
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:31,004
Me?! You open the door,
you don't look at all.

524
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:33,073
Aw, shit, you wrecked
my fuckin' door.

525
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,375
- you did that to your own door!
- whoa whoa whoa.

526
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,743
What the fuck
did you say?

527
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,312
I said he opened the door,
he don't look at all.

528
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:40,881
Look at my fuckin' bike!

529
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:43,016
- do you hear this guy?
- you saw it!

530
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,652
Fuck you, nigger.

531
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,955
I am not a nigger!

532
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:51,658
I am from somalia!
I go to school and I work!

533
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,126
Do not call me
a nigger!

534
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:54,928
So you're some
terrorist piece of shit.

535
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:57,464
Either way, motherfucker,
you're in the wrong neighborhood.

536
00:39:57,931 --> 00:39:59,899
Get the fuck away!

537
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,503
You a tough nigger now?!

538
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,505
You got something to say?

539
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:09,743
Cocksucker!

540
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:53,253
do you mind?

541
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:56,389
No, knock yourself out.

542
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,395
This is the...

543
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,031
This is the new shit...

544
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,667
Medical-grade, mellow,

545
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,736
paranoia-free.

546
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:14,708
Oh, well, that's good.

547
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:24,484
Oh, chris loved
to party.

548
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:26,986
What's your point?

549
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,989
Nothing.
You just...

550
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:32,826
Remind me
of him, obviously.

551
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:37,163
What's that mean?
I fuck like him?

552
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:43,003
So much
for paranoia-free.

553
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:45,605
No, you were his
friend, that's all.

554
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,174
Why would you
bring him up?

555
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:51,011
All I'm saying

556
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,612
is that there's
a certain kind of guy

557
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,948
that I don't run into
on campus.

558
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,417
But where I dance...

559
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,186
That accent,
the clothes.

560
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:01,855
I'm a type?

561
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:04,691
This coming from the girl who's
stripping her way through college?

562
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,527
Actually,
you're a surprise.

563
00:42:07,627 --> 00:42:09,696
Chris sometimes talked
about some sad shit,

564
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,032
but you seem...
I don't know...

565
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,135
Actually sad.

566
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:18,138
Not right now I'm not.

567
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:20,874
Jesus, this is some
pretty fucking amazing dope.

568
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,612
Chris said you two...

569
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:27,414
Took peyote together.

570
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,482
Yeah.

571
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:33,153
I mean, I haven't done
buttons in a while, though.

572
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,927
You know, I've been thinking
why the fuck I'm here.

573
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:42,829
You can get
to that place.

574
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:45,932
No. No, I mean vegas.

575
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,002
truth is I always wanted
to try that shit...

576
00:42:51,137 --> 00:42:52,806
but I always had

577
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:55,809
all the responsibilities.

578
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,916
You're a hard man
to reach.

579
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:04,851
Nobody's seen hide
nor hair.

580
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,486
Yeah, I'm away.
What do you want?

581
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,722
what do I want?
I'm returning your call.

582
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:10,557
I think this got nothing
to do with asbestos.

583
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:13,293
Why don't you let go of the
old shit and be a businessman?

584
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,962
- you got everything you want.
- not everything.

585
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:19,599
But listen, allow me
to express my condolences

586
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,601
regarding your nephew.

587
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:23,169
This is me hanging up.

588
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,182
- I can tell you're upset.
- big fucking deal.

589
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:39,219
- what exactly happened this week?
- nothing.

590
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,958
You know, people walk around
like this is all something.

591
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,293
They'rfucking laughing

592
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,195
and nobody takes
even one second

593
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,064
to think about
what's really going on.

594
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:52,533
You sound
depressed again.

595
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,403
How can anybody not be?
You'd have to be fucking nuts

596
00:43:56,536 --> 00:43:58,338
not to be.

597
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:01,307
I mean, you'd have to have
your head wedged so far

598
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:03,309
up your ass that all
you could see

599
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:05,545
is your own stupid face.

600
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,480
What specifically
are you talking about?

601
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:11,151
I mean, everything
is so fucked up.

602
00:44:15,088 --> 00:44:17,924
Why can't we all
just get along?

603
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,800
You don't have to
chew it.

604
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:30,470
You just wash it down
like a pill.

605
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:41,468
it's the same principle
as the solar system.

606
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,478
no more bets.

607
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,082
- 24.
- yes.

608
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:58,752
Nice.

609
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:06,926
Press it all.

610
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:18,772
No more bets.

611
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:25,079
20.

612
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:28,715
Holy fucking shit.

613
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:37,891
Here.

614
00:47:37,957 --> 00:47:39,959
Much appreciated.

615
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:55,174
no more bets.

616
00:48:08,788 --> 00:48:11,124
24 again.

617
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:24,537
- he's dead.
- what?

618
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:26,606
What?

619
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:40,253
What?

620
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,205
I get it.

621
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:16,082
I get it!

622
