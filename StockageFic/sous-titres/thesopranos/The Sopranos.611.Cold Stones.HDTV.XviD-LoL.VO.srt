1
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,500
so every time i asked you "how's
work?" and you said "fine,"

2
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,967
you were having your own
private little joke on me?

3
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,300
what's going on?

4
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,101
i went to blockbuster today
to rent "cinderella man"

5
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,734
- and guess what?
- is it still a classic?

6
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>i found out
that our son-- the liar--</i>

7
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:51,134
<i>had been fired
three weeks ago.</i>

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
from blockbuster?
how the fuck do you do that?

9
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,034
they got rhesus monkeys
working as managers over there.

10
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,367
he was taking promotional items and
selling them-- posters, standups.

11
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,634
standees! this whole thing's bullshit.

12
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:04,233
most of that stuff gets
thrown out anyway.

13
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,367
<i>the store's policy
was very clear.</i>

14
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:08,901
well maybe i care
about the environment.

15
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:11,434
did that ever occur to you?
"wallace and gromit,"

16
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,934
i mean that weighed like 50 lbs. how
many trees gave their lives for that?

17
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:19,400
<i>- it just goes to the dump.
- can i come home to a peaceful house one goddamn night?</i>

18
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:23,168
you tell me to think like a businessman,
yet every time i do there's something wrong.

19
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,068
i made money promoting parties
in high school, that was no good.

20
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:29,001
- now this.
- you know what i think? all those days you go in late,

21
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,300
you call in sick,
you deserve to get canned.

22
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,734
<i>the worst part is you
don't even give a shit.</i>

23
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,400
what, i should care about blockbuster?
fucking religious fanatics!

24
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,200
<i>- i can't live on what they pay me anyway.
- why not?!</i>

25
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,867
you live at home!
we feed you!

26
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,634
you have a social life
but i can't?

27
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,434
<i>you have any idea what it costs
at a decent club in new york?</i>

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,200
it's $500 for a bottle of cristal,
and it's a two-bottle minimum.

29
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:55,068
you spend $1,000 a night on champagne?

30
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,667
no, not every night.

31
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:01,367
all right, barely ever.
and hernan, everybody--

32
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,333
we take turns
picking up the tab.

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,233
hernan. or the girl he crippled
when he flipped over the car?

34
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,233
is she there, drinking champagne
with you... in her wheelchair?

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
it wasn't his fault.

36
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,967
her parents are going for a big payday
because his dad was in "forbes" magazine.

37
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,001
oh god almighty!

38
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,967
if it makes you feel any better i've been
looking for a new job-- every day online!

39
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,934
oh jesus!
you can't even talk to her.

40
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,734
are you fucking kidding me?
you should be kissing her feet.

41
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,068
because when you were growing
up, if it wasn't for her,

42
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:31,500
i would have knocked all your
baby teeth out with one shot.

43
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:47,701
i can't sleep.

44
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,967
- a.j.
- somebody call?

45
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,467
it's not only that he's a
complete stranger to the truth,

46
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,034
he's got this dead streak in
him. it chills me to the bone.

47
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,567
he's fuckin' spoiled, that's
all. we gave him too much.

48
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:03,300
come on, he went to school
with lots of privileged kids.

49
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:06,934
most of them are off in ivy league
universities now, doing very well.

50
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,934
no, this is something in him. deep down
it's like this big "fuck you" to everything.

51
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,801
i don't know
what that's about.

52
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,034
remember that whole god-is-dead
business on the day of his confirmation?

53
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:20,267
- maybe he'll surprise us.
- aren't you the sunny optimist when you want to go to sleep?

54
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:29,001
- i saw the light was on. can i come in?
- sure, hon.

55
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,367
i'm going to california.
i don't know for how long.

56
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:40,667
- california? what are you talking about?
- finn took that year off.

57
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,333
and it was great when dad
was hurt-- he was here for me.

58
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,367
but now he's going back to dental
school, i want to be with him.

59
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,834
i thought you two
were having problems.

60
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,467
i never said that.

61
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:58,168
i don't know if i want to go
to law school or med school.

62
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,634
<i>those are nice
options to have.</i>

63
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,801
<i>that's what we call
a high-class problem.</i>

64
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,467
<i>his dad said
that he can get me</i>

65
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,701
<i>a lab job at ucla where
he teaches oral surgery.</i>

66
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,434
i mean if i decide
on med school

67
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,667
that will look really great
on my application.

68
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:14,434
<i>what you're really saying is you're
following this man to california.</i>

69
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:19,101
<i>meadow, you drop this bomb
on us at 1:30 in the morning--</i>

70
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:21,734
forgive us if we need
some time to adjust.

71
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:25,034
- i have to make plane reservations--
- you'll be back for christmas?

72
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:28,734
i don't know.
no pressure please, okay?

73
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:59,068
tidelands project--
your slice of no-shows--

74
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:01,734
i spoke to the union and we
can't make five work no more.

75
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:05,600
rollbacks, not to mention
my end's way down.

76
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,001
now more than ever i got
captains looking to me

77
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,901
to deliver them
those no-show jobs

78
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:14,068
- on account of the medical insurance.
- health care costs these days.

79
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,500
bitch all you want
about john, he understood

80
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,134
that ours is a
mutually-beneficial arrangement.

81
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,667
john's folding laundry
in fucking danbury.

82
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:24,367
it's on my shoulders
to take care of the family,

83
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,834
even if he's boss just in name.
now i made a decision,

84
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,600
and, with all due respect,
it's final.

85
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,267
you see, this is what i get. i never
should have let you slide on the vitamins.

86
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,367
again with the vitamins.

87
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:39,434
you told me there were 1500
cases of centrum on that truck.

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,567
when your nephew delivered it, there were
cartons ripped open, pills all over the floor.

89
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:46,600
anybody got shorted, it was
yours truly, but you know what--

90
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,300
all right, all right, all right,
put it back in your pocket.

91
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,667
but i gotta get some relief
on this other situation.

92
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:07,233
<i>for the supreme commander's
control over the sworn enemy's</i>

93
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,400
<i>capital city is the epitome
of their power in europe.</i>

94
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,367
i need to talk to you. remember i
told you about that trip to paris?

95
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:21,400
i won it at the silent
auction at the feast.

96
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:26,867
well, the date is here and
i think i would like to go.

97
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:32,367
you don't remember the first
goddamn thing about this, do you?

98
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,200
we stood right here talking
about it for 15 mites.

99
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,034
- i know, you won a trip to paris.
- why do you have to lie?

100
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,333
i'm not! you're always saying i'm lying.

101
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,034
- why paris?
- it is one of the great cities of the world.

102
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,667
but the frogs hate us.

103
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,567
- go to italy.
- they weren't auctioning a trip to italy.

104
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:57,600
it's actually a good deal.
it's a week for two for $5,000.

105
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,233
how's the euro doing?

106
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,467
i don't know, tony.

107
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:05,434
i had three years
of high-school french.

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,101
- i can't get away for a week, carm.
- i could go with ro.

109
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,867
we've been talking about taking
a trip together for years--

110
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,068
ever since our rome thing
went belly up.

111
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:17,967
oh yeah... when anthony walked
through the plate-glass door.

112
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,333
i could really use a
vacation now-- meadow leaving,

113
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,500
my spec house-- the thought of
tearing it down and starting over,

114
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,534
<i>- it makes me nauseous.
- yeah.</i>

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,034
<i>plus him. i just don't
know what to do anymore.</i>

116
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,734
you know what?
you should go.

117
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,600
you deserve it.

118
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,867
it'd be good for you too.
do whatever it is

119
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,734
that boys do when
they're on their own.

120
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,901
whatever.
i said go.

121
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,434
i'll be fine.

122
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,467
i'm so excited.
i'm gonna call ro.

123
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,168
oh, hey hey!
look.

124
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,001
tony. hey.

125
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:18,901
what the fuck?

126
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,634
my brother's over there.

127
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:30,168
- what's that supposed to mean?
- nothing. he's just there, that's all.

128
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,901
you sandbag me, i cut
your fucking throat open.

129
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,200
i'm sorry. i didn't
know what else to do.

130
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,801
i want back in.

131
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,967
- can i sit?
- no, you can't sit.

132
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:47,168
it was complicated.
i was working things out.

133
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,267
i'm sure it gets complicated when
you're taking it up your fag ass.

134
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,500
i'm not a fag.
i never was.

135
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,634
- excuse me?
- it was the medication i was on.

136
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,634
for my blood pressure.

137
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,834
it fucked with my head,
but i'm over that now.

138
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:01,801
i can probably get
a letter from my doctor.

139
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,233
a note from your doctor saying
you don't like to suck cock?

140
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,300
first off,

141
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,300
i pay my way back in.

142
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,333
i got 200k that goes
directly to you personally.

143
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
no one else
needs to know.

144
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:23,034
long term, i know
construction's out.

145
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:24,801
those guys--

146
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,834
but meth, running girls,

147
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,767
a lot more
tolerant atmosphere.

148
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,701
i got contacts in a.c.

149
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,701
<i>with your support
i could set myself up there.</i>

150
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,200
i'd be close
but not too close.

151
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:40,001
ton'!

152
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,901
please, don't turn
your back on me.

153
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:46,001
he was fucking
stalking you, t.

154
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,901
that's the thing
with the gays.

155
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:52,333
it's the living in the
closet, makes them devious.

156
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,367
<i>speaking of crystal meth,
look at this walyo.</i>

157
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,701
say what you will about
richie aprile,

158
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,767
but when he found out
his son was gay,

159
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:05,101
he did the right thing.
he disowned him.

160
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:07,434
i got an a.a. meeting.

161
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,767
alcoholics-fucking-anonymous
now too...

162
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:19,434
salvatore lucania must be
looking down on all of us

163
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,767
- with great pride.
- there's gonna be a lot of popular sentiment

164
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,600
to get rid of vito.
phil alone--

165
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,667
fuck phil!

166
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,901
you know what that's about? he's
gotta polish his rep as a tough prick

167
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,834
so he can make boss.
vito in atlantic city...

168
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,500
he's out there.
he's not part of us.

169
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,333
and we get, you know, a trickle
of cash coming in each month.

170
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,534
- you ready?
- oh, there's so much going on here,

171
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,567
just the thought of flying,
the heightened security...

172
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,134
come on.

173
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,567
i got something for you,
for your trip.

174
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,801
now this is the real
louis "vitoon."

175
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,801
you had a rough year--
me in the hospital,

176
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,867
you there
around the clock--

177
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:29,400
i want you
to enjoy yourself.

178
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,134
hmm?

179
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
when you were in that coma,
i told you i loved you.

180
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,300
- do you remember?
- no.

181
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,867
- i should tell you more often.
- well...

182
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,901
nobody's stopping ya.

183
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,333
okay, listen up, kids.

184
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,134
francesca, look at me.

185
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,434
you can't tell anyone,
even your friends at school,

186
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
that daddy's home

187
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,134
<i>- for a little while.
- are you gonna have to go back to afghanistan?</i>

188
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,400
the cia doesn't tell you
where they'll send you next.

189
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,801
is it dangerous
to be a spy?

190
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,333
not as long as nobody
knows who you are.

191
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,834
i'm what they call
"working deep cover."

192
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,434
that's why,
like i said,

193
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,001
- you gotta keep the secret.
- i won't tell.

194
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:31,101
- you better not!
- i won't!

195
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,267
i love you guys.

196
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,767
how long till you can
move back in with us?

197
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,101
just until i straighten
this shit out with tony.

198
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,200
it's looking good.

199
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,634
in a few days i'll know.

200
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,734
what about counseling
for your problem?

201
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,934
- have you talked to father macken?
- marie,

202
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,634
i thought i made it clear--
i don't have a problem.

203
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,567
that's over with.

204
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:06,567
in fact,

205
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,034
i'm seriously thinking
we should have another kid.

206
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:12,200
yo, dad, check it!

207
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:18,434
attaboy, v!

208
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,400
<i>hello?</i>

209
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,001
hi.

210
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,567
<i>fuck you.</i>

211
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:42,667
- i know, look--
- not a word, not a note.

212
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,934
- what kind of person are you?
- i'm sorry.

213
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,667
you ed help.
you're seriously fucked up.

214
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,834
i got kids.
i couldn't live without 'em.

215
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,134
<i>bullshit.</i>

216
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,001
it was the fucking life
you couldn't live without--

217
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,367
the gambling, the money,
who knows what else.

218
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,101
you're right. i didn't want to
drag you down into this pit i'm in.

219
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:07,400
hey, fuck that! everybody else
is stupid to you, aren't they?

220
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,801
<i>- no.
- you can throw your weight around down there</i>

221
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,134
in fucking jersey.
everybody kisses your ass.

222
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,500
<i>- i miss you.
- i don't want to know you.</i>

223
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,434
<i>i don't want to hear your
voice. don't ever call me again.</i>

224
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,801
do your bowels just
jam up when you fly?

225
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,600
hey-yyy!

226
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,068
<i>hopalong che-se-dic'.</i>

227
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,034
what do you know?
what do you say?

228
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,367
- how you been?
- word is you reached out to tony.

229
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,701
i appreciate you coming out
to see me. how you doin'?

230
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,967
nicole is choking my balls
with this child support.

231
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:30,534
i could be looking at
six months in county.

232
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
- oof!
- i was wondering if you could float me 20k at two points,

233
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:38,267
but maybe now is not
a good time for you.

234
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,200
no. no,
i could do that.

235
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,134
but i'm gonna have to say
two and a half.

236
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,233
okay. you know
i'm good for it.

237
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,267
would you stop?

238
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,434
heard on 1010-wins
the tunnel's a parking lot.

239
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,101
i hope you didn't
get caught in that.

240
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:11,834
<i>you said you were gonna take
care of that fucking finook.</i>

241
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:15,400
oh, for christ's sake. fucking vito
again? what the fuck is wrong with you?

242
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,500
he's in town, isn't he? i was
at marie's the other night.

243
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,333
she played the innocent, but
i could tell she'd seen him.

244
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,567
you're fucking carnac
the great now too, huh?

245
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,901
i gotta tell you, anthony,
if vito was here

246
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,168
- and you knew about it...
- fuck this.

247
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,834
i love they let you
smoke here.

248
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:42,300
i think i should have slept in a
while before hitting the stores.

249
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,534
i told you.

250
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,300
- is your stomach still upset?
- i put in the fucking memory stick.

251
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,134
i love that sound--
french.

252
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,801
it's so elegant.

253
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
isn't it?

254
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,534
nobody fucking knows us here,
ro. can you believe that?

255
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,567
all the guidebooks say you should
try and get on the local schedule.

256
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:14,867
- did you reset your watch?
- yes, napoleon. jesus.

257
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:19,434
eloise and abelard,
my god!

258
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,467
<i>what?</i>

259
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:25,233
i would say today the first
cultural stop should be the louvre.

260
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,068
again, remy!

261
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:29,034
<i>- how do you say "please"?
- s'il vous plait.</i>

262
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,867
<i>- s'il vous plait.
- and the check please.</i>

263
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,734
i don't know
what the fuck he said.

264
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:37,567
you keep talking english. why
don't you try and use your french?

265
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:40,200
i don't know.
i feel strange.

266
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:43,901
me and tony went to miami. he
knows like six words in spanish,

267
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:47,634
but he was right out there with them like he
was fucking ricardo montalban or something.

268
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,901
mmm.

269
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,233
<i>i told you we should
have gone towards rue dauphine.</i>

270
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,867
god damn it, where's my other glove?
i had it when we went in there.

271
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:03,534
- i'm all turned around.
- you had to hurry me out of that restaurant.

272
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,867
- we're miles from the louvre.
- fuck, damn it. i already lost a glove.

273
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,367
oh my god.

274
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,701
holy shit.

275
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:30,267
look at those clouds.
paris skies...

276
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,767
who could have built this?

277
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,367
look!
just like "charade"!

278
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:09,300
make sure you clean
that shit off her tit!

279
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:13,068
vito-- atlantic city,
forget it.

280
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:15,233
why the changeup?

281
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,967
i can't keep
fighting phil on this.

282
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:20,068
our businesses are
all entwined.

283
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:23,634
you gotta pick your battles. you want
your no-show jobs, vito's gotta go.

284
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,667
it's the right move, t.

285
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:31,233
all those weeks
in the hospital,

286
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,667
surgeries, constant pain, for what?

287
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,834
come out here and get shot
over something like this?

288
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,534
i'm sorry.

289
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,867
if vito wanted to pursue
that lifestyle,

290
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:44,267
he should have
done so quietly.

291
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,101
he was, wasn't he?

292
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,967
anyone in particular
you want to give this to?

293
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:55,934
carlo had the biggest problem
with it, let him handle it.

294
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,233
it's vito's own fault.
why couldn't he stay

295
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
wherever
the fuck he was?

296
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:07,634
don't beat yourself
up about this.

297
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:20,068
i'll tell carlo
to be at the mall.

298
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,267
<i>hi, it's me.</i>

299
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,068
<i>i just wanted to let you know
that we got in safe and sound.</i>

300
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,834
<i>call me back. remember,
it's six hours ahead.</i>

301
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,001
<i>miss you.</i>

302
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:51,333
i notice all these little plaques
all over-- what do they say?

303
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,333
<i>"august 20, 1944.</i>

304
00:21:58,034 --> 00:22:02,034
this man francois martine
fought in the resistance

305
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,567
and the germans shot him
right here on this spot."

306
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,600
<i>phil?</i>

307
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,233
what the fuck did that
tailor do to my zanella's?

308
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,801
<i>- what?
- my slacks, what!</i>

309
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,634
<i>he's losing his eyesight,
poveret'. diabetes.</i>

310
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,767
i'll take them to the korean
on my way to church tomorrow.

311
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:23,567
i've got a meeting
of concerned catholic mothers.

312
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,367
<i>tell you the truth,</i>

313
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,734
i almost want to not go
to the meeting.

314
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:31,567
- here we go.
- a gay in our own family?

315
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:35,168
this protestant minister from denver
is coming to speak to us tomorrow.

316
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,967
an expert.

317
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,734
i'm so embarrassed
in front of father.

318
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,767
father told me vito doesn't
renounce that lifestyle

319
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,901
- he's damned.
- i know.

320
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,200
<i>- what?
- i know.</i>

321
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:56,834
<i>father put it so well
last week.</i>

322
00:22:56,901 --> 00:23:00,267
- "there's nothing gay about hell," he said.
- that's good.

323
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,734
i'm sure he didn't
come up with that himself.

324
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,634
one thing i do know,

325
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,333
vito has to be made to face
his problem squarely.

326
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,967
<i>thanks for the ride.</i>

327
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:23,867
<i>new york's only

00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,233
you don't need to do that,
but you're sweet.

330
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,500
<i>okay.</i>

331
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:57,400
- yeah?
- i was just wondering if you thought about my offer.

332
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:00,934
yeah, i thought, and i need to know
who these atlantic city contacts are.

333
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:04,134
<i>meet me in the mall, 11:00.
don't be late.</i>

334
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,567
- get him up.
- no!

335
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:33,200
- come here, come here.
- shut up.

336
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,367
don't be moving.
stop.

337
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:57,068
you're a fucking disgrace.

338
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:38,967
...husband comes home with
a duck under his arm, he says,

339
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,034
"this is the pig
i've been fucking."

340
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:43,834
the wife says, "it's
not a pig, it's a duck."

341
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:46,767
- he says, "i wasn't
talking to you."

342
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:55,267
vito... he was found beat
to death this morning

343
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,967
<i>in a motel in fort lee.</i>

344
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:59,801
<i>- my cop up there told me.
- minchia.</i>

345
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,001
plus the homicide detectives
told him

346
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:04,101
vito had a pool cue
rammed up his ass.

347
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:30,001
- lover's quarrel maybe?
- look, we all know who did it.

348
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:32,767
phil! the fucking balls on that prick!

349
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,934
what did i always
say about him?

350
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:42,667
i see you
heard the news.

351
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:45,901
- that must have been phil, right?
- jimmy olsen over here.

352
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,967
i know he's out of line, but still,
you kind of have to admire the guy.

353
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:51,068
it's not all talk
with him.

354
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:57,967
i'm just saying he saved us
all a lot of trouble, right?

355
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:11,134
can't have been an easy
decision, killing a made guy, huh?

356
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,667
naturally phil won't brag
about it 'cause he can't.

357
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,767
phil was in a tough situation,
his family honor was stained.

358
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,767
if i got to vito first, net
result would have been the same.

359
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,467
fucking-a.

360
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:34,233
i wish i'd have
borrowed money from vito.

361
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:40,901
you know what
this is, right?

362
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,434
it's not about vito,
it's about me.

363
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,901
phil's saying he can do
whatever the fuck he wants,

364
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,101
including kill a
captain in my own family

365
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:50,434
and i can't do a fucking thing about it.

366
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,901
it's always been
partly about that.

367
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,934
believe me, the vitamins
are just the beginning.

368
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,534
it's carmela.

369
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:09,500
<i>- is paris burning?
- hi, you busy?</i>

370
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,967
no no, just bullshitting
with sil.

371
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:13,734
how's it goin'?

372
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,934
actually it's cold,
raining.

373
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:19,400
- when it drizzles, huh?
- you're worse than ro.

374
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:22,200
i'm going out of my mind
with these pop references.

375
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:25,567
i am seeing some
incredible things, tony.

376
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:28,434
<i>talk about the history channel,
you would love it here.</i>

377
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,801
<i>- how's the toast?
- the what?</i>

378
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:32,567
the french toast?

379
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,168
actually they call it
something else.

380
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,534
<i>- how's the french fries?
- pommes allumettes.</i>

381
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,634
<i>- fuck it.
- have you heard from meadow?</i>

382
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:42,333
<i>more than i thought.</i>

383
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,034
you realize this kid knows
how to do absolutely nothing?

384
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:48,001
she was asking if she needed to
get the car serviced regularly

385
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:50,434
'cause there's no snow
out there.

386
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,267
<i>- how's prince albert?
- he'd fit right in over in france.</i>

387
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,467
<i>none of those dipshits
want to work either.</i>

388
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,667
i did get him to hose down
the trash cans though.

389
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,300
<i>that's something.</i>

390
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,267
you're probably busy.
i'll let you go.

391
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,600
i just wanted to say hello.
i miss you.

392
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,767
i miss you too.
be careful, eh?

393
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,467
people are gonna
expect a response.

394
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:22,801
see, this is what the fuck
i was talking about.

395
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:26,634
- we hit one of phil's guys?
- joe bananas went after carlo gambino.

396
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,001
made guys got killed,
the war went seven years.

397
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,034
how many times
do i gotta say this?

398
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:33,567
when guys are on the mattresses,
they're not out earning.

399
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:36,267
so? what?

400
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,634
all phil cares about
is fucking money.

401
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,801
he's got that wire room
in sheepshead bay, right?

402
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,267
- our guys have seen it.
- yeah.

403
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,667
i live in las vegas
six months.

404
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:24,333
my friend has a restaurant.
i work there.

405
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,134
- i like u.s.a.
- and i like france.

406
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,333
ro, are you coming
or what?

407
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,034
<i>- okay, you call me, yeah?
- d'accord.</i>

408
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,267
he lives in belleville.

409
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,068
they've got a belleville
in france.

410
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,667
you're not really gonna
go out with him, are you?

411
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,034
- i mean he's like 26 years old.
- duh!

412
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,233
god, isn't this pretty?

413
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,400
<i>"1350 a.d."</i>

414
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,867
you realize some woman
just like us wore this?

415
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,767
she was probably married,
had children.

416
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:17,001
"gallo roman baths,

417
00:33:17,068 --> 00:33:18,801
third century."

418
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:21,300
i wonder what they
got up to there, huh?

419
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,134
this city is so old.

420
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,600
you think about all the
people who have lived here,

421
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,834
generation
after generation,

422
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:38,634
<i>hundreds and hundreds of
years, all those lives.</i>

423
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:41,267
god, it's so sad.

424
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,701
i mean, it isn't sad, i don't
know. it just makes you think,

425
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:48,200
- just makes you look at yourself differently.
- mmm.

426
00:33:57,233 --> 00:34:01,034
there was this one night in the hospital
when it was very touch-and-go with tony.

427
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,467
- mm-hmm. - he came out
of the coma for a minute

428
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,500
and he said, "who am i?
where am i going?"

429
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:10,801
at the time i didn't know
what he meant.

430
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,333
but coming here,

431
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,967
i feel the same way.
isn't that odd?

432
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:18,967
let me get a picture.

433
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:26,267
oh honey, what?

434
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,300
we worry so much.

435
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,934
sometimes it feels
like that's all we do,

436
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:33,801
but in the end it just
gets washed away.

437
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,667
all of it just--
just gets washed away.

438
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:40,200
come here. oh.

439
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,267
i know what
the papers are saying,

440
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:58,400
but the police think it might've
not have been a gay thing.

441
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,168
marie, honey,

442
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:04,500
they pick up strangers
in bars and truck stops.

443
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:07,934
the way they beat him--
oh god, his face.

444
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,667
he didn't even look like
a person anymore.

445
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,634
- you can't let
your mind dwell on--

446
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:17,001
turn that off!

447
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,834
aunt cel' hasn't called.
not even to talk to the kids.

448
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,967
how could people
be so cruel?

449
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,701
it is a sin
after all, marie.

450
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:32,801
the church is
very clear on that.

451
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,134
but you're here.
you came.

452
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,834
father always says
hate the sin,

453
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:40,667
love the sinner.

454
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:43,068
i wish i was dead.

455
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:46,034
i mean it,
i wish i was dead!

456
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:49,367
you know what? i'll make
the funeral arrangements.

457
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:52,068
you're in no condition.
given the circumstances,

458
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:55,534
a small private service,
just the immediate family.

459
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,667
he was a good man,
wasn't he, phil?

460
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:02,267
he was. i loved him
like a brother-in-law.

461
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,400
- but god moves
in strange ways.

462
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,434
our tailor, he's going
blind, 47 years old.

463
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,634
walk in those shoes.

464
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:20,400
and i gotta think, marie,
vito on some level--

465
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:23,634
maybe it's better for the kids
not to have that role model.

466
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,600
so...

467
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,667
all the women
in your house are gone.

468
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:49,634
how do you feel about carmela
taking a trip without you?

469
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,068
do we really have
to fucking talk about this?

470
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:54,600
of course not.

471
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:00,101
before we end, is there
anything you'd like to discuss?

472
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,168
okay.

473
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:14,834
how about the fact
that i hate my son?

474
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,101
i come home and he's
sitting on the computer

475
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:19,867
in his fucking
underwear.

476
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,101
wasting his time
in some chitchat room,

477
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:24,767
going back and forth
with some other fucking jerkoff,

478
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,734
giggling like
a little schoolgirl.

479
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:29,300
i want to fucking smash
his fucking face in.

480
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:34,034
my son.

481
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,134
what do you think
about that?

482
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:40,267
anthony, i think
your anger towards a.j.

483
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,134
has been building
for some time.

484
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,600
we have to deal
with this.

485
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,901
all i know is it's a good
thing my father's not alive,

486
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:51,367
- because he'd find this fucking hilarious.
- find what hilarious?

487
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:54,300
the kind of...
son i produced.

488
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,068
you mean because anthony
doesn't conform

489
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:59,734
to your father's idea
of what a man should be?

490
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:02,467
his, mine or anybody's.

491
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,400
let me tell you--

492
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:12,134
if carmela let me kick a.j.'s
ass like my father kicked my ass,

493
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,467
- he might have grown up with some balls.
- like you.

494
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,734
yeah, like me.

495
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:19,867
he might have
also grown up

496
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,801
taking out his anger

497
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,834
at his father's brutality
towards him on others.

498
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,400
he might have grown up
with a desperate need

499
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:29,267
to dominate and control.

500
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:34,667
anthony, we've been dancing
around this for years--

501
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:36,767
how you live.

502
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:44,600
what is it you want
fr your life?

503
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:54,434
i couldn't even hit him
if i wanted to,

504
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,134
he's so fucking little. it's
carmela's side of the family,

505
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,134
they're small people.
her father-- you could

506
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,134
knock him over
with a fucking feather.

507
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,233
okay.

508
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:08,068
but i have to point out

509
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:10,367
<i>what you resent carmela
doing for a.j.,</i>

510
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,034
protecting him
from his father,

511
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,934
is the very thing
you had often wished

512
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,767
your mother
had done for you.

513
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,300
i love this fois gras.
i can't get enough.

514
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,101
the presentation alone gives
you calories, but who cares?

515
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:31,333
we should feel guilty?
we walked our asses off.

516
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:41,734
man, you know
what's strange, ro?

517
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,434
when you go to a place you've
never been before, it's like...

518
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,300
all the people were
imaginary till you got there.

519
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,667
it's like until you saw
them, they never existed,

520
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:52,901
and you never
existed to them.

521
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:56,467
i don't know, maybe you're more
a philosophical person than i am.

522
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:58,233
no no, it just made
me think, that's all.

523
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,101
you know, it's the
same as when you die--

524
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:02,267
life goes on
without you.

525
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,134
like it does in paris
when we're not here.

526
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,367
tomorrow we hit
the stores.

527
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:11,034
<i>- chloe, dior.
- a kelly bag pour moi.</i>

528
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:18,367
bordeaux
is so delicious.

529
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:20,534
when we were
in st. eustache's

530
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,500
i noticed that
you lit two candles,

531
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:24,600
for jackie
and jackie jr., right?

532
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,168
you know we never really
talked about that.

533
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:30,300
- about what?
- about jackie jr.

534
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:33,200
what's there
to talk about?

535
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,667
madame.

536
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,168
oof, madonn'.

537
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:59,267
<i>- merci.
- oh boy!</i>

538
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,333
i didn't mean
to invade, ro.

539
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,200
<i>it's just--
i mean, we're friends.</i>

540
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:05,534
if there was anything
you wanted to share...

541
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,500
i mean, i-i cannot

542
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,168
begin to imagine
losing a son.

543
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,567
<i>jesus, carm.</i>

544
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:24,233
we're on vacation.
we're having a beautiful dinner.

545
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,701
why would you
bring this up?

546
00:41:28,101 --> 00:41:29,734
i didn't mean
to upset you, ro.

547
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,834
<i>i thought because we had
this time together--</i>

548
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,400
- it's fucking morbid, that's what it is.
- i'm sorry, ro.

549
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:39,300
he's dead.
he's gone.

550
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,467
what can i do about it?

551
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,367
light a candle.

552
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,701
i picture him
with his dad,

553
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:51,034
and with his grandma
who he loved

554
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:53,134
and with jesus.

555
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,967
what's the matter
with you?

556
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,068
why would you bring
new jersey here?

557
00:41:57,134 --> 00:42:00,567
- why can't we just have a good time?
- you're right, i apologize.

558
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:09,333
i'm going out
with michel tonight.

559
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,801
okay.

560
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:20,168
you know, you're welcome
to come, carm.

561
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,600
<i>- i mean that.
- thank you, but no. you go.</i>

562
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,634
i want to walk along
the seine one more time.

563
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:42,434
we gotta call the exterminator.
these are rat turds.

564
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,267
what time did patsy
and them say?

565
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,101
there they are!

566
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:49,534

son 13,

574
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:19,367
syracuse--
tanked again.

575
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,101
that pool cue--
i wonder if it was chalked.

576
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:29,467
very funny, dom.
very cute.

577
00:43:29,534 --> 00:43:32,600
i don't quite get it,
but cute.

578
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:35,500
hey, you know the autopsy found
a three ball in his side pocket?

579
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,667
- you're on a run.
- they found a hankie with carlo's lipstick

580
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:40,801
in his other pocket.

581
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:43,567
i'm just breaking balls.

582
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:46,834
you're right though--
shouldn't laugh about a tragedy.

583
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:55,300
that old homo actor--
raymond navarro?

584
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,867
he had an ivory dildo stuck
up his ass when they found him.

585
00:43:57,934 --> 00:44:00,867
pretty up on all this shit, huh, dom?

586
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:03,834
come to think of it,
he was from jersey too.

587
00:44:03,901 --> 00:44:06,701
<i>- what'd they find up your mother's cunt?

- my mistake.

589
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:11,267
