Get out
of the way.

2
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,541
Remember
to say please.

3
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,545
I can't
watch this again.

4
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,546
This is the dvd.

Eg.
This is
the advanced bootl

6
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,049
these are
the alternate takes.

7
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,552
What, are you gonna call coppola
with ideas on how to fix it?

8
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,554
I do not
believe this.

9
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,056
Ho!

10
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,558
Oh, c'mon.

11
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,563
The disk

12
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,564
You know what scene
i love most?

13
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,567
"It was you, fredo."

14
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,570
Ton', you gonna

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,571

Yeah.

17
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,573
That would be smart.

18
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,574
Fucking disk!

19
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,076
Somebody should tell
paramount pictures

20
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,577
to get their
shit together.

21
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,080
We're gonna be stealing
thousands more of these things.

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,083
So, how was junior
last time you saw him?

23
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,085
His life is about
motrin these days.

24
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,588
Ton', what's y
our favorite scene?

25
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,590
I can't have this
conversation again.

Okay if
my nephew comes in?

72
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,728
He's got some
questions for the doc

73
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,230
Of course.

74
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,731
The doctor will be
right with you.

75
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,734
Perhaps your nephew ca
n help you with your clothes.

76
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,244
You want
some help?

77
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,747

00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,757
So what do you
want to talk about?

82
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,758
Going over

83
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,760

Our friend, what's

88
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,769
What's he like?

89
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,271
Yeah.

90
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,772
I only met him
one time.

91
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,275

He came over on
"the michelangelo", 19

92
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,777

95
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,285
We had some bon voyage
party's on that boat.

00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,288
He's a serious man,
zi vittorio.

Heads up, sonny boy.

100
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,296
He don't listen to opera,
vittorio,

101
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,798
which is
a fucking break.

102
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,300
Isn't he like
a distant cousin of ours?

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,303
It's so far removed by now
tonto's a closer cousin to you.

104
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,806
We deal with him throu
gh a guy named furio giunta,

00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,808
he speaks english.

106
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,312
Going to italy, huh?

And we don't

00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,831
You got school.

112
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,333
What about mom?

113
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,335
She knows
it's a business trip.

114
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,338
Don't you think she might
like a little interlude,

115
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,839
just the
two of you?

116
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,342
You know when we'd like
a little interlude,
just the two of us?

117
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,343
Right now.

118
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,844
Not my idea to have me
set the table.

119
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,348
Carm, you want me
to help with the roast?

120
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,351
It's right there
on the counter.

121
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,353
Carm, it's
a business trip.

122
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,356
Okay? It is,
it's not worth the jet lag.

123
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,357
Did i
say anything?

124
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,858
God!

125
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,859

00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,376
You didn't.

132
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,378
It was football season.

133
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,880
Meadow, can you tell
your brother dinner's ready?

134
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,382
It's our
busiest months.

135
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,890
Junior's last shipment went
to naples two months ago.

136
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,394
30 containers,
two cars to a container.

137
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,896
Junior had to give the operation
over to who, specifically?

138
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,898
Ray curto.

139
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay,

There's something else
you should know.

141
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,405
They're talking like
the molitsanti kid
might get his button.

142
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,407
Tony, where's he a
t with junior these days?

143
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,409
They ain't
spoke in months.

144
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:56,909
Are you bein'
straight with me?

145
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,411
Oh, pussy!

00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,996
You come all the way
to a fucking party store

180
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,997

got to see you?

181
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,999

Was a long time.

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,021
Did he ever tell you
where he was?

187
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,022
Oh, he don't like
to worry me.

188
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,524
Not even
a card?

189
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,526
That's got
to be a worry.

190
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,027
It's horrible.

191
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,529
Anyway, you must
be so happy.

192
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,030
We're back
to our old routine.

193
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,034
Ah, i lo

194
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,035

00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,050
Que sera sera.

198
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,553
What will be

199
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,559
God, he's so handsome,
this guy too.

200
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,065
He's blind,
you know.

201
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,067
Jesus christ!

202
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,068
Angie.

203
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,572
My god. I'm sure
he's adjusted to it.

204
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,575
Christ, you fucking idiot,
rosalie!

205
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,578
I'm not happy
sal is back.

206
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,079
Angie!

207
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,581
I'm sad
and depressed.

208
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,084
I've thought
of killing myself.

209
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,091
Fucking nosy?
Eat your monigott'.

210
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,594
God forgive me.

211
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,598
When he did come home that day,
i was upstairs,

212
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,101
i heard the door
and then his voice,
"i'm home."

213
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,104
I fucking wanted
to vomit.

214
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,608
After all that worrying
he might be dead,

215
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,610
praying
he was okay.

216
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,613
My heart just sank,
i wished--

217
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,115
he had died.

218
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,117
Oh.

219
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:30,122
To just come and go
year after year like that.

220
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,124
How dare he!

221
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,126
Have you reached
out to him?

222
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,128
That's a good one.

223
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,632
Listen,

224
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,635
and i don't want
my kids to know this.

225
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,137
They found a lump
under my arm.

226
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,139
Oh my god.

227
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,141
They biopsed it, i get
the results in a couple days.

228
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,644
Anyway,
i told sal,

229
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,147
he said,"jesus christ",
kind of alarmed a little.

230
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,151
Then he went back
to doin' whatever
the fuck he was doin'.

231
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,654
Spraying wd- 40
on his pocket knife.

232
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,156
Hasn't asked me
how i am.

233
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:08,661
Touch my face, or something
when he comes in.

234
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,663
So angie, what
are you gonna do?

235
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:15,167
Benign, malignant,

The mother country.

Here, they
make it real.

239
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,207
Vesuvius, jesus,

240
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,210
that mural he spent
that money on

241
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,713
looks like a used trojan
compared to this?

242
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,214
You notice
the women?

243
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,216
Know what i realized
on the plane?

244
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,718
Even the skanks

Those were
my feelings too.

Gravy, gravy,

00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,169
Nino,

353
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,672
It effects everything

Come to our house,

I will personally give you
a tour of the...
surroundings area.

Where your
family's from.

00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,761
I don't want
to put you out.

371
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,765
No, you should have
been guest to our house.

372
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,767
But with my father

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,283
Can you stop fucking
interrupting me?

380
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,285
We've been offered

00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,290
I didn't have

384
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,802
It's just
a kid.

385
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,312
The kid only got
firecrackers on him.

386
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,844
We're gettin'
ready to eat.

387

00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,865

i don't need
your permission.

404
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,377
It's not permissio
n, it's just an idea.

405
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,379
You know what
? fine, i'll hang up.

406
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,882
Well if the trip
is as bland as
this phone call.

407
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,384
There's nothing
going on.

408
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,887
What do you want me
to say to you, seriously?

409
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,899
You better not say
what you saw, jimmy.

I shove that elvis shit
right up your ass.

in your mouth jimmy.

You're having
a nightmare.

416
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,435
I think it was the fuckin'
shrimp hors d'oeuvres
on the plane.

417
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,936
Get some immodium.

418
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,439
You want to get made
, this is no fucking way.

419
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,441
Tony wants us
to hang with nino,

00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,942
work out
the dock facilities.

421
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,944
I hope we get
some spare time.

422
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,946
I'm gonna see
that fuckin' volcano.

423
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,507
Oh, ho

424
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,552
Hey.

425
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,053
Hey.

00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,561
listen, i've bee
n to italy many times

428
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,563
and really, you're n
ot missing all that much.

429
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:15,066
The amount
of sexual harassment
that i was subjected to.

430
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,068
I went one tim
e with my friend zane.

431
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,070
Her, they
didn't bother,

432
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,072
me, they couldn't keep
their hands to themselves.

433
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,075
Much less the whistlin
g and the fucking hooting.

434
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,076
It's not italy.

435
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,079
Do you remember
angie bonpensiero?

436
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,082
Angie belfiore
married sal bonpensiero.

437
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,585
Right, she's thinking
of divorcing him.

438
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,586
Halle- fucking- lujeh!

439
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,588
Do you
know them?

440
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,590
No i don't know them
, but to be married
to a man like that.

441
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,091
A man
like what?

442
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,093
The'tude and the fucking
medieval outlook.

443
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,095
He is such an adoring
father though.

444
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,598
Three beautiful kids
they raised,

445
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,600
who are now from
a broken home.

446
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,102
Ilk
no sons i hope,
three more of his

447
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,604
we don't need.

448
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,605
He's very macho.

449
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,108
Macho, no, try
swaggering mama's boy,

450
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,109
fucking hypocrites,
shall we?

451
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,110
Hypocrites?

452
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,613
Carm, come on stop.
Just stop.

453
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,114
Is that how you
see your brother?

454
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,617
I thought we wer
e talking about angie.

455
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,120
I mean these o
. c. pricks especially,

456
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,624
with their goomahs
and their prostitutes,
emotional cripples.

457
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,628
And they expec
t their wives to live

458
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,630
like the fucking n
uns at mt. Carmel college.

459
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,131
It's not
that simple.

460
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,633
Of course not.

461
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,136
Madonna/whores is the full
equation i believe.

462
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:30,642
Clothes,
appliances, houses.

463
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,143
You are
talking about me.

464
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,645
About us.

465
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,646
No.
Carmella,

466
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:39,150
ow.
I don't kn

467
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,155
ce,
that a woman
of your intelligen

468
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,158
is content to ask so littl
e from life and from herself.

469
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,663
I don't know, it's none
of my business.

470
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,165
Marriage is
a holy sacrament.

471
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,667
Ay.
Ok

472
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,669
family is
a sacred institution.

473
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,671
Roger.

474
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,172
And you trying
to fan the flames

475
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,174
with richie aprile,
of all people?

476
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,676
Talk about
old school.

477
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,680
Carm, richie, because of h
is life experience in prison,

478
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,182
he has a sensitivity
to the plight of women.

479
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,684
Oh my god!

480
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,187
I am not even
gonna touch that one.

481
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,190
But you had me going
for a while there,
you really did.

482
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,193
Oh janice honey,
i got to love ya.

483
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,269
Nice shot.

484
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,238
I shank him.

485
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,741
It's
a man's club.

486
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,243
I'll send you
one your size.

487
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,245
Whole set.

488
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:21,753
So tony, you don't mind
me calling you tony?

489
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,757
What can
i do for you?

490
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,259
Well you can introduce
me to the boss.

491
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,761
You ca
n talk to me.

492
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,264
A fuckin'
woman boss?

493
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,767
So what
do you want?

494
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,769
Never happen
in the states.

495
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,771
Never.

496
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,272
Our men ki
ll each other.

497
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:47,779
All my brothers, for example,
they all got murdered.

498
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,781
Or they
go to prison.

499
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,783
Rome has a war
against us.

500
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,285
But our men are
in love to their mama.

501
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,789
So being a woman is not--
come se dic',

502
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,290
comes natural.

503
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,794
We'll i'll
be dipped in shit.

504
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,299
You go around like your
father's nursemaid.

505
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,301
I am my father's
nursemaid.

506
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,305
Well if an old man carries
the respect of troops,

507
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,807
you keep
him around.

508
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,809
I did something
like that myself.

509
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,310
We're cousins.

510
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:24,315
You hungry?

511
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,819
I could eat.

512
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,333
So, you wanted
to talk about business.

513
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,337
Can i ask
you a question?

514
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,841
We not gonna pay
the price on the mercedes.

515
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,844
Why do you save your
toenail clippings?

516
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,849
Why, you
want them?

517
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,857
Il,
if your enemy comes
into possession of your na

518
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,360
or your hair clippings,
they can make the evil on you.

519
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,864
I'm flattered you wouldn't
trust me with your toenails,

520
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,866
but can i pass without
ruining the moment?

521
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,869
I alread
y burned them.

522
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,370
Em.
Nobody gets th

523
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,897

A lot of guys today,
they come soft
living in america.

527
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,416
One in five guys,
they're a fucking rat.

528
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,921
You can't find anybody
over there that believes
in the old ways,

529
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,423
keeping silent,
putting the family first.

That way i get
guys with no ties
to anybody over there

00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,436
they belong only to me,
110 percent.

534
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,939

535
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,440

536
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:33,945
Well, you get an obvious
advantage to havin'
your guys in that end.

537
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,446
How much you
pay me for this man?

538
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,447
Pay you?

539
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,950
Your profitability
is gonna go way up.

540
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,453
What are
you thinking?

541
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,956
Furio to start.

542
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,458
Furio!

543
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,460
Back up,

u one of my best men.

And all i get is a bunch
of numbers in air.

546
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,967
With all due
respect,

547
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,468
i think you're being
a little short- sighted
on this.

548
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,971
He's my cousin,
he's one of my best men.

549
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,472
Forget about it,
it's not going
to happen.

550
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,473
I'm asking
you nice.

551
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:03,975

00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,477
Hey look, i don't even
think you understand.

So you have to fucking

Up your ass.

558
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,510
Oh, you're up.

559
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,012
Where's
my other belt?

560
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,013
You look
under the bed?

561
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,514
Fuck, yeah.

562
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,016

the doctor's office.

00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,519

569
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,089
I was
in the neighborhood.

570
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,091
That bachelor party,
they're looking
for some entertainment.

571
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,593
A sett',

Sure,

579
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,128
I have to ask.

580
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:42,133
What's it like,
working for a woman?

581
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,135

A woman boss!

00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,140
No.

585
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,142

Yeah, come
down to eat.

589
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,151
Jesus christ, is that
all your people do?

590
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,652
The lunch we had
would jam a wood chipper.

591
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,654
We need to finish
our business.

592
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,656
I said all
i'm gonna say.

593
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,162
Alright,
i'm coming down.

594

Cheers.

597
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,732
So what
is this place?

598
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,237
My father was born
in this house.

599
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,741
Later we m
ake the new one.

600
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,747
You're born here,
and your kids
are raised next door.

601
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:42,253
That's
a nice thing.

602
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,259
You take good care
of your father.

603
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,764
Do,

you going

604
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,767

605
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:12,783
Hey, listen...

606
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:28,299
this one has to stay
with until he goes
to sleep.

607
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,301
I'll take you
back in the morning.

608
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,311
Goodnight.

609
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,831
It was horrible
what he did.

610
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,833
I might as well
have fucking cancer.

611
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,838
So what did
the lawyer say today?

612
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,840
He said i have
a good case,
we're filing tuesday.

613
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,343
So your gonna take monda
y to think, that's good.

614
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,344
Monday's

615
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:14,845
Oh.

616
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:15,846
I'm finished
thinking.

617
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,349
Hell, i thought myself
into fuckin' nonexistence.

618
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,351
Well, you ar
e not nonexistent,

619
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,353

Not anymore,
it's what i see.

622
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,359
God gave me
more years, carmela.

623
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,862
This very morning
god gave me a gift,

624
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,864
and i will
use that gift.

625
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,366
I won't
waste it,

626
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,369
like i wasted
24 fucking years
with this man.

627
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,371
You know wha
t the church say
s about divorce.

628
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,374
Oh please, let
the pope live with him.

629
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,887
Well, what about
the kids?

630
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,390
Up.
They're 19, 21, and 24,
it's time we all grew

631
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,394
kevin is just
starting his sophomore
year at college.

632
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,396
Aren't you worried
he's gonna realize,

633
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,398
the two stayed together
waiting for him to leave?

634
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,899
Long as he don't
loose his privileges

635
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:09,900
at our house down
the shore,

636
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,402
that's all kevin
cares about.

637
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,904
He's so fond of his father,
that's all i'm saying.

638
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:18,909
And terry and scott
with the money problems,

639
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,411
and the pregnancy,

640
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,414
this is really the example
you want to set,

641
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,915
when your daughter
is struggling very hard

642
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,417
to keep her new marriage
in one piece?

643
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,419
Why you workin
' this hard, carmela?

644
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,920
Why?

645
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,922
For all of the reasons
i just said.

646
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:36,427
Because you're my friend,
i'm not even sayin' don't.

647
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,429
I'm just sayin'
at the very least,

648
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,431
you got to ask
yourself these questions.

649
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,934
Terri, they're not even sure
she's gonna be able

650
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,436
to have children
of her own.

651
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:49,940
Sal began to cry
when he heard that.

652
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,445
Oh, honey.

653
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,952
In the end, i know
you're not gonna leave him.

654
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,956
I know you
won't do that.

655
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,968
Commendatori

675
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:53,063
You know my grandfather
was napoletan',
gran- pappa mio.

676
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,566
He went to america
in 1910.

677
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,067
Three thousand
miles.

678
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:02,072
Un ragazzo, un piccolo bambino,
all by himself.

679
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:06,076
Yep, i'm napoletan'.

680

So, what part

685

00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,599
Ariani el pino

687
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,103
That's where

688

Ariani el pino, se'.

We come fr
om the same tow
n.

690
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,612
Our families probably
knew each other.

691
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,633
The island back there
is called progeda.

Show'em

In the olden tim
e the sibylla of cumae

696
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,656
was the second most
important oracle
after delphi.

697
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,158
I thought delphi
was in greece.

698
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,660
The gree
ks were here.

699
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,163
Way before the romans,
and before the greeks

700
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:37,167
there were somebody else,
and before them somebody else.

701
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:42,673
"The rulers would
come from across
the ancient world,

702
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,174
"to hear the sibyl's
predictions of the future.

703
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,678
She would sit inside
the cave inhaling gases."

704
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,180
I think
i dated this broad.

705
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,684
"Possibly volcanic
though no longer active,

706
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,686
"and would speak
in a voice not her own,

707
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,689
delivering unto them
their fates."

708
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,695
Let's go
into the cave.

709
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,213
The sibyl sat way back there,
see that shaft of light?

710
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,717
Some
fucking trip.

711
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:33,724
The sibyl were
very beautiful,
in most case.

712
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,727
Oh yeah, got
a premonition for me?

713
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:42,733
You, you're no
problem to read.

714
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,235
You are your
own worst enemy.

715
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,236
Oh, is that right?

716
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,740
Tell you right now
you remind me

717
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,742
of somebody
from back home.

718
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:56,246
Not your wife,
your girlfriend?

719
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,249
Oh, i got one,
to answer your question.

720
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:03,253
But no,
not her.

721
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,255
But, she's someone
you want to fuck.

722
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,760
I can tell.

723
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,262
Oh really.

724
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:17,768
You know, everybody's
their own worst enemy.

725
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,271
So maybe your
psychic power has been
overrated a little bit.

726
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,774
You don't want
to fuck her?

727
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,783
You don't want
to fuck me?

728
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,785
Yeah, i do.

729
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:38,789
But i don't shit
where i eat.

730
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,794
Que cosa?

731
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:47,297
Non fare
la merdo dove...

732
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:53,804
it's bad business,
we're in business.

733
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,809
Not at
those price.

734
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,310
Alright.

735
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,313
You give

736
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:08,819
and i'll work down
the price of the cars to 85.

737
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,828
Posto,

738
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,337
I get more guys,
on my timetable.

739
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,848
75 thousand.

740
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,851
Okay.

741
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,366
Hey, thanks!

742
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,368

I feel sorry for anyone
who hasn't been.

747
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,377
Especially
any italians.

748
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,879
Someday.

He's in the duty f
ree buying a gift for ade.

753
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,890
Four days, he's a block away
from the greatest shopping
district in the world.

754
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,391
Why the fuck didn't
he think of it then?

755
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,893
A broad.
