1
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,106
You are what you are
when you are who you are

2
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,664
You are what you are

3
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,602
You know what you are
when you are who you are

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,113
where you are

5
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,616
It's all about you

6
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,545
Oh, motherfucker.

7
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,115
Wow. Hey.

8
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,262
Look who's here.

9
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,226
Finally.

10
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,733
Look at her. Her own business now.

11
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,328
I've got some radio ties
to help with our Mondays and Tuesdays...

12
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,374
plus I'm thinking about
adding some contests later on.

13
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,610
Glenlivet, right, Ton'?

14
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,273
Just seltzer, dear.

15
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,346
Christopher here?

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,074
Is he supposed to be?

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,546
- You want me to call him?
- We're gonna sit down there.

18
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,022
VIP table's better!

19
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,033
Hello?

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,707
An FBI informant?

21
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,479
I must've been out of cell phone range.

22
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,021
Your accountant didn't reach you?

23
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,283
A. J. said he talked to you four hours ago.

24
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,021
Well, Ginsberg didn't call me.

25
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,254
I'm gonna fuck her face up before I kill her.

26
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,795
Look, I said I'll talk to him,
so I'll talk to him.

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,599
Cousin Brian is dropping
those estate papers off tomorrow.

28
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,497
Good, I'm anxious to look them over.

29
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,018
Let's give it up for No Soap Radio.

30
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,201
Was that a steamroller of a set?

31
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,139
Pick up one of the new CDs for sale
up at the front.

32
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,051
Come on, Giovanni.

33
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,186
Jesus Christ, he's pissing his pants.

34
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,184
You want me to do it again?

35
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,708
There you go. Looks pretty good!

36
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,252
Okay, that's great.

37
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,587
Let's bring out your lover.

38
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,719
The weight she put on in rehab....
How could she do that to herself?

39
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,494
She always had a bad can. It's genetic.

40
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,893
Hello?

41
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,903
Hey, Ma, what's up?

42
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,506
Adriana? You got a call.

43
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,940
Ma, hang on a sec.

44
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,507
- Hello?
- Adriana, it's me.

45
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,047
Why the fuck are you calling me here?

46
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,281
Don't hang up, because I'll just call back.

47
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,017
Ma, I'll call you later.

48
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,715
I know, Ma. Goddamn it,
I'll pick up the Sensodyne.

49
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,059
- Norman, I got to take this.
- Ade, I got a boliage at 11:00.

50
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,097
Are you following me?

51
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,794
We wanna talk to you. A&B Bakery...

52
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,530
route 10, East Hanover.

53
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,265
I got to drive all the way up there?

54
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,967
You don't want us talking to you
in your neighborhood.

55
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,034
And don't go anywhere.
We got a unit watching the beauty shop.

56
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,911
- I'm getting lights and a wax.
- We'll wait.

57
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,455
Janice, hi.

58
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,323
Listen, I can't stay.

59
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,490
I just brought Bobby Junior
a couple of Xbox games...

60
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,395
a friend of mine burned for him.

61
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,456
JoJo.

62
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,301
Hi. What are you doing here?

63
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,168
Janice, look at you.

64
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,208
I made Bobby and the kids
some of my chicken marsala.

65
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,273
It's times like this,
I remember when I lost Mikey.

66
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,077
It's impossible to think about food...

67
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,380
but like the President says:

68
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,283
"We have to keep going."

69
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,117
The family's got to eat.

70
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,181
I'm picking up the kids
after school, Bobby. No argument.

71
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,126
He's hanging in, though, aren't you, Bobby?

72
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,587
Leave those. The girl's coming today.

73
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,292
Then I better do these pots at least.

74
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,063
I've seen Rigoberta
with those copper tuffies.

75
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,229
What she's done to this Teflon.

76
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,669
Any time you want to drop Sophia
and little Bobby off, don't be shy.

77
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,678
I mean it. My kids would love it.

78
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,772
How is Michael Junior doing on the Ritalin?

79
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,518
The way they medicate kids today....

80
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,348
It's the answer for everything.

81
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,048
Then they wonder
why teenagers get hooked on drugs.

82
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,785
If a child had diabetes,
you'd give him insulin.

83
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,349
I didn't mean it like that.

84
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,190
Bobby's got to come home anyway.

85
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,890
Karen always made him
do his homework before dinner...

86
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,830
or it didn't get done.

87
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,440
The chicken, Bobby...

88
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,285
put it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes.
You just want to heat it.

89
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,781
And if you have some egg noodles....

90
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,722
It's better the first night.

91
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,087
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, JoJo.

92
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,372
Everybody's been so nice.

93
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,871
I'll bet.

94
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,378
Look at all these casseroles people brought.

95
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,515
Stuffed shells.

96
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,283
Gabriella.

97
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,590
Ziti.

98
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,454
Karen made that.

99
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,100
- I'm sorry.
- That's her last ziti before she died.

100
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,691
I didn't know.

101
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,301
I loved her so much.

102
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,442
I thank God for every day we had together.

103
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,538
- She was an angel.
- I know. She was special.

104
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,983
Miss La Cerva.

105
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,528
Agent Harris. We met.

106
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,692
This is agent Sanseverino.

107
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,763
Hi, Adriana.

108
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,702
Eat shit, Danielle.

109
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,266
Or whatever the fuck your name is.

110
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,008
Get you a latte? Scone?

111
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,540
I just want you people to leave me alone.
How many times I have to tell you?

112
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,979
I don't know anything.

113
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,614
You people are just trying to scare me.
Nobody's trying to hurt Christopher.

114
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,485
What was he doing in Yonkers last night?

115
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,783
What?

116
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,793
- I don't know.
- Somebody saw him having drinks...

117
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,160
at the Renaissance Inn
with an individual named Chip Zoto.

118
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,689
Christopher ever mention a Chip Zoto,
or just plain Chip?

119
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,558
No.

120
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,595
Here's what's problematic.

121
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,606
You don't even know
where your boyfriend is.

122
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,539
How do you know if he's in trouble?

123
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,237
He's into heroin, organized crime.

124
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,973
He's associating
with some very dangerous people...

125
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,345
not to mention Tony Soprano himself.

126
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,213
See, that's where you're wrong.

127
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,776
Tony would never let
anything happen to Christopher.

128
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,515
They're cousins, he loves him.

129
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,217
He loved Pussy Bonpensiero.
What happened to him?

130
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,453
He went in the Witness Protection program.

131
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,893
Dwight? He went into the program?

132
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,158
You know anything about that?

133
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,898
- No.
- I think we would've heard.

134
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,301
And your uncle Richie,
I suppose he's in the program, too.

135
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,665
He is.

136
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,567
Isn't he?

137
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:56,854
This is a way out for you.
You have your whole life in front of you.

138
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,322
We'd like to see you two have a chance.

139
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,848
Okay.

140
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,857
I'm gonna get back.

141
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,822
Where are you going?

142
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,594
You're gonna be working
with agent Sanseverino here.

143
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,657
What?

144
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,795
Why?

145
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,532
It's for your own safety.

146
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,437
And you know what we were talking about?

147
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,442
About the little creatures?

148
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,808
Good luck with that. I mean it.

149
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,971
Fuck you.

150
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,225
The more you can tell us,
the more we can help you and Christopher.

151
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,692
He doesn't need your help.

152
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,870
He can take care of himself.

153
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,136
You want some water?

154
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,365
How's Tony been lately?

155
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,311
I have no fucking idea. I told you already.

156
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,870
Been over to the house?

157
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,146
I don't go over there.

158
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,780
Hardly ever.

159
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,016
That should be your area of focus,
if possible.

160
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,922
I don't feel so good.

161
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,369
A little more salt?

162
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,839
No, it's delicious.

163
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,572
- Listen, I was talking to cousin Brian--
- I'm seeing Ginsberg tomorrow.

164
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,742
No, not that.

165
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,946
He gave me a free tip on a medical stock
that's gonna move soon.

166
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,216
He said we should put $10, 000 in it.

167
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,621
$10, 000?

168
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,052
It's not that much.

169
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,493
Right. It's not a meaningful investment.

170
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,888
That much of Dell Computer bought in 1989
is worth $5 million today.

171
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,698
We don't have
that kind of money on hand right now.

172
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,172
Things are tight.

173
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,269
Don't you read the papers? The economy?

174
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,213
It sounded like a wonderful opportunity.

175
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,781
What are you gonna do?

176
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,885
Waldorf- Astoria for horses back here.

177
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,391
Groom, trainer, three meals a day.

178
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,893
No, watch out for the goat, it butts.

179
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,657
My Nina Lento cooked goat.

180
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,221
What's it doing here?

181
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,528
Horses like company.

182
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,501
Seabiscuit had a horse he traveled with.

183
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,004
How do you like that?
You own a horse, Tony?

184
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,199
Please, as his accountant....

185
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,538
I thought about it a couple times...

186
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,175
but it's an animal, it's a commitment.

187
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,813
Don't tell me with the buck shins again?

188
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,680
No, she's fine. We had a great morning.

189
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,716
Jesus, that's a beautiful horse.

190
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,551
She'll be a bottle of LePage
if she don't win this race.

191
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,989
Bubbala, you want a sure thing? Buy bonds.

192
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,027
Lois is the best trainer here.

193
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,688
This ciuccio, he sells me a horse.

194
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,560
The next week it starts losing.

195
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,293
I don't know what got into her.

196
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,392
She ran the whole race ahead
by two lengths...

197
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,528
and then she just stopped
in the backstretch.

198
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,800
- Stopped?
- Slowed down, finished fourth.

199
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,866
- As in out of the money.
- Maybe you should try holding her back.

200
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,342
Keep something for the finish.

201
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,380
Horse is a front runner.
She likes running up front.

202
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,881
So, what if she don't win?

203
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,885
I have to agree with Lois here.
A horse has style, you don't fuck with it.

204
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,353
It's her kind of track today. Fast.

205
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,152
She did draw the one hole.

206
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,691
Done, said, finished.

207
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,661
Tony, all due respect,
I'm inclined to defer to the experts.

208
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,021
Me, too.

209
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,190
All right.

210
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,667
Wire to wire.

211
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,503
And tell that midget
not to be shy with the whip.

212
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,971
If only his mother had taken that advice.

213
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,806
That's what you're wearing to court?

214
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,848
- I'll get it.
- Now what?

215
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,080
It's your niece.

216
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,320
Morning, Uncle Jun'.

217
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,296
- Great tie.
- What's that?

218
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,923
Dinner tonight.
It's some delicious chicken marsala.

219
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,633
Murf, 350 oven for 20 minutes,
just so it's hot.

220
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,300
- And if you have some egg noodles--
- Go bring the car around.

221
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,070
Where you going?

222
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,477
- I'm getting my jacket.
- I'll bring it.

223
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,640
Go get the car, we're late.

224
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,617
I got to go upstairs,
get some change for the parking.

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,883
I've been meaning to get down to the court
to show my solidarity.

226
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,057
But this thing with Bobby....

227
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,060
- He needs help with those kids.
- He needs help?

228
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,330
- I'm on trial for my life.
- He's gonna get through this.

229
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,060
When? I'm waiting
like patience on a monument.

230
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,768
You really depend on him, don't you?

231
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,568
This one, he drives like a little old lady.

232
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,910
Gas, brake, gas, brake.

233
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,673
You know, I remember Daddy said...

234
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,549
that someday Bobby
would be your linchpin.

235
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,314
My brother said that?

236
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,793
Bobby was still a head waiter
when Johnny died.

237
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,658
Bobby's doing better.

238
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,522
We had a very healing day yesterday.

239
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,562
I helped him go through Karen's things
for Saint Vincent de Paul.

240
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,665
- Psychologically, that's enormous.
- Yesterday?

241
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,868
Bobby was home?

242
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,164
Why?

243
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,869
He had to take care
of something for me, that's why.

244
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,346
What was it?

245
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,507
Goddamn it.

246
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,353
Each of us is alone in the fucking universe.

247
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,823
So this estate planning shit...

248
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,989
Carmela wants it, and I got
nothing against getting well set up.

249
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,693
Half of these cidrules
live one day to the next.

250
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,566
The blue chip portfolio
like your cousin's suggesting...

251
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,537
to keep pace with inflation?

252
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,439
If it makes your wife happy, go with God.

253
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,211
I'm supposed to make the money,
she takes care of the house.

254
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,375
That's the way it should be.

255
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,586
Carmela's a smart woman.
If we start winning in the market...

256
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,555
it's gonna be Intel this
and Coca- Cola that. It'll never end.

257
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,821
This other thing your cousin advised...

258
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,127
the life insurance trust?

259
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,933
Big red flag.

260
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,570
What? The kid said
there was tremendous tax advantages.

261
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,868
To Carmela, when you die.

262
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,471
But present day,
if something unforeseen should arise...

263
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,234
divorce, say...

264
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,439
that type of trust is irrevocable.

265
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,377
It can't be changed. You have to
petition the court, and even then....

266
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,349
Don't get me wrong.

267
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,715
A trust, per se, is a good thing.

268
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,626
Avoids probate, prying eyes...

269
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,824
but there's other ways to go.

270
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,694
Such as an inter vivos, a living trust.

271
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,560
Here they go.

272
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,969
They're in the gate, and they're off.

273
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,105
- Come on, baby!
- Here we go.

274
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,071
Out of the gate, it's Vision Be Mine,
Miss Rae Rae and Zucker's Mother...

275
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,081
going for the lead.
Yeah Boy right there on the outside...

276
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,140
Pie- O- My settling into fifth.

277
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,047
Go, goddamn it, go!

278
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,679
- Come on, move up!
- Come on, baby, come on!

279
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,987
I hate this fucking pygmy.

280
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,620
What's he doing? Get her out of there!

281
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,685
Move her up!

282
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,028
Vision Be Mine following by a length,
Pie- O- My back two lengths....

283
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,624
No! I got $5, 000 on her.

284
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,329
She's gonna make it, here we go!

285
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,598
Come on, baby! Come on, girl!

286
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,664
Zucker's Mother, Miss Rae Rae,
Vision Be Mine, and Pie- O- My...

287
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,232
joins the front runners.

288
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,902
She's coming around!

289
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,504
- Jesus, look at her go!
- Making a move on the outside...

290
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,812
it's Pie- O- My, with a tremendous push,
with tremendous speed.

291
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,216
Come on, girl!

292
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,584
At the top of the stretch it's Pie- O- My...

293
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,646
challenging Zucker's Mother for the lead.

294
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,316
Pie- O- My and Zucker's Mother!

295
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,384
Pie- O- My and Zucker's Mother
as we head for home!

296
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,730
Pie- O- My pulling ahead....

297
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,499
Pie- O- My with speed to burn,
and it's Pie- O- My!

298
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,926
Pie- O- My coming from behind to win it!

299
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,938
Pie- O- My hits the wire first!

300
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,931
Son of a bitch!

301
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,474
I won! I'm rich!

302
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,014
$5, 000 at eight- to- one!

303
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,813
Heading for the winner's circle
is Pie- O- My, owned by Inez Munoz.

304
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,659
Who is that?

305
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,091
That's his girlfriend.

306
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,153
I'll give you a shot in the fucking head.
"My girlfriend."

307
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,893
It's his maid.

308
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,459
Right, the racing license.

309
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,400
Miss Munoz,
as the owner of the winning horse...

310
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,772
you'll receive an 8 x 10 glossy
in two to four weeks.

311
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,279
You, Anthony.

312
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,383
What did you say?"Hold her back."

313
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,515
You are not going unthanked.

314
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,615
You...

315
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,956
I'm giving a taste of my win.

316
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,661
Hey, Inez!

317
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,065
Come here, have some champagne.

318
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,499
Mr. Ralph, I don't know....

319
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,506
There he is.

320
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,139
I wanna congratulate you.

321
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,007
I asked, and she was there.

322
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,977
You know, not for nothing.

323
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,545
The horse won, but that was not
the agreed upon strategy.

324
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,017
Nicky didn't sit on it.

325
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,919
She was bumped out of the gate
and got stuck in a speed trap.

326
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,719
So this coming behind, this was a fluke?

327
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,322
This man here, he knew.

328
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,122
We all get lucky.

329
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,027
No, right is right, Anthony.

330
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,995
Fluke, escolar, whatever the fuck...

331
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,567
I'm giving you your taste.

332
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,968
- Your money's no good.
- I insist.

333
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,033
She ran your race.

334
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,274
You called it.

335
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,074
End of story.

336
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,544
$300, $400, $500, $600.

337
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,877
And I need $150 more this week
for A. J. 's football cleats.

338
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,212
- In my day, they were $50.
- $50?

339
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,485
That's what I pay to get your suits
out of the cleaners.

340
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,285
So you got those papers for me to sign?

341
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,661
- Brian's?
- I told you I'd talk to Ginsberg.

342
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,821
Got a pen?

343
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,391
Anthony Soprano, that is wonderful.

344
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,330
That's so great, I am so impressed.

345
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,913
"Authorization to open an account."

346
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,415
It's wherever there's a little red arrow.

347
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,449
And there.

348
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,213
You need to sign
the agency papers here, too.

349
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,883
It gives Brian authorization
to buy stocks on our behalf.

350
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,449
Where the little circles are here, initials?

351
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,519
You will not regret this, Tony, truly.

352
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,623
This is the best thing for all of us.
It'll give us such peace of mind.

353
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,370
Wait, there's one more.

354
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,966
I'm not gonna sign that one.

355
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,168
Why not?

356
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,639
I don't think it's a good idea.

357
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,172
But this is the trust.
It's in case something happens to you.

358
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,710
- I'm not gonna sign it.
- You have to.

359
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,449
Remember your children, your wife?
So they don't end up out on the street?

360
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,523
Yeah, well, there's better ones.

361
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,287
- "In vitro" something.
- What?

362
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,262
- What's wrong with this one?
- It's irrevocable.

363
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,958
- We don't wanna get locked in.
- To what?

364
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,129
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."

365
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,227
Excuse me?

366
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,795
It's the government, Carm.
You've got to be flexible.

367
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,171
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

368
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,343
Come on, Carm, be fair.

369
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,937
I gave you two out of three.

370
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,348
You gave me?

371
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,999
In here, hon.

372
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,569
What're you doing in bed?
We got dinner with Tony and Carmela.

373
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,043
I can't go.

374
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm sick.

375
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,945
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, I got chills and a fever.

376
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,211
I think I'm getting the flu.
I shouldn't go up there.

377
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,381
Come on, get dressed.
Couple of drinks, it'll kill the germs.

378
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,688
- You'll forget it all.
- You better go without me.

379
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,125
But you have to go.

380
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,358
This is the inner sanctum, here.
I'm not just a relative anymore.

381
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,129
You think Paulie and his cumares
ever get invited to dinner with them?

382
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,567
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,595
Maybe if I just sleep....

384
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,916
Nothing ever goes my way.

385
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,594
Is that sausage?

386
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,755
My mom made it with hamburger.

387
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,820
See?

388
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,335
Just a spoonful, Jan. That's enough, thanks.

389
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:38,701
Why don't you kids tell Daddy what we saw
on the way home from school today?

390
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,446
The Fuji blimp over Willowbrook Mall?

391
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:45,772
So?

392
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,382
You kids seemed to like it when you saw it.

393
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,813
You begged me to follow it.

394
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,158
It was nice of you to pick them up for me.

395
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,752
- And making dinner.
- Enjoy, everybody.

396
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,530
It does smell good, doesn't it?

397
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,430
- Did you eat yet?
- I'll get something at home.

398
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,730
No, it's all right, isn't it, kids?

399
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,810
Can we eat in front of the TV?

400
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,847
- That's rude.
- No, kids.

401
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,976
I'm the one barging in.

402
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,111
You go right in there.

403
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,948
You know how to set up the TV trays.
You want a little more?

404
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,689
- Okay. It's pretty good, actually.
- Thank you, Bobby.

405
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,262
I told you I don't want them to be spoiled
because they lost their mother.

406
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,970
I saw my uncle today.

407
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,375
- Jesus.
- That's right.

408
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,040
Is he mad?

409
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,484
What's going on, Bobby?
What were you supposed to do?

410
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,315
- Union business.
- What's going on?

411
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,018
This election coming up, that's all.

412
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,158
I'm the one that should've been in that car...

413
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,527
not Karen.

414
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,164
And Junior's been so good to me,
and I'm letting him down.

415
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,902
Fuck him!

416
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,633
He only thinks of himself, selfish old fuck.

417
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,368
Now listen to me.

418
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,137
I know my uncle, he's a patient man.

419
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,844
But he's at the point,
if you don't do your job...

420
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,373
he'll find somebody who will,
you know what I'm talking about?

421
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:32,122
All your effort, all the years you put in
getting your ticket punched...

422
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,258
you'll be a nobody.

423
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,424
I don't care anymore. That's the problem.

424
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,963
I don't care if I live or die.

425
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,890
We lose that luxury when we have children.

426
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,702
I remember my son Harpo,
when my husband left us...

427
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,035
I had both barrels of a shotgun
in my mouth...

428
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,171
but then just one thought of Harpo...

429
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,541
my little boy without his mother....

430
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,946
Every day is worse than the last.

431
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,586
My uncle loves you.

432
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,523
He needs you.

433
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,920
So you're going to get up
tomorrow morning...

434
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,399
and you're going to get dressed,
and you're going to get in that car...

435
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,268
and you're going to do
what needs to be done, aren't you?

436
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,317
Okay, then. Now will you eat something?

437
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,982
Show me one of those trusts,
the living ones.

438
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,086
Okay, I can see
where you'd want more mutability, Ton'.

439
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,996
Mutability mean money?
Because that's what I want.

440
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,200
Carmela's cousin, Brian Cammarata.
Ralphie Cifaretto.

441
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,365
- This is the life.
- What life's that?

442
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,501
I didn't mean--

443
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,136
I'm kidding, just kidding.
Any cousin of Tony's....

444
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,507
Lois, how's she look today?

445
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,311
Been clocking her best fractions yet, 21. 45.

446
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,547
She's in some rich company, though.
Zucker's Mother again.

447
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,146
And this other one,
frigging Kentucky thoroughbred.

448
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,056
You wanted a stakes horse,
this is a stakes race.

449
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,923
I think she's ready.

450
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,394
So, Dr. Dolittle, any thoughts?

451
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,989
Only six furlongs.
She should run it head- to- head.

452
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,264
Excuse me, senor,
if I'd listened to you last time....

453
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,930
She's right.

454
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,072
Short race like this, let her blow them away.

455
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,634
Foolish that I am...

456
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,878
I'm going to place some bets.

457
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,174
They're all in line, and they're off.

458
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,253
Look. The five horse bumped her.
You see that, piece of shit!

459
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,379
Come on, baby!

460
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,687
It's Zucker's Mother with Tenant's Harbor
to the inside in the lead.

461
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,718
Zucker's Mother, Lil' Camille, Pie- O- My
and Tenant's Harbor sprint for the lead.

462
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,957
- Run, goddamn it!
- Go!

463
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,660
Coming to the top,
Pie- O- My has the rail in the lead...

464
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,703
Pie- O- My ahead by two lengths as they--

465
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,670
Run, you fucking nag!

466
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,003
- Come on, Pie!
- Come on, baby, go!

467
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,234
She's pulling ahead!

468
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,140
Here comes Lil' Camille from the outside.

469
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,906
- Come on, Pie!
- Go!

470
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,344
He can't get you!

471
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,876
- She just can't beat Pie- O- My.
- Yeah, baby!

472
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,512
Pie- O- My hits the wire first, Lil' Camille
was second and Tenant's Harbor, third.

473
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,687
Beautiful!

474
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,849
Damn it, I bet to show.

475
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,164
What'd you win, $5? My financial advisor.

476
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,859
This is it. This is happiness.

477
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,993
Winning is one thing,
but when it's your horse, right?

478
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,162
Yeah.

479
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:42,210
Once again, your horse wisdom
is not going unappreciated.

480
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,219
Heading to the winner's circle is Pie- O- My.

481
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,254
Pie- O- My is owned by Inez Munoz...

482
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,798
and trained by Lois Pettit.

483
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,745
I see the flowers got here.

484
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,688
Which you like better,
the lilies or the roses?

485
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,171
I came into some cash.

486
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,811
Sold a property
down on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

487
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,646
It's okay, let's buy that stock.

488
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,518
It split. It's too late, we missed it.

489
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,371
You're Teddy Genaretti, aren't you?

490
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,433
The shop steward for local 184?

491
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,141
Guilty. You a joint fitter?

492
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,143
What can I get you?

493
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,346
Wild Turkey, neat.
I saw your Caravan in the lot.

494
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,716
It's a nice car for a family.

495
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,847
- Do I know you?
- Jim Blake.

496
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,090
What local you in?

497
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,955
Bad back.

498
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,758
I follow these things,
you know, with this election coming up.

499
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,991
Dick Hoffman for President?

500
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,070
I heard he's got 184's vote.
I think it's a mistake.

501
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,900
Pension's been ripped off
for the last 25 years.

502
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,840
I'm sure you guys got grievances,
but Dick Hoffman?

503
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,600
What do you owe this guy?

504
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,579
It's all talk.
He's out of touch with reality, Dick.

505
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,246
You think if push came to shove
he'd give a fuck about you?

506
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:44,185
- I know what you're trying to do.
- You look like a smart guy.

507
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,713
I can see why your local
puts their faith in you to do the right thing.

508
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,022
I'm just saying, if it was me....

509
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,220
I got kids that depend on me, like yourself.

510
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,299
And to waste my votes
on somebody like Dick Hoffman?

511
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,435
I might as well put a bullet in my head, here.

512
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,424
Affordable solutions
to all your fitness challenges.

513
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:29,262
Now, the Body by Jake design team
has used a remarkable new technology...

515
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,669
with the Body by Jake
Bun and Thigh Rocker...

516
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,265
the three minute hip,
thigh and bun machine.

517
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,301
So now you can quickly and easily
trim and tone the hips and thighs.

518
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,082
- What are you, up?
- Cosette, go to your basket.

519
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,323
- What's the matter with you?
- Because I'm glad to see you.

520
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,758
I worry about you staying out so late.

521
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,887
- Since when?
- You hungry?

522
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,488
- Want some scrambled eggs?
- Yeah, all right.

523
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,386
I'm thinking...

524
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,062
maybe we should try someplace else.

525
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,625
I saw this thing on TV,
a tour of this house in Santa Barbara...

526
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,694
you should've seen the flowers they had,
the ocean.

527
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,763
I was in California, I didn't like it.

528
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:47,607
I'm just saying, we're young.
We got our whole life in front of us.

529
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,212
Looks really nice out there. No snow.

530
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,077
You're burning the butter.

531
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,514
Let's be honest.

532
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,618
What's our future here?

533
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,053
You could end up in jail,
or something horrible could happen.

534
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,859
Fucking negative shit. Stop with that.

535
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,023
Somebody could have it in for you.

536
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,762
- Who?
- I don't know.

537
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,561
What kind of shit is this?
Who told you that?

538
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,628
Nobody.

539
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,231
Fucking negative shit
coming out of your mouth!

540
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,903
I had that fucking bird watching me
when I got made.

541
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,503
I'm already under
a what- do- you- call- it, possibly.

542
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,105
So stop with that.

543
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,416
I worry about you, that's all.

544
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,656
I love you so much.

545
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,290
So if you love me, stir my eggs, okay?

546
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,831
Excuse me.

547
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,071
Is Tony here?

548
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,404
All right, we'll wait in the office.

549
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,601
What can I get you?

550
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,508
Can I see a bar menu?

551
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,770
I'll take a CC- and- 7.

552
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,581
Nachos Grande and a Diet Coke.

553
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,414
Where's your office, in the back?

554
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,021
You should play Skynyrd.

555
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,158
Smells in here.

556
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,525
Mold.

557
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,562
Stuff can kill you, I read.

558
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,201
Fuck that.

559
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,042
What the fuck you think cheese is? Mold.

560
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,371
Holy!

561
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,439
You okay?

562
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,599
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

563
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,078
And I gotta rot in that courtroom.

564
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,642
I'll put the heat on under the gravy.

565
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,277
My daughter's coming over
to the house for dinner, so I gotta go.

566
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,553
The three men were arrested
in Germany last month.

567
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,760
Did we miss it, goddamn it?

568
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,963
In other news, in the Federal courthouse
in Newark, there were few surprises...

569
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,468
in the racketeering trial
of Corrado "Junior" Soprano.

570
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,696
The 72- year- old defendant listened
as government auditors detailed...

571
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,708
financial irregularities at Comley Trucking.

572
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,035
The prosecution outlined how accounting....

573
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,669
- What the fuck?
- What?

574
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,976
What kind of likeness is that?

575
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,279
If they were great artists,
they'd be in a museum.

576
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,221
I'm fucking fodder for cartoonists now?

577
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,921
You know, a little support
in the courtroom would be nice...

578
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,795
or are you still hanging crepe?

579
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,198
I took care of the thing, last night.

580
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,462
- The guy, you saw him?
- Him and 184 won't be a problem.

581
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,729
Good.

582
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,576
Hand me that weight over there.
The one in the middle.

583
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,550
Glad to see you're back
in the swing of things.

584
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,248
That moping around, you gotta
put it behind you, get on with your life.

585
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,018
That's what Janice said.

586
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,890
She's been wonderful through all this.

587
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:27,761
Looking after Bobby Junior and Sophia,
bringing dinner over the house.

588
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,566
- She's a pretty good cook.
- Since when?

589
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,795
Everybody steers clear of her food.

590
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,367
She made lasagna the other night, delicious.

591
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,173
With sweet sausage along with the beef.

592
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,574
- I thought Karen's was good, but--
- Sweet sausage?

593
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,540
In little pieces?

594
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,409
A layer of basil leaves
right underneath the cheese?

595
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,885
- That's right.
- That's Carmela's lasagna.

596
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,445
What the fuck are you talking about?

597
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,684
You always think the worst of everybody.

598
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,748
Fine.

599
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,591
Enjoy your lasagna.
Just don't come running to me.

600
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,287
Shit!

601
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,431
Go see if he's all right.

602
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,539
They were here until 1:00.
I couldn't even get into my office.

603
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,135
- This is a good thing, Adriana.
- Why?

604
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,981
They don't pay for nothing.
They ran up a $200 bar bill.

605
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,882
Overcharge some of those college students.

606
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:28,214
Ralph and them wanted to know
if Tony was here. Why, is he going to be?

607
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,385
You don't know what this guy did for me.

608
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,325
I do.

609
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:35,724
Not getting my stripes.
Something I can't talk about.

610
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,399
Something that was ruining my whole life,
and he made it right.

611
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,030
What I owe him,
I would follow that man into hell.

612
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,166
But why do they have to come here?
I don't understand.

613
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,142
This place isn't bugged.

614
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:51,671
The cops and the feds don't know about it.
Probably in time they will, until then--

615
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,683
Oh, shit.

616
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,658
They broke my fucking chair!

617
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,986
We're having Sunday dinner at Tony's,
and you're coming.

618
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,259
I don't care if your mother's dying.

619
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,669
Your honor, I introduce as evidence
government exhibit 27- B...

620
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,706
which is a stipulation between the parties
that, if called as a witness...

621
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:22,007
Koren W. Jonic,
supervisor of the US Post Office...

622
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,908
located at 8721 Wayland Avenue
in Paramus...

623
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:29,345
would testify
that post office box, number 206...

624
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,851
was registered to and paid for...

625
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,083
by one Ira E. Barad, who resides
at 43 Bellingham Boulevard...

626
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,027
apartment 4- B, Paramus, New Jersey...

627
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,121
and was initially rented by Ira E. Barad...

628
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,225
on September 16, 1998 with a payment of....

629
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,937
I don't care what your psychic said.

630
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,805
If a guy don't call back
within the first 48 hours....No, don't!

631
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,207
Don't call him, Ma.

632
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,905
Because I don't want to hear about it.

633
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,442
Fuck. Nothing, Ma, I gotta go.

634
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,708
I'll call you later, bye.

635
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,723
I can't stay. Christopher's waiting for me.

636
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,190
Just checking in, seeing how you're doing.

637
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,354
How I'm doing?
I can't even get my dog clipped anymore?

638
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,658
- Anything interesting going on?
- No.

639
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,432
Ralph Cifaretto was in your club.

640
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,033
Vito Spatafore, Gene Pontecorvo,
and Patsy Parisi.

641
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,503
It's the law. If they got shirts and shoes on,
I gotta serve them.

642
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,741
Ralph Cifaretto drove down to Philadelphia
last Thursday.

643
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,311
Had a couple of guys with him.

644
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,851
- You know who was in the car?
- No.

645
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,024
You ever heard the name Cogo...

646
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,260
Giovanni?

647
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,830
No.

648
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,594
Okay, look...

649
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,295
Patsy Parisi goes to White Plains
all the time. He gets these suits.

650
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,027
- Suits?
- Yeah, suits.

651
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,902
Some guy came in, and Patsy went out
and got him a bunch of suits.

652
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,169
Boss and stuff, half dozen, dozen.

653
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,711
From his car.

654
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,748
See? How hard was that?

655
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,288
Finally, the woman finds the Easy Off.

656
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:56,323
- Thanks for picking the kids up.
- No prob.

657
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,160
So, how about you, how was your day?

658
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,493
Good.

659
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,804
I knew it. See, I knew you would feel better.

660
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,604
- Did you make sure that my uncle knows?
- Yeah.

661
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,308
We should celebrate.
I'll make something nice for dinner.

662
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,613
No. I mean, we should go out.

663
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,111
- Vesuvio?
- Takes too long for them.

664
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,754
Kids like Chinese.

665
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,480
MSG.

666
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,325
I collapsed one time at the Hunan Palace,
complete blackout.

667
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,293
I'll just open a can of soup.

668
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,060
That's crazy.
There must be something I can heat up.

669
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,534
Really, Janice, you do too much already.

670
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,437
What about this?

671
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,370
Karen's ziti?

672
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,537
I'm not ready to eat that yet.

673
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,550
I understand.

674
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,086
Hold on a minute, hon.

675
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,490
Sorry.

676
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,700
What does that mean,"basically"?

677
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,143
He's laying out that kind of cash
to us every week.

678
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,374
He'll write a check to our shell companies,
we'll take the tax hit.

679
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,608
You got it.

680
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,546
How's our girl?

681
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,087
- Our girl?
- Yeah, she had a hot tendon.

682
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,158
You know, it's always something with her.

683
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,359
You should see the veterinarian bills.
Fucking racket.

684
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,403
Know what I think we should do,
if you don't mind my saying?

685
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,237
Switch her shoes to those titanium ones
that Heshie was telling me about.

686
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:47,675
They don't weigh anything.
So they're good for a tender hoof.

687
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,875
Sure. Why not?

688
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,587
Here you are, baby.

689
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,863
You don't have to answer it.

690
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,330
See who it is.

691
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,232
You want me to answer it?

692
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,139
Will you answer the fucking phone?

693
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,306
Hello, I need to speak with Mr. Ralph.

694
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,143
It's your maid.

695
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,610
What? She's gotta go to the clinic
again tomorrow?

696
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,482
You talk to her,
tell her to get her ass in here.

697
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,352
He isn't in.

698
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:36,256
Because the horse is very sick,
and he put the horse in my name...

699
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,453
and he say I won't get in no trouble.

700
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,497
The horse doctor won't do nothing...

701
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,761
because Mr. Ralph
don't pay the money he owes to him...

702
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:47,770
and the horse may to die,
and I don't know what is to do!

703
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,203
All right, wait.

704
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,235
Hold on.

705
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,269
Your horse is sick and the vet
won't do nothing till he's paid.

706
00:46:56,346 --> 00:47:00,442
These guys, no compassion
for the fucking animals whatsoever.

707
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,508
Maybe you better go down there.

708
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:09,090
Tell her to call 555- 0157.

709
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,969
At the outbreak
of the second great war in 1939...

710
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:33,676
Sir Winston again answered his country's
call as the First Lord of the Admiralty.

711
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,115
Churchill.

712
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,052
Remember you saw
that TV movie you liked about him?

713
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,731
Carmela, can you shut the door?

714
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,204
Carmela, can you please shut the door?

715
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,819
- The horse is sick. The lady, she--
- Who's this?

716
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,922
Mr. Ralph's housekeeper.

717
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:19,326
The horse is very sick, and she said to call,
because they needed--

718
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,727
Slow down.

719
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,890
The horse is sick, the Pie- O- My.

720
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,091
- How bad is it?
- They said she may to die.

721
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,831
The doctor,
he won't do nothing until he gets--

722
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,273
All right. Tell him I'll take care of it.

723
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,243
Son of a bitch.

724
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,608
I am now nearing the end of my journey.

725
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,145
I hope I still have some services to render.

726
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,084
But in 1955, the advance of time...

727
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:54,824
did to Churchill what dictators,
armies and war planes had failed to do.

728
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,263
He chose to surrender.

729
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,767
The Queen and husband
attended a formal dinner...

730
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,599
at the venerable statesman's residence
at 10 Downing Street.

731
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,867
Sir Winston had announced....

732
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,773
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go out.

733
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,107
It's raining.

734
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,911
Ralphie Cifaretto's horse is sick,
and they can't find him.

735
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,384
Somebody's gotta go down there
and pay the vet.

736
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,183
- Down where?
- The racetrack.

737
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,621
It's a racehorse?

738
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,421
So why do you have to go?

739
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,792
You bought a racehorse?

740
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,831
No, I didn't buy it.

741
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,935
- It followed you home?
- The horse is sick.

742
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,181
I told him you were coming with the money.

743
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:33,887
He finally gave her something
to settle her down, so I don't know.

744
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:37,166
- Will she be all right?
- At least she stopped thrashing.

745
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,863
That's where the danger is. The intestines
get twisted, and you have to cut.

746
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,269
They're finished as racers then.

747
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,140
You the vet?

748
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,038
I gave her a shot, she's quieted down.

749
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,914
Here. Here's your fucking money.

750
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,584
You better hope she's going to be all right.

751
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,495
Good girl.

752
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,530
That's a good girl.

753
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,834
Trust me.

754
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,140
Trust me. It's okay.

755
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,846
Good girl.

756
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,023
It's okay.

757
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,669
It's okay, I know.
