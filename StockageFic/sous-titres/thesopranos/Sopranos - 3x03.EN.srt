1
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,450
...that really
understands you people.

2
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,951
That really
frightensme.

3
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,453
Hey, while there hav
e been some turnover

4
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:44,954
in the elite teams
from last year,

5
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,457
one thing remains
consistent...

6
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:48,958
the eagles.

7
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,461
The cowboys have remained
fairly healthy this year...

8
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:53,463
c'mon, chrissy,
don't answer it.

9
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,464
You just got in.

10
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:56,466
I have to, it's
football season.

11
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,968
Oh, c'mon, there
is no game tonight.

12
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:00,970
Paulie, what's up?

13
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:04,474
I was making
cheese dogs for you.

14
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:05,975
Why, what's going on?

15
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,977
Okay.

16
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:09,979
Alright.

17
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,981
I'll be there.

18
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,484
Chrissy!

19
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,988
And plus, it was a
bitch getting off
of work tonight.

20
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,492
Shh, adriana, i think
this could be it.

21
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:23,493
What?

22
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:24,994
He told me
to look sharp

23
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,996
and meet him
at modells in
half an hour.

24
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,498
He told me to
shine my shoes.

25
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, my god.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,002
Christopher!

27
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:36,005
Find me a shirt an
d tie to go with this.

28
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,507
Not the camelia,
though.

29
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:39,008
Paulie's got one
just like it.

30
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,510
I can't believe it.

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,512
I mean, i knew it
would happen, but...

32
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:45,515
so, now, can we
get out of here?

33
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:48,518
You know, get a
big loft maybe.

34
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,520
You're giving
notice today.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,521
You wish.

36
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,027
The wife of a made
guy doesn't hostess.

37
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,530
I'm so proud
of you.

38
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,032
I love you,
christopher.

39
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,534
You better.

40
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,548
What?

41
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:21,050
I don't know.

42
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,052
You gettin
g called like this

43
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:25,054
and going off
all happy.

44
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,557
I'm worried,
that's all.

45
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:31,060
You seen too
many movies.

46
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,076
How you doing, kid?

47
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:49,078
No, no, no.

48
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,580
Ride up front.

49
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,081
Where we going?

50
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,084
You look good.

51
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,587
Shoot your cuffs.

52
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:07,096
Where we
going, sil'?

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,101
Oh, here he is.

54
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,105
So, this is it.

55
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,609
Alright!

56
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,113
He sat on on
e ass- cheek th
e whole way over.

57
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,617
Too many fucking
movies, that's
his problem.

58
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:30,119
Bullshit,
i sat funny.

59
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:33,122
Alright,
let's get
started, c'mon.

60
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,131
Alright, finish
up over there.

61
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,634
You know w
hy we're here.

62
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,636
So, if you got any
doubts or reservations,

63
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,638
now is the time
to say so.

64
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,640
No one'll thin
k any less of you.

65
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,643
'Cause once you
enter this family,

66
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:57,146
there's no
getting out.

67
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:59,148
This family comes
before everything else.

68
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,150
Everything.

69
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,652
Before your wife

70
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,654
and your children and
your mother and your father.

71
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:07,657
It's a thing of honor.

72
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,659
Then god forbid
if you get sick

73
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,160
or something happens
and you can't earn,

74
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:12,662
we'll take
care of you,

75
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,164
'cause that's
part of it.

76
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:18,167
If you got a problem,
you just gotta let
somebody know.

77
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,169
This man right here.

78
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,672
He's lik
e your father.

79
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:27,176
It doesn't matter if
it's with somebody here

80
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:28,678
or on the outside.

81
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:32,181
You bring it to him,
he'll solve it.

82
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:36,686
You stay within
the family.

83
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,690
Alright,
give me your hand.

84
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,714
Okay.

85
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:07,717
That's saint peter,
my family saint.

86
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,719
Now, as that card burns,
so may your soul burn in hell

87
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,221
if you betray your
friends in the family.

88
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:19,228
Now rub your hands
together like this
and repeat after me.

89
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,731
May i burn in hell

90
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:23,232
may i burn in hell

91
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,234
if i betray my friends.

92
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,737
If i betray my friends.

93
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,743
Congratulations.

94
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:40,249
Welcome to
the family.

95
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:41,751
Thank you, paulie.

96
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,271
My fucking heart's
still pounding.

97
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,774
You been doing really
good this year with
the sports book.

98
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,275
Yeah, it's been good.

99
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,778
I'm gonna give
it to you, my
boy, it's yours.

100
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,781
I was wondering
what it was gonnabe.

101
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,783
You're a
made guy now.

102
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:16,285
It's your turn to
make some real money

103
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,787
and i get to
relax a little.

104
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:20,289
Your only problem
in life now is

105
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,793
you give me 10
points of your take
every settle- up day.

106
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,795
Other than that,
you got no problem.

107
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,797
My only
problem in life,

108
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,800
i gotta kick my points
to that man over there.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,804
And onward goes
this thing of ours.

110
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,806
When you think of
all the headaches

111
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:38,808
most human beings
have in life,

112
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:41,811
ours are all boiled
down to only one.

113
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,312
Not a bad deal, huh?

114
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:44,313
You got it.

115
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,315
Only thing,

116
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:47,817
there's a six g
minimum every week.

117
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,319
I gotta get something
out of this.

118
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,823
But six grand, that could
be a lot or a little.

119
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:57,326
Depends on you and
how much you grow
the business.

120
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:59,328
I love you, paulie.

121
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,330
We're in it
together now.

122
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,333
I love you too, kid.

123
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,841
Anything on the
riverfront esplanade
project in newark?

124
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,342
My guy on the
state assembly,

125
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:14,844
he says the matching
funds are this close.

126
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,345
The development agency...

127
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:18,848
they added plans
for a city of newark

128
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,850
museum of science
and trucking.

129
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,852
More cement,
more everything.

130
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,355
Answer the
fucking thing.

131
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:29,859
So, you
feeling okay?

132
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,862
You mean about
my mother.

133
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:34,363
Well...

134
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:35,865
what are you
gonna do?

135
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,367
You pick up the pieces
and you go on.

136
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:39,368
I meant your spells.

137
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,370
They're not spells.

138
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,372
How do you know about
that the fuck over
there in new york?

139
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:44,874
Everybody knows.

140
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:46,876
There's nothing to
be ashamed of, tony.

141
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,378
For chrissakes,
julius caesar
was an epileptic.

142
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,380
I'm not an epileptic.

143
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,382
Whatever it is, you gott
a take care of yourself.

144
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:54,884
It's your health.

145
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,886
Is the psychiatrist
helping?

146
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:57,887
Oh, you know
about that too.

147
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,388
So, what?

148
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:00,389
There's no stigmata
these days.

149
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,891
My kid saw a shrink.

150
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,393
He got court- ordered for
that thing with his wife.

151
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,896
They're very happy now.

152
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:08,898
Whatever happened
to privacy?

153
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:11,901
Our family's been
doing our jersey business

154
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,402
a long time
with the sopranos

155
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,905
in a peaceful
and profitable way.

156
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,406
And i want to
keep it like that.

157
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,409
Take care of thi
s for me, okay?

158
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,410
Alright, carmine.

159
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:22,912
Why fuck around?

160
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,413
Be a better friend
to yourself.

161
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:25,915
I will.

162
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,918
I appreciate your
concern, really.

163
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,427
Jane was determined to
bust into the business,

164
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:39,929
so to speak.

165
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,931
Hollywood folklore has i
t that she picked up the phone

166
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,432
and called paramount
pictures and said,

167
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,935
"my name's jane
mansfield and i wanna
be a movie star."

168
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:48,437
Nowadays you'd
get a dial tone,

169
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:49,939
but back in 1954...

170
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:53,442
you got a phone call
from some young kid.

171
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,444
Drew,

172
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,946
wanted to know when
you were coming home.

173
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,447
How'd he sound?

174
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,950
Like he was about
15- years- old.

175
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,954
Wait, is that your
so- called fiance?

176
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:08,958
He's 19 actually and
he can go all night.

177
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,461
When are you going back
to seattle, janice?

178
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:16,966
It depends on how long
it takes to settle
ma's estate.

179
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,968
...take a look at
how jane mansfield...

180
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:20,970
"estate."

181
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,974
A falling down
house and some
old lady underwear.

182
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,977
Sad, isn't it?
What it all
comes down to.

183
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,979
Janice, you know
how much we love you.

184
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,481
And you know how much
we love having you around.

185
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:35,985
But there's a whole
big house over there.

186
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:39,488
And i know you want
maximum value.

187
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,490
So, maybe for
security reasons

188
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,993
or so it don't
fall into disrepair,

189
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,494
you could stay there.

190
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:47,496
I've been thinking
the same thing.

191
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:51,000
I just don't want
to push svetlana out.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,001
Yeah, well,
i talked to her.

193
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,003
She's moving out tomorrow,
maybe the next day.

194
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:57,006
Really.

195
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,507
Yeah.

196
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,009
Great.

197
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,015
I better go pack.

198
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,041
Jesus christ.

199
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,043
Lemme come around.

200
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,544
How you doin'?

201
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,548
Congratulations.

202
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:40,549
Thank you.

203
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,552
Hector, large
old blue eyes for
this gentleman.

204
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,054
Soft drinks
of choice.

205
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,555
Look.

206
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,562
Take away tony soprano
, he's a zero with shoes.

207
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,564
Yeah, but he's
wearing a stripe now.

208
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,565
My uncle richie was--

209
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,067
yeah, but
he never did.

210
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:10,579
Chris, my propers.

211
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,081
Dino.

212
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,582
Hey, benny.

213
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,089
Congratulations.

214
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,591
When'd you
get out, benny?

215
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:23,592
D. A. Tossed it.

216
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:24,593
The witness bailed.

217
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:27,096
So, jackie
, how's rutgers?

218
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:28,597
Fuck that.

219
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,598
I'm dropping out.

220
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:32,101
C'mon, boola, boola.

221
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,603
We were just
talking about
our former alma mater.

222
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:38,607
They got the coffee house,
it's a pure cash operation.

223
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,609
And the beauty
part is...

224
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,611
i mean, who's
gonna stop you?

225
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,114
Kids?
Campus security?

226
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,116
What are you telling
him about that?

227
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,617
That's ours.

228
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,123
Watch where the fuck
you're going!

229
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,125
Kiss my ass!

230
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,126
Hey!

231
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,128
Take that
shit outside!

232
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,629
Don't disrespect
the pizza parlor!

233
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,131
Fucking asshole!

234
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,132
I know where
you live!

235
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:05,634
You hear
what i said?

236
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,640
Yo, it was good
talking to you, chris.

237
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,142
Keep dino in mind.

238
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,643
I don't want to sound
like an asshole,

239
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:17,646
but i really can't
be seen in a place
like this anymore.

240
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,159
Alright.

241
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,662
This has gotta start
showing results or end.

242
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:36,165
Now, i talked
to a business
associate of mine,

243
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,667
a man i respect, about
these panic attacks.

244
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:39,668
Enough fucking around.

245
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,670
Enough money
in your pocket.

246
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,173
What's the story here?

247
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,178
The latest thought
on treatment of panic
attack syndrome

248
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,180
is a three- pronged
approach.

249
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,681
So, it's a syndrome?

250
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,683
Medication to
treat the depression,

251
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:56,185
psychotherapy,

252
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,188
and cognitive
behavioral therapy.

253
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,690
We've got
you on medication.

254
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,193
If you feel you're ready
, you could see a behaviorist.

255
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:07,696
What do you mean?
Talk to somebody else?

256
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,199
You seem unhappy
with my approach.

257
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:15,204
If you're really ready
to commit to mental health,

258
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,705
i say, great.

259
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,209
Let's get going,
i'm ready to help.

260
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,712
But we'll have t
o delve deeper, focus.

261
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,717
This latest incident
for starters.

262
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:32,221
Alright, fine.

263
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,227
My daughter
brought home a black.

264
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,730
They were on the
couch watching tv,

265
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,232
snuggling.

266
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,737
And?

267
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:51,740
And...

268
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,242
she went upstairs

269
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,744
and i had a
frank conversation
with buckwheat.

270
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:59,248
I told him to stay the fuck
away from my daughter.

271
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:02,751
And she came downstairs
and they left.

272
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,755
And then you
had the attack.

273
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,257
Well, no,
not right then.

274
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,758
I...

275
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,760
went into the kitchen
to fix a sandwich,

276
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,262
i opened the cabinet,

277
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:16,265
i saw a box of
uncle ben's rice.

278
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,266
Boom.

279
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:20,269
I see, the
rice logo.

280
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,771
The first onset of
hyperventilation,

281
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:25,274
that occurred upon
seeing the rice?

282
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,776
Umm...

283
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,781
no, no, i was
taking the cappicola

284
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,283
and shit out
of the'fridge.

285
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,286
I'm thinking whe
n you first came here,

286
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,289
the panic attack
with ducks.

287
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:44,293
As i remember it you wer
e grilling meat, weren't you?

288
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:46,795
The memory on you.

289
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,297
Sausages,
wasn't it?

290
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:49,798
Sausages.

291
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:51,300
Steaks, yep.

292
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,301
Wow.

293
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,303
Let's get back to
that cappicola.

294
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:57,806
I gotta take that.

295
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,808
It's my busy season.

296
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:03,812
Yeah.

297
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:07,316
50?

298
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,817
That's pretty rich
for one game.

299
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,821
If he's good for
it, take it.

300
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,324
But keep me posted
on duke- wake forest.

301
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,326
Alright.

302
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:23,832
Sorry.

303
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,835
Where were we?

304
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:31,340
The connection
between your anxiety
attacks and meat.

305
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,341
Right.

306
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:36,345
What was it again?

307
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,849
Closing ohio state guys,
they're kicking off.

308
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,351
Who do you like, iowa?

309
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:45,354
Fuck if it makes
a difference, as
long as it pays out.

310
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,357
Chris, fuck,
oregon vs. U. S. C.?

311
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:51,860
I told you we
should have laid off
some of that action.

312
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,362
Spread's 11.

313
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:54,863
Oregon's down by 12.

314
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:57,366
They're on the 45 yard
line with no timeouts.

315
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,868
Oregon's got an
all- american fucking
field goal kicker.

316
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,371
Why didn't
somebody tell me?

317
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,873
See?

318
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,875
...and it's good!

319
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,378
A 43- yarder!

320
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,881
U. S. C. , that spread
could've opened at 18,

321
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,383
fucking top 10 team!

322
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:15,384
Even so, we should've
laid off some of the action

323
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,386
to philadelphia.

324
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:17,886
Paulie did it
all the time.

325
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,389
You see him here?

326
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,392
What's the matter
with you people,
you deaf?

327
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:25,894
Answer the
fucking phones!

328
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,400
Minor setback,
that's all.

329
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,401
Oh, yeah?

330
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:34,903
Frost is on
the pumpkin, huh?

331
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:36,405
It's supposed to
warm up again.

332
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,407
Good football
weather.

333
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,910
Mom said to
tell you she's
waiting for the meat.

334
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,912
Did jackie jr.
Show yet?

335
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:44,913
I don't know.

336
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,415
Little fuck.

337
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,916
He promised his mother
he'd be here.

338
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,419
Watch your languag
e in front of my kid.

339
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,423
Probably keeping
the booth warm
at the o. F. ,

340
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,425
him and
dino zerilli.

341
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,432
What's jackie jr.
Hanging out with
that mortadella?

342
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,934
I'm promised his old man
i'd try to keep him
out of this shit.

343
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:06,935
He's the heir apparent.

344
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,437
No, no,
not this kid.

345
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:09,938
Do me a favor.

346
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,940
You watch out
for jackie, okay?

347
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,942
You oughta turn
that one link there.

348
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,448
Little setback, huh?

349
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,453
Ro, the kid's late,
he's being rude.

350
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:25,954
He should be
set straight.

351
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:28,457
He'll be here,
i paged him.

352
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,459
Honey, the poor kid
lost his dad.

353
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,960
I lost min
e when i was six.

354
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,963
You know, ralph
had to drop out
in the 11th grade

355
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,465
to raise his
brothers and sisters.

356
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,966
You'd never
know it.

357
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,969
I'm satan
to this kid.

358
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,473
That's because
i'm in love
with his mom.

359
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:45,974
What are w
e talking about?

360
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,476
Hey, a. J.

361
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,478
Cheerleaders,
any hotties, huh?

362
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,981
There's no cheerleaders
for freshman ball.

363
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:57,486
These are mario batali's
stringbeans with parmesan.

364
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,994
You are very late,
young man.

365
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:06,995
It's me.

366
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,497
Meadow, hi, babe.

367
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,498
Who is it?

368
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:10,499
It's meadow.

369
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:11,500
What are
you doing?

370
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,501
Nothing.

371
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,502
What's going
on there?

372
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,003
Well, sunday dinner.

373
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,505
Yeah.

374
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:19,007
You want to talk to
your father, he's outside?

375
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,509
Burning a cross?

376
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,511
Well, i'm not sure i kno
w what you're driving at,

377
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:25,013
but i know that no
w is not the proper time.

378
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:26,515
Here, your brother
wants to talk to you.

379
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,016
No, i don't.

380
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,020
Hello.

381
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,021
Hi, what's up?

382
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:34,523
Everybody's here,

383
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,525
is that jackie?
It's really boring.

384
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:39,528
No, it's not him,
it's meadow from school.

385
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,031
Hold on,
call waiting.

386
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:44,533
Hello?

387
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:45,534
My mother there?

388
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,035
Yeah, one minute.

389
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,537
Aunt ro.

390
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:50,539
Yeah, i gotta go.

391
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,542
Thank you.

392
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,044
Jackie,
where are you?

393
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:57,045
I can't make it.

394
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:00,048
We're all waiting,
you promised.

395
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:01,049
Fuck it.

396
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:12,060
The way he
talks to me.

397
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,064
You know what? I'll
bring it up to tony.

398
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,350
Maybe he'll sit him down
for a heart- to- heart.

399
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,082
Paulie.

400
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:45,093
What time is it?

401
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,095
That's almost
all of it.

402
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:50,599
Warren probably told you
about oregon- u. S. C.

403
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,103
This is unacceptable.

404
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,606
There's $4, 0
00 there, paulie.

405
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,107
I'll have the other two
in a couple of days.

406
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,109
I thought i made
myself clear.

407
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,110
Fucking college ball.

408
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,113
But i learned
a valuable lesson.

409
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:09,618
I'm not runnin
g a school here, kid.

410
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:12,621
Paulie, this is me,
you know i'm good for it.

411
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,123
Don't fucking drag
in our friendship.

412
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,625
This isn't about that.

413
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,126
You work for me.

414
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:19,127
Yeah, and i want to--

415
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,629
just shut your mouth
and listen!

416
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,130
I'm gonna give you
a couple of extra days.

417
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,132
But it's gonna cost
you another two g's

418
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:26,635
as a reminder
not to fuck it up.

419
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:28,637
I make myself clear?

420
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:31,640
And don't give me
the malocch'.

421
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,142
I'm not the on
e with the short bag.

422
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,154
Abast'.

423
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:48,657
Any word from
your ivy leaguer?

424
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,659
And how's carm
with the empty nest?

425
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,160
What empty?

426
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,162
Every five minutes,
meadow's home with
a laundry bag

427
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,664
or she's hauling
food out.

428
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,165
All that talk
about berkeley,

429
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,167
she barely made it over
the george washington bridge.

430
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,669
We created too nice
a home life for them.

431
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,671
They don't want to go
out in the world.

432
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:06,174
But, if they're closer to
then we were with our parents.

433
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,175
That such
a bad thing?

434
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,185
What time is it?

435
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:18,687
I'm here,
aren't i?

436
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,189
Out of respect
to my father.

437
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:22,691
I gotta make
two phone calls.

438
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,193
Sit down.

439
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,703
You want
something to eat?

440
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:37,706
Not hungry.

441
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:40,208
That's too bad, i
said lunch meeting.

442
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,211
You want a drink?

443
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,721
Lose the glasses.

444
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,228
I'm gonna say
a few things.

445
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:03,231
And i'm gonna say
some bad words.

446
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,734
And you're just gonna
have to deal with it.

447
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:08,737
Now, i know what
you're thinking.

448
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,739
You're thinking
i clipped your uncle.

449
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:13,241
On the one hand, you'd be
a shithead to believe me

450
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,243
when i told you
i didn't do it.

451
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,746
But i didn't.

452
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,249
And i got some
bad news for you.

453
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:23,251
Look at me.

454
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:25,754
Look at me.

455
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:30,258
Your uncle
was a rat.

456
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,760
No fucking way!

457
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,761
Sit down.

458
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,262
Sit down, sit
the fuck down.

459
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:42,270
Your uncle
was a rat.

460
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,773
And now, he's
in the witness
protection program.

461
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:46,274
That's my father's brother
you're talking about.

462
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:51,279
Jackie, i'm a member
of your family almost.

463
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,283
You think i'm the
only one that knows
this about richie?

464
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:57,786
You ask anybody.

465
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,288
This hurt all of us.

466
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:11,299
Jesus christ.

467
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,302
Your dad and me,
you know how
close we were?

468
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:18,306
He never wanted
this for you.

469
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:21,309
He wanted you
to be a doctor.

470
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,812
Give me a
fucking break.

471
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,313
Let me tell
you something.

472
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:27,315
Besides the money,
which there's
a shitload of.

473
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,818
A doctor's a very
powerful position.

474
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:31,319
I'm no doctor.

475
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,321
You know how hard you ha
ve to work to get your m. D.?

476
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,824
How many years
it takes?

477
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:38,326
I was even thinking
maybe osteopathy.

478
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,829
But i don't think i ha
ve the grades for that even.

479
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,831
You're not gonna drop out
of rutgers, are you?

480
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,833
No.

481
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:48,336
But those fucking prem
ed courses almost killedme.

482
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,839
I only did it
'cause my dad was sick.

483
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,842
You should know he never
wanted this life for you.

484
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:56,845
And i'll tell
you something.

485
00:24:56,845 --> 00:25:00,849
I don't want it
for my son either.

486
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,352
C'mon!

487
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:05,854
Let's go, i want to
see you hit'em!

488
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:08,857
Get off the ba
ll, get off the ball!

489
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:11,359
What is this, girls?

490
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,865
Fourth and three
and this chedrool's
going for it?

491
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,867
With that
offensive line?

492
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,369
Why's my kid still
sitting on the bench?

493
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,872
Coach goodwi
n will let him in.

494
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:24,873
Freshman rules.

495
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,875
They all get to
play one quarter.

496
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:27,876
Pucillo,

497
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,377
in for sposato.

498
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:32,380
Pucillo played already,
put my kid in!

499
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,883
C'mon, let's go!

500
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:36,885
It's the rules.

501
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,390
See, i told you
they wouldn't make it.

502
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,893
Are you fucking
crazy, ref?

503
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:47,395
Are you fucking
crazy, what?

504
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:49,397
What did you say?

505
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:51,399
No, come here
and say that to me!

506
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,401
Romano, the
periodontist.

507
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:56,905
I get my hands on you, i'll
rip your fucking heart out!

508
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:58,907
Look, anthony's
goin' in.

509
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:00,909
Anthon
y, do it!

510
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,912
Stick'em!

511
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:05,914
Okay, defense,
41 stack.

512
00:26:06,414 --> 00:26:07,916
Stick'em, baby!

513
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,417
Swallow'em up!

514
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,419
Do it!

515
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:14,422
Fumble!

516
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:15,924
Fumble!

517
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:20,929
Everybod
y up, get up.

518
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:32,440
Red ball!

519
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,942
Yeah!

520
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:49,457
Yeah, it's a. J.!

521
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:50,959
Yeah!

522
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,961
Yeah, good job, a. J.!

523
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:53,962
Good j
ob, good job!

524
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,463
Yeah!

525
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:57,465
Hey, hey!

526
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:59,467
That's my son.

527
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:05,974
You got a nose for the ball
and that can't be taught.

528
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,475
Oh.

529
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,477
The defensive lineman,
you gotta have leverage

530
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:10,979
and you go
tta have footwork.

531
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:13,982
I remember staying
after practice every day

532
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,984
hitting that
sled till my
shoulder was raw.

533
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:18,486
But then you gotta

So, i'm gonna

535
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:21,990

536
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,992
I just want
to go home.

537
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:26,995
You should be riding
high after what yo
u did on the field today.

538
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:27,996
C'mon!

539
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,498
Want to play
some nintendo?

540
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:32,000
You and me?

541
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,501
When are you gonna
throw that freaking thing

542
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:35,003
out the freaking
window?

543
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:36,504
Why?

544
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,507
Alright,
play nintendo.

545
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,512
Okay, let's go
to stewart's.

546
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,014
Yeah?

547
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:47,015
Yeah.

548
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,027
Yeah.

549
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,029
I need you home,
tony, for dinner.

550
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,031
Now?

551
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:03,531
It's our
busiest season.

552
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:05,033
I know.

553
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:07,035
But it's very
important with
meadow gone

554
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:09,037
that we not turn
into a family

555
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:10,538
who eats standing
up at the counter.

556
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,041
Alright,
i'll be there.

557
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:17,045
Pass the
potatoes,
please?

558
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,548
Anthony.

559
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,050
The potatoes?

560
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,053
Sorry.

561
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:26,554
Every night.

562
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:31,059
Go ahead,
pour yourself
another glass.

563
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,062
You need good
bones for those
open field tackles.

564
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:38,566
So...

565
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,568
how was everybody's
day today?

566
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,570
Busy.

567
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,576
So,

568
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:51,079
nana was asking me
today where you might
want to go to college.

569
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,580
I don't know.

570
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:53,581
West point.

571
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:55,583
West point?

572
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,584
Yeah, that's what
you said.

573
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,585
No, i didn't.

574
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:58,586
Yeah, you did.

575
00:28:58,586 --> 00:28:59,587
You were sittin'
right there.

576
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:01,089
You said either
harvard or west point.

577
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:02,590
No way i'd ever
have said that.

578
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:04,092
I could never get in.

579
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:12,600
Can we eat
with the tv on?

580
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,602
No.

581
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:21,109
I gotta take that,
it's my busy season.

582
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,112
Yeah.

583
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,114
Mom there?

584
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,116
Hey, how are you?

585
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:30,118
Is mom there?

586
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,120
Yeah, she's here.

587
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,621
How's school?

588
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:35,123
Fine.

589
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,125
Is- mom- there?

590
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,630
Is that meadow?
Can i talk?

591
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,132
Yeah, you can
have her.

592
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:47,635
Hello?

593
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:50,138
Did you hear what happened
to bobby capobianco?

594
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:06,654
I feel bad
taking your old room.

595
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:08,156
Oh, don't worry
about it.

596
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,657
You're all settled
in there.

597
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:11,659
You could sleep in
your mother's room.

598
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,661
Pass.

599
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,163
Won't be for long.

600
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:18,666
Bill's children going to liv
with their mother end of week.

601
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,669
I go and stay
with him.

602
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,675
A few days
is not a problem.

603
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,677
I'm glad i can
help you out.

604
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:31,679
And god knows my
brother used to sleep

605
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,681
like a fucking
dead man in there.

606
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,686
I'm sorry about how
i behaved at the cemetery.

607
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,688
Janice?

608
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:43,191
I cannot give
records back.

609
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,692
I wish you'd
reconsider.

610
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:46,694
I know livia
left no will.

611
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,198
But possession
is 910ths of law.

612
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,700
Let's not descend
into that.

613
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,703
Feeling in me is...

614
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:58,706
she's not
here to ask.

615
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:00,208
I know,
i'm sorry.

616
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,709
Just, um...

617
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,711
this is an emotional
issue for me.

618
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,214
I thought that if we had
the chance to talk one on one,

619
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:08,216
i could make
you understand

620
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:11,719
how much those records
mean to me.

621
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,722
Just promise m
e you'll sleep on it.

622
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:38,746
It was that bird!

623
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,249
It was that fuckin
g bird in the window!

624
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,751
It was a coincidence!

625
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:46,254
I was making good jack
at that betting parlor!

626
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:47,755
I was in the
fucking zone!

627
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:49,257
Now everything
turns to shit?

628
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:52,760
The bird thing is
if it's in the house
flapping around.

629
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,263
And that's death,
not bad luck.

630
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:56,264
Will your mother
loan me the money?

631
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:58,266
She's still paying
for her hysterectomy.

632
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:01,269
Where's that fucking
tennis bracelet i got you?

633
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,770
Why don't you get
rid of that stupid
fucking range rover

634
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,272
which you shouldn't
have even bought

635
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:05,273
if you couldn't
afford it.

636
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:06,774
Ow!

637
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:09,277
I'm sorry.

638
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,781
Jesus fucking christ.

639
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,812
Janice!

640
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:46,814
Janice!

641
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:47,815
Janice!

642
00:32:57,325 --> 00:32:58,326
Janice!

643
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:00,828
Janice!

644
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:21,849
Hello.

645
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:28,356
What the fuck is
this, dollar bills?

646
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:29,857
You owe me
300 bucks.

647
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:31,859
I ain't usin',
i ain't usin', chris--

648
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:35,863
that's it,
i want my money!

649
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,865
I want my money!

650
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:39,867
Motherfucker.

651
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,391
Janice call yet?

652
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,393
No.

653
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:10,898
Hello, tony.

654
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:13,901
How have you been?

655
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,403
What is
she doing here?

656
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:18,906
She brings
old leg.

657
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,409
Piece of shit
made in russia.

658
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,413
I have lost weight
, cannot wear it no more.

659
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:28,916
Only an hour and
it starts to hurt.

660
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,419
I'm getting
married, did
you know?

661
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:32,920
You told me.

662
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,423
Wish you
all the best.

663
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:39,927
She put
into my sprite
three halcyons.

664
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:42,430
I miss you
so much, tony.

665
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,932
Why don't we just
stick to the
subject here?

666
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:46,434
Your cousin's
missing a leg.

00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:48,436
$20, 000.

668
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,938

Kenneth cole.

673
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:04,452
You don't even want to
talk to me anymore.

674
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:08,456
I don't see why we
can't be friends.

675
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:09,957
You know what?

676
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,959
I don't even know
what i'm doing here.

677
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,961
Except you worked
it this way.

678
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:17,465
We could've talked about
this leg thing on the phone.

679
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:18,966
I'm sorry, tony.

680
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:20,468
It's not your fault.

681
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:23,471
Look, i'm sorry
about your leg.

682

Cappicola, chops, and a
beautiful standing roast.

714
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,520
You gonna
back talk me now?

715
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,521
Junior, get hi
m over here.

716
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,025
Wait, please,
what are you gonna do?

717
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,534
Anthony, what did
i fucking tell you?

718
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,542
What, your father never
cut off anybody's pinky?

719
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,048
That's traumatic
for anyone to witness,

720
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,550
much less
an 11- year- old.

721
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,052
Actually, it wasn't.

722
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,057
It was a rush, if you want
to know the truth.

723
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,060
You want me
to delve.

724
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,063
Go on.

725
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,579
Dinner's ready.

726
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,586
Come here.

727
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:46,090
C'mon, i want
to talk to you.

728
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,102
What you seen
today, anthony...

729
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,604
a very sad thing.

730
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,107
You disobeyed
your old man.

731
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,608
I ought to
give you the belt.

732
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,612
But i gotta say...

733
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:14,118
a lot of boys your
age would've run
like a little girl.

734
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,120
But you stayed.

735
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,125
I know you lik
e mr. Satriale,
we all do.

736
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,127
He's a lovely man.

737
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,130
The man
is a gambler.

738
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,133
He got over
his head in debt.

739
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,635
He owed me money
and he refused to pay.

740
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,139
He avoided me.

741
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:40,144
That's why you sho
uld never gamble, anthony.

742
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,649
What was i
supposed to do?

743
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,152
That's my livelihood.

744
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,155
It's how i put food
on the table.

745
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:57,161
You should never
gamble, anthony.

746
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,663
Johnny, dinner's ready!

747
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,664
Anthony!

748
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,167
Janice, turn
that off!

749
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,670
Let this be a
lesson to you.

750
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,175
A man hono
rs his debts.

751
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,682
What a beautiful
cut he sent.

752
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,186
You like it
standing with the
bone in, huh, lee?

753
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,188
Look at those juices.

754
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,210
Go wayne newton.

755
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,226
Can i have
the end piece?

756
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,729
Johnny, let's eat
while it's still hot.

757
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,732
You bet, baby.

758
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,736
Lady loves her meat.

759
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,753
Four stitches,
ruined dinner.

760
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,256
This was your
first panic attack?

761
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,257
Fainted.

762
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,259
That's what my
old man called it.

763
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,262
Obviously, we finally
touched on something here.

764
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,765
What you
witnessed that day,

765
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,767
where the meat
came from,

766
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,770
and your mother's
great pleasure init.

767
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,772
It was the only time
you could count on her

768
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,274
being in a good mood.

769
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,775
When the weekly
meat delivery

770
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,277
from satriale's showed
up at the house.

771
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,779
Or fusco,
the vegetable man,

772
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,281
maybe.

773
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,783
Probably the only time
the old man got laid.

774
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,286
Probably.

775
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,287
Pretty sick, huh?

776
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,789
Getting turned on
by free cold cuts.

777
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,791
Do you think that
your mother questioned

778
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,793
why the meat was free?

779
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,796
The meat that was going into
her children's mouths?

780
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,798
I don't know.

781
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,800
I don't want to know.

782
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,802
I don't even want to fuckin'
think about any of this shit.

783
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,306
I'm sure it was too much
for you then, too.

784
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,808
That's why you
short- circuited.

785
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,310
Puberty.

786
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,814
Witnessing not only your
mother and father's sexuality,

787
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:35,319
but also the violence
and blood so closely connected

788
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,821
to the food you
were about to eat.

789
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,325
And also, the thought
that someday

790
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,828
you might be called up
on to bring home the bacon...

791
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,831
like your father.

792
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,833
All this from a
slice of cappicola?

793
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,337
Kind of like
proust's madeleines.

794
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,339
What?

795
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,843
Marcel proust wrot
e a seven- volume classic,

796
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,346
"remembrance
of things past".

797
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,349
He took a bite
of a madeleine.

798
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,351
It's a kind of
a tea cookie

799
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,353
he used to hav
e when he was a child.

800
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:14,358
And that one bite unleashed
a tide of memories

801
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,360
of his childhood

802
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,363
and ultimately of
his entire life.

803
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,365
This sounds very gay.

804
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,866
I hope you're
not saying that.

805
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,868
No!

806
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,871
Understandin
g root causes

807
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,375
will make you less vulnerable
to future episodes.

808
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,378
My fucking head
is swimming here.

809
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,381
We're gonna
have to stop.

810
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,384
It's a lot to process.

811
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,886
But we've made
real progress today.

812
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,888
Good work.

813
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,891
I'd really like
you to write down

814
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,895
any thoughts
or associations.

815
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,899
See the left tackle
? see how he fakes inside,

816
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,901
then he crosses ov
er with his right leg,

817
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,903
so he gets
a spin move
on the guy.

818
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,905
He's in the
backfield charging t
he quarterback, you see?

819
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,907
I thought the
tail- back had it.

820
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,410
You gotta keep
your eye on the
ball, a. J. , the ball.

821
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,911
That's what
it's all about.

822
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,913
Okay, i'm going.

823
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,415
Where?

824
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,916
I gotta bring
these things
over to med.

825
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,420
Her biking shoes,
she's been missing
my braciola.

826
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,421
Can i come?

827
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,922
We're watching
the game.

828
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,924
So, i like
going to the city.

829
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,926
I can catch the
game in the car.

830
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,928
It's nice he wants
to visit his sister.

831
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:28,932
You're right,
i'll get my shoes.

832
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,934
Uh, why don't you
watch your game, ton'?

833
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,937
What, i shouldn't
go now?

834
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,941
A. J. , why don't you bring
this stuff out to the car?

835
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,950
This is about
sambo, right?

836
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,453
I'm paying for that
goddamn college.

837
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,455
I don't know what's
going on over there.

838
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,956
But if you want to
make a big scene

839
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,458
at your daughter's
new college,

840
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,460
then comb your hair
and come right along.

841
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,961
Embarrass her.

842
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,963
Alienate her.

843
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,966
Or better yet,
cut her off.

844
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,968
Let her drop out of there
and go to a state school.

845
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,970
Or maybe move
back in here.

846
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,976
I was just trying to
protect her from herself.

847
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,479
And i'll do that till
the day i fucking die.

848
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:23,487
I'm not gonna tell you
you can't come, tony,
she's your daughter.

849
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,993
I'll probably
watch the game.

850
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,024
Garcia handing off
at the 40 yard line,

851
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,026
across to the 43.

852
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,530
I got your favorite
santa barbara olives.

853
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,033
Leave me
the fuck alone.

854
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,542
Chicken- shit
cocksuckers,

855
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,043
go for the touchdown!

856
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,046
I need another fucking
five points to
cover the spread.

857
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,551
Hi, pardon me.

858
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,554
Here she is.

859
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,556
Meadow!

860
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,558
We're here.

861
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,560
Hi.

862
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,061
Hi.

863
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,064
This is my mom
and my little
brother, a. J.

864
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,065
Hey.

865
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,567
Dad didn't come?

866
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,568
No, he didn't.

867
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,570
Did you
want him to?

868
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,575
Noah, would you mind?

869
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,076
Noah told me what
dad said to him.

870
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:57,080
It's all out in the
open, so fuck this.

871
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,583
Let's watch
the latrine lip.

872
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,084
What'd dad say?

873
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,588
Anthony, would you
go downstairs and
wait for me?

874
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:08,091
I would like to talk
to your sister.

875
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,594
Oh, i know
what he said.

876
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,095
Go.

877
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,099
I'm always
being sent away.

878
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,602
Why do i bothe
r going anywhere?

879
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,106
What did your
father say?

880
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,608
Like he didn't
tell you, please.

881
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,110
Well, believe
what you like--

882
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,113
he called noah
things that are so
disgusting and ugly,

883
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,615
i can't
even repeat it.

884
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,619
Well, you're right
, there is no excuse.

885
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,621
He's lucky i didn't punch
his fucking lights out.

886
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,623
Because you're
a civilized person.

887
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,626
So, what was this
gonna be then, some
kind of a big drama?

888
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,628
You wanted your father
to come here for what?

889
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,129
To subject your friend
to this again?

890
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,130
Oh...

891
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,132
wait, so i'm
in the wrong.

892
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,135
The rest of the world
should work around

893
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,137
his racist,
retrograde,

894
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,140
fucking asshole
personality.

895
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,143
He comes from
a place and a time

896
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,146
where he thinks he has
your best interests at heart.

897
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,147
New jersey?

898
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,149
The third millennium?

899
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,152
Noah, i'm sure you mus
t know what i'm talking about.

900
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,655
Coming from a racially
mixed marriage.

901
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,657
I'm sure that's been
a difficult burden
to shoulder.

902
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,159
Don't slam his
family background.

903
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,661
Look what you
wound up in.

904
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,664
Noah, would yo
u excuse us a moment?

905
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,666
I would like a word
with my daughter.

906
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,669
I'm not going
anywhere unless
she wants me to.

907
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:29,172
It's okay, i'll be up
in a little while.

908
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,198
I would hate t
o think you're airing

909
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,200
your family's business
in public.

910
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,201
Noah's not stupid.

911
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,704
Took him a while,
but he caught on.

912
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,707
But he keeps his
opinions to himself.

913
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,208
Unlike some people,

914
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,711
he's a brilliant
and sensitive person.

915
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,213
I'm gonna keep
my mouth shut,

916
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,716
because i know that anythi
ng i say to you or your father

917
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,718
will just fuel this.

918
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,721
I'm not gonna
stop seeing noah.

919
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,724
I put your helmet in there
and your padded shorts,

920
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,225
although, i would
really rather

921
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,727
you not ride your
bike in the city.

922
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,229
If you must know...

923
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,732
i'm going to
litchfield, connecticut,

924
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,234
to the weekend home of some
friends of noah's parents...

925
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,737
who work at nbc.

926
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,273
Svetlana!

927
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,274
Get out here.

928
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,275
Oh, hi.

929
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,277
You must be
the famous "bill".

930
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,779
It's moving day, huh?

931
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,280
Oh.

932
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,283
I didn't think you
would have the nerve

933
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,785
to show
your face to me.

934
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:22,786
Why?

935
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:23,787
What happened?
What's wrong?

936
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,289
Don't give me bullshit,
where is my leg?

937
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,791
Your leg?

938
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,793
Oh, yeah,
where's your--

939
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:30,794
i know you took it.

940
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,295
That's preposterous.

941
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,797
I mean, what possible use
would i have for your leg?

942
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:37,801
Because you think that wil
l make me give records back,

943
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,803
but you are wrong.

944
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,805
If you see some karmic
connection between

945
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:42,806
your taking my
mother's records

946
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,809
and the disappearance
of your leg, wow!

947
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,811
The records return
to the rightful owner,

948
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,312
so does the leg,

949
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,814
i can see how
you got there.

950
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,817
I don't know how you can
live with yourself.

951
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:56,820
Bill, don't waste breath.

952
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,792
This cunt is gonna be sorry
she ever fucked with me.

953
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,294
You better hope you have
all your shit out
of here'cause...

954
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:07,297
i'm calling
the locksmith.

955
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:16,289
Doc, where's dino?

956
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:18,291
They got him
for possession.

957
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:19,793
Shit.

958
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:20,794
The fuck
do you care?

959
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:22,295
He mentioned that job
over at rutgers

960
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:23,797
he was interested in
steering my way.

961
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:24,798
Coffee house.

962
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:26,800
Coffee house? Shit.

963
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,802
We were gonna jack
a benefit concert
out there tonight.

964
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:30,804
Jewel and
amnesty international.

965
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:32,305
You know
the details?

966
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:33,807
Can you make it work
without dino?

967
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:35,809
It was my
fucking idea.

968
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:50,323
I know this must be
hard for you, anthony.

969
00:51:50,323 --> 00:51:52,826
Your siste
r off at college,

970
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:55,328
you here at
home all by
yourself withus.

971
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,830
It won't
be for long.

972
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,332
Pretty soon
before you know it,

973
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:00,834
you'll be heading
off to college yourself.

974
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:03,336
I don't think
i'm gonna go.

975
00:52:03,837 --> 00:52:05,839
What, college?
Of course you will.

976
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:09,843
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

977
00:52:09,843 --> 00:52:12,345
There's so many
people there, they're
all smarter than me.

978
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:13,847
It's a bunch
of freaks.

979
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:15,849
What?

980
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:22,355
You're not excused.

981
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:23,857
You're punished!

982
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:24,858
He's alright.

983
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:26,860
Las' lui.

984
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:38,371
Under no circumstances
move this car

985
00:52:38,872 --> 00:52:40,373
or your life will
not be worth shit.

986
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:41,374
Get me jewel's
autograph.

987
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:42,876
You're a good kid.

988
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,378
I'll bring you
her underpants.

989
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:56,389
All goes in there,
no one gets shot.

990
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,391
Oh, my god,
oh, my god.

991
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:12,906
You're robbing
a benefit concert,
you know that?

992
00:53:13,406 --> 00:53:15,408
Is that all ther
e is, i'll fuckin'
blow your head off!

993
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:17,911
Most people charged it
to their student cards.

994
00:53:17,911 --> 00:53:19,412
Hey, what'
s going on, you?

995
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:20,914
Shut up!

996
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:23,416
You say one word
on that fucking thing
and you're dead!

997
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,431
Hit it!

998
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:05,458
There's your money.

999
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:11,965
You oughta hit
a tanning salon.

1000
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:13,466
I had a late night.

1001
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:16,469
You gotta give
that shit a rest.

1002
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,471
A man need
s his seven hours.

1003
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:19,973
Keeps your mind sharp.

1004
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:21,474
This was work.

1005
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:24,477
Little jackie hyped
us to a score at
the rutgers campus,

1006
00:54:24,477 --> 00:54:25,979
not bad.

1007
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:27,981
What's the matter,
chrissy? Tell
uncle paulie.

1008
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:30,483
This being made
ain't working out the
way i thought it would.

1009
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:32,986
A lot of
responsibilities.

1010
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:34,988
Fuckin' a, what
did you think?

1011
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:36,990
You're only as fuckin' smart
as this week's lines.

1012
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,492
One false move and you spend
your fuckin' time chasing it

1013
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:40,493
instead of
making money.

1014
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:41,995
Welcome to the
nfl, rookie.

1015
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:43,997
Go home,
get some sleep.

1016
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:46,499
Tomorrow's a new day.

1017
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,512
Skip, sorry i'm late.

1018
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:01,514
Had to make
a few stops.

1019
00:55:01,514 --> 00:55:03,516
Have a smelt.

1020
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:04,517
Nah.

1021
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:08,521
We had a very good
week this week, boss.

1022
00:55:10,523 --> 00:55:12,525
How's our little
friend doing?

1023
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:14,027
He had a few knots...

1024
00:55:14,027 --> 00:55:15,528
but it came ou
t alright in the end.

1025
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:19,032
Yeah, well, wait till
he hears the policy
on newly made guys.

1026
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:22,035
They're subject to strip
search for wires and shit.

1027
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:24,037
Hmm, he'll love that.

1028
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:26,539
He had to augm
ent his kick this week

1029
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,541
with a stick- up
out at rutgers.

1030
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,043
Little jackie
put him onto.

1031
00:55:30,043 --> 00:55:31,544
Jackie aprile?

1032
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:34,547
He had something to do with
this thing in the papers?

1033
00:55:34,547 --> 00:55:36,049
Don't worry.

1034
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:37,550
Junior was only
the wheel man.

1035
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,053
I specifically told
christopher to leave
the kid the fuck out.

1036
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:42,555
Just telling you
what i know.

1037
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,571
Don't be too hard
on chrissy.

1038
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:01,574
He's having a hard
enough time as it is.

1039
00:56:01,574 --> 00:56:02,575
Yeah, but what's wrong
with the kid?

1040
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:06,079
When's he gonna
grow up?

1041
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,080
Where's soprano?

1042
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,581
Here.

1043
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:11,084
Guys, i want you to take
a good look at soprano here

1044
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:14,087
and remember his performance
on the field last week.

1045
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:17,590
Soprano's on the sidelines
three whole quarters waiting.

1046
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,092
But does his mind
go soft?

1047
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:20,093
No.

1048
00:56:20,593 --> 00:56:21,594
Does his fire go out?

1049
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:22,595
Heck, no.

1050
00:56:22,595 --> 00:56:25,098
When the call came,
he brought his a- game.

1051
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:28,101
This young man may have
a big future ahead of him.

1052
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:29,102
He may be a leader

1053
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:31,604
and that's
what it takes.

1054
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:34,607
And that's why i'm naming
him defensive captain.

1055
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,112
Alright, alright.

1056
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:40,613
So, let's hit
those showers.

1057
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:42,615
One thought
in mind--

1058
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:44,617
soprano!

1059
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:47,170
Soprano,
you alright?
