His friend says

12
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,088
You gotta be

Nk.
Your kid's alright,

in your
grandmother's
house?

15
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,619
It wasn't my fault.

16
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,121
If i had a quarter for
every time i heard that

17
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,622
since you learned
how to talk,

18
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,125
i'd have a private jet
on 24- hour stand- by.

19
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,627
Get in the car.

20
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,138
In your
grandmother's house.

21
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,140
Now, who's
repeating
themself?

22
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,642
You're just lu
cky i knew that cop.

23
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,144
So he cut me
a favor.

24
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,646
Let me guess,
he owes you money?

25
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,159
Are you gonna tell me
what she did?

26
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,160
Go upstairs.

27
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,661
No, i wanna se
e the fight.

28
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,164
Anthony jr. , get your
little ass up those stairs.

29
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,666
Meadow...

30
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,168
we can talk about it
in the morning.

31
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,669
Get down here!

32
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,670
Let her
go to bed.

33
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,671
Let her go to bed?

34
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,173
I want her to
answer for herself!

35
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,174
She's drunk!

36
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,175
Was she driving
like this?

37
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,677
I could have taken
ecstasy but i didn't!

38
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,679
Don't puke on the floor!

39
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,181
What are you doing up?
Go to bed!

40
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,683
She fools around with ecstasy
and you yell at me?

41
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,685
Get up there!

42
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,191
So, what did she h
ave to say for herself?

43
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,694
The usual shit,
"wasn't my fault."

44
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,696
There was design
er drugs there, tony.

45
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,199
So, what did you say?

46
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,701
I don't know,
i yelled.

47
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,204
What the fuck else
am i gonna do?

48
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,214
You sure you're gonn
a be alright, uncle rich?

49
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,216
I wanna walk.

50
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,219
See if i run into
any of the old crowd.

51
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,721
Thanks, doll.

52
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,737
Er.
Motherfuck

53
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,747
there has to be
consequences.

54
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,749
What kind of
parents would we be

55
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,751
if we let her
get away with this?

56
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,753
Typical.

57
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,255
Ip.
Plenty of parents
still crack the wh

58
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,757
yeah, that's what
they tell you.

59
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,261
I cannot wait unti
l she goes off to college.

60
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,762
Oh, right, so you
can be fucked up

61
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,264
with the empty nest
syndrome,

62
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,267
and go on wellbutrin
like your sister.

63
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,269
As a parent today,

64
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,772
you are over a bar
rel no matter what you do.

65
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,275
You take away the car,
you become her chauffeurs.

66
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,776
You ground her,

67
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,777
you gotta stay
home weekends

68
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,279
ds.
And be prison guar

69
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,280
we could
throw her out,

70
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,781
but social services
would bring her back,

71
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,284
and then we'd be
in front of the judge,
she's not 18 yet.

72
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,286
That's your solution,
to throw your daughter out?

73
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,288
All i'm saying,
with the laws today,

74
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,290
you can't even restrain
your kid physically,

75
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,793
'cause she can sue you
for child abuse.

76
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,296
There has to be
consequences.

77
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,798
And, there will be,
i hear you, okay?

78
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's not
over- play our hand.

79
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,802
'Cause if she finds out
we're powerless,

80
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,304
we're fucked.

81
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,319
Jesus, mothe
r of christ!

82
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,821
Richie, so,
when'd you get out?

83
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,323
How come nobody told me?

84
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,825
Well, it's funny.

85
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,328
Paulie walnuts told me
he ran into you this morning.

86
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,831
Hey, honest
to fucking god
, nobody said a word.

87
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,833
Just shut
the fuck up.

88
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,841
I did a lot of meditation
in the can on this.

89
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:53,846
You can't believe how
clear you can see things.

90
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,848
Do you ever
meditate?

91
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,850
Me, meditate?
Are you crazy?

92
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,852
Not as crazy
as i used to be.

93
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,356
But still crazy enough
to take an eye out.

94
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,358
What's going
on here, rich?

95
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,360
Ten years, and
not even a pleasant

96
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,862
"go fuck yourself",
from you i get.

97
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,365
I always asked
how you were doing.

98
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,868
Hold on there, you.

99
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,871
How could you let
my dear friend sit here

100
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,373
with an empt
y cup of coffee?

101
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,376
That's alright,
take it easy, kid.

102
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,879
Bring this gentleman
a nice veal- parm sandwich.

103
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,881
And hurry the fuck
up about it.

104
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,384
The other two stores
doing as good as this?

105
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,887
Come on, you know
it's a grind.

106
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,393
That doesn't answer
my question.

107
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,897
Uy.
Hey, look, rich,
i know you're a made g

108
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,399
so, i lose either way.

109
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,401
I always respected you
and your brother jackie.

110
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,403
I'm no victim here.

111
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,406
I'm not some
greaseball store owner.

112
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,909
I'm sorry, richie,
i will not be
shaken down.

113
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,413
Sucking up to tony soprano
has done wonders for you.

114
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,915
I go away for a while,
i come back,

115
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,418
you're a tough guy.

116
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,419
Don't do this.

117
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,420
Don't do what?

118
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,921
Take what's
owed to me?

119
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,922
What's owed to you?

120
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,924
I put you in action,
beansie.

121
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,928
You got a bad
memory, beansie.

122
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,934
Veal parmigiana
sandwich...

123
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,936
fuck you.

124
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,941
I'll be back every
saturday, partner.

125
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,943
I don't fucking believ
e what i'm hearing here.

126
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,945
I'm being shak
en down for what?

127
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,448
What did i do,
tell me, what did i do?

128
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,949
This is not
right, richie,

129
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,451
wn.
I'm not gonna
fucking lay do

130
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,453
up.
I'll step

131
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,466
you won't
lay down, huh?

132
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,967
You won't lay down?

133
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,470
You piece of shit!

134
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,475
Alright, let's get
her down here.

135
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,477
I guess.

136
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,479
Where is the bride
of frankenstein?

137
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,480
She's still
sleeping.

138
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,483
Yeah, alright,
go wake her up.

139
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,984
I wake her up?

140
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,487
Yeah, i wanna get this
shit out of the way

141
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,988
before i go out.

142
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,491
Let her sleep, you guy
s are making too much of this.

143
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,992
Oh, no, i don't think
we're making enough.

144
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:20,993
She was drunk.

145
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,495
Her choice.

146
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,996
There's a zuni
saying:

147
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,998
For every 20 wrongs
a child does,

148
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:26,999
ignore 19.

149
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,501
There's an old
italian saying:

150
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,002
You fuck up once
, lose two teeth.

151
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,003
See?

152
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,005
That's what all
this is about.

153
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,507
Ego and control.

154
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,509
I beg your pardon?

155
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,510
No, please, please,

156
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,011
don't try to mak
e sense with her.

157
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,012
No, i wanna
understand this.

158
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,014
Go ahead, tell me.

159
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,517
You want to hold onto control
over a young woman

160
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,520
whose entire
biological determinism

161
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,022
is to achieve independent
thought and behavior.

162
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,024
And because she's
exercised her independence,

163
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,026
you wanna penalize her

164
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,028
because you don't
agree with her choices.

165
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,531
Why don't you go and g
et a fuckin' permanent?

166
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,533
I'm tryin'
to watch tv!

167
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,537
Ll.
We

168
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,041
good morning.

169
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,043
Oh, i'm sorry,
it's afternoon.

170
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,044
Mom, please.

171
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,546
Please, what?

172
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,548
You better have
some answers, young lady.

173
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,550
Yeah, that's right.

174
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,054
Okay, fine,
you're punished.

175
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,056
For what, i didn't
do anything!

176
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,058
You call what you did
to grandma's house
nothin'?

177
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,059
It wasn't my fault!

178
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,561
It's never your
fault, meadow.

179
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,062
It was just
supposed to be

180
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,564
me, hunter and
the macaluso twins,

181
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,066
and then steve shows up
with his asshole friend, adam,

182
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,568
and a bunch of people
from boonton.

183
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,570
Oh, so, steve's just walking
around trying doorknobs

184
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,071
'til he hi
ts the jackpot?

185
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,073
No, hunter goe
s and tells him.

186
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,074
Oh, now with
the hunter?

187
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,577
And she's over at her house
blaming it all on meadow.

188
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,078
Me.
It's an old ga

189
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,580
we're under a lot
of pressure, okay?

190
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,583
You try studying day and night
to get into college!

191
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,585
We've been working hard,
we deserved a night.

192
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,087
Sy.
Take it ea
sy, take it ea

193
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,090
i'm sorry you're under
a lot of pressure, meadow.

194
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,593
But, it's still
no excuse.

195
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,598
So, who's this
ecstasy guy?

196
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,600
I just told you, adam.

197
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,101
Ve.
I don't even know him,
he just showed up with ste

198
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,103
is this the same
steve i know?

199
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,605
The school newspaper kid
you're always with?

200
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,106
He's a flake.

201
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,108
Why do you think i stopped
hanging out with him?

202
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,611
That's news to me,
you don't hang out with steve.

203
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:23,616
It's painful to
talk about, okay?

204
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,117
Well, you're gonna
get punished.

205
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:29,121
Look, you guys,
i know what i did
was not okay.

206
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,124
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

207
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,127
and i'm really not feeling
good about myself, okay?

208
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,131
And i think you should
take away my discover card.

209
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,633
You better
believe it.

210
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,134
That's right.

211
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,135
For two weeks.

212
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,637
Three.

213
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,647
How do i buy gas?

214
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,649
Your
allowance.

215
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,151
I spent my allowan
ce, and i already owe mom.

216
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,153
The cashmina.

217
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,658
We can wait
on that.

218
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,661
Sh.
Alright, you get
ten dollars a week, ca

219
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,663
no more.

220
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,665
...
until you get
your card back

221
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,166
for gas.

222
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,677
Oh, oh, oh!

223
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,179
Come here.

224
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,182
Look at you,
you look great.

225
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,684
You're all sinew!

226
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,686
If you lost
that baby fat,

227
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,187
you'd disappoint me.

228
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,689
Ou.

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,691

I leave before
the stock market closes,

234
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,701
you scream at me for
not watchin' the phone.

235
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,202
Meet richie aprile.

236
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,706
Jesus christ
, how you doin'?

237
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,209
I gotta tell you,
your brother jacki
e was like a fuckin' god.

238
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,211
A great leader.

239
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,213
I heard a lot
about you.

240
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,215
Yeah, well, i heard
a lot about you.

241
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,217
That's why i'm here.

242
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,720
What do you mean?

243
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,222
Out of respect
for our friend here,

244
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,224
i'm gonna talk nice.

245
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,227
I ever hear you raise
your hands to my niece again,

246
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,730
next time you
won't see my face.

247
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,732
You understand?

248
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,233
Who told you i put
my hand on her?

249
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,236
Is this kid gettin'
jerky with me?

250
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,741
Look, kid, i shouldn't
have to explain myself.

251
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,242
I'm from
the old school.

252
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,745
You wanna raise your hands,
you give her your last name.

253
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,748
Then it's none of
my fucking business.

254
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,752
Until then, you keep
your hands in your pockets.

255
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,254
We understand
each other?

256
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,260
Now get
out of here.

257
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,764
I wanna talk to tony.

258
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,766
Go on.

259
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,777
He's a good kid.

260
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,280
Capable.

261
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,785
Look, ton',
this is the thing.

262
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,788
I wanna get my shy business
back on its feet.

263
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,289
I keep getting
these calls--

264
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,791
sil!

265
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,292
Where the fuck
are you goin'?

266
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,796
I'll talk to y
ou later, richie.

267
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,297
You wanna tell me
what just happened?

268
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,800
No more talking busine
ss with the skipper directly.

269
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,802
Are you fuckin' with me?

270
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,805
You can talk to him,
but not now.

271
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,307
And never here.

272
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,817
Can you believe we drank
a whole bottle of wine

273
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,318
between the
three of us?

274
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,319
Thank god.

275
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,821
Cheers.

276
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,322
Cheers.

277
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,825
Outta here.

278
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,327
Richie broke a chair
over his head.

279
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,329
Are you shittin' me?

280
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,331
Then he smacked beansi
e with the coffee pot

281
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,833
and broke hi
s cheekbone.

282
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,334
Prick, i talked
to him yesterday.

283
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,336
He was all sweetness
and lights.

284
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,339
Already, this big brother
shit is getting old.

285
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,343
Yo, bright eyes...

286
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,845
...where ya goin'?

287
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,346
Paolucc', this
isn't the bing.

288
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,347
What the fuc
k did i say?

289
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,349
Hey, how have
you been?

290
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,854
Can't complain.

291
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,357
You look good.

292
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,859
Where are your
friends going?

293
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,861
Tell them to
come back, join us.

294
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,863
No, they're leaving.

295
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,365
It's my first time here,
the veal is excellent.

296
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,868
What, are we makin'
small talk now?

297
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,370
Nice to see you.

298
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,872
Yeah, you too.

299
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,377
Toodle- oo.

300
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,381
Not a bad ass.

301
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,383
Ps.
She had nice,
pipe- fitter li

302
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,385
no disrespect.

303
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,888
Hey, what do i give a fuck?
I hardly know her.

304
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,389
You mean you would
take the lips,

305
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,892
over the tits?

306
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,893
Trust me, my boy.

307
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,395
There's two things
i'm good at.

308
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,398
That's pulling dents,
and spottin' good blow jobs.

309
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,902
And that sweetie had
world- class blow- job lips.

310
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,905
Am i right, skipper?
Good or no?

311
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,908
What the fuck do i know?
Long time ago.

312
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,913
Alright,
she was good.

313
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,416
Good, or great?

314
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,421
Why the fuck are you
bustin' my balls?

315
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,923
It was a long time ago.

316
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,425
I remember every
blow job i ever got.

317
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,928
How about you,
you remember y
our first blow job?

318
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,429
Yeah, of course.

319
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,932
How long did it ta
ke for the guy to cum?

320
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:41,934
Did ya hear that?

321
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,435
B,"
i said,"you rememb
er your first blow jo

322
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,937
he said,"yeah."

323
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,439
I said,"how long did
it take for the guy to cum?"

324
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,442
Toodle- fucking- oo?

325
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,444
What the fuck
was that?

326
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,446
God, i couldn't
sleep all night,

327
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:55,948
i was so embarrassed.

328
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,950
What was so wr
ong with toodle- oo?

329
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,451
It's an accepted
form of goodbye.

330
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,954
That's not the way
i talk with patients.

331
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,956
It wasn't me,
it was someone else.

332
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,958
It was jennifer.

333
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,459
For whatever reason,
at that moment,

334
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,962
er,
you felt safer
showing him jennif

335
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,463
not doctor.

336
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,465
Ble
i mean, what did
you see at that ta

337
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,968
that made you wanna
hide doctor?

338
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,469
And who were you
hiding from?

339
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,471
I saw a patient that
i never wanted to see again.

340
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,974
That's who i was
hiding from, a patient.

341
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,477
When you say,"see",

342
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,479
do you mean that as in
see professionally,

343
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,481
or just plain see?

344
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,482
What's the
difference?

345
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,484
There's a bi
g difference.

346
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,487
If it was just a matter
of plain, old,"see",

347
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,990
then you would have been
the cordial doctor

348
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,992
and said,"goodnight."

349
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,995
But, because he's someone
you didn't wanna see
professionally,

350
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,997
you abandon
the doctor facade,

351
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,499
re.
And adopted the
jennifer postu

352
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,501
hence,"toodle- oo".

353
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,003
Okay, you're almost
there, elliot,

354
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,504
but not quite.

355
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:56,008
Young girls are
not accountable for
their behavior.

356
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,011
I think toodle- oo
was the action of

357
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,512
a ditsy, young girl.

358
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,016
I regressed into
"the girl thing"

359
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,519
to escape responsibility
for abandoning a patient.

360
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,023
He asked me
for help.

361
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,027
Look, i need you
as a colleague,

362
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,030
to tell me that
i did the right thing.

363
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,033
You gotta ask yourself why
you became a psychiatrist

364
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,534
in the first place.

365
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,536
If it was only to he
lp people to stop smoking

366
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,538
or biting their nails,
then, so be it.

367
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,540
There's nothin
g wrong with that.

368
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,542
I had another patient
who committed suicide

369
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,045
because i was
treating this man.

370
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,546
Because i had to
go on the lam.

371
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,049
Oom
treating patie
nts from a motel r

372
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,550
um,
may not ha
ve been optim

373
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,052
but you were still
there for her,

374
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,553
you were in
phone contact.

375
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,556
It would have been the sam
e if you'd been on vacation.

376
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,560
Did you say,"lam"?

377
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,566
And lifting up into cobra...

378
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:02,074
og.
And, now, rising up
into downward facing d

379
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,582
coming back down
into cobra.

380
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:20,092
And relaxing
into child's pose.

381
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,100
Richie.

382
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,604
Janice, you know,
i thought that was you.

383
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,605
Parvati.

384
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,606
Huh?

385
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,609
I changed my name
to parvati in'78.

386
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,112
I thought you live
d in california now.

387
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,115
Seattle, actually,
last couple of years.

388
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,618
So, how long
you been...

389
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,122
out of jail?
One week.

390
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,624
That's where i picked up
this yoga shit.

391
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,627
Well, it's working for you,
you seem very supple.

392
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,130
I do a lot
ta stretching.

393
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,631
So, you back now?

394
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,134
My mom's
at st. Erasmus,
a stroke.

395
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,135
At.
I'm sorry
to hear th

396
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,637
tony didn't say
anything about it.

397
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,642
I guess we're all
getting a little older.

398
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,644
Only if that's
our choice.

399
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,160
You drag me all the wa
y out to this place,

400
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,661
i'm walkin' throug
h the food court,

401
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,164
this fucking kid spill
ed fried rice all over me.

402
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,165
Alright,
take it easy.

403
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,666
Keep your
voice down.

404
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,168
Let's talk.

405
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,170
How would
you feel?

406
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,172
Es,
you wrap up a dime,
your crew evaporat

407
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,175
and you walk away from me
like i got some catchy disease.

408
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,676
Hey, i don't talk
business with anybody,

409
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,178
don't take
it personal.

410
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,180
A guy in my position
is a government target.

411
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,182
Why do you think we're
meetin' in a fuckin' mall?

412
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,185
It feels
disrespectful.

413
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,687
That's all
i'm sayin'.

414
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,689
I'm the guy who saved you
from the hit parade.

415
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,693
When did you e
ver step in for me?

416
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,195
You forget?

417
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,696
When you and
my kid brother

418
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,698
stuck up
feech lamanna's
card game?

419
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,200
Get the fuck
out of here.

420
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,201
Feech was made before
the electric light.

421
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,702
If it wasn't for me,

422
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,204
you two kids would
a caught a vicious beatin'

423
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,705
st.
To say the lea

424
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,208
richie, you know
i love you.

425
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,209
You're like
my big brother, okay?

426
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,211
You're gonna be
taken care of.

427
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,212
What was yours
before you went away

428
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,214
will be yours again.

429
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,216
You just gotta
give it some time.

430
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:28,220
Jesus, anthony,
you'd do that for me?

431
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,222
Hey, fuck you.

432
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,226
What's mine is not
yours to give me.

433
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,728
Hey, prick, you
reached out to me.

434
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,231
I said wha
t i wanted to say.

435
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,737
We got a
problem, kid?

436
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm just trying to get you
to slow the fuck down, okay?

437
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,242
Things are
different now.

438
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,245
You gotta be
extra, extra careful.

439
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,247
When do you know m
e not to be careful?

440
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,249
When?

441
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,251
How about, you been out
of the can ten fucking minutes,

442
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,752
already, you're trying
to shake down beansie

443
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,254
for a piece of
his pizza joints.

444
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,757
Do me a favor, back off,
he's a good earner.

445
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,259
Yeah, for you.

446
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,761
Hey, that's none of
your fucking cazzis.

447
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,763
Those pizza joints are
strictly a cash business.

448
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,765
They come in handy.

449
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,767
He's a sneak
y cocksucker.

450
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,269
Whatever,
back off.

451
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,771
Are you takin' the sid
e of a civilian over me?

452
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,723
Jesus fuckin'
christ, richie,

453
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,225
i'm askin' you
to do me a favor.

454
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,226
If you wanna
do it, do it,

455
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,227
if you don't,
go fuck yourself.

456
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,729
Oh, yeah?

457
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,231
Yeah.

458
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,733
How's your sister?

459
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:34,236
Hey, there's no need
for that kinda talk.

460
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,238
What?

461
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:37,739
My sister.

462
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:41,743
Janice,
how's she doing?

463
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:46,748
Oh, i thought
you were baitin' me.

464
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:50,252
How's your sister,
fuck your mother.

465
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:51,753
No.

466
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,326
Have you seen
what she did?

467
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:05,827
Who?

468
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:08,330
Meadow, that
house is fucked!

469
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,832
Ar.
Thought you
didn't swe

470
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,834
what are you
talking about?

471
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:16,838
I'm outraged, no,
i am beyond outraged.

472
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,340
Talk about disgrace.

473
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,842
Disrespect for other
people's property!

474
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:23,845
That place looks like
a freakin' shooting gallery!

475
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:24,846
It smells
of urine,

476
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:27,349
there's puke all over
the beautiful hardwood floors.

477
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,351
It sounds like your
apartment in venice!

478
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:30,852
Don't worry about
it, she's been punished.

479
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:32,854
Oh, three weeks without
a credit card?

480
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:34,856
That's some
heavy shit there!

481
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:35,857
Janice!

482
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:37,359
If that
was my child--

483
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,361
you know what
? fuck this!

484
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,329
You got a lot of fucki
ng balls, you know that?

485
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:42,330
Don't talk to me
like that.

486
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,331
Tony.

487
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,833
No, let's clear
the air here.

488
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,835
You come ridin' into tow
n like some vishnu- come- lately

489
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:47,836
and try to play
the concerned daughter,

490
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,337
who the fuck
are you kiddin'?

491
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:51,339
You're just here to pick
the friggin' bones.

492
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,341
There's a lot
i could say right now,

493
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:55,844
that i am not gonna say.

494
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:58,847
Lotta balls.

495
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,351
Temper tantrums!

496
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,353
He hasn't changed one iota
since we lived in newark.

497
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:06,855
Not one iota!

498
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:09,357
You are passing
judgment on him, janice,

499
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:10,859
on us,
as parents.

500
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,861
Dy.
I told you
once alrea

501
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,362
how we discipline
our children

502
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,864
is none of
anybody's business.

503
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,866
You let that girl
ride roughshod over you,

504
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,367
some day you're
gonna regret it.

505
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,369
Mother of god, janice!

506
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,371
Are all of you
sopranos the same?

507
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,873
I asked you nice
ly to stay out of it,

508
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,374
but, you're pretending
you don't hear me.

509
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:27,876
Well, maybe you're
gonna hear this.

510
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,878
Ss,
mind your
fucking busine

511
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,380
ds,
keep your mouth shut
when it comes to my ki

512
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,882
alright?

513
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,386
Maybe i've stayed
here too long.

514
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:50,398
The fall in the shower
didn't in any way

515
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,901
affect the pre- existin
g condition in your heart.

516
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,402
But you
already knew that.

517
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:56,404
It never hurts
to be sure.

518
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,907
Fucking bum hip.

519
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:01,910
What next, does
the man upstairs
have in store for me?

520
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,913
En.
You're lucky it was
sprained, not brok

521
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:07,415
the thing is, doc,
i've been feeling these...

522
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,417
little fibrillations.

523
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,919
Psychosomatic.

524
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,420
You got out of jail
on a medical.

525
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,923
It's the mind- body
connection.

526
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,925
Your body's just
pitching in to help.

527
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:23,431
Hey, there's my boy.

528
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:26,434

He's a good kid.

Lets me use the
doctor/patient thing

00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,471
to meet people here.

542
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,976
Fucking house arrest.

Like the man said,

00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,999
"may you live in
interesting times."

552
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:33,001
You met with tony?

553
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:36,004
It's more like a fucki
ng audience with the pope.

554
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:38,506
What are you
gonna do?

555
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,512
Whatever
you tell me.

556
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,522
You and your brother
were always good boys.

557
00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:58,526
You tell me,
this is the way it is,
then so be it.

558
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:01,529
You tell m
e otherwise,

You just say it.

Once again,
a big welcome home

562
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,043
to our guest of honor.

563
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:17,045
Richie was surprised
all the changes

564
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:18,546
the last ten years.

565
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,048
New jersey with
its own hockey team.

566
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:21,549
You know,
it's interesting.

567
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:23,051
The meadowlands is
the only nhl arena

568
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:26,054
where the penalty box
is maximum security!

569
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:31,559
Maximum security
penalty box. Help me.

570
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,061
What the fuck?

571
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,063
I was talking to
paulie walnuts,

572
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:36,564
who was under
the impression

573
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:38,566
that richie had
been in bosnia,

574
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,569
where there's also a large
moose- lim population!

575
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,571
Get this fucki

00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:46,074
And, now for all
you youngsters

Welcome home.

Wait'll you open it,

581
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:16,604
I'm a grandfather

582
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,106
Imagine that.

583
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,607
Please

584
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:21,109
Exploitin' medical
curiosities

585
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,611
is against
the law.

586
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,613
Is that why they canceled
your mother's audition?

587
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:27,115
What d
id you say?

588
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:29,617

They're hanging.

Ready and waiting.

595
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,092

00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,598
Don't worry

attitude problem.

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,611
Careful.

605
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,612
Enough.

606
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,114
He just did te
n fucking years.

607
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,616
He's got a right to be
a little fucked up.

608
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,118
No?

609
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,120

Now, go ahead,

618
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,689
Hey, buddy.

619
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,691
What the fuck
are you doing?

620
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,692
What did you think

621
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,694
tony soprano was
gonna do for you, huh?

622
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,696
You know, you got
a raging hard- on for me,

623
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,198
and, i don't even
know what for.

624
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,199
You don't?

625
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,700
Come here,

626
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,201
No.

627
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,203
Come here,
come here!

628
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,704
How come you weren't
at the party?

629
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,207
Hey, i moved a lotta "h"
for you and your brother.

630
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,708
And you guys made
the lion's share.

631
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,211
You're just bitter because
i invested my money smart,

632
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,214
and you spread yours
however the fuck you did.

633
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,217
I spent mine on lawyers,
you slippery fuck.

634
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,718
You wanna talk
like a tough guy?

635
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,221
Tough guy, here!

636
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,223
Hey, come on, please,

Please?

638
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,226
What happened to tha
t greaseball store owner?

Tell me again how
you won't lay down, huh?

640
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,748
Janice.

641
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,252
Oh, sorry, is the
music too loud?

642
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,753
Oh, no, it's fine.

643
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,757
Umm, i just wanted
to apologize.

644
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,760
You know,
about earlier.

645
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,763
No, i should be
apologizing to you.

646
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,767
I was out of line,
you're right.

647
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:54,272
I never raised a child.

648
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,773
I was robbed of that

649
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,776
when eugene took him
back to montreal.

650
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,279
I'm still petitioning
the state department,

651
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,282
but, i think they have me
on their enemy radicals list.

652
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,785
When was the last time
you saw harpo?

653
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,289
He changed
his name to hal.

654
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,292
I'm sorry, carm, can
we not talk about him?

655
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,294
Look, i just
want you to know

656
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,296
that i was way
out of line.

657
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,799
Well, i'm sorry, too
, really, i feel terrible.

658
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,302
You know,
you're family.

659
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,804
And family means a lot.

660
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,307
I just don't feel righ
t about you leaving here.

661
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,809
I don't know.

662
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,313
I don't think
tony wants me here.

663
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,315
Well, where yo
u gonna go?

664
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,816
The house is
in no condition
to move into.

665
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,318
Especially now.

666
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,819
I'll be alright.

667
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,822
No, i'm sorry,
i can't let you leave.

668
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:48,326
Really, i want
you to stay.

669
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,328
Okay, thanks.

670
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,330
Ay.
Ok

671
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,333
goodnight.

672
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,834
Goodnight.

673
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:00,338
Oh, maybe just
a little bit,
the music.

674
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,339
Right.

675
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,860
Jesus, no,
richie, no!

676
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,364
Jesus!

677
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:03,401
Should i put
the chocolate in now?

678
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,902
Put it in,
i'll pour the milk.

679
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,906
What did you parents finally
say about last saturday?

680
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,908
The usual, nothing.

681
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,910
They're afraid
i'll go bulimic again.

682
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,413
Mine, blah, blah, blah.

683
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,415
Start purging,
they won't say anything.

684
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,416
When are they
gonna realize

685
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,917
that we're
practically adults,

686
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,419
responsible
for ourselves?

687
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,421
So, your grandmother's house
got used for a party.

688
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,923
Excuse me, would they
prefer we go to limelight?

689
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,426
It's'cause they
have no life.

690
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,428
They focus on bullshit.

691
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,929
So, what'd yours do?

692
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,932
They took away
my discover card
for 3 weeks.

693
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,434
Oh, that's nothing.

694
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,935
I know,
it was my idea.

695
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,937
Oo.
So hypocritical, t

696
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,440
when you think how
my dad makes a living.

697
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,945
Oh, sheez,
what is this?

698
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,449
Why don't you ring
for the nurse?

699
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,950
Never you mind.

700
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,951
Ob.
That's their j

701
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,454
i don't need them.

702
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,956
My daughter came all
the way from seattle.

703
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,463
Oh, jesus!

704
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:15,973

00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:19,977
Mrs. Soprano.

708
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,480

00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,486
But, i thought

00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,490
No, that was
my brother jackie.

712
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,493
Oh, i'm sorry.

713
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,496
How did he die,
the poor baby?

714
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,998
He had cancer.

715
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,500
Me, too.

716
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,503
Oh, shut that curtain,
will you?

717
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,509
You know, i was
in a private room.

718
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,512
My johnny would
roll over in his grave

719
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,014
if he saw this.

720
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,518
They wheel people
in and out, in and out.

721
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,020
Oh, go on.

722
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,524
So, isn't parvati
supposed to be here?

723
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,026
I don't know
who that is.

724
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,029
Your daughter,
parvati, janice.

725
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,033
Oh, please, don't start
with that name business.

726
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,537
She did it
to shame me.

727
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,540
You'll have to hav
e your tea without lemon.

728
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,044
Richie.

729
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:34,051
You see the beautiful
flowers he brought me?

730
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,054
Your father has
friends with class.

731
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,056
Not like
some people.

732
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,058

He's your
boyfriend?

735
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,564
Don't you remember me?

736
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,066
You used to yell at me
for beeping my car horn

737
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,068
when i came over
to pick up janice?

738
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,571

00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,589
Take it easy.

746
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,591
Is that how you
talk to your mother?

747
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,092
Rip

00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,596
Don't you have
any shame?

750
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,099
Shame, i got
plenty of shame.

751
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,101
Believe me.

752
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,604
You don't want to hear
what i'm ashamed of.

753
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,607
Go ahead, ma, shoo
t your best shot.

754
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,609
Never you mind.

755
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,112
Just remember what we
talked about last week.

756
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:39,617
Ee.
Ma, i'm gonna go to
the cafeteria for coff

758
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,121
Yes.

759
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,624
I bet you're very
good to your mother.

760
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,134
She'll be better
when i get her home.

761
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,137
Does that mean you're
sticking around jersey?

762
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,139
If i don't, who's
gonna take care of her?

763
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,641
What about tony?

764
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,644
Long story.

765
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,646
You haven't hear
d what happened?

766
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,148
Anthony's one of these people
who blames everyone else

767
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,650
for anything
bad in his life,

768
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,151
er.
Including his moth

769
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,153
tony, nah.

770
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:19,657
Trust me, nothing'
s ever his fault.

771
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,160
So, what's with
the flowers,

772
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,162
mr. Candy stripe?

773
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,165
Well, i couldn't come
visit her empty- handed.

774
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,167
Oh.

775
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,169
You weren't in yoga.

776
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,171
I'm very bus
y with my mother.

777
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,673
Too busy
for dinner?

778
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,675
You and i weren't good for
each other 20 years ago.

779
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,177
What makes you think
it's gonna be different now?

780
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,179
That's gettin'
to the point.

781
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,682
Richie, after all i put in
to getting to where i am,

782
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,685
it'd be ridiculous
to decompensate now.

783
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,688
I'm so not tha
t person anymore.

784
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,691
It works both ways.

785
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:58,195
I don't think
i'd be interested
in the same jan i knew.

786
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,700
So, what,
you've grown?

787
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,702
Well, you tell me.

788
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,203
Did you ever think
you'd see richie aprile

789
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,207
doing a "downward
facing dog"?

790
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,716
Can she put anymore
gook shit in here?

791
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:19,717
It's not that much.

792
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,219
Soy milk this,
tofu that.

793
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,220
I hate a
ll that shit.

794
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,222
Yeah, me too.

795
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,724
Shut up, you said yo
u like the soy milk.

796
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,226
I lied, she was taking me
to the video store.

797
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,729
I'm happy
aunt parvati's
gonna stay.

798
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,231
Oh, your aunt who
doesn't think you
get punished enough?

799
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,733
That party
wasn't my fault,

800
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,735
how many fucking tim
es do i have to say it?

801
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:38,736
Hey!

802
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,737
Oh!

803
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,744
Don't look like
you're gonna cry.

804
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,747
You made your bed.

805
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,753
I need 15 dollars.

806
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,254
Excuse me?

807
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,256
A cole porter cd

808
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,759
We're doing three
of the songs.

809
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,261
You took my card,

810
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,771
Re.
He

812
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,780
Nothing.

813
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,783
Thank you,
by the way.

814
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,288
Janice should
be home by now.

815
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,790
My sister was halfway
out the door.

816
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,792
You had to fall
for her con?

817
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,793
What was she
gonna do?

818
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,294
Live in a motel
which she can't afford?

819
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,796
How about she goes bac
k to wherever it was

820
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,297
she was hiding
for twenty years

821
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,298
while i took car
e of her mother.

822
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,800
I thought we weren't
supposed to mention

823
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,802
grandma in
this house.

824
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,805
Fine, i'm not gonna
argue with you, tony.

825
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,806
If want her to leave,

826
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,307
you're gonna have to
tell her, 'cause i'm not.

827
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,309
It's not christian.

828
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,812
See, the shit works out,
she's a buddhist.

829
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,313
Hello?

830
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,315
We're in
here, par'.

831
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,821
I thought it was cruel
to pick flowers.

832
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,322
Richie brought
'em to ma.

833
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,323
They're beautiful.

834
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,324
Aren't they?

835
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,325
Richie?

836
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,327
Richie aprile?

837
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,829
Yeah, he went
to visit her.

838
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,831
You know he always
loved ma.

839
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,837
I gotta go.

840
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,840
You better

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,342

842
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,975
Jesus christ!

843
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,978
Peter, you're scaring
your mother.

844
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,480
Leave me
the fuck alone.

845
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,985
Hey, is that
anyway to talk?

846
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:48,986
Tony?

847
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,489
Can you pick up the bbc
on that thing, or what?

848
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,491
Ny.
No jokes,
please, to

849
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,492

850
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,494
Ay.

852
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,506
You said he wasn't
gonna bother me, tony.

853
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,508
Jesus.

854
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,512
Lk.
They said
i might not wa

00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,515
come on, ma,

856
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,018
let's go downstairs
for a little while.

857
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,024
You gonna let that animal
get away with this?

858
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,531
I'll let you
talk to your friend.

859
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,045
Listen, beans,
do me a favor.

860
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:49,546
Don't listen to these
fuckin' doctors.

861
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,048
When it comes
to spinal injuries,

862
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,549
everything's
a mystery to them.

863
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,552
Paul has this cousin,
got run over by a forklift,

864
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,054
broke his back,

865
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:00,057
the guy's dancing
tango competitions.

866
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,563
Alright, here.

867
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,565
Here.

868
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,068
I can't do it.

869
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,573
...
ah, ah

870
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,077

871
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,083
Thanks.

you know that?

875
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,593
Your nose is as far
as i'm willing to go.

876
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,110
Listen, beans.

877
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,112
You a thousand
percent sure

878
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,114
