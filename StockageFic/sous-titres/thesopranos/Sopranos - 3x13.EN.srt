1
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,873
I gotta pee.

2
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,375
The janitor
leaves at eight.

3
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,377
You can wait
10 minutes.

4
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,891
Now i gotta pee.

5
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,909
Got it.

6
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,423
Listen to super bowl
35 on the radio...

7
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,425
this is that kid
i was tellin' you about.

8
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,927
He needs to
crash here.

9
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,929
He can get you
a glock 9.

10
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,931
Welcome to the boonton
holiday inn.

11
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,934
My name is leena.

12
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,936
What's your name?

13
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,437
Uh...

14
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,439
i probably
shouldn't say.

15
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,941
Mr. X, then.

16
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,445
You'll be
safe here, bro.

17
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,948
Your guido friends would never
think to look for you here.

18
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,462
How do i open
this door?

19
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,970
Did you like
the room, nucci?

20
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,972
Did you think
it was nice?

21
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,974
That's sammy kahn.

22
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,977
That's one
of my favorites.

23
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,479
I'll hav
e the deposit,

24
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,481
the 40, 000 to you,
end of the week.

25
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,983
If you could
transfer--

26
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,992
we have an even bigger
sing on parisian night

27
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:46,993
which is fridays.

28
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,494
Oh madonna mi',

29
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,496
they don't eat
snails, do they?

30
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,500
No, coq au vin,
blanket of veal.

31
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,503
Ma?

32
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,005
What's the matter?

33
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,507
My son let's me li
ve in a place like this.

34
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,510
He's such a good boy.

35
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,013
Yeah, well, who's
the queen, huh?

36
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,515
C'mon, now,
dry those peeps.

37
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,524
Listen to this,

38
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,526
19- year- old college
kid in michigan,

39
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,528
he's comin' out for the
nba draft as a sophomore,

40
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,530
he figures he'll go
in the first round...

41
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,532
he's dead...
from crack.

42
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,041
I was thinking
about ro.

43
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,543
And here jackie
had her convinced

44
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,046
he was just smokin
g a little marijuana,

45
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,548
making cs in school.

46
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,550
And he was dealing
hard drugs.

47
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,056
You never know
with your kids.

48
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,058
It's like
i been saying...

49
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,560
the shit that can
happen over drug money.

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,063
Well, you tried,
tony, with that boy.

51
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,569
Nice haul, cracking
that strong box.

52
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,072
Almost a hundred k.

53
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,573
Where's my half?

54
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,075
Fuckin' week now.

55
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,577
Let's see,

56
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,580
after you kick
upstairs, you'll net--

57
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,082
what are you,
my accountant?

58
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,083
I'm better
with numbers

59
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,085
than nine tenths
of your accountants.

60
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,087
Kind of in arrears
in the respect
department, aren't you?

61
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,089
Fuck you
talkin' about?

62
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,591
Your future step- son,
the card game.

63
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,093
Come on, he pissed
on your leg.

64
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,594
Killed your dealer,

65
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,596
shot at
two made guys.

66
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,600
"A", you're talkin
g shit that's none
of your business.

67
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,102
And "b",

68
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,105
i'm gonna give that
little fuck ah matz'
he'll never forget.

69
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,607
Soon as we can
locate him.

70
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,111
He's in a housing project
in fuckin' boonton!

71
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:50,116
So, this 50 gs, you
think you deserve it?

72
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,119
"Deserve" un gatz,
it's my territory.

73
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,624
What?

74
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,127
It's me.

75
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,128
Uh...
tony.

76
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,630
Tony.

77
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,634
Tony,
what is it?

78
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,136
It's really vito.

79
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,637
You said to call
in five minutes.

80
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,139
No, no, no, no.

81
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,142
I'm not doing nothing
important right now.

82
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,646
Uh, i'm watching a guy
clean his windshield.

83
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,149
He's got a
green hat on.

84
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,650
It's that big?

85
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,653
Some birds
up ahead flying.

86
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,658
Some weeds across
the street there.

87
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,660
Well...

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,663
i can be there
in a half hour?

89
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,665
I think i see a rabbit
or a squirrel.

90
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,167
I don't know
what it is.

91
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,669
Maybe it's a possum.

92
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,671
No, i'll see you then.

93
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,679
What can do i?

94
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,181
To be continued,
looks like.

95
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,183
Tony needs me.

96
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,185
We'll work this out
another time.

97
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,693
Hello.

98
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,696
Tony? It's me.

99
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,201
You shouldn't be
calling me here.

100
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,703
I have to, what else
am i gonna do?

101
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,205
Don't say nothing.

102
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,207
You gotta help me.

103
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,708
Talk to your stepfather,
let him help.

104
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,710
I can't talk to him.

105
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,212
Look, i'm up in--

106
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,214
i don't want to know.

107
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,216
You call him,
you tell him to
come get you,

108
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,717
help you,
whatever.

109
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,719
Tony, please
, i'm sorry.

110
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,222
Please
don't hang up.

111
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,223
For my dad
if not for me.

112
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,225
He's been dead
two years.

113
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,227
As a matter of fact,
the expiration date
was last week

114
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,728
on all your bullshit
with that.

115
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,730
When you and him
did the same thing,

116
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,731
you got forgiven.

117
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,233
Go think about it.

118
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,734
See if you can figure
out the difference.

119
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,736
Don't call
me no more.

120
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,744
Mr. X, can you
play chess?

121
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,746
No.

122
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,249
I can, my daddy
taught me.

123
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,772
Economic downturn,

124
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,774
that's all you hear
about, but not you, boy.

125
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,777
You got 300 gs of the
esplanade green- grass

126
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,779
being chauffeured home.

127
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,780
Yeah.

128
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,282
Good job.

129
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,787
Jackie j
r. Call you?

130
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,789
No, why?

131
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,291
He called me.

132
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,294
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,296
Nah, don't apologize.

134
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,799
Anyway, i told him
to take it up with you.

135
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,801
Ton', what do you
want me to do?

136
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,303
You're the boss of the--

137
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,305
whoa, whoa, whoa,
we talked about this.

138
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,806
You were gonna
give him a pass.

139
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,808
But he should know.

140
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,312
You don't want to create
confusion, insubordination.

141
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,816
But more important tha
n the particular decision

142
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,319
is that it happe
n in a timely fashion.

143
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,823
But, fuck,

144
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,325
why am i telling you?

145
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,828
You know all this,
you're a captain.

146
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,332
Chain of command is
very important in our thing.

147
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,834
I'm sorry he
called your house.

148
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,836
Don't apologize.

149
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,302
Imagine,

150
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,305
neither of you had ever gotten
so much as a passing grade

151
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,806
on any geometry test,

152
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,808
and then
the midterm.

153
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,811
Sister agnes
shared these with me.

154
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:59,815
Both of you got
96 percent correct,

155
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,818
remarkable.

156
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:06,822
I'd like to call
your parents and share
the good news with them.

157
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,326
Oh, you really
don't have to.

158
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,834
What do you
want to tell me?

159
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:24,840
If you cooperate now,
it'll be easier later.

160
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,345
All we did
was study hard.

161
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,349
I don't have to waste
my time with you.

162
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,351
It was both
your urines

163
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,853
that mr. Lubimov spent
two hours scrubbing.

164
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,356
Your dna was
an exact match.

165
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,857
Oh, geez!

166
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,359
He's the one
who peed first!

167
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,861
I didn't even have to
pee till he did it.

168
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:48,864
I could take another test,
you could watch me.

169
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:53,869
He's back.

170
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,871
Junior soprano
beat cancer?

171
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,373
As far as anyone
can tell.

172
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,874
This prick
is laughing at us.

173
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,377
We get another
crack at him?

174
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,379
For a change the
judge ruled with us.

175
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,880
He'll set a trial
date in 30 days.

176
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,382
Good.

177
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,883
Tony?

178
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,886
Well, we had
the lamp problem.

179
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,388
Can't we get to him
through the nephew?

180
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,389
He's been made.

181
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,391
What about what we did
with archie banners?

182
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:16,392
His wife niki?

183
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:18,394
Moltisanti
is engaged

184
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:21,397
to a lovely thing called
adriana la cerva.

185
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,398
Good.

186
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:25,401
Would you ask debora
h to come in here please?

187
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,404
May i just
point out,

188
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,406
all she's ever done
is background checks.

189
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:31,907
Where'd you start?

190
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,914
Deborah,

191
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:43,419
how would you like
a new best friend for
the next nine, ten months?

192
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,921
Uh...

193
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,924
let me put
it this way.

194
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,926
How big can you
make your hair?

195
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,930
...tampa, site of
super bowl 35,

196
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,433
coming up on sunday
and today is media day...

197
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,435
no!

198
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,438
You pawn can only move
two spaces on the first move.

199
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,440
Sorry.

200
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,941
There.

201
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,946
Yo, i think
you're done for.

202
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:12,448
We just started.

203
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,450
Yeah, but the way she's
developing her knights.

204
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,458
I win again.

205
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,460
See, you should've
played that out.

206
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,962
That's the only way
you gonna learn.

207
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,465
I'm going down the
park, see bruce.

208
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,467
You guys
need anything?

209
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,469
Nah, i'm cool.

210
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:36,472
What are you
laughing at?

211
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,509
How could it
be $3200?

212
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,513
He said the transmission
was completely compromised.

213
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:19,515
I never even
heard of that!

214
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,016
I want my guy to
take a look at it.

215
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:23,018
I already told this
guy to go ahead.

216
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:24,520
Well, then
call him back,

217
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,521
tell him not to.

218
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,523
Tell him we're
picking up the car.

219
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,526
...who was voted the sexiest
man at the super bowl.

220
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,528
They never do this
in the world series...

221
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:35,030
forget it,
i don't care.

222
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,532
Let him do it.

223
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,533
Are you sure,
honey?

224
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,034
What the fuc
k did i just say?

225
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,036
Look, ro...

226
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:45,040
i'm coming home late,
i got some shit i gotta do.

227
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,047
...we'll come back,

228
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,049
see if we can get
a couple more giants on

229
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,051
before their hour
has come and gone...

230
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,553
the super bowl
returns to tampa...

231
00:13:58,053 --> 00:13:59,054
how much?

232
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,057
A dime?
You got it.

233
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:04,560
...who was run out of this
town just a year ago.

234
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,562
I know what the ravens
offense is gonna do,

235
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,063
what the ravens defense
is gonna do,

236
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,065
what the giants defense
is gonna do.

237
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:12,067
What i don't know is what
the giants offense
is gonna do.

238
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,570
We're writing a lot
of slips on this game.

239
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:18,574
I'm goin' to the
betting parlor.

240
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,076
...if they
spread it out...

241
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:23,579
at some point
they might have
to spread'em out.

242
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,082
Neither defense thinks
that the other offense

243
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,084
can score on'em.

244
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,587
I think because the defense of
the giants feels so confident

245
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,589
they can shut out
the ravens...

246
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,093
i been dreaming of
that fuckin' lo mein

247
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:40,095
all the way the
fuck over here.

248
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,599
Now, who came in here
and ate my shit?

249
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,101
They don't have the explosive
outside speed...

250
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:50,606
i look for baltimore to wi
n this game, 20 to seven.

251
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:54,610
Not for nothing,
t, but...

252
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,112
i think you've
been wound a
little tight lately.

253
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,116
It's that sack of
shit, ralphie.

254
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,118
That's what i gott
a talk to you about.

255
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,120
He didn't pay me
the 50 gs he owes me

256
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,123
that comes out
that check cashing
store in morristown.

257
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,125
You lost me.

258
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,627
I got an alarm guy
on my payroll.

259
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,129
I tipped ralphie's
guys about the safe.

260
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,131
Gave them the codes.

261
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:18,133
So, ralphie says
the dough is his.

262
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,136
I'll talk to
him about it.

263
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,638
Fuck that
!

264
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,640
I been telling you
for months now
this guy's no good.

265
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,142
And i need that money
for my long range planning!

266
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,144
I want a sit- down.

267
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:31,647
Alright, answer
the fucking phone.

268
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,651
Hello?

269
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,152
Yeah...

270
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:39,655
carmela.

271
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:43,158
Sounds like
she's crying.

272
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,172
Yeah.

273
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,174
What?

274
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,176
A permanent expulsion.

275
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,679
I prayed i wou
ld never see this.

276
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,682
Even i managed
to get through school
without getting expelled.

277
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,185
Maybe it's
a blessing.

278
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,687
I don't see how
that could be.

279
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,689
The place was too loose,
it was too easy.

280
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,190
How can you say that?
I got expelled.

281
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,693
You got nothing to say
till i tell you!

282
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:18,694
Unless i ask you
a direct question!

283
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:20,696
Tony.

284
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,699
I work hard all day
to pay for this

285
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,702
6, 000 square foot house,
big screen tvs,

286
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,704
food on the table,
video games,

287
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,206
all kinds of
scooters and bicycles,

288
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,676
columbia university,
and for what?

289
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,177
To come home
to this?

290
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,680
Sucks to be you.

291
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:43,185
My god, tony!

292
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,187
There's more where
that came from!

293
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,189
We're starting a new
regime around here!

294
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,691
The school guidanc
e counselor said

295
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:49,692
this might be
a cry for help.

296
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,694
Oh, c'mon,
will ya?

297
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,195
She recommended a school
in new brunswick.

298
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:54,697
Birnwood day, it
's for troubled kids.

299
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,198
There's psychologists
right on staff.

300
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,701
No, no more fucking
schools that coddle him.

301
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:59,702
He's going to
military school.

302
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:00,703
What?

303
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,204
That's right,
i got some brochures.

304
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,706
You got
school brochures.

305
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,207
Yeah, from janice.

306
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:06,208
She was gonna
send harper there

307
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,210
but she didn't have the money
and it was too fuckin' late!

308
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,211
I'm not sending
him away.

309
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:12,715
We're lookin' at
those brochures!

310
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:15,718
What is with
you, tony?

311
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,722
Now, this i like.

312
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,724
Highly structured
environment.

313
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,727
Which
one is that?

314
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,729
Hmi,

315
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,230
hudson military
institute.

316
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,733
"Our second century
of excellence."

317
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,735
I never said
i was going.

318
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,236
We're just
looking, honey.

319
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:37,239
We're looking, and
then you're going.

320
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:44,747
Here.

321
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:45,748
Hello?

322
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:47,249
Yes.

323
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,251
Oh, hi, marie.

324
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:51,754
No.

325
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,258
Oh, my god.

326
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:00,763
Where's rosalie?

327
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:03,265
She's right here.

328
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,767
She can't come
to the phone.

329
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,269
Tell her i'll be there
as soon as i can.

330
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,272
Oh, my god.

331
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:11,774
What is it?

332
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,275
Jackie jr. Was
shot to death.

333
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,278
At the boonton projects...
by drug dealers.

334
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,282
I'm going
over rosalie's.

335
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,795
You see?

336
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,808
Taco bell.

337
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:46,809
Hi.

338
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,810
Hey.

339
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,812
There's something
i gotta tell you.

340
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:50,813
I heard.

341
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,314
How?

342
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,817
Like mom's not totally
gonna tell me you
got expelled.

343
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,819
Not that.

344
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,822
I heard you cracked and
copped to everything.

345
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,824
They had my dna.

346
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,327
Moron, it takes
like six weeks to
get dna tests.

347
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:06,328
Shit.

348
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,830
I gotta go.

349
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,832
No, i didn't
tell you yet.

350
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:10,833
What?

351
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,836
Jackie, he was doing a drug
deal with some black dudes...

352
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,838
and they shot him.

353
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,340
He's like, dead.

354
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,351
22 years old,

355
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,353
living in a
housing project.

356
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,356
Imagine the sh
ame for the family?

357
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:43,866
Fortunately
they were no longer
boyfriend and girlfriend.

358
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,868
How's your daughter
taking it?

359
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,870
Not very well.

360
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,874
You certainly saw it comin
with this boy, didn't you?

361
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,379
In the end,
i failed him.

362
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,382
What the f
uck you gonna do?

363
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,885
World today...

364
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:05,387
i'll tell you
one thing though,

365
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:08,891
i'm not gonna make t
he same mistake with a. J.

366
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,392
He got expelled.

367
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:12,895
Him we're sendin
g to military school.

368
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,396
You know, we
never discussed

369
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,899
exactly what you want
for your children.

370
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,400
I don't want the
m to end up in boonton

371
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,902
with their face
blown off.

372
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,404
You followed your father
into his business.

373
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:23,906
I didn't have a choice.

374
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,409
I try to make sure my kids
have every opportunity.

375
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,912
Meadow's goin' to columbia
for chrissakes.

376
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:33,916
She's wants to be some kind
of a professional woman.

377
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,919
Like you.

378
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,921
A psychiatrist?

379
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,423
And have to listen to guys
like me whine all day?

380
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,929
She mentioned bein
g a pediatrician once.

381
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:47,930
You'd like that?

382
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,432
Yeah, i would, i would
like something like that.

383
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:53,936
But the important thing is
she get far away from me.

384
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,442
I mean, she
could live close.

385
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,444
I think i understand.

386
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:03,946
And your son?

387
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,948
A. J.?

388
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,952
In my business?
Forget it.

389
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:12,955
He'd never make it.

390
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,461
Your father an
d i have to drive a. J.

391
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,964
Up to hudson institute
for his interview.

392
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:25,467
I would feel much bett
er if you were up and moving.

393
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:26,969
Jackie's dead

394
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,972
and you perseverate
on secondary schools.

395
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,476
I was up half
the night with ro

396
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:37,479
and this morning
her sister and i

397
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,983
made all the
funeral arrangements.

398
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,985
Your brother doesn't
a have school.

399
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,987
He can't be allowed

400
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,989
to sit around chatting
all day on the web

401
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,992
with the other dropouts
and the flakes.

402
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,495
You know,

403
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:57,499
he's the first
person my own age,

404
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,502
that i knew,
that ever died.

405
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:06,008
He knew all the
risks involved.

406
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,510
What, the x?

407
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,513
Half the kids
i know take it.

408
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:13,515
They have to get
it from someone.

409
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,018
It's not something
you get killed over.

410
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,020
Except that he did.

411
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,021
Or not.

412
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:20,522
Meaning?

413
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,524
Look at who
he grew up with.

414
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:25,527
Look at who
his father was.

415
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:27,529
Look at everybody
we know.

416
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:28,530
Let's not get cute.

417
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,533
When i'm being cute,
i'll let you know.

418
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,042
You liked jackie,

419
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,544
so you don't want to believe
that he did this to himself.

420
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,046
So, like a lot
of other people

421
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,048
you go around looking for
boogie men to blame.

422
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,549
Boogie men
with italian names.

423
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,051
So whatever
you're thinking,

424
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:50,052
you just stop
thinking it right now

425
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:53,055
because that is
not what happened.

426
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:59,061
Left, left, left...

427
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,568
stealing an exam, that's quite
a personal defeat, isn't it?

428
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:08,070
It was wrong.

429
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,072
That sounds
pre- programmed.

430
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:12,074
That how you saw
your future self

431
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,076
when you were
a younger man,
a cheat?

432
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,577
No.

433
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:17,079
How do you
explain it?

434
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:21,083
There's like all thi
s academic pressure,

435
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,085
about gett
ing into college.

436
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,586
My school, they're
like obsessed.

437
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:26,588
There's like
academic pressure,

438
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,590
or academic pressure?

439
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,094
There's all this pressure,
my parents too.

440
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:35,097
My sister, she
goes to columbia

441
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:37,099
and i know my parents
expect me to go.

442
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,101
Around here we all call
that stinkin' thinkin'.

443
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,103
It's precisely the same
with an alcoholic.

444
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,105
No one makes him put that
drink to his lips but himself.

445
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,606
I'm not an
alcoholic.

446
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,608
How do we do things
differently here at hmi

447
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,110
than at your
former school?

448
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,611
I don't know.

449
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,614
I realize you don't know,
i'm about to tell you.

450
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:55,617
At your school, and
it's not a bad school.

451
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,119
You're right,

452
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,121
there's too much emphasis
on what's good for you.

453
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,623
What's good for johnny,
what's good for janey.

454
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:04,126
Here the higher good
is the good of the corps.

455
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:05,627
As general macarthur said

456
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:07,129
in his farewell address
at the point,

457
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,631
"the corps, the
corps, the corps."

458
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:12,134
Now, how do we achieve

459
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:16,138
this revolutionary change
in thinking on your part?

460
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:20,142
Cadet corps has first call
and formation, 0530 each day.

461
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:23,145
March in formation
to first mess, 0620,

462
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,147
followed by dorm
inspection, 0700.

463
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,149
Classes, 0800 to 1440.

464
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,651
Athletic formation, 1500,
except thursdays,

465
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,654
which is drill or
commander's time.

466
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:35,157
1900 to 2100 is
evening study time.

467
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:39,161
Taps, lights out, 2200
hours, what's missing?

468
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,663
Give up?
Television.

469
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,668
What's 0530 mean?

470
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,670
5:30 a. M.

471
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,672
I just outlined for you

472
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,175
a blueprint for
total self discipline

473
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:55,677
that would take you
through your entire life

474
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:58,680
and that's your
only question?

475
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,186
Why do guys in the
army or like spies

476
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:06,188
use that o- thing
when they tell time?

477
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:09,691
That'll be made
abundantly clear to you.

478
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:11,693
For now, we have an
expression around here,

479
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,695
keep it simple.

480
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,699
Capt. Delaunay?

481
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:21,703
Please give mr. Soprano
the standard t. O. I.

482
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,205
While i meet
with his parents.

483
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:25,207
Sir, yes, sir.

484
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,727
I, for one, think anthony
could greatly benefit
from our program,

485
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:50,232
which, as i candidly told
him is very rigorous.

486
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:54,236
Do you mind?

487
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:57,239
I will be very frank
with you, major zwingli.

488
00:25:57,239 --> 00:26:00,742
I do not agree with this
hard- nosed discipline.

489
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:03,245
The mother
s seldom do.

490
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,249
Wait till he starts
opening doors foryou

491
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,251
and pulling back
your chair.

492
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,752
That would b
e a miracle.

493
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:12,754
But, that's not even something
we thought we could hope for.

494
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,757
What about creativity, tony,
independent thought?

495
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:16,758
I stressed rat
her heavily with anthony

496
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,261
the notions of duty
and group think.

497
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,762
But, i didn't
for now mention to him

498
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,264
the army's
motto of today.

499
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,766
"Be an army of one."

500
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,268
Why be an army
at all?

501
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:27,769
How about a
veterinarian?

502
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,771
Isn't there enough war?

503
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,273
Amputees?

504
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,774
Horrible displaced--

505
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,776
jesus, he's just gonna
march around a little bit.

506
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,279
I wouldn't get too hung
up on the marching aspect.

507
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,780
It's part of it,

508
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,282
but it's nothing
compared to the mentoring

509
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,284
that comes through
small class size

510
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:45,287
and faculty involvement
in dorm life.

511
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,289
Well, that sounds
wonderful certainly.

512
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,291
We've created too many
options for our kids.

513
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,293
We can't blame the
m for being confused.

514
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:52,794
Then when
things go wrong,

515
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,796
we fob them off onto
the ever burgeoning

516
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:58,300
for profit substance
recovery industry.

517
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,803
This army of one thing,

518
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,805
what happens
when each army
of one decides...

519
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:06,808
fuck it, i not goin'
over the top of the foxhole,

520
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,811
or, why don't we just blow
the lieutenant's head off?

521
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,314
Because they've been
told, you know,

522
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:15,317
"you're an army of one".

523
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,819
I would submit audie murphy
was an army of one.

524
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,321
Is that what we're
preparing him for?

525
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,322
A career in
the military?

526
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,324
No, no!

527
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,826
One day at a time.

528
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:27,329
You want to
train him to be a
professional killer?

529
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,831
Oh, will you stop
? they're soldiers!

530
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,833
And the united states army
hardly goes to war anymore!

531
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,336
They were marching
with rifles, tony!

532
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:36,338
They're symbolic,
the barrels are plugged!

533
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:37,339
Symbolic of what?

534
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,341
Respect!

535
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:42,844
He will be subjected
to the discipline of kids

536
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,346
hardly older
than himself.

537
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:45,347
Does that
seem smart?

538
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,350
Boys his age still kil
l frogs and small animals.

539
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,352
The cusamano's binky?

540
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:52,354
The cherry bomb
with the nails in it,

541
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:53,355
you think
it was a. J.?

542
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,857
No, that is what i'm
trying to tell you!

543
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,860
He is still a chil
d, he's a normal child!

544
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:00,862
He's made some mistakes
and god knows,

545
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,864
he's got a shit lo
ad to learn about life!

546
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:05,367
That does not mean
that i'm gonna let you

547
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:08,370
send him to the type of school
whose whole reason for being,

548
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,872
is to make him
follow orders by
instilling fear!

549
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,874
He thinks the
world owes him a
fucking living!

550
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:16,378
What could have given him
that bizarre idea?

551
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,382
We tried it your way
for 15 years now.

552
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:22,384
With the berry brazleton,
the validating his feelings.

553
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,886
And that fuckin' school
did the same thing,

554
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:25,887
and what a surprise!

555
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,889
He thinks the world
runs on his feelings!

556
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:29,391
Well, he's gonna go
learn to be a man!

557
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,394
I will not send hi
m to that place!

558
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:36,898
Oh, no, fuck that,
allow me!

559
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,412
Fuck!

560
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:58,920
T...

561
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,425
about the
sit- down.

562
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,426
I haven't heard, and--

563
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:07,929
jesus christ, can i bury
my best friend's kid?

564
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,434
I am not
ready for this.

565
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:16,438
Okay, let's go,
we gotta do this.

566
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:18,440
Come here, you.

567
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:25,947
Rosalie?

568
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:27,449
Ro, honey?

569
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:28,950
Hi, sweetheart.

570
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,458
Ro...

571
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,460
i'm so sorry.

572
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,462
Mm- hmm,
place some more.

573
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,470
I'm so sorry
about your brother.

574
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:54,476
You remember my cousin
, mackenzie coluccio.

575
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:01,483
Oh, my god.

576
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:03,485
Here,
sit down.

577
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,991
It's alright.

578
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,493
Sit down.

579
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:23,004
A point and a quarter.

580
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,006
Would you listen
to me, moose?

581
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,509
It's very simple.

582
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:33,014
Look at this place.

583
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:36,017
Two days befor
e the super bowl

584
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:38,019
and nobody shows up.

585
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,021
That's not
true, mom.

586
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:44,526
You think i'd
remember, all my
years married to jack.

587
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:48,029
What happened, ton',
vegas moving the line?

588
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,031
...just make sure.

589
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:53,034
Point and a half.

590
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,053
Talk to you
a minute?

591
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,054
Russ?

592
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,556
Mr. Cozzarelli?

593
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:16,558
My partner and i
cut this.

594
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,059
Devotional music.

595
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,561
It's a little ragged,
it's a demo.

596
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,563
Christian contemporary.

597
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,065
I wish i had it for
my mother's funeral.

598
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,067
Tommy mottola at sony,

599
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,069
looks like he's gonna
offer us a deal.

600
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,081
Listen,
about jackie,

601
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:42,083
and you know, ralph.

602
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:46,087
How you handled that,
so it wouldn't stick
to any of us.

603
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,593
I'm only here out
of respect to you.

604
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:55,096
But i'm sorry i was
mooshada there.

605
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,599
And...

606
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,601
i appreciate that you
were looking out for me.

607
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,603
Oh, yeah?

608
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,605
You were close
to the kid, i know.

609
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,607
No, you don't know.

610
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:11,613
Anyway, what i said
about not loving you...

611
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:15,116
that's not
how it is.

612
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:51,152
Let's try it
your way.

613
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,159
I got here first?

614
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,160
Cocksucker.

615
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,162
Sit down, relax,
have a coffee.

616
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:03,164
He'll be here.

617
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,171
Well...

618
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,173
i think i go
t ma situated.

619
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,175
The brother
job home.

620
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,177
Nah, fuck that
, we went there.

621
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:19,180
Che poots,
i almost gagged.

622
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,684
Nah, we're gonna go
with green grove.

623
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,185
Based on your
recommendation, ton'.

624
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,687
I never
recommended it.

625
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:28,189
Yeah, you did,
when you had
your ma there.

626
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:31,192
By the way, did she ha
ve the silver bird package?

627
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,194
I dunno.

628
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,195
You know, sil,

629
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:36,698
it's the most expensive
nursing home in the state,

630
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,700
it's a retirement
community.

631
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,201
The level of care.

632
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,703
Ma was crying.

633
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,204
Eight grand
a month?

634
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:44,205
Who gi
ves a fuck?

635
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:46,207
You see a seeing eye
dog over here?

636
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,208
Cup full of pencils?

637
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,711
I'm not trying to insult
you, i'm just saying.

638
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:52,213
It'll be tough, bu
t i'll figure it out.

639
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:54,215
Worth every
fuckin' penny.

640
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,719
I'm the hero now, boy.

641
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:02,724
Hey.

642
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:04,225
You're late.

643
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,227
Well, tomorrow
i can be on time.

644
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,729
But you'll be
stupid forever.

645
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,231
Hey, hey,
sit down!

646
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:13,735
Sit the fuck down
and shut up!

647
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:17,739
You want
one of those?

648
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,741
No.

649
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:22,243
I was at my goomah's
all night.

650
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:24,245
Ro with the grief,
poor kid.

651
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,749
I can't get any sleep
there, it's incessant.

652
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:29,751
So...who wants
to talk first?

653
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:33,254
What's to fuck
in' talk about? I
'm owed that 50 gs.

654
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,256
A fuckin' alarm
code, 50 gs?

655
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:37,759
Five tops, maybe,
as a finder's fee!

656
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,761
Friggin' heist
fell in your lap.

657
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:41,763
You spend your days
fucking those fat pigs

658
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:44,265
in the outer office
at the carpenter's union.

659
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,267
Three mil a year,

660
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,269
from construction,
this family sees.

661
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,773
Alright, five's just
the negotiating platform,

662
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,275
take it easy.

663
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:56,778
It's not five,
we all know that.

664
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,780
His guys did
the heavy lifting.

665
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,283
Little paulie was good t
o go, fuckin' car never came.

666
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,286
They left him
waiting outside his
house like an asshole,

667
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,789
fuckin' 11 degree
weather.

668
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:16,297
Ralphie, give him 12k.

669
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:19,801
I can't believe this.

670
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,803
Why not?

671
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,805
Last year you believed
that flying saucer
was over east rutherford.

672
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,807
I'm not gonna
tell you again!

673
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,810
T, i'm asking yo
u to reconsider this.

674
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,312
Paulie, you
requested a sit- down,

675
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:32,313
he heard you out.

676
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:33,815
But, jesus fuckin' christ,

677
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,817
i'm leaving $38, 000
on the table.

678
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,318
Tony!

679
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:39,821
I had to park the car
all the way over there!

680
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,824
Ah...!

681
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:45,827
Sonofabitch!

682
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:51,833
C'mon, get up.

683
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:56,838
Miss?

684
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:57,839
Mm- hmm?

685
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,841
Can you tell me where i could
find something more dressy?

686
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,343
Not evening,
but muted?

687
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:04,846
I'll go look.

688
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:08,850
They have a great little
black dress i saw over there.

689
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,352
Mmm, those i have.

690
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,855
Thing is, it's
for a funeral.

691
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,857
Oh, i'm so sorry.

692
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,358
Yeah.

693
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:18,860
Guy was like 22.

694
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,361
Car accident?

695
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:22,363
Actually...
murder.

696
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:23,865
He was a cousin
of mine.

697
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:25,366
Anyway, last time
we went to a funeral,

698
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,368
my boyfriend bitched me
out over what i wore,

699
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,370
it was his boss'
mother's wake.

700
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,372
I said,"come on, you
think tony even noticed

701
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,374
for like one minute
what i had on?"

702
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:35,376
But he keeps on
about everything.

703
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:38,880
Oh, madonn', jesus.

704
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,381
Me, too.

705
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,885
I love blahniks, but the
y were killing me last night.

706
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,889
I was gonna go sit
with a starbucks.

707
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:48,890
So was i.

708
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,391
You wanna
go together?

709
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:50,892
Yeah.

710
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,393
Great.

711
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:53,895
Blahniks, th
ey are slim- line.

712
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:55,897
I was dancing,
my god.

713
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,398
But i'll tell you,
jimmy choos?

714
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:57,899
Ooh...

715
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,400
worse.

716
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,902
My name is danielle,
by the way.

717
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,404
I'm adriana, you
live in nutley?

718
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,406
If you're one of
the thousands of men

719
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:07,909
who suffer from
erectile dysfunction,

720
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,411
you already know that
it's no laughing matter.

721
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,412
Hey, i know this guy!

722
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:12,914
What you probabl
y don't know, however,

723
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,917
is that treatment is covered
by most medical plans.

724
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,919
I'm dr. Ira freid,

725
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,921
of the freid medical group.

726
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,423
Be it viagra, penile
enhancement surgery...

727
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,927
imagine, needing
an operation like that.

728
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:28,429
I can help you
increase the length,

729
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:30,431
girth, and vitality,

730
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:32,433
of what occurred
naturally.

731
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,936
My associates and i
have offices

732
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,438
conveniently located
throughout the tri- state area.

733
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,941
Our discretion
is assured.

734
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,443
Ho, it's sergeant bilko.

735
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:43,945
Tony.

736
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,947
You're right,
i'm sorry.

737
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,949
Just thought we shouldn't
get too gloomy about this.

738
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,450
My god,
anthony.

739
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,452
Your dress grays.
You know what?

740
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:52,954
You look
very handsome.

741
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:54,455
She's right,
you do.

742
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:55,456
Yeah, right.

743
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:57,458
No, i'm serious.

744
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,961
Tight suit like that,
it shows off your lats.

745
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:01,963
Put on the hat?

746
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:02,964
No way.

747
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:03,965
Oh, please?

748
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:05,967
He looked so cute at
the uniform company.

749
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,969
You're not gonna
sew the hat.

750
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:09,470
Just put the hat on
for your mother.

751
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,471
No!

752
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:12,473
What did you say?

753
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,979
Look at that.

754
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:21,482
I'm serious, you
look very impressive.

755
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:24,986
Oh, my god, if i wasn't
already married.

756
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,493
I look like
a total jerk- off.

757
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:34,996
You do not.

758
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:39,000
What are you,
crying?

759
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,002
I don't want
to go there.

760
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,503
You need
toughenin' up!

761
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:43,504
Tony.

762
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,510
Stand up
straight, okay?

763
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,012
I'm standing
fucking straight!

764
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:54,015
You keep it up,
goddamnit!

765
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,025
I think...

766
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:07,528
i think the hat
goes in the crook
of your arm here.

767
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:09,530
Like that.

768
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:12,533
You look good.

769
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,543
Oh, my god.

770
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:24,045
A. J.?

771
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:25,546
Anthony!

772
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,048
Get some water
or something.

773
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,550
My son...

774
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:33,554
has panic attacks.

775
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:38,559
Obviously we can't send him
to military school...

776
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,063
pediatrician said.

777
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:47,568
He's got that putrid, rotten,
fucking soprano gene.

778
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:52,573
It's a slight tic in his
fight- flight response.

779
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:57,578
It doesn't brand
him as anything.

780
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,583
It comes down
through the ages.

781
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:06,587
I remember hearing about my
great great great grandfather.

782
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,589
He drove a mule cart
off a mountain road.

783
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:11,592
He was transporting th
ese valuable jugs of olive oil.

784
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:14,595
Probably was
a panic attack.

785
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:17,098
When you blame your genes,

786
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:20,101
you're really
blaming yourself.

787
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:23,104
And, that's what we
should be talking about.

788
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:26,107
Fuckin'
verbum dei school.

789
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:29,110
Turns out
it happened before,

790
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,612
but they
didn't tell us.

791
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:33,114
Idiot nurse.

792
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:36,117
She diagnosed
it as dehydration from
football practice.

793
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:39,620
Can you believe they didn't
inform the parents?

794
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,623
I'm not a litigigus person,
or whatever the fuck.

795
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,625
I prefer to resolve
things directly,

796
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:47,628
but this tim
e i'm gonna sue!

797
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:51,132
Well, that's
your right.

798
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,648
Anthony?

799
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,158
You don't understand.

800
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:19,660
Make me understand.

801
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,663
We can't send him
to that place.

802
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:24,665
Yes?

803
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:26,667
How are we gonna
save this kid?

804
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:54,195
Your mother!

805
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:56,197
C'mon, let's go.

806
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:58,199
Silvio manford dante?

807
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,700
At a funeral?

808
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,203
Det. Filemon francis,
essex county sheriff's dept.

809
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,205
You're under arres
t for violation title 2- c,

810
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,207
chapter 37
, section two,

811
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,209
of the new jersey penal
code, promoting gambling.

812
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,710
Every fuckin'
super bowl,

813
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,213
d. A. Grabs a few
popcorn headlines.

814
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:13,714
Here, go'head.

815
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,216
Last year
i made bail so fast

816
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:17,218
my soup was still warm
when i got home.

817
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:19,720
Alright, c'mon,
keep moving.

818
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,250
Jesus christ,
you told me 11:00!

819
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,251
I'm sorry!

820
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:51,752
"Sorry", that's
all i hear.

821
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,755
Junior, look.

822
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,261
Junior!

823
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:02,263
Junior, don't
leave me!

824
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,770
In sure an
d certain hope

825
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,772
of the resurrectio
n to eternal life

826
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,774
through our lord
jesus christ,

827
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:15,776
we commend
to almighty god,

828
00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:21,282
our brother, giaco
mo michael aprile jr.

829
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:23,784
And we commit his
body to the ground.

830
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:28,789
No!

831
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:38,799
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

832
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:40,801
The lord bless him
and keep him.

833
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,304
The lord make his face
to shine upon him

834
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:45,306
and be gracious to him.

835
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,808
The lord lift up his
countenance upon him

836
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,810
and give him peace.

837
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:59,320
Someone from the famil
y should go down to artie's.

838
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,821
Stop thinking, ro.

839
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:01,822
Let's get you
to bed.

840
00:44:02,323 --> 00:44:04,325
He opened up the
restaurant for us.

841
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:07,328
All those
people down there.

842
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:33,354
So med, was he
dealing while you
guys were dating?

843
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:34,355
Hey, mackenzie,

844
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,856
why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

845
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:37,358
I was
just asking.

846
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:38,859
Please, okay?

847
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,362
My brother's whole
stupid pathetic dream

848
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,864
was to follow in our
father's footsteps.

849
00:44:43,864 --> 00:44:46,367
I gotta paint
a picture?

850
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,370
He was killed by some fat
fuck in see- through socks.

851
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,872
Take your pick,
they all look alike.

852
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,876
Actually, kelli,

853
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,878
you really have
no basis to say that.

854
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:01,882
We used to joke around
about our families.

855
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:03,884
What happened
to you?

856
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:08,389
I know this is a really
painful time for you,

857
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:12,393
but your brother's
best friend was an
israeli x dealer.

858
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:14,395
I met him.

859
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:17,398
Wow, so, it was
international.

860
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,400
Let's just
drop it, okay?

861
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,404
Yeah, right.

862
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:25,406
I mean, if my dad
still controlled

863
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:27,908
all the crime in
north jersey like
your dad does now,

864
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:29,910
i'd probably want
to drop it too.

865
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,413
But then, it might
not have happened.

866
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:35,916
Wait, this
is way beyond...

867
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,419
our dads are in the
garbage business

868
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:39,920
and it's always
good for a laugh,

869
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,423
and yeah, they brush u
p against organized crime.

870
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,925
But you think they
control every slimeball
and illegal gun

871
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:48,429
in like a hundred
communities?

872
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:51,432
The fact that you
would even say thi
s in front of an outsider

873
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,434
is amazing tome.

874
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:57,938
Jesus chri
st, some loyalty?

875
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:01,442
Their names, etched
forever in history.

876
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:05,446
Their hands, around football's
most revered trophy.

877
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:06,947
Immortalized...

878
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,951
how are you?

879
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:12,953
Want a drink?

880
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:15,956
I gotta go,
ma's alone.

881
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:33,474
He's having a
full dinner, huh?

882
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,477
I'm done already.
It's good gravy today.

883
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:40,481
Sad day.

884
00:46:40,481 --> 00:46:42,983
Mm- hmm.

885
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:44,985
Kid was always a dumb
fuck, though, wasn't he?

886
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:47,988
Didn't he almost drown
in three inches of water?

887
00:46:47,988 --> 00:46:50,991
The penguin exhibit.

888
00:46:50,991 --> 00:46:54,495
Jack tried to lay
off all jackie's problems

889
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:56,997
on a learnin
g disorder, but...

890
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:02,002
stupidity would be
a learning disorder,
wouldn't it?

891
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,004
Look at this
crappy turnout.

892
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:06,507
You know, if jackie sr.
Was still acting boss,

893
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,509
with a child passed away?

894
00:47:08,509 --> 00:47:10,511
This place would be
filled to the rafters.

895
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:12,513
Flower cars up and
down the block.

896
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:15,015
No matter what
the boy had done.

897
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,017
Now...

898
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:28,028
bobby says me you're out
from under the house arrest.

899
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:30,030
Congratulations.

900
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,533
My fuckin' lawyer was
finally able to demonstrate

901
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:34,535
i don't pose
a flight risk.

902
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:36,537
Flight risk.

903
00:47:36,537 --> 00:47:38,038
I been farting into
the same sofa cushion

904
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:40,040
for the last
18 months.

905
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,042
The rico trial's
coming up though.

906
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:45,045
At least you're ou
t, and you're eating
regular food again.

907
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,548
Fucking illness changed
my whole viewpoint.

908
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:50,551
I'm gonna stop
and smell the roses.

909
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,553
We all should.

910
00:47:52,553 --> 00:47:55,055
What the fuck?

911
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,065
In the museum of noses,

912
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:07,067
there goes the
friggin' mona lisa.

913
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:09,570
The fuck you doing
out here?

914
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,071
Ginny thinks i quit.

915
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,573
Jesus christ.

916
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:15,576
Fuckin' underboss of a
five families' family.

917
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:17,578
Ginny can get heavy.

918
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,084
What's the matter?

919
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:26,086
Ah, nothin'.

920
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:28,088
You could tell
uncle john.

921
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,590
Fuckin' tony.

922
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,092
He knows my
mother's ill,

923
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:35,095
then he rules against me
in this morristown bullshit.

924
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:36,597
Maybe you heard
about it.

925
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:38,599
I don't stick
my beak in.

926
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,101
Since ralphie's bringing him
all this esplanade scharrol,

927
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:43,103
you'd think i
was carrying a
load in my pants,

928
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:45,105
the way tony sticks his
nose up when i'm around.

929
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:47,107
I'm not insensitive.

930
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:49,109
I hurt too.

931
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:52,112
You think tony pla
ys favorites like that?

932
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:53,614
What do i say
to ma?

933
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:56,617
She thinks she's going
to this paradise
of nursing homes.

934
00:48:56,617 --> 00:48:59,119
Same one his mother put
her fuckin' feet up at

935
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,120
for a year,
by the way.

936
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:02,122
Don't confuse money
with caring.

937
00:49:02,122 --> 00:49:03,624
Look how he
treated her.

938
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:07,127
I mean, he's my de
ar friend, but, comeon.

939
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:08,629
I was just saying
that to junior.

940
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,632
That maybe tony fundamentally
don't respect the elderly.

941
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:13,634
You said tha
t to junior?

942
00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:15,636
What are you making,
minest'?

943
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:20,140
You know,
carmine, too,

944
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,142
sometimes he gets very
frustrated with tony

945
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:24,645
and ralphie,
that generation.

946
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:27,147
He thinks the whol
e esplanade thing,
rich as it is,

947
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:29,149
wasn't handled
right risk- wise.

948
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:31,151
How is carmine?

949
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:35,155
He asks about you.

950
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:36,657
Give him my love.

951
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:38,659
I will, he'll like
hearing that.

952
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:42,162
He's not as
well as he could
be either, you know.

953
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:46,166
If there's ever anything
i can do, anything,

954
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:48,669
he shouldn't
hesitate.

955
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:51,171
I'll tell him.

956
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,177
You okay?

957
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,179
Yeah.

958
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:05,686
You had a few drinks
over there.

959
00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:10,691
We all
could useit.

960
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:16,196
I was thinking
before.

961
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:18,699
About what
you once said,

962
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:20,701
how you have to max
out the good times

963
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,704
with the people you love.

964
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:27,708
God, am i learning that
that like is so true.

965
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,710
Actually your father
said that.

966
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:37,217
Anyway, look how people
deal with each other.

967
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:40,721
Even families,
like jackie's family.

968
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:41,722
What about them?

969
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:44,224
They were never
there for him.

970
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:47,728
I mean, aunt ro's sweet,
but she's like, hello.

971
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:50,230
And uncle jackie?

972
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,232
So narcissistic.

973
00:50:52,232 --> 00:50:54,735
They let him do
whatever he wanted.

974
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:56,236
When you'd
ask him, like,

975
00:50:56,236 --> 00:50:58,238
"aren't you afraid what
your parents are gonna say?"

976
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:00,741
About i dunno,
whatever.

977
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,744
And he would just go,
"they don't give a shit."

978
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,249
But i think it hurt
his feelings inside.

979
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:12,252
Well, i'm glad
you see.

980
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:15,255
Yeah, right.

981
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:17,257
You're glad i see.

982
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:18,258
What you
take from this

983
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:20,260
is an excuse to get
intrusive and controlling.

984
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,763
That is not what i'm
talking about, jesus!

985
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:24,765
What did i say?

986
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:28,769
Meadow, you're out
from under our roof.

987
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:31,271
A. J. , then, you'll
use it against him.

988
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:34,274
"Against him"?

989
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:36,276
I'm sorry
i said anything.

990
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,282
The young bearde
d stranger turns,

991
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:44,785
the rabbi goes,
"don't touch me, i
'm on total disability."

992
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:58,298
They're back!

993
00:52:32,332 --> 00:52:33,834
When'd you
get here?

994
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,335
Just now.

995
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:50,851
Come on, junior,
sing it!

996
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:54,354
Come on,
come on!

997
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,361
C'mon,
let's go!

998
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:06,867
What the hell.

999
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:13,874
I beat cancer.

1000
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:15,876
Now i'm gonna
beat the can.

1001
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:23,884
Nah, that's too high,
bring it down.

1002
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:25,886
What is this?

1003
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:27,888
What's that?

1004
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:29,890
Cosmo.

1005
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,392
He's not bad when
he's had a few'bucas.

1006
00:53:32,392 --> 00:53:33,894
He's shit- faced.

1007
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:35,896
Don't laugh.

1008
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,502
Hold this.

1009
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:25,505
Yeah, yeah, i'm
going, i'm going.

1010
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,512
C'mere!

1011
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:34,514
Did you hear me?

1012
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:36,516
I said,
c'mere!

1013
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:41,021
This is
such bullshit!

1014
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:45,025
Meadow!

1015
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:55,535
Hey, guys, let's go.

1016
00:55:56,036 --> 00:55:57,037
C'mon.

1017
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:07,047
Back to school
i guess.

1018
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:09,049
Did you give her
money for the bus?

1019
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,551
I dunno, she's
got her purse.

1020
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:14,054
She'll be alright.

1021
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:28,068
Stand still
and be quiet.

1022
00:57:01,101 --> 00:57:03,603
What's that mean,
cuore ingrata?

1023
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:06,606
Ungrateful heart.
