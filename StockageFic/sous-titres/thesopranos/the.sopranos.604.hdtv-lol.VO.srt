1
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,050
The fleshy part of the thigh

2
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>i'll be as fast as i can.</i>

3
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,282
Jesus christ.
I'll never get
Used to seeing that.

4
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,117
Won't have to
Much longer.

5
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,578
Got you scheduled
For surgery tomorrow.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,622
<i>finally close you up.</i>

7
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,082
<i>- more surgery?
- it's a good sign.</i>

8
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,335
Dr. Plepler doesn't think
He'll need access anymore.

9
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,550
<i>- watch it with
 the morphine, now.</i>

10
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,479
Beautiful thought.
Who put that up?

11
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,522
My sister.
Who else?

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,443
Why you keep it up there
If you don't find it
Inspirational?

13
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:33,027
My daughter likes it.

14
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,698
Everybody keeps telling me
How lucky i am.

15
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,244
You are.
Septic shock?
As long as you were out?

16
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,579
Attending staff
Gave you 20 to one.

17
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,164
You read the paper?

18
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,416
My own uncle
Puts me through this.

19
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,297
New gunshot.
Rapper. Da lux.

20
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,632
He's hot.

21
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,759
Got shot seven times
Coming out of a club.

22
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,721
He's still got
All his pancreas, though.

23
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,516
All done.

24
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,686
Fiona.

25
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,356
Look,
I've been feeling...

26
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,776
I don't know,

27
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,238
Not myself,

28
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,991
Since i woke up
From the coma.

29
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,871
My thoughts keep
Running away with me.

30
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,249
These feelings?
They'll pass.

31
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,960
It's very common
In post-surgical
Patients.

32
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,088
Maybe you'd like
To talk to someone.
Social worker?

33
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,852
<i>hey babe, how ya feeling?</i>

34
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,187
Oh, good good.

35
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,107
That candy striper out there,
There's not much of a selection.

36
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,819
There was something
On "sink the bismarck,"
But half the pages were gone.

37
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,613
But you like dinosaurs.

38
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,241
Having surgery tomorrow.

39
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,994
They say they're
Closing me up.

40
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,390
Gus!

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,559
Jason,

42
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,436
My condolences.

43
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,231
Your dad was
The best boss
Any of us ever had.

44
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,733
We're sad to hear
You're selling
The company.

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,151
I've been going
Over the books.

46
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,403
We're paying
An anthony soprano

47
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,447
The second highest salary
In the company.

48
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,491
He's a consultant.

49
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,992
Where do i reach him?

50
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,454
I want to make some changes,
But his office is
Full of junk.

51
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,706
There's a 55-horse
Johnson outboard
On the desk.

52
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,542
Looks like nobody's
Ever there.

53
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,669
He's in the hospital.

54
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,840
You should talk
To his colleague,
Mr. Gaultieri.

55
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,551
<i>paulie?</i>

56
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,221
<i>Oh, tony soprano.
Of course.</i>

57
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,598
I knew him when i was a kid.
He was a friend
Of the family.

58
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,352
I'm having surgery tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to eat!

59
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,106
You fucking
Believe this?

60
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,650
Always something.

61
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,571
So anyway,
She was crying
The entire night

62
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,281
And i didn't get
Any sleep.

63
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,158
Why don't you ride
On the fucking zephyrs
And sleep on a cloud?

64
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,120
What, you think
I put that up there?

65
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,831
- i didn't.
- right. Who did?

66
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,130
Hello. I can't hear--

67
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,756
Yeah-- talk louder!

68
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,260
Nanny.

69
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,638
Between the reception
And her language skills...

70
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,568
I suppose you got
A little choo-choo train
At home, huh?

71
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,821
Takes your toast
Right from the kitchen,
Delivers it to your bedroom?

72
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,368
Look, ton'-- i'm sorry about what
Happened with junior and the
Shooting, but--

73
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,704
Don't mention junior
To me ever again.

74
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,460
I'll tell you this, bobby.
You can't hide behind this
Brother-in-law shit forever.

75
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,629
You're an okay guy,

76
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,173
But each and every man
Is judged on his own merit.

77
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,770
<i>- have you
 heard the good news?</i>

78
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,063
- jesus christ!

79
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,356
That's right.

80
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,733
Aaron arkaway,
Jan's friend.

81
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:43,904
Oh yeah, right.

82
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,823
We're protesting
Downstairs and...

83
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,285
I saw jan in the elevator
This morning. She told me
You were up here.

84
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,247
That's what all
That yelling and
Singing is?

85
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,874
The druggist
From the hospital
Pharmacy was fired

86
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,794
For refusing
To fill birth control
Prescriptions.

87
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,629
We're trying
To get his job back.

88
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,382
Tony, this is
Our prayer leader,
Bob brewster.

89
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:04,842
Hi,

90
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,677
aaron's told me
A lot about you.

91
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,387
I thought we'd come up
And pray with you.

92
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,765
- bottom feeding, huh?
- it's where the big fish are.

93
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,020
Son of a fuckin' bitch!

94
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,402
They cut my morphine,

95
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,320
Trying to wean me off.

96
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,364
You know,

97
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,242
I've seen
People delivered from
Unbelievable pain...

98
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,160
Myself included.

99
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>- oh yeah?
- i was at rock bottom.</i>

100
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,292
I  was addicted
To cocaine and strippers.

101
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,962
Then  i lost my wife
And i crashed my car,
Drunk.

102
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:46,216
Ended  up upside down,
Hanging by my seatbelt,
Completely terrified.

103
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,511
<i>then i prayed
for god to save me.
- and he came in.</i>

104
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:51,847
<i>- praise him.
and in that moment,
i was reborn.</i>

105
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,391
And i see you there
And i know you're hurting.

106
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,728
And the answer
Is to accept the lord
As your personal savior.

107
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,441
Well i got
All this covered, you know,
With my parish priest.

108
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,651
That's  great,
But what god wants

109
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,612
Is for you
To love him directly,

110
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,823
Not necessarily through
The intercession of liturgy

111
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,325
Or any human agent.

112
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,620
Is this
Aaron arkaway?

113
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,746
- hey.

114
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,581
- what are you fellas
doing here?

115
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,916
- mrs. Soprano.

116
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,918
We were just dialoguing
With your husband.

117
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,794
We were about to pray.

118
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,006
<i>- they were.
- you're having
 surgery tomorrow.</i>

119
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,009
You know they've done
Clinical studies about
The power of prayer.

120
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,888
Prayed-for patients
Have 11% fewer
Complications.

121
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,641
I  have read that.
It does help to pray.

122
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,476
I mean even if it just
Takes your mind off it.

123
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,269
Dear jesus...

124
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,649
<i>hear these words
and bestow your loving,
healing grace</i>

125
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,484
Upon our injured friend.

126
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,111
Lord, help heal his wounds
And help him

127
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,738
With your cleansing love.

128
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,157
Where sin abounds,

129
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,618
Grace abounds even more.

130
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,454
- amen.
- amen.

131
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,718
So, reverend,
Let me, uh--

132
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,305
Let me ask you about
This guy not selling
Birth control.

133
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,475
He should be free
To exercise his moral
Convictions

134
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,561
Without suffering
Loss of livelihood.

135
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,606
Well here's
What i'm getting at--
I'm-- i'm...

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,109
I'm worried
About viagra.

137
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,613
The way i see it, i'm gonna need
Plenty of that, considering
My condition and...

138
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,326
What if somebody decides
That viagra is wrong
And god don't like it?

139
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,414
Well, god loves
Procreation.

140
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,499
<i>no one's saying
anything against viagra.</i>

141
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,914
Birth control in the name
Of the morning-after pill
Is a sin

142
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:48,426
Because it strikes
At life, at the unborn.

143
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,549
<i>yeah but what if somebody
goes after viagra?</i>

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,132
I'm not talking about procreation
And listen up, 'cause this affects
You too.

145
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,433
Something like viagra
Will never be an issue.

146
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:59,477
Excuse me, but at one time
They were going after booze,

147
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,895
And as a proprietor
Of a drinking and eating
Establishment,

148
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,646
<i>i take this stuff
very seriously.</i>

149
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,648
Strip club,
I believe it is.

150
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,442
- oh, you've been
to the bing?
- no

151
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,485
He should rest.

152
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,614
Thank you so much
For coming, pastor,
And aaron.

153
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,115
Thank you so much
For your prayer.

154
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,993
- sure.
- yeah, really i...

155
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,915
- i really appreciate it.
- bye, guys.
praise god.

156
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,511
- what are you, a wise ass?
- what?

157
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,846
What'd i do?

158
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,066
- oh my god.

159
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,484
- what is it, doctor?

160
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,444
- i just found jimmy hoffa.

161
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,741
In montana,
The fossilized remains
Of a tyrannosaurus rex

162
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,786
Yielded soft tissue that
Indicated a definite link

163
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,330
Between dinosaurs
And modern birds.

164
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,790
- look who i got here.

165
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,793
- ho, the sanitation prince.

166
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,921
Hi, tony. I'm sorry
You're not feeling well.

167
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:11,964
Thank you.

168
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,382
Sorry about your loss.

169
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,884
Your father and i
Were very close.

170
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,222
Remember my daughter
Meadow? Jason barone.

171
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,349
- hi.
- hey.

172
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,352
<i>remember
when you were a kid,</i>

173
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,273
At that field box
At shea, opening day?

174
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,442
Me, you, your dad
And paulie here?

175
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,195
Oh yeah. Kingman was
Just back from the cubs.

176
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:38,574
Mookie wilson hit
That foul tip, beaned
That guy in the loge.

177
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,701
- i gotta get to the office.
finn's picking me up.

178
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,245
- i'll be back later.

179
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,454
- sweetheart,

180
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,123
Thank you
For everything.

181
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,085
Okay.
Don't wear him out.

182
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,255
She wants to be a doctor.

183
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,549
Also considering law.

184
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,806
So, you're living
In deer valley?

185
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,600
Yeah, ski instructor.

186
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,062
So, paulie tells me
You're thinking of selling

187
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,606
Your father's business
To chuckie cinelli.

188
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,025
Yeah, i think it's
The best thing for mom.

189
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,153
And  of course, tony,
There'd be a severance
Package for you.

190
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,741
- frankly, jason, i don't think
You should sell the business right
Now.

191
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:24,328
<i>there's a lot
of potential buyers
out there.</i>

192
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,247
When i get out
Of the hospital,
Run the numbers,

193
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,916
Get you
The best price.

194
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,626
No, cinelli's offer
Seemed fair.

195
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,753
<i>there's lots of things
to take into account.</i>

196
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,963
- you even know
what your ebitda is?
- my what?

197
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:39,551
Earnings  before interest,
Taxes, depreciation
And amortization.

198
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,305
Gives the true picture
Of a company's
Profitability.

199
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,976
Jas', you let me
Handle this.

200
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,646
I don't want
To see you get hurt.

201
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,023
The carting business--

202
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,150
It's a different
Corporate culture.

203
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:57,861
You're  tired, t.

204
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,987
We'll leave.
Come on.

205
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,074
All right.

206
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:03,992
Bye, tony.

207
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,923
We're afraid
She doesn't have
Long left.

208
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,008
I'm surprised she
Didn't call ma.

209
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,594
Well she asked
Specifically
To see you.

210
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,315
Ooh, madonn'.

211
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,693
Paulie.

212
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,862
Aunt dottie.

213
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,363
Hold on a sec'.

214
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,449
- it's chilly in here.
- i'm burning up.

215
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,784
i'm burning up.

216
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,620
I brought you
Some pignolis and...

217
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,083
A new pair of those
Speedo skin-diver
Socks you like.

218
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,294
Look at those.
The treads are all gone.

219
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,047
You slip
On the linoleum again,
Then where are we?

220
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,717
- paulie, i gotta tell you--
- just a sec.

221
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,761
Sister, please
Give me a hand here.

222
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,514
Put these
On my aunt, will ya?

223
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,475
Paulie,
You should know...

224
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,686
- speak up, aunt dot.
- i was...

225
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,814
- i was a bad girl.

226
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,567
- how could you be a bad girl?
- you're a nun.

227
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:20,527
- these are too small.

228
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,447
No they ain't.
They're supposed to be snug
So she don't slip.

229
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:24,907
<i>- put 'em on.
- paulie...</i>

230
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,868
During the war,
I was still a novitiate.

231
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,829
I was helping out
At the u.s.o.,

232
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,583
And there was
This soldier-- russ.

233
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,836
And he was
So lonely--

234
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,255
Aunt dottie,
If this is going
Where i think,

235
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,299
Maybe you should
Talk to a priest.

236
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,009
I got pregnant.

237
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,303
- i had a baby.
- a baby?

238
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,140
Listen to her.
The alzheimer's
Is gettin' to her.

239
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,769
You didn't have
No baby.

240
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,855
I did.
I did have a baby.

241
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,607
Paulie...

242
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,442
It was you.

243
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,403
You're my son.

244
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:05,906
But...

245
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:09,993
But ma...?

246
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,956
Marianuccia
Is your aunt.

247
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,251
<i>i'm your ma.</i>

248
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,339
I was a bad girl.

249
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,221
Good afternoon, mr. Soprano.
How are you doing?

250
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,473
- better now.

251
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,100
- i'm glad to hear that.

252
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,770
Where they been
Keepin' you?

253
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,649
The other doctors around here--
It's like the united colors
Of benetton.

254
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,609
I'm not a doctor.

255
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,528
I'm a utilization
Review specialist.

256
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,697
I represent
Your insurance carrier.

257
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,116
It's my job,
Together with
Your physicians,

258
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,035
To see how fast we can
Get you out of this
Place and back home.

259
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,706
Well this is good.
They've closed
Your incision

260
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:59,084
And you're ambulatory
Now and i see they
Got the foley out.

261
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:02,921
You wanna kick
Me out of here.

262
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,799
Well a hospital stay
Costs a lot of money.

263
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,510
My  bowels don't work.
I'm in pain.

264
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,596
I just got operated on,
For christ's sake.

265
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,015
Perhaps your bowels
Would be working better

266
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,059
If you hadn't tried to eat
The sausage sandwich on 3/28.

267
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,396
I don't believe this.
With all the money i've been
Contributing over the years,

268
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,231
You  wanna put me
In the street.

269
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,026
Look, you think
We're the enemy,

270
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,070
But if you hadn't had insurance,
You would have ended up
At the county hospital.

271
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,449
It's a good thing that you had your
Card with you when they performed
The wallet biopsy.

272
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,284
- the what?
- in the ambulance.

273
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,579
If  you hadn't had your card with you,
They would have dropped your butt
At martin luther king.

274
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,581
The "wallet biopsy"?

275
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,250
Get out of my room,
You sick cunt.

276
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,011
You're doing great.

277
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,974
Mrs.oprano?
Doctor taschlin's
On the phone for you.

278
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,602
Can you sit here
For a minute, ton'?

279
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,229
Yeah, i'm winded.

280
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,234
He says he's
Downhearted.

281
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,860
I  tried to explain
To him

282
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,904
There's an upside
To everything.

283
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,533
I know it's
A difficult struggle,

284
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,826
But let's lead
With some good news
For a change.

285
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:19,331
Yeah. "armor gettin'" cd
Is now charting
Number five, arrow up.

286
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,376
Look, frankly the shooting
Couldn't have come
At a better time.

287
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,086
Yeah,
But it really hurts.

288
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,713
Sure it does, baby boy.
Sure it does, but check it.

289
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,717
Seven caps!
Tupac ain't get near that.

290
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,845
And 50,
He only got two more.

291
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,388
<i>yeah, but it really hurts.</i>

292
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,390
It's helping considerably
With the street cred,

293
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,434
Which, as you know,
Has always been something
Of a problem

294
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,187
Because you had
A job all those years.

295
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,773
I'm gonna
Lose my thumb?

296
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,984
Special hand surgeon
Coming in.

297
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,736
<i>you gonna be
all right, lux.</i>

298
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,116
Don't put on that face.
It don't make me weep.

299
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,160
Keep your eyes
To yourself,
You sexy freak.

300
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,162
Nah, i like it better.

301
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,165
Keep your eyes
To yourself, bitch.
I'm on a murder streak.

302
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,626
- word, word.
- yeah, kinda warn her ass,
you know what i mean?

303
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,087
- yeah, that's fine.
- you writing a song, huh?

304
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,174
I always wondered
How it was done.

305
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,800
Like this here.

306
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,678
<i>are you a rap star
my son would know?</i>

307
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,471
Da lux gonna
Produce my album.

308
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,390
Then he gets shot.

309
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,893
Make him gangsta
Number one.

310
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,936
It's like he losing
Focus on my shit.

311
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,564
My son says he's
More popular than ever
'Cause of it.

312
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,941
What i know is
I ain't gonna have...

313
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,027
No major release
This year.

314
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,636
Paulie,
I won $40 at keno.

315
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,558
Is there something
You wanna tell me about?

316
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,185
What?

317
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,772
I just saw aunt dottie,
And guess what?

318
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,149
Turns out she's not my aunt.

319
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,109
Turns out she's my mother.

320
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,819
No, that's not true.

321
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,697
Don't bullshit me. You been bullshitting
Me my entire life.

322
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,158
- paulie.
- it's true, isn't it?

323
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,369
<i>isn't it?</i>

324
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,080
Son of a bitch!

325
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,542
Oh how i dreaded
This day.

326
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,252
I  gave you
Everything!

327
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,254
I gave you
A son's love,

328
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,214
All under
False pretense.

329
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,299
- no.
- you're a fraud,

330
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,676
And a phony.

331
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,261
And she's even worse.

332
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,637
She's a whore.

333
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,389
My mother's
A fuckin' whore!

334
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,516
Don't say that.
She was a young girl.

335
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,269
She wanted to be a nun,
But she got in trouble.

336
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,980
And you helped her out,
Cooked up this little scheme.

337
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,690
Forget  who gets victimized!

338
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,317
I loved you.
I always loved you.

339
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,169
There he is. I've been thinking
About your problem.

340
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,505
<i>Maybe it would help you
If you got shot.</i>

341
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,550
Fuck you talking 'bout?
"got shot"?

342
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,345
Make you more popular too,
You know raise your profile
With ex lax.

343
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,056
Something easy.
The fleshy part
Of the thigh.

344
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,349
- i'm a marksman.

345
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,351
- you's a crazy
motherfucker.

346
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:44,995
Excuse me.

347
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,164
Hi.
You're a friend
Of anthony's.

348
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,166
I was just about
To visit him.
How's he doing?

349
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,586
He's in a lot better shape
Than those fuckin' nuns
You got up there.

350
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,466
<i>put away such memories.</i>

351
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:01,053
<i>between father and son,
there is a bridge</i>

352
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,098
<i>which neither time
nor death--
Hey, i got phil leotardo downstairs</i>

353
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,558
This show...

354
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,896
Used to watch it all the time when
I was a little kid.
- what about it?

355
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,316
- the bridge of which i speak, grasshopper.

356
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,531
- you want me
to bring him up?
- no.

357
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,157
Help me out of here.

358
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,294
Hold on.

359
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,089
Easy easy.

360
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,302
Ho! Where the fuck
You going?

361
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,679
Sorry, ton'.

362
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,857
Hope you got
Some sleep last night.

363
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,150
I was snoring
Like a son of a bitch.

364
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,280
Oh, i hope you got
Some sleep. I was cutting
Farts like sonic booms.

365
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,115
John schwinn.

366
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,908
Oh, bicycle heir.

367
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,119
Unfortunately no relation.

368
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,372
I was just a foot soldier
At bell labs.

369
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,915
Oh, you guys
Invented stereo.

370
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,377
- tony soprano.

371
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,753
What're you in for?

372
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,505
- sinus infection.

373
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:22,092
They were going to enlarge
The opening in my lower
Right maxillary sinus,

374
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,053
And then they saw
Some stuff they didn't like,

375
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,638
So they're running tests.

376
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,724
Another guinea pig.

377
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,478
Thank you
For giving my kid
That cd.

378
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:34,980
Tony soprano?

379
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,944
- original g.
- yeah, whatever.

380
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,614
Why don't you come by
My joint later on tonight?

381
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,283
Gonna have the fight
On satellite.

382
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,171
Not even a courtesy call,
And you try to poach my company?

383
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,382
No disrespect, tony.
You've been in a coma.

384
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,259
That give you
Carte blanche?

385
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,555
It's that fucking john.

386
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,349
He's sitting in the can.

387
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:13,352
<i>the feds are trying to take
everything he's got.
- he's in a panic state.</i>

388
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,521
- i'm sensitive to that.

389
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,023
But whatever happens
To barone sanitation,

390
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,651
I gotta be kept on.
I need that w-2.

391
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,655
And as you can see,
I'm facing a long
Convalescence here.

392
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,660
And barone is my secondary
Insurance carrier.
I need it.

393
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,329
John's gonna
Take care of you.
You know that, tony.

394
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,999
But what you're asking?
25% of the sale price,

395
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,127
Years' salary
Till retirement,
Plus skim?

396
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,383
Look, i don't
Wanna argue.

397
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,009
I'm not well,

398
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,887
So i'll give john
A break on the skim.

399
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,597
Getting two g's
A week now.

400
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,142
How many stops
We base that on?

401
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,232
Ho! How many stops?

402
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,443
- 11.
- the fuck you talking about?!
it's at least 25.

403
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,070
- 25.

404
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,287
All right,
Take the skim on 20.

405
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,372
1,500 a week,

406
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,207
But i stay on
The payroll as is.

407
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,251
All i can do is deliver
The message, anthony.

408
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,505
You got your head
Up your ass today.

409
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,968
- what's going on?
- my aunt dottie's been sick.

410
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,554
Call i got?

411
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,848
She just died.

412
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,022
Sorry.

413
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,401
You were close?

414
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:49,466
Your mom's sister
Or your dad's?

415
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:51,427
Mom's.

416
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:55,889
- she must be
broken up, huh?

417
00:24:57,057 --> 00:24:58,142
Here we are.

418
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:01,395
Guess your brother
And sister coming in?

419
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:05,316
Your aunt,

420
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,026
She's the nun.

421
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:09,403
- always wondered.

422
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,155
They got hair
Under there?

423
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:13,532
Yeah, short.

424
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,663
Well maybe you don't
Wanna talk about it.

425
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,798
Those wedding rings
They wear...

426
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,177
Are they really
Married to jesus?

427
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,471
So i understand.

428
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,938
T, this is the guy,

429
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:45,773
The paramedic.

430
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:50,027
"wallet biopsy"?

431
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:51,946
Nice.

432
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:53,364
Very nice.

433
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,492
These people
Are saying i took money
From your wallet? Fuck that.

434
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:57,868
Whoa whoa whoa.
What'd you say?

435
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:01,246
I was looking for proof of
Insurance. I was only doing
My job.

436
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,332
- they heard a lot of that
at nuremburg.

437
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:08,671
You owe me two k.
It was gone from my wallet.

438
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:09,880
I don't have
That kind of money.

439
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,298
One week,

440
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:15,052
<i>rudy diaz,
Or you'll need
A paramedic.</i>

441
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:23,185
Oh, nice of you to come by.
We'll see you next week, huh?

442
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,729
All this activity, tony,
Are you getting any rest?

443
00:26:25,896 --> 00:26:27,815
Absolutely. The guys
Are just leaving.

444
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:29,900
Carmela.

445
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:38,617
So, you two
Came together.
You talking now?

446
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:41,662
Mom apologized to me.

447
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,789
And he got a job
At blockbuster.

448
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:45,249
Good.

449
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,584
Well i'm glad
To see you made up.

450
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,756
<i>fucker keeps
dropping his hands.</i>

451
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:54,758
Your boy's
Getting tired.

452
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:58,804
Fool's costing me
50 g's.

453
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:00,597
<i>who you place
your action with?</i>

454
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,891
- pinnacle.
- online?

455
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,353
What price they give
You on alvarez?

456
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:07,688
350.

457
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,148
<i>damn!</i>

458
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,650
Hold the motherfucker
Steady!

459
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:16,989
My friend here'll
Give you 375.

460
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:18,532
Right, paulie?

461
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,160
<i>HE DON'T EVEN
WANNA FIGHT, MAN.</i>

462
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,623
Wonder what kind
Of health insurance
He's got.

463
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:26,999
It's a life of abuse.

464
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,126
Yes, well he
Is a boxer.

465
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,837
It's the same
For everybody.

466
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:35,049
Look at you, t.
You do your uncle
A kindness,

467
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:37,343
You get shot
For your efforts.

468
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,179
You think you got family,
But in the end,

469
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:41,930
They fuck you too.

470
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,268
He's grieving.
His aunt just died.

471
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:49,730
I tell ya, we each
And every one of us,

472
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:52,399
We're alone in the ring,
Fighting for our lives,

473
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:55,819
- just like that poor prick.
- well, that's one way
to look at it.

474
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:59,657
- you got a better one?
- don't get me started.
it's complicated.

475
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:01,158
You think i'm stupid?!

476
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:05,579
It's actually an illusion
Those two boxers are
Separate entities.

477
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:07,665
- what the fuck?
- illusion?

478
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:11,752
Their separate entities
Is simply the way we choose
To perceive them.

479
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:14,004
<i>- i didn't chose nothing.
- schwinn: it's physics.</i>

480
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:15,839
Schr dinger's equation.

481
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:20,010
The boxers, you, me--
We're all part of the same
Quantum field.

482
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:22,846
You ever substitute teach
At carver middle school?

483
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:26,558
He's a rocket scientist,
For christ's sake. Bell labs.

484
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,270
Shit. Lift it up,
Nigga!

485
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:31,480
You were saying?

486
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:35,943
Well, think
Of the two boxers
As ocean waves

487
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,570
Or currents of air,
Two tornadoes, say.

488
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:42,199
They appear to be
Two things, right?
Two separate things.

489
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:46,870
<i>But they're not. Tornadoes are just
Wind, the wind stirred up
in different directions.</i>

490
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:49,540
The fact is,
Nothing is separate--
Everything's connected.

491
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:51,625
Everything is everything.

492
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,545
- i'm down with that.
- get the fuck out of here.

493
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,923
- schwinn: the universe is just
one big soup of molecules...

494
00:28:58,215 --> 00:29:00,009
<i>...bumping up against
one another.</i>

495
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:03,595
The shapes we see
Exist only in our
Own consciousness.

496
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:05,889
Keshawn, don't make me
Come over there.

497
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,351
You'reo fucking smart,
Fix that tv.

498
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:23,032
Besides the financial
Ramifications,

499
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:26,160
He says there's
The issue of his w-2
And health insurance.

500
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:28,495
That selfish prick.

501
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:31,874
I'm sitting in here
Facing a shitstorm

502
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,001
And all he can think
About is himself?!

503
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:38,922
As far as
The sale's concerned,

504
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:41,300
That ship has sailed.
It's going through,

505
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:43,510
And as a friend,
I would appreciate
Tony's help.

506
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,391
Because he's a friend,
Here's what i'm willing
To do.

507
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:53,395
Cinelli will retain
Him as waste management
Consultant for two years.

508
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:56,732
During that time,
He can keep his fucking w-2

509
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:58,484
And his health insurance.

510
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:02,613
Plus 5%
Of the sale price.

511
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,825
And we lease him
A new car.

512
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:08,786
Are you fuckin'
Kidding me?

513
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:11,872
I told them i need
That w-2 in perpetuity,

514
00:30:11,997 --> 00:30:14,291
And 5% of the fucking
Sale price?!

515
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,419
He thinks 'cause i'm
In this weakened condition,

516
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:19,755
He can take advantage.
Well he can go
Fuck himself.

517
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:22,049
I'm just telling you
What phil told me, ton'.

518
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:25,594
You tell jason before he sells,
He better understand his obligation!

519
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:25,321
What's up, paulie?

520
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:29,033
Since even with tony's advice,
You seem determined to sell
Your father's company,

521
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,576
There's something
You should know.

522
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:33,454
- whatever happens,
we gotta be taken care of.

523
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:36,415
<i>- yeah, of course.
I'm going to honor whatever
Provisions are in the contract.</i>

524
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,625
Fuck the contract.

525
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,918
Tony's given years
Of his life to that company,

526
00:31:40,002 --> 00:31:42,546
And he expects
To be duly compensated.

527
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:44,923
Johnny sack sure as shit
Ain't gonna perform.
- who?

528
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,801
- mr. Cinelli's waste
management consultant.

529
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,971
And since johnny sack
Ain't gonna step up,
Guess what?

530
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,474
It's coming out
Of your ass.

531
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,809
You know,
I'm starting to feel
A little intimidated.

532
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:57,645
As well you should,
My friend.

533
00:31:57,811 --> 00:32:00,022
A man who teaches skiing
For a living

534
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:03,400
Ought to look after
His physical condition,
Wouldn't you say?

535
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:05,903
His knees. Kid,

536
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:09,365
You wouldn't be in this
Situation if you'd listened to tony
In the first place.

537
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:12,576
He's looking out for you.
He doesn't wanna see
You get hurt.

538
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:17,373
I got a lot on my
Mind these days.

539
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:19,124
I don't need
This shit.

540
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:30,052
Jason, we shook hands.
A deal's a deal.

541
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:34,098
There's lifetime employees
Who expect compensation.
It's only equitable.

542
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:37,518
Now if you're willing to take care
Of that, maybe we could still work
Things out.

543
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,311
Tony soprano, right?

544
00:32:39,603 --> 00:32:41,689
Fuck that and fuck him.
He's your problem.

545
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:42,940
- look, the numbers
just don't work.

546
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:44,233
Jason!

547
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,568
I'm going
To the buffet table.

548
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:48,279
Be right there, mom.

549
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:52,199
If i give tony what he wants,
I lose money on the sale.

550
00:32:52,324 --> 00:32:53,617
- i can't do that to my mom.

551
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:56,912
- kid, you work it out any way you want,
But nobody's backing out of the deal.

552
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:59,957
Mr. Cinelli, i'm sorry,
But the bottom line is i'm
Not selling the company to you.

553
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:02,835
There are other buyers
Out there. Tony was quite
Clear about that.

554
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:05,296
I'll tell you
The fuckin' bottom line,
Laddy buck.

555
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:08,716
The barone routes are now cinelli
Routes. That's that.

556
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:25,858
T.

557
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:31,363
Horrible thing.
They brought this
Little girl in,

558
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,575
<i>she's got
third degree burns
on 80% of her body.</i>

559
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,994
You wouldn't believe
The week i've had.

560
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:40,080
What?

561
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,667
There's a little girl
Burned in there.

562
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,712
- jesus christ.
- sorry, t.

563
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:51,508
No. Now what the fuck
Is with you?

564
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:54,303
And i want some answers,
'Cause you're starting
To drive me fuckin' nuts.

565
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:57,514
This remains between us?

566
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,350
'Course.

567
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:03,771
My aunt who died--

568
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,357
She wasn't my aunt.

569
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:09,735
She was my mother.

570
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,114
What?
Your aunt, the nun...
Was your mother?

571
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:17,576
Some cocksucker g.i.
Knocked her up
During the war.

572
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:18,911
Russ.

573
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:22,247
- so what was your mother?
- my ma's my aunt.

574
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:24,750
She adopted me
To hide the family shame.

575
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:27,920
Believe this shit?

576
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:29,964
All i did for her.

577
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:33,467
Not only is my ma
Not my ma,

578
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:36,178
Who the fuck even knows
Who this russ bastard is?

579
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,599
Worst thing,

580
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,851
I'm not who i am.

581
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:45,854
It's like my whole
Life is a joke,

582
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,607
A big fuckin'
Joke on me.

583
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:37,740
- what's going on?
- this ain't your route
no more.

584
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:39,366
It's ours. Cinelli.

585
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:41,869
What do you mean?
I have this route
For five years.

586
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:43,203
Stupid fuck.

587
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:46,248
Fuck this.

588
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,585
Poppi!

589
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,585
Who's there?

590
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:34,964
Oh, hi paulie.

591
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,134
You didn't go
To your mother's funeral.
It's a sin.

592
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:42,096
Some mother.
Even a rat don't abandon
Its own children.

593
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:44,014
No, you should
Feel sorry for her.

594
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,600
She's gonna have
To face st. Peter

595
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,727
With this stain
On her.

596
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:51,438
- i hope she rots in hell!
- don't say that!

597
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:53,482
And you.
I was your meal ticket,

598
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:55,859
The goose
With the golden eggs!

599
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:58,612
Look at this place.
Who set you up here?

600
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:01,740
Not that fuckin'
Brother of mine
Or rose.

601
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:04,201
They never provided
You with shit!

602
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:07,204
Well, your real children
Can start now.

603
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,418
I went without,
So you could have.

604
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:16,630
The mink coat,
The massage chair
From sharper's image,

605
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:20,009
The flat screen tv.

606
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:23,137
$2,000 bucks
For a woman i don't
Even know!

607
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:38,694
Paulie, please.

608
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:41,822
You're on your own.
I never wanna see you again.

609
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,084
I told you.
It's a different
Corporate culture.

610
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,836
I tried to redefine
The deal.

611
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:58,922
You shouldn't have made
The deal without talking
To me in the first place!

612
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:00,883
Well goddamn it,
How was i supposed to know?

613
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,178
I made it perfectly clear:
Give up part of your profits.

614
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,472
Thanks to you,
A man is beaten
Half to death...

615
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:08,182
While his little boy
Was watching.

616
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:09,600
<i>and it's
all over the media!</i>

617
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:13,062
It's not fair.
The business belongs
To my family.

618
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:14,355
"fair"?

619
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:17,858
You fuckin' believe
This shit?

620
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:19,652
You remind me of my kid.

621
00:38:20,027 --> 00:38:22,571
Talk to the katrina victims
About fair.

622
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,074
Talk to paulie here.
He'll tell you about fair!

623
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:26,200
- absolutely.

624
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,953
- you're worse than my son!
- get him the fuck
outta here!

625
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:37,670
How was i supposed to know?
My family kept me
In the dark.

626
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,131
What kind of pathetic
Fuckin' excuse is that?!
Don't you communicate?

627
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:43,425
You make me sick,
You fucking baby.

628
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,854
Shoot me one time,
One time only,
You heard?

629
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,399
Fleshy part
Of the thigh,
Like you said.

630
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:00,401
There's only 7,000 here.
I said eight.

631
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:03,654
Hey hey hey, i get my
Little brother to do it
For less, believe that.

632
00:39:03,988 --> 00:39:06,782
Trust me, you gotta go
Outside the family for
Something like this.

633
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:08,993
You don't want
People knowing.

634
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:12,621
That way you can blame it
On dr. Droop or whoever.

635
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:14,039
7,000's all i got.

636
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:22,715
I don't wanna know
When it's coming.
You decide.

637
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,053
Get this...

638
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:31,307
It says here that
If the history
Of the planet

639
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:34,018
Was represented
By the empire state
Building,

640
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:36,186
The time
That human beings
Have been on earth

641
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:39,148
Would only be
A postage stamp
At the very top.

642
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:43,068
You realize
How insignificant
That makes us?

643
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,446
I don't feel that way.

644
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,326
There he is.

645
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:52,953
- hi, chris.
- hesh, how are you?

646
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:56,498
Great to see you
Looking so robust.

647
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,542
- hey.
- how you doing?

648
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:00,919
- beth wanted to come.
- yeah, sure.

649
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:02,755
- hi, tony.
- hey.

650
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:05,591
So how's eli?

651
00:40:05,716 --> 00:40:08,761
I hear that
With the physical therapy,
They got him using a walker.

652
00:40:09,094 --> 00:40:10,804
He's doing better.
Thank you.

653
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:14,975
Hey, tony. Okay to visit?

654
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:17,645
Yeah yeah, sure.

655
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:21,941
My nephew christopher;
Pastor bob.

656
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,485
Hesh rabkin,
His daughter beth.

657
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:30,407
- how you feeling?
- physically, a little
better than i was.

658
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,494
So maybe you're right.
That prayer business works.

659
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,664
I brought you something.

660
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:39,333
- "born again."
- charles colson.

661
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,001
The watergate guy.

662
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,128
Friend of mine
Did time with him.

663
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:46,340
A ruthless, powerful man
Who thought he was
Above the law.

664
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,759
He committed crimes
And then went to prison.

665
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:50,886
And then he found jesus,

666
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,680
And everything changed.

667
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,057
Became a different man.

668
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:57,893
Yeah, so?

669
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,898
Salvation
Isn't just about

670
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:05,234
Being saved from hell
After you die.

671
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:09,071
<i>it's also about
being saved from yourself
while you're still alive.</i>

672
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,575
I hope when you get
Out of the hospital

673
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:16,328
That you'll join us
At the church of the open
Door of the redeemer.

674
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:21,583
Well it must be nice

675
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,586
To have something
To hold onto.

676
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:27,881
Maybe.

677
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:38,142
Dinosaurs.

678
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,311
My kids can't get enough.

679
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:42,771
Yeah yeah, me too.

680
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:47,192
Every since i saw
King kong kick their ass
In the original.

681
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:49,278
My son loves
Dinosaurs too.

682
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,196
- that's interesting.
- what?

683
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:52,823
Some people would
Have you believe

684
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:55,451
Dinosaurs existed
Millions of years ago.

685
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:57,870
It's just not true.

686
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:01,415
God created the earth
6,000 years ago.

687
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,542
And i tell my kids,
You have to remember,

688
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:07,379
Dinosaurs and human beings
Lived on the earth
At the same time.

689
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:10,799
What, like
"the flintstones"?

690
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,676
It's in the bible.

691
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:15,971
Yeah but what
About all that
Carbon-dating stuff?

692
00:42:16,305 --> 00:42:18,432
A lot of scientists
Would disagree with you.

693
00:42:18,682 --> 00:42:21,769
Well i think you'll find
All those people have
An agenda, tony--

694
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:25,981
Evolution, which is
Satan's plan to deny god.

695
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:30,319
Evolution and salvation
Are mutually exclusive.

696
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:34,031
Guy next door's a scientist.
Think he'd disagree
With you big time.

697
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:36,283
Then that man's
Not saved.

698
00:42:38,827 --> 00:42:40,412
Read about mr. Colson.

699
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:42,414
We'll talk later.

700
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:50,547
What's he saying?
There were dinosaurs
Back with adam and eve?

701
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:52,383
<i>- i guess.
- no way.</i>

702
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:54,051
<i>t rex in the garden
of eden?</i>

703
00:42:54,176 --> 00:42:56,720
Adam and eve would be running
All the time, scared shitless.

704
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:59,264
But the bible says
It was paradise.

705
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:01,392
<i>you can disagree
with evangelicals,</i>

706
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,310
But they're great friends
Of the jews

707
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,771
Because israel
Is the holy land.

708
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:08,023
You wait.

709
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:20,828
Hey, how ya doing?

710
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:23,122
- hi.
- i'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

711
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:29,586
Your color's better.

712
00:43:29,837 --> 00:43:31,171
So mr. Wizard,

713
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,300
You were talking
About tornados.

714
00:43:36,885 --> 00:43:39,263
You know what
The indians say
About the wind?

715
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:43,976
- no.
- they say that sometimes  we go
Around feeling pity for ourselves,

716
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:47,187
But behind our back,
A great wind
Is carrying us.

717
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:49,815
We don't see we're part
Of a much bigger reality.

718
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:52,651
- then we die.
- why are you so
interested in all this?

719
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,742
I was in this coma
And, uh...

720
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:03,996
Look, i don't
Remember nothing,

721
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:06,040
But before i woke up,

722
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:10,085
I felt like
I was being pulled
Towards something.

723
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,839
And i don't
Wanna go back.

724
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:18,969
And my wife told me
I woke up at one point
And said,

725
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:22,514
"who am i?

726
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:25,059
Where am i going?"

727
00:44:27,728 --> 00:44:29,229
Kinda makes you wonder,

728
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,733
About heaven and hell.

729
00:44:33,025 --> 00:44:35,986
That presupposes a duality
Of good and evil.

730
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,530
You know it gets us
Back to the idea

731
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,992
Of separate,
Opposing entities.

732
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:43,953
You know where i go
With that.

733
00:44:44,286 --> 00:44:46,622
<i>But this bible guy
I know says you're
Going to hell.</i>

734
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:48,207
Maybe he's right.

735
00:44:48,415 --> 00:44:50,459
Got my test results back.

736
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:52,544
Laryngeal cancer.

737
00:44:54,755 --> 00:44:56,006
Jesus, i'm sorry.

738
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:59,301
You know i was thinking,
Maybe you could
Do me a favor

739
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:02,513
And, uh, you know
What's the term,
"whack" me?

740
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,685
Sorry, bad joke.

741
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:23,575
- walking alone again.

742
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:25,035
- what, i'm gonna wait
for vito?

743
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,538
Hour and a half
To take a dump,
That guy.

744
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:30,165
Could build a jetty
With what comes out.

745
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:42,970
Little paulie tells me
You didn't go to your
Aunt's funeral.

746
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:45,973
And i'll tell you
Something else--

747
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,225
I'm done with nucci.

748
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:51,478
Four g's a month
For that nursing home?
Fuck that.

749
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,773
- what are you gonna do,
throw her out on the street?
- way i see it,

750
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:58,193
Serves her right.
What the fuck, paulie?

751
00:45:58,777 --> 00:46:00,738
That woman loved you.
She fed you.

752
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:04,241
How many times she
Bail you out of the can
When you were a kid?

753
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:05,993
Huh? Am i right?

754
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:09,788
I'll tell ya
What really fries me--

755
00:46:09,997 --> 00:46:12,041
It's not nucci.
It's dottie.

756
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:15,419
I know to your way
Of thinking, you didn't
Have a great mother--

757
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:19,340
- all i'm saying,
Livia, with all her faults,
Never abandoned you.

758
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:21,717
For christ's sake, paulie.
You know what your
Problem is?

759
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,552
You go around
In pity for yourself.

760
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:25,804
You think
You got it bad.

761
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:29,350
You're not stuck in some hospital
Room with fucking tubes coming
Out of you.

762
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:32,311
You can eat food
Like a normal person.
- t,

763
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:34,730
I never meant
To trivialize your
Situation.

764
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:37,983
Well you gotta
Get beyond this petty
Bullshit, paulie.

765
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:42,363
<i>You're part of something bigger.
when you gonna learn that?</i>

766
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:51,246
- my ass!
- marvin?!

767
00:46:51,413 --> 00:46:53,415
Ow! They shot me
In my ass!

768
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,876
They shot me in my ass!

769
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:07,888
Pearl's oyster bar--
The lobster roll.

770
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:10,391
Listen, ton'.

771
00:47:10,766 --> 00:47:13,185
That package,
From vito and paulie?

772
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:15,229
I have to believe
That there was more there.

773
00:47:17,064 --> 00:47:18,065
Sure.

774
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,150
So?

775
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:23,487
Vito especially
Is somebody you
Should watch.

776
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,409
- mr. Soprano?

777
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:29,743
Good morning,
Mrs. Soprano.

778
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,745
Ah, the bird of prey.

779
00:47:33,372 --> 00:47:35,874
Okay, it looks like
Your last drainage tube
Is coming out today.

780
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,919
Dr. Plepler says
You're stable and the pain
Is manageable

781
00:47:39,086 --> 00:47:40,754
So that's good news.
You're husband's
Coming home.

782
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:43,173
- are you sure he's ready?
- what does she give a shit?

783
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:45,009
She's trying to save a buck.

784
00:47:45,426 --> 00:47:46,593
Hold on a minute.

785
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:48,846
Guy next door--
Mr. Schwinn.

786
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:51,598
Had surgery
This morning, cancer.

787
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:54,018
You know anything
About it?

788
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:56,061
I heard they
Removed his larynx.

789
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:16,332
<i>"gitanos".
That's a mexican word
For gypsies.</i>

790
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:20,961
Tony? How are you?
Hey!

791
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:22,713
All right.

792
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:24,923
I made you
Some stuffed zucchini.

793
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,343
- he can't eat that.
- oh oh, i'm sorry.

794
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,094
It was thoughtful
Anyways.

795
00:48:29,845 --> 00:48:31,930
Listen, my condolences
Regarding dick.

796
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:34,642
- you get my flowers?
- oh yeah. They were beautiful.

797
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,602
- have a seat.
- oh thank you.

798
00:48:40,314 --> 00:48:42,816
Uh, jas told me
About the conversation
You had.

799
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:45,319
I can only imagine
How upset you must be.

800
00:48:45,653 --> 00:48:48,030
Well it is a very
Unfortunate situation.

801
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:51,075
Jason just doesn't understand
How the business works.

802
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:53,035
- that's for sure.
- no, it's not his fault.

803
00:48:53,994 --> 00:48:57,498
It's my fault.
Dick and i purposely
Kept him in the dark.

804
00:48:57,665 --> 00:49:00,668
Blame me, not him.
You're not involved
In this, helen.

805
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:04,505
I was too wrapped up
In my own grief.
I didn't realize...

806
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,051
He's my boy, tony.
It's my baby.

807
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:11,679
It'd kill me
If anything happened
To him.

808
00:49:12,137 --> 00:49:14,098
<i>what are you
talkin' about?
Tony, please.</i>

809
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:16,225
You have a son.
I'm begging you.

810
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:20,437
Helen, believe me,
Nothin's gonna happen
To him.

811
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:22,606
I'm his mother, tony.
I love him.

812
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:26,360
<i>if anyone has to pay
for this, let it be me.</i>

813
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,612
<i>how many times
i gotta tell you?
it's gonna be fine.</i>

814
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:30,239
<i>but, tony,
do i have your word?</i>

815
00:49:31,156 --> 00:49:33,325
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
You got my word.

816
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,937
Especially good week
This week.

817
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:06,483
Good.

818
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,195
I know
How good you feel.

819
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:13,407
I was only in the hospital
Overnight. I couldn't wait
To get out.

820
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:15,784
Hold on.

821
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:20,706
You wanna go in,
Say goodbye?

822
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,647
I wanted to make sure
You had this before
You checked out.

823
00:50:44,813 --> 00:50:45,856
Whoa whoa.
Not here.

824
00:50:46,273 --> 00:50:47,232
It's all right.

825
00:50:49,276 --> 00:50:50,986
Let's go.
- ton'?

826
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:52,237
- let's go.

827
00:51:24,478 --> 00:51:26,480
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'll follow you home.

828
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:31,986
Supposed to be dead.

829
00:51:33,445 --> 00:51:34,780
Now i'm alive.

830
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:39,618
I'm the luckiest guy
In the whole world.

831
00:51:42,204 --> 00:51:43,455
Listen, after this...

832
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,669
From now on,
Every day is a gift.

833
00:51:52,298 --> 00:51:53,882
I'm gonna go get the car.

834
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,439
Tony? Phil leotardo
Is here to see you.

835
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,191
- 10 minutes. You're supposed
To be resting.

836
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:13,319
Hey, blondie.

837
00:52:15,696 --> 00:52:17,239
It's all you, you know.

838
00:52:18,157 --> 00:52:19,241
The reason i'm back here.

839
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:21,952
No, it's not just me
By any means.

840
00:52:23,912 --> 00:52:25,289
Thank you
For saying that.

841
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,972
Johnny doesn't want
Another unfortunate
Incident.

842
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:45,643
He's willing to let
You keep your paycheck
And your w-2 for 10 years.

843
00:52:46,352 --> 00:52:48,020
To replace the skim,

844
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:50,856
He'll jack up your share
Of the sale price
To 12%.

845
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:55,945
No more skim.

846
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:07,706
Truth be told,
There's enough garbage
For everybody.

847
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:11,210
- does that mean
we got a deal?

848
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:12,836
- yeah, we got a deal.

849
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:15,673
Be well.

850
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,131
Aw, fuck!

851
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:43,761
- guess what, fuckin'
mama's boy?! You're kicking up

852
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:45,179
Four grand to me
Every month.

853
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:47,514
I don't care
If you're in deer valley
Or death valley!

854
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:49,558
Four grand,
Every goddamn month!

855
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:52,144
And if you ever mention
A word of this to tony,

856
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:54,521
I'll stick this
Up your ass

857
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,899
And pull the trigger
Till the bullets come
Out your eyes.
