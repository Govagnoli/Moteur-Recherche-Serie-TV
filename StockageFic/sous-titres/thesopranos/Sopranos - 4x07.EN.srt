1
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,927
What do you hear? What do you say?

2
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,575
Welcome home.

3
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,436
Youngstown, my ass. Look at this guy.
You look like you were in Miami.

4
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,845
- Yeah, you look like you were in Miami.
- Good to be home, skip.

5
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,713
What can I get you, Paulie?

6
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,310
After four months inside? How about laid?

7
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,826
- It's Papillon.
- Hello, Sil, how are you?

8
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,021
I heard you were getting laid all the time.

9
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,587
- Come here, you little prick.
- Hello, Chrissy.

10
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,896
Let's have a drink.
Come on, pass them back.

11
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,700
- Hey, over here.
- There you go.

12
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,541
All you guys!

13
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,906
Salute.

14
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,335
Just a second.

15
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,896
My song.

16
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,773
Welcome home.

17
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,405
Come on.

18
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,143
What the fuck?

19
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,079
Why is this his song?

20
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,414
Paulie, say hello to Brian Cammarata,
Carm's cousin.

21
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,851
He's a financial guy.

22
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,286
How you doing, kid?

23
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,587
So, just back from college?

24
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,361
Let me talk to Paulie for a sec, all right?

25
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,090
Nice meeting you.

26
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,198
Have a seat.

27
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,168
How you doing? You okay?

28
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,003
Just thank God that piece of shit from
Youngstown finally copped to that gun.

29
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,532
I could've been wearing
an orange jumpsuit till I'm 90.

30
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,742
Well, you're home now,
that's the important thing.

31
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,942
Here, get back on your feet.

32
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,749
Thanks, T.

33
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,454
Not that I don't appreciate it...

34
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,185
but I could've used a boost
when I was gone, too.

35
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,624
Fucking bills.

36
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,626
Then there's Ma with the private home care.

37
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,188
You know she almost lost her spot
at Green Grove?

38
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,565
An extra $5, 000 it cost me
just to hold her place.

39
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,434
You're here 30 seconds,
you already got a fistful of cash...

40
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,497
not to mention the no- show jobs
I got for you.

41
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,844
- You're right, Ton'. I know.
- Enjoy the party.

42
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,106
I will.

43
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,492
Were you having dinner at Citris last year...

44
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,657
when a man threw a drink
in Richard Cross' face?

45
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,591
Yes.

46
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,533
Subsequent to that incident...

47
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,197
did Mr. Cross telephone Rusty Arnold?

48
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,764
Yes.

49
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,808
And the following day...

50
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,538
were you informed
that the man in question...

51
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,910
had suffered a fractured skull?

52
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,777
Your honor, objection.

53
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,148
This whole line of questioning is irrelevant.

54
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,949
Overruled. You may answer, Miss Costello.

55
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,418
I don't think I'm supposed to, Judge.

56
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,689
I just made my ruling,
you are required to answer.

57
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,498
But isn't there some law about testifying
against your husband?

58
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,998
Excuse me?

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,630
Richard and I were married
the night before last in Reno.

60
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,171
Your honor...

61
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,268
the defense requests
a conference in chambers.

62
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,938
We'll stand in recess for 15 minutes...

63
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,984
while the court confers
with counsel in chambers.

64
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,020
Bailiff, will you escort the jury out?

65
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,783
Did she say anything to you about this?

66
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,553
What we saw in that courtroom
is a transparent attempt by Richard Cross...

67
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,725
to subvert the intent of the marital privilege.

68
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,564
Hey, she's his wife.

69
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,794
Where are my pants?

70
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,596
There's some mouthwash
and shit in the back.

71
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,195
We'll go get breakfast.

72
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,297
Oh, aspetta, I'll go with you.

73
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,469
Any investment advice for
an ambitious young man such as myself?

74
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,515
Buy land, I guess.
God ain't making any more of it.

75
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,744
That's what Will Rogers said.

76
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,548
It's true, my house is worth
nearly triple what I paid.

77
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,421
Location's the key, right?
Otherwise you get stuck with shit.

78
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,890
Sometimes there's money in shit.

79
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,022
How do you mean?

80
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,396
- Nothing, I don't know.
- We're just talking here, come on.

81
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,598
I don't know. Some guy
I went to school with, this black guy...

82
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,368
we worked one summer for this
not- for- profit housing group.

83
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,310
Told me about some scam his minister
was involved with up in Harlem.

84
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,040
I read about this.

85
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,843
Forgazee Mortgage Loans
or something, right?

86
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,943
- Actually, you ever hear of HUD?
- Housing development, yeah.

87
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,979
HUD was set up to help minorities
and low- income families to be homeowners.

88
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,117
There are more programs
for these deadbeats, I swear to Christ.

89
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,357
If the feds guarantee the home mortgage,
the banks figure, why not?

90
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,898
They'll loan the money.

91
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,832
You get a front man to buy houses
in some crummy neighborhood.

92
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,804
Talking about some real shitboxes.
Maybe they're worth $100, 000 apiece.

93
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,876
Next, you tie up with some
non- profit organization who goes to HUD...

94
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,606
and says they intend
to buy these houses from your stooge.

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,480
They're gonna convert them to homes
for working- class blacks, blah- blah- blah.

96
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,378
Thing is, though....

97
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,521
All right, sit tight. I'm gonna be a while.

98
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,260
I'll be over here.

99
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,400
Maurice and I met in college.
All the way to the University of Michigan...

100
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,266
to make friends with a guy
who lived 20 blocks away from me.

101
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,899
You should've seen the Jew- fro
on this guy. Out to here.

102
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,000
So, Maurice, Ron tells me
you're from down Roseville Street.

103
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,912
My father was a typesetter
for the Star- Ledger.

104
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,210
No shit?

105
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,777
- Sixth and Orange.
- Then we were practically neighbors.

106
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,912
Yeah, that's why he moved.

107
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,407
- Hello.
- Carmela, it's me, Furio.

108
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,705
I guess I missed you this morning,
I was in the bathtub.

109
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,370
The reason I call...

110
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,473
I leave my sunglasses
in some place, I don't know.

111
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,384
You're kidding. Let me have a look around.

112
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,150
So how is everything? How's your dad?

113
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,725
Not so good.

114
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,156
But I get the pictures
from the housewarm finally.

115
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,358
Good, bring them next time.

116
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,661
I will.

117
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,663
There's a pretty one of you.

118
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,672
That's sweet.

119
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,604
I don't see the glasses, Fur'.

120
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,778
That's okay, I probably leave them home.

121
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:44,873
All right.

122
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,919
If I find them, I'll give you a call.

123
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,112
Okay.

124
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,113
I see you soon.

125
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,963
The summer of'67,
we're both home on break.

126
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:05,197
I'm interning at the state legislature
and he....What were you doing?

127
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,638
- East Newark Food Co- op.
- Right.

128
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,306
But come July--

129
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,471
The Newark riots.

130
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,074
What a fucking summer that was.

131
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,142
Later that year, Maurice and I helped
organize one of the first black voting drives.

132
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,280
Maurice, were you around
for Anthony Imperiale?

133
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,653
- The White Knight?
- Around?

134
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,392
- Who do you think he was fighting against?
- "Italian pride, keep Newark white."

135
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,161
Aspiring Klansmen, some of those boys.

136
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,895
So this group you got now,
the Urban Housing League.

137
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,402
What's the story there?

138
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,462
Like many non- profits...

139
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,442
we've fallen on hard times.

140
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,439
Republican administration,
plus a proliferation...

141
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,241
of new charities post 9/1 1.

142
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,545
Sounds like you got a lot to talk about.
I'm gonna hit the showers.

143
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,642
Maurice, nice meeting you.

144
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,551
Same here.

145
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,925
I took the liberty of filling Maurice in
on the broad strokes.

146
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,292
Okay, we got a guy,
Dr. Fried, he's a urologist.

147
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,465
We'll give him $500, 000 of our money.

148
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,194
Have him grab up these four houses
on Garside Street...

149
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,860
for $125, 000 apiece.

150
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,062
The old First Ward.

151
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,971
Once we own the houses,
we got an appraiser who'll play ball.

152
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,238
He's gonna re- appraise them
in the $300, 000 range.

153
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,712
What you do, Maurice,
is take the phony appraisals to HUD.

154
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,978
Tell them your urban housing thing wants
to buy up these shitholes.

155
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,986
Convert them to low- cost housing
for working families.

156
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,217
Once HUD guarantees the mortgage app,
you take it to the bank.

157
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,088
They cut a check, and we work it up nice.

158
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,262
At which point, I assume my organization
fails to make the mortgage payment.

159
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,357
Unforeseen construction delays
and repeated vandalism...

160
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,596
force the project into dissolution.

161
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,501
We all walk away from the houses.

162
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,200
Your cut'll be in the 10 percent
of the profit range.

163
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,336
My office'll write a letter in strong support
of your application.

164
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,141
Sounds about right.

165
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,487
Tony, good.

166
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,717
You're still here.

167
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,459
- Is there a problem?
- No problem, I just wanna talk to you.

168
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,732
You remember that time in Atlantic City?

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,825
You brought Irina, your old girlfriend?

170
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,065
Yeah, the cystic fibrosis thing,
the fundraiser.

171
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:22,932
God.

172
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,401
This is awkward.

173
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,736
Irina and I are seeing each other.

174
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,871
What?

175
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,172
You're fucking kidding me.

176
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,185
I met her that night at the fundraiser.
I gave her my card.

177
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,278
She was having some problem
with her landlord.

178
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,290
She called me months later,
after you two broke it off...

179
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,350
- one thing led to another--
- All right, take it easy.

180
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,225
It's ancient history.

181
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,565
I wanted to tell you.
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

182
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,468
What am l, her father? You're both adults.

183
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,902
Enjoy yourself.

184
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,498
It's more than that. I care for her.

185
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,603
Very deeply. Roz and I are separated.

186
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,244
The heart wants
what the heart wants, I guess.

187
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,113
The heart also wants what the dick wants.

188
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,917
Okay, who's gonna scrub my back?

189
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,514
Ralph, you steal my water?

190
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,582
Oh, girl

191
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,923
I'd be in trouble if you left me now

192
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,068
Man, I love this song.

193
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,860
The Chi- Lites.

194
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,634
The best.

195
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,239
Believe it or not, The Chi- Lites
were signed to the same label...

196
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,506
as Tommy James and them damn Shondells.

197
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,515
See, a lot of people think that,
but they're wrong.

198
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,710
Chi- Lites were on Brunswick.

199
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,755
See you soon.

200
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,518
So, Tony, anyway....

201
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,918
Look, she's a great girl.

202
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,393
Beautiful girl, a little needy.

203
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,291
Frankly, I'm glad to have her off my payroll.

204
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,464
Thanks for understanding.

205
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,062
Wish you nothing but the best, bro.

206
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,810
Dr. Fried, you are now the legal owner.

207
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,817
Eat my dust, Donald Trump.

208
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,953
- Hey, Adriana.
- Jesus Christ!

209
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,457
Why don't you go
haunt a house or something?

210
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,502
It's been a while, figured I'd check in.

211
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,469
So you crawl up my ass?

212
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,709
What do you want, Robyn?

213
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,839
I heard Paulie Gualtieri's out of jail.

214
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,046
- What do I know?
- How does Christopher feel about that?

215
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,949
Christopher likes Paulie, they're friends.

216
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,077
Is that a crime now, too?

217
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,018
How is Christopher anyway?
He looked tired last time I saw him.

218
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,255
If you're gonna turn me into a traitor, fine...

219
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,060
but do me a favor and stop asking
about him like you give a shit how he is.

220
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,761
How is he doing with his drug problem?

221
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,968
He doesn't have a drug problem.

222
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,706
How are you doing, Ade?

223
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,238
Really.

224
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,339
I'm fine. We're both fine.

225
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,486
As a matter of fact,
we're thinking of finally getting married.

226
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,485
You have a good time today?

227
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,319
Yeah, it was cool. I love the ocean.

228
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,204
Feel like taking a ride?

229
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,799
See that church?

230
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,907
Your great grandfather helped
build that almost 80 years ago.

231
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,505
He was a stonemason, the old man.

232
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,813
Came over from Avellino
with $4 in his pocket.

233
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,855
Yeah, but I saw in a book
where you could get a hotel room...

234
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,913
for, like, 10 cents a week then.

235
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,188
Room service must've been,
like, one or two cents a meal.

236
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,728
Room service?

237
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,853
We're talking about history here, A. J.

238
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,491
Your family's history. Newark's history.

239
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,866
- Who gives a shit about Newark?
- I'm making a point.

240
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,031
This neighborhood used to be beautiful.

241
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,041
Hundred percent Italian.

242
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,509
The 1920s, most of them right off the boat.

243
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,070
Most Italians couldn't even
find a church that wanted them.

244
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,979
So what did they do, did they cry?

245
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,042
Did they go to the government
with their hand out? No.

246
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,548
They took care of their own problems.

247
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,649
They said,"You don't want us here? Fine.
We'll build our own, a better one."

248
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,820
Look at all these buildings around here.

249
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,295
Most of them are falling down
into the ground.

250
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,526
But that church is still standing.

251
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,067
You know why?

252
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,101
The bricks?

253
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,172
'Cause our people give a shit, that's why.

254
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,603
Every Sunday, Italians from
the old neighborhood drive miles...

255
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,510
to come here to pray.

256
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,477
They keep this place alive.

257
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,744
So how come we never do?

258
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,055
Buy land, A. J. ,
'cause God ain't making any more of it.

259
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,192
This is advice I'm imparting to you
as your father.

260
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,249
Now what?

261
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,049
Are you afraid?

262
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,192
Right, like I haven't seen places
like this before.

263
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,562
See those houses over there?

264
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,632
I'm buying them.

265
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,040
Those crappy ones? What for?

266
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,139
For an investment.

267
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,248
What have I been saying?

268
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,612
I don't know.

269
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,878
Real estate. Buy real estate.

270
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,957
Dad, the black dude's coming over.

271
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,660
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

272
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,356
Five- O?

273
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,923
Yeah, I'm Starsky and this is Hutch.

274
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,894
Smoke, crack, or crank?

275
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,302
No, thank you,
we're just having a look around.

276
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,705
- No eyeing if you ain't buying, man.
- Thought this was a free country.

277
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,337
Unless you want something, motherfucker,
get the fuck off our street.

278
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,210
The language on you.

279
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,842
- You blow your father with that mouth?
- What the fuck you say to my sister?

280
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,251
Relax, I don't want trouble.
I'm showing my son the old neighborhood.

281
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,519
This is our neighborhood now.
Guinea motherfucker.

282
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,457
Yeah, I can see that.

283
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,469
So that's a crack ho.

284
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,571
Keep your fucking cracker ass off
my motherfucking block!

285
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,938
Come on, ease up.

286
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,871
She's really gonna marry him?

287
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,741
- What is wrong with this girl?
- Come on.

288
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,680
Moltisanti's a great catch.

289
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,843
Tall, dark, and sociopathic.

290
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,981
From a strategic standpoint,
do the nuptials help us or hurt us?

291
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,250
If they do get married...

292
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,319
brings them closer, obviously.

293
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,662
And by extension, gets her closer to Tony.

294
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,430
It could cause her to stop cooperating.

295
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,562
The guilt becomes overwhelming.

296
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,163
Remember Angel Diletto?

297
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,800
I think it's more likely
to have the opposite effect.

298
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,606
His problems really become her problems.

299
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,572
If they have kids, that's even more pressure.

300
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,508
The Dilettos never had kids.

301
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,553
I wouldn't count on children.

302
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,248
She's had some issues. Female trouble.

303
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,353
Maybe Darwin was right.

304
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,656
Nature really does weed out the nimrods.

305
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,787
So what do we do, people? Yay or nay?

306
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,832
Supportive or discouraging?

307
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,426
If anyone objects to this marriage,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

308
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,232
I say neutral or supportive.

309
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,274
Even if we discourage it,
she'll go through with it anyway.

310
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,866
Agreed then. They have our blessing.

311
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,207
To the happy couple.

312
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,946
These doctors own so much property.

313
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,557
You're going to buy four houses
on Garside Street?

314
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,395
You've certainly
got your work cut out for you.

315
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,866
One day at a time.

316
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,664
Keep on keeping on.

317
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,900
Tony. Come on in.

318
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,771
You know, it really would've been better
if we met over at Denny's.

319
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,073
What are you worried about?
I was in the neighborhood.

320
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,275
So, what's up?

321
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,080
Can I get you something? Scotch, right?

322
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,525
I sent some of my guys down there
to start gutting the place.

323
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,088
Turned out one of the houses
was a crack den.

324
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,754
- So?
- What,"so"?

325
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,631
- We got to get them out of there.
- Why didn't your guys roust them?

326
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:46,137
Oh, nice. Bunch of white guys
setting off caps in the ghetto.

327
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,399
That won't attract any attention at all.

328
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,200
- What do you want me to do?
- Exert some influence, make some calls.

329
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,247
Get the donut squad to go down there
and roust the shitbags.

330
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,306
Tony, it's not that easy--

331
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,150
Hello, Tony.

332
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,352
How you doing, hon?

333
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,915
I'm very good.

334
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,622
No, I'm very well.

335
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,760
Thanks you very much.

336
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,768
She's taking a class at the community
college, English as a Second Language.

337
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,874
You sound great.

338
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,571
Ronnie, I'll go make some lunch,
some egg salad?

339
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,377
Great. You hungry?

340
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,439
No.

341
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,183
Go light on the mayo.

342
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,486
Look, when you're dealing
with squatters' rights...

343
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,363
or anything having
to do with the homeless...

344
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,799
it can get very tricky.

345
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,565
Homeless? They're a bunch
of fucking crackheads.

346
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,799
I understand they're gumming up the works.

347
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,934
But try to see the big picture.
The HUD approval came through.

348
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,740
In two weeks, we're gonna
be looking at a huge windfall.

349
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:05,749
See, that's why you're a politician
and not a businessman.

350
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,785
Maximum value is the big picture.

351
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,953
There must be $7, 000 of copper pipe
in there, if they haven't taken it out already.

352
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,619
I still don't know
what you expect me to do about it.

353
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,560
Okay, all right.

354
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,066
We'll take the $7, 000 out of your end?

355
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,329
- Well, no, but--
- Come on, Ronnie.

356
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,503
University of Michigan.

357
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,703
Fucking figure it out.

358
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,174
Good dinner, baby.

359
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,620
Christopher.

360
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,582
- Let's get married.
- Whoa!

361
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,361
Where'd this come from?

362
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,830
I don't know.

363
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,527
It's gonna be two years we're engaged.

364
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,895
Let's just go down to City Hall.

365
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,301
City Hall?

366
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,604
What are we, schwugs?

367
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,505
You said you wanted a big wedding anyway.

368
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,772
I don't care about that shit.

369
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,744
I just want you.

370
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,808
It'll be cheaper anyway,
we could buy a house.

371
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,950
Plus, a wife...

372
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,491
can't testify against her husband.

373
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,463
You can't have a club, stay out all night
getting high when you have a kid.

374
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,936
What if we didn't have kids?

375
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,072
Fuck that!
What's the point of being married?

376
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,049
I mean, what if we can't?

377
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,482
If I can't?

378
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,244
Would you still love me?

379
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,883
Of course I'd still love you.

380
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,052
Why?

381
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,470
There's something you should know.

382
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,172
A long time ago, years ago...

383
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,737
I had a medical procedure.

384
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,178
It was before we met.

385
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,416
My uterus got pierced.

386
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,853
- Both of them?
- There's only one.

387
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,549
That's ovaries.

388
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,059
So what does that mean?
You can't get pregnant?

389
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,288
My doctor said it might be hard.

390
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,854
A friend gave me the name
of a specialist in Manhattan.

391
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,766
You knew you were damaged goods
and you never fucking told me?

392
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,604
How could you call me that?

393
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,732
Jesus fucking Christ!
How could you lie to me like that?

394
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,436
I tried to tell you once. I wanted to.

395
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,045
I was afraid that you wouldn't propose.

396
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,547
You don't get it, Adriana.

397
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:54,449
I don't have a son,
the Moltisanti name ends! That's it!

398
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,749
- We could adopt.
- Yeah, that's great!

399
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,449
Some kid with chinky eyes called Moltisanti!

400
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,389
He'd get his ass kicked every day!

401
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,051
You said you'd still love me.

402
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,926
That doesn't mean I'll fucking marry you!

403
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,910
She's a great girl, Christopher.

404
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,310
You don't want to lose this one.

405
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,248
T's right.

406
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,780
You could have more kids
than the Kennedys...

407
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,118
if you're married to some twat,
what good is it?

408
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,249
Gotta have balance in a relationship.

409
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,691
I know all that.

410
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,055
But what if the kid thing never happens?

411
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,427
Come on, medicine today? Technology?

412
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,029
You want my advice?

413
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,628
And this is nothing
about Ade or anybody else.

414
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,997
Stay single as long as you can.

415
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,003
Come on, what are you saying?

416
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:56,070
No offense, but ask me,
marriage and our thing don't jive.

417
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,308
Everybody we know is married.

418
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,745
Not everybody.

419
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,549
You love her, right?

420
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,247
Yeah. You know.

421
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,019
Then do the right thing.

422
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,623
When the shoe was on the other foot,
your spleen...

423
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,726
she stood by you, right?

424
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,895
Do you want to end up
like my uncle Junior?

425
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,869
Or worse, like Paulie?

426
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,997
Exactly.

427
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,181
All right, thanks.

428
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,145
I've got to think about it.

429
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,379
All right.

430
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,088
- Ron!
- Hi, Lenore.

431
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,448
What a nice surprise.

432
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,755
We're overdue for that dinner, the four of us.

433
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,228
- We absolutely are.
- Here they come.

434
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,492
We're late for practice. He's in the den.

435
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,033
Okay, thanks.

436
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,342
The fact is, Mo, these people are criminals.

437
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,808
Drug addicts and dealers
who've been occupying that house illegally.

438
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,839
What about the police? Get the seller,
the urologist, to make the call.

439
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,977
They're crack addicts.
They'll be back there living in two hours.

440
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,387
The deal was for me to effectuate
the purchase of these houses, period.

441
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,515
I realize that.

442
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,753
Nobody mentioned anything about violence.

443
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,852
We renounced it, remember?

444
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,562
Then Eldridge went
into the codpiece business.

445
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:28,963
I'm in a bind here.

446
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,762
What do you expect me to do?

447
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,903
- Get some of your people to handle it.
- What people?

448
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,167
Well, we can't send whites in there.

449
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,733
People of color.

450
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,539
You run a youth gang outreach program,
don't you?

451
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,110
- I'm on the board, Ron.
- Fine, I understand.

452
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,116
Take the $7, 000 this is costing
out of your end then.

453
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,345
Come on.

454
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,013
You know what I pay in child support
to my first wife.

455
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,991
The chances I'm taking with this.
I'm putting it all on the line if I get caught.

456
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,859
Get some kids, gangbangers, whatever,
you throw them some money.

457
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,622
When you think about it
from a policing standpoint...

458
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,997
it's one group of recidivists
beating on another.

459
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,797
Stop trying to justify it.

460
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,034
It's about the $7, 000.

461
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,175
Let me tell you something else.

462
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,774
Guys like Tony, you don't fool around
with these people.

463
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,789
My son...

464
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,498
I don't know what he understands.

465
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,594
I'm trying to tell him about the immigrants.
He's talking about room service.

466
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,606
We need to talk about
your recent behavior in here.

467
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,007
- Your angry tirade?
- You want to talk about that now?

468
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,910
That was weeks ago.

469
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:54,645
It was my judgment that at the time
you were in crisis about Gloria's suicide.

470
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,950
Didn't you get the flowers I sent?

471
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,390
Your behavior was unacceptable, Anthony.

472
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:07,225
You cannot have these outbursts
and expect to redeem yourself...

473
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,959
with an FTD bouquet.

474
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,424
I'm sorry, all right?

475
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,235
It's good that you're sorry,
but no, it's not all right.

476
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,633
We've been down this road before.

477
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,004
I know.

478
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,935
The fact that you're angry is fine.

479
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,913
And it's okay to talk about your anger.

480
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,411
But when it manifests itself in physicality...

481
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,879
it becomes unacceptable.

482
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,750
I never laid a finger on you.

483
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,983
You loomed.

484
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,353
- You threw my tissue holder.
- Then I picked it up.

485
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,164
I was very upset.

486
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,396
- You lied to me.
- I did not lie to you.

487
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,998
You withheld information
about a very sensitive subject.

488
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,935
All right, look.

489
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,080
I know what I did was wrong. Okay?

490
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,051
And you may not believe this...

491
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,647
but I did exercise impulse control,
and I have been controlling my anger.

492
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,688
This thing with my son,
I went to show him the old neighborhood...

493
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,888
and we got accosted by these crackheads.

494
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,126
One of them had a gun.
The other one threw a bottle at my car.

495
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:19,033
Now it may not sound like much,
but I let it go. I drove away.

496
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,971
Well, in the future,
I'll ask that you extend to me...

497
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,903
the same courtesy you would a crack addict.

498
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,919
All right, as long as we're
being truthful here, you know, opening up?

499
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,824
I've been holding a grudge against you
for recommending that Wendi Kobler...

500
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,131
that half- assed adolescent shrink.

501
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:50,361
That stupid bitch
almost sent my daughter to Barcelona.

502
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,870
You're right, it's no excuse.

503
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,346
I knew I hit something last night
when I turned off the road.

504
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,313
Up and at them, Lieutenant.

505
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:09,785
How was your ride?

506
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,487
Busted brake line.

507
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,255
- Yeah, what's it look like?
- Like a busted brake line, man.

508
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,359
Good morning, honey.

509
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,488
- Can you fix it, B. A.?
- Gonna try. Thanks, Hannibal.

510
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,123
I need those.

511
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,134
What do you need my tools for?

512
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,797
Going to get my hands on the tape
that'll prove Calvin Cutter's a murderer.

513
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,931
I won't leave the county without proof.

514
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,240
The tape won't do us good
if we can't get out of the county with it.

515
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,288
Listen, I've been doing some thinking...

516
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,117
the kid thing and all.

517
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,089
I'm not happy that you lied to me.

518
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,993
But I think I want to try and deal with it.

519
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,658
Really?

520
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,096
I love you, Adriana.

521
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,400
I want you in my life.

522
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,205
I love you, too, Christopher.

523
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,488
Are you high?

524
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,155
You gotta start with that now?

525
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,224
- I just want to be sure it's real.
- It is real.

526
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,463
I love you.

527
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,338
When can we get married?

528
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,634
I was thinking maybe our anniversary,
we could go to Vegas.

529
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,721
Vegas? Want to get married
by some Elvis impersonator?

530
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,354
- We would save money at least.
- No, it's a sacrament, Ade.

531
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,125
Why don't we have it here?
All your friends could come.

532
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,334
We'll have it in the great room,
or in the yard even, if it's nice out.

533
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,961
We can have Artie cater it.

534
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,472
I think Christopher will ask Tony
to be his best man.

535
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,474
I am sure he will be honored.

536
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,477
- Does your mother know?
- You're the first person I've told.

537
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,013
We'll decorate the whole house with mums.

538
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,310
Believe me, you will
not save any money in Vegas.

539
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,819
My cousin Jackie and her husband Tommy,
$60, 000 at blackjack.

540
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,416
- I'm getting married!
- I know!

541
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,425
Give me some of that.

542
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,345
Remember, just shoot the ceiling and shit.
No 187s.

543
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,824
Get the fuck out my house, motherfuckers!

544
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,723
Get out and stay out!

545
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,967
Hey, mister.

546
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,973
I'll kill you if you come around here, bitch.

547
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,736
Don't come back here no more.

548
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,337
Get the fuck out before we kill your asses!

549
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,385
Fucker's got a. 9 mm!

550
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,164
All right.

551
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,407
Don't come around here no more.

552
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,390
That's my brother.

553
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,433
Get out of here, you filthy bitch!

554
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,502
Go!

555
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,984
I told you young people
that crack is some bad shit.

556
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,894
Dr. Fried, $1, 300, 000.

557
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,032
Mr. Tiffen, you take possession as of today.

558
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,372
Good luck now, and congratulations.

559
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,172
Thank you, Doctor.

560
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,719
For you.

561
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,356
- What's this?
- It's a music box.

562
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,468
Holy shit.

563
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,197
A Patek?

564
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,874
Yeah, me and Ralph got lucky
on a new real estate investment.

565
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,001
You actually did it?

566
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,108
- I was just speculating. I never--
- Relax.

567
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,413
- Your name will never come up.
- It's not that, it's just....

568
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,919
The American taxpayers--

569
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,423
They pay for airport security,
look how well that's going.

570
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,186
Give me a fucking break.

571
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:28,431
This is like a $15, 000 watch, Tony.
I can't take this.

572
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,967
It's just a little thank you, that's all.

573
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,501
A. J. , what are you doing down there?

574
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,368
It's me, Carm! Down here with Bri'.

575
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,599
- I'm just borrowing some tools.
- All right.

576
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,544
Thank you for this, really.

577
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,879
I gotta get dressed.

578
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,534
- Furio, hi, good morning.
- Good morning.

579
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,698
Come in.
What are you doing out in the cold?

580
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,801
Today I'll wait in the car, I think.

581
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,609
Why? Don't you want some coffee?

582
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,046
The motor is acting funny.

583
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,882
I need to keep my foot on the gas pedal.

584
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,014
Well, okay.

585
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,952
I was looking forward
to seeing those pictures.

586
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,886
I'll let Tony know you're here.

587
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,172
Furio's here.

588
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,404
You doing some work on the house?

589
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,545
Yeah, you know.
Sinking some anchors for a wall mirror.

590
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,129
Thank you.

591
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,203
How's the mousse?

592
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,071
Fucking great.

593
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,403
I tell you...

594
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,110
the shit you miss when you're inside?

595
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,877
There was a week where I would've killed
for some Good & Plentys.

596
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,412
Should've told me.

597
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,482
I would've sent you some.

598
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,852
I know you would've.

599
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,016
See, that's the thing though.
What I need's not your problem.

600
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,956
- What do you mean?
- Fucking Tony.

601
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,735
Four months I'm up there,
like the Man in the Iron Mask.

602
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,567
Not one visit. Not even a fucking phone call.

603
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,870
- The guy didn't reach out at all?
- When do I ever complain?

604
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,942
Paulie, look, the guy's the boss.

605
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,049
You visit a guy in the can these days....

606
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,986
You know the feds.

607
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,215
You give someone the time of day,
it's a criminal conspiracy.

608
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,688
So he can't phone? You fucking did.

609
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,798
Even before I left, he was treating me
like the ugly girl at the dance.

610
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,292
I'm sucking wind, and he's rolling in it
with that fucking Christ killer.

611
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,393
Hesh?

612
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,872
Fucking Zellman, fucking real estate scam.

613
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,068
The Frelinghuysen Avenue thing.

614
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,939
We had some words.

615
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,649
- Tony made it right.
- It's a different one now.

616
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,086
I'm not sure what it is.

617
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:40,681
All I know is fucking Ralphie's going around
bragging about how much they're making.

618
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,436
Listen, John, I know we talk sometimes.

619
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,873
I tell you my problems, you tell me yours.

620
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,407
I have the highest regards for Carmine.

621
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,535
He thinks the world of you, also.

622
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,877
Even still, this shit
don't leave the table, right?

623
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,010
I'm hurt that you even have to ask.

624
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,890
As far as we know,
those transformers are perfectly safe...

625
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,454
but I'll propose an ad- hoc study.

626
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,898
- Thank you, assemblyman.
- Okay, bye- bye.

627
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,397
Mr. Olmstead called regarding lunch,
and you've got the zoning hearing at 4:00.

628
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,212
I'll call him later, I'm going to make a stop.

629
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,616
I'll see you back at the office and make sure
that she's on the list for the fundraiser.

630
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,585
- Does this go your cousins?
- No, Verrazano Salvage, ask for Gene.

631
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,795
Don't forget the fireplace mantles
and the wall sconces.

632
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,959
Downtown, the yuppies pay top dollar.

633
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,969
We're on it, Ton', don't worry.

634
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:07,066
Assemblyman. What brings you
to beautiful downtown Newark?

635
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,237
Meeting with one of my constituents.

636
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,544
- You going to be at the Bing tomorrow?
- I don't know yet.

637
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,378
Maybe I'll see you over there then.

638
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,177
Maybe you will.

639
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,096
Is it going to be a nice house here now?

640
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,673
I'm taking it.

641
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,114
I'll put it on my card, okay?
It's with my clothes.

642
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,879
I'll get the seamstress.

643
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,316
I can't believe you're finally doing this.
So sudden, too.

644
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,051
The best part is going to be seeing
how much people give us.

645
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,220
Lisa told me at her and Ricky's wedding,
Bobby Canzoneri didn't cover his plate.

646
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,424
Shut up.

647
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,332
$40 in an envelope, not even a card.

648
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,938
I'll tell you, though,
the main thing about getting married?

649
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,099
I can never be called to testify.

650
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,301
What do you mean?

651
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,209
- A wife can't testify against her husband?
- Right.

652
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,240
Actually, though,
I don't think that's actually true.

653
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,574
What do you mean?

654
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,017
They did a whole Murder, She Wrote
about that.

655
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:26,386
This butler thought his wife
couldn't testify against her husband...

656
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,255
but it turns out, legally she actually could.

657
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,168
To claim marital privilege,
three conditions must be met.

658
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,296
The communication must be made
during the course of the marriage.

659
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:45,034
Anything said before you were married
is fair game.

660
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,010
Two, the communication
must involve only the spouses.

661
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,478
The presence of a third party
destroys the privilege.

662
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,380
Three, communication can't be made
in furtherance of a crime.

663
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,318
Oh, my God, it's a simple question.
Can they make me testify or not?

664
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,148
The short answer?

665
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:00,946
Probably.

666
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:05,421
In organized crime, a RICO, the feds
will spend a fortune putting on their case.

667
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,193
Believe me, if they want you to testify,
they're going to find a way.

668
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,965
Here you go, 10 percent apiece.

669
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,967
Technically, it's a little less...

670
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,168
but our friend rounded you up
to an even $60, 000.

671
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,207
There's plenty more where that came from.

672
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,615
A lot of poor families
need affordable housing in Newark.

673
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,893
Ronnie, listen...

674
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,091
I didn't want to say this.

675
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,496
- No hard feelings?
- Of course not.

676
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,505
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

677
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,373
You're just being....

678
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,476
- You're being awfully quiet.
- I don't know, tired.

679
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,580
- You ever feel bad about any of this?
- What do you mean?

680
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,056
When I think about where we started out....

681
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,760
I used to think what I did made a difference.

682
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,026
The anti- drug programs, the voter drives.

683
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,156
But over the years...

684
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,998
it's like shoveling shit
against the tide, you know that.

685
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,298
I guess.

686
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,209
You cut corners, but you help out.
Do the best you can.

687
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:32,948
If it ain't us, it's going to be somebody else.
Really, I mean....

688
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,947
What are we supposed to be,
the only honest men?

689
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,444
We were going to lead a revolution.

690
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,250
Revolution.

691
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,490
The revolution got sold, Ronnie.

692
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,322
You heard the Beatles for H&R Block?

693
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,329
Sometimes I feel like I should be punished.

694
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,625
Come on, let's get something to eat.

695
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,707
Here's something I never thought I'd say:

696
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,901
To the federal government.

697
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,373
Depends on which department.

698
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,654
A cappuccino maker, this is great.

699
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,596
Is that the Capresso? You'll love that, Ade.

700
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,594
Cappuccino now. He used to drink Bosco.

701
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,564
I got it at Fortunoff's
if you want to exchange it.

702
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,245
No scissors, bad luck!

703
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,248
That's from me.

704
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:53,763
I can't count how many cheese melts
I've made for Silvio in that thing.

705
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,765
Here, open this one, Ade.

706
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,672
Oh, girl

707
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,904
I'd be in trouble if you left me now

708
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:47,076
'Cause I don't know where to look for love

709
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,713
Oh, girl

710
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,397
You got anything to drink?

711
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,847
What's going on?

712
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,044
What's up?

713
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,561
Look, why don't you just calm down and--

714
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,821
I'm perfectly calm.

715
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,161
We can talk about whatever's bothering you.

716
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,722
Tony, this is crazy.

717
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,063
Come on, fuck!

718
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,367
Tony, no!

719
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,512
All the girls in New Jersey,
you had to fuck this one?

720
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,717
Go ahead, cry like a bitch.

721
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,339
Ronnie.
