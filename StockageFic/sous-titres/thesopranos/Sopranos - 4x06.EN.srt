1
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,592
When I look at the great pyramid...

2
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,700
the marvel there for me
is not the stonework...

3
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,963
as much as the level of organization...

4
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,133
that these ancient Egyptians had...

5
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,545
getting this society
to pull together in such a way...

6
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,414
that they not only had blocks of stone...

7
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,619
but bread on the table.

8
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,419
Stone setters were all fairly accomplished.

9
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,823
Very good craftsmen.

10
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,763
It isn't surprising...

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,701
they had such a long history,
thousands of years doing this.

12
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,901
Meet me in 20 minutes
at the old Webendorfer factory parking lot.

13
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,780
The real gigantic pyramids...

14
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,546
were built within the space of
about three, maybe four generations.

15
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,723
Jesus Christ!

16
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,458
It's true, they're gonna start a draft.

17
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,558
There's no way I'm going in the army.

18
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,665
Yeah, 'cause his old man'd
put a horse's head in some senator's bed.

19
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,041
- Insert foot in mouth, Jason.
- No big.

20
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,836
Ever get paranoid they'll, like,
shoot up your house like in Godfather II?

21
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,679
- Probably got armed guards at night.
- That shit doesn't happen anymore.

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,151
- You have attack dogs on the property.
- No.

23
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,989
I mean, we did, but she got hit by a car.

24
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,255
Jason said your old man's
mostly legit now, anyway.

25
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,920
Yeah, like what?

26
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,361
- He's in waste management.
- Garbage?

27
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,797
Recycling.

28
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,303
What about drugs and prostitution and shit?

29
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,463
No.

30
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,398
- His dad owns a strip club, though.
- Let's go.

31
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,806
We'd get carded.

32
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,540
We can just stop by, and watch
the strippers coming in and out, right?

33
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,263
What's going on?

34
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,007
Truckload the other night
from Port Elizabeth?

35
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,672
Give the washing machines
to Frank Contino.

36
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,146
You got it.

37
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,281
Vacuum cleaners, too?

38
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,354
No, Patsy's got a buyer for those.

39
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,785
You been drinking?

40
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,925
Me and Ade had some wine at the house.

41
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,492
Been wanting to talk to you.

42
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,529
Yeah, been wanting to talk to you, too.

43
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,900
I'll go first.

44
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,072
I gotta make it my number- one priority...

45
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,508
to limit my exposure to potentially
damaging conversations and wiretaps.

46
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,810
Sure, guy in your position....

47
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,888
So, over the next couple of years,
more and more...

48
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,754
I'm gonna be giving my orders
through you...

49
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,655
and then finally, only through you.

50
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,058
What about Sil?
You got that with him and Paulie.

51
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,465
Those other guys, Sil, Paulie...

52
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,795
one thing they're not...

53
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,904
they're not my blood.

54
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,608
You hear what I'm saying to you?
It's a matter of trust.

55
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,677
It's very wise.

56
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,081
Sil's a good consiglieri,
and will continue as such.

57
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,848
But he's no fucking spring chicken either.

58
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,923
But it's no reason
to be giving him an attitude.

59
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,653
No, of course not.

60
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,397
And there's gonna be a period of transition.

61
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,657
Jesus Christ, T!

62
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,032
You're gonna take this family
into the 21st century.

63
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,170
We're already in the 21st century, though.

64
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,468
Whatever you say, T.
I'd follow you into the gates of hell.

65
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,407
That's what I was gonna say to you.

66
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,779
What you did for me,
that fuck who killed my father...

67
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,251
I'll never forget that.

68
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,853
I only hope I'm worthy.

69
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,949
- Why wouldn't you be worthy?
- I'm just saying.

70
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,368
Yeah, this looks familiar.

71
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,300
The pizza parlor. Pull over, Matt.

72
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,911
This is it?

73
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,078
- It's closed.
- Shit.

74
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,978
This place, this is the pork store.

75
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,810
It's a gay strip club?

76
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,948
Obviously it's not a strip club,
it's a fucking butcher shop.

77
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,322
I think I got it all messed up.

78
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,927
This is where my dad's office is.

79
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,061
Okay, it's a front.

80
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,664
- Like Genco Olive Oil.
- Yeah, it's like Genco.

81
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,829
- It looks really clandestine.
- So where's the strip club, A. J.?

82
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:50,171
Maybe Route 17, or Route 4.
Lodi or something?

83
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,367
This is stupid. Let's go.

84
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,751
I heard a car.
Your son's out past curfew again.

85
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,287
- Call his cell?
- My goodness.

86
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,558
I didn't know anybody else was here.

87
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,887
I just use the men's room.

88
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,646
Sometimes I worry about Furio.

89
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,820
Doesn't he seem lonely?

90
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,322
I was telling Jessica
about him this morning...

91
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,861
the hygienist in Dr. Mascera's office?

92
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,329
I know I shouldn't gossip, but...

93
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,624
I think she was having an affair
with Dr. Mascera.

94
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,335
Here she is.

95
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,070
- Their office Christmas card.
- Yeah, there's his hand on her ass.

96
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,131
Stop it.

97
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,008
I think she's ready for somebody nice.

98
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,478
And she seemed very receptive
when I described Furio to her.

99
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,073
She's not his type.

100
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,343
What's his type?

101
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,123
Don't worry about him. Stay out of it.

102
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,916
- One date won't hurt.
- Why do you wanna bother?

103
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,859
My little Hello, Dolly!

104
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,195
Speaking of gossip.

105
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,095
That noise in the Mercedes?

106
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,628
Yeah?

107
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,801
Brought it over to Globe Motors
to have it looked at.

108
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,244
And I was talking to Jerry
in the service department?

109
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,847
Now, remember that nice sales lady?

110
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,545
I don't think so.

111
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,050
Gloria Trillo,
she gave me a ride home that day?

112
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,787
You know what Jerry told me about her?
She died.

113
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,653
She what?

114
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,895
She committed suicide. Isn't that awful?

115
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,066
Mr. Empathy over there.

116
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,742
She hung herself from a chandelier.

117
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,548
Good evening, Vesuvio.

118
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,815
I'm sorry, we aren't taking any more
reservations, the kitchen is closing.

119
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,750
$50, 000. That's a lotta escarole.

120
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,425
- Did you try the bank?
- Escarole?

121
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,318
Escarole. Money.

122
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,165
Escarole. Money. Good.

123
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,501
No, the bank, red tape.
I have only until the end of the week.

124
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,635
I told my brother
you know people who lend money.

125
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,302
Little pitchers have big ears.

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,844
I just need it for 10 days and then,
pas de probleme.

127
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,646
- Do you mind if I ask what for?
- Some business in France.

128
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,552
A group is purchasing
an Armagnac property.

129
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,819
I got the dossier right here.

130
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,457
Jesus!

131
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,032
Domaine Vezelay.

132
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,762
After Darroze, one of the oldest,
largest producers of Bas- Armagnac...

133
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,431
which is on fire now in France,
and all over Europe.

134
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,269
It's the next vodka.

135
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,773
This is a $10 million worldwide launch.

136
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,712
I got $100, 000 into it,
and I need $50, 000 more to get...

137
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,876
- the North American distribution rights.
- Armagnac?

138
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,646
I'll bring you a bottle of Vezelay.
Unbelievable.

139
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,681
- And with cigars, which are now very hot.
- You only need the money for 10 days?

140
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,783
How's that?

141
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,489
Because when the deal is done,
the advertising money is released to me.

142
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,561
You understand,
these people that I might know...

143
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,624
they don't know you.

144
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,538
So I wouldn't be just vouching for you.
I, in essence, would be the lender.

145
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,837
And it's gonna cost you.

146
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,503
- How much?
- $10, 000.

147
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,569
Merde.

148
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,938
$5, 000.

149
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,444
$7, 500.

150
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,577
Okay.

151
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,591
Charmaine, I don't think you know
Elodi's brother, Jean- Philippe?

152
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,392
Nice to meet you, but, Elodi, please...

153
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,393
can you clear off table four?

154
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,961
Thank you.

155
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,738
- Charmaine, she's French?
- Not remotely.

156
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,111
She's a hostess.

157
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,843
Not a busboy.

158
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,884
What was...about, Arthur?

159
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,590
It's just a venture capital thing
with Jean- Philippe.

160
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,823
It wouldn't pass your high
Wharton School of Business standards.

161
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,455
If you wanna bring in money...

162
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,660
why don't you get your friend,
Anthony Soprano, to pay his tab?

163
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:47,195
- It's close to $6, 000.
- I could have an empire like Bobby Flay.

164
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,567
And it still
wouldn't be good enough for you.

165
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,741
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

166
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:57,112
We'll start working on your empire
right after we pay the $10, 000...

167
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,277
of orthodenture
Melissa's gonna need this year.

168
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,585
They're on allocation from the factory.

169
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,986
I don't know
when we're going to get any more in.

170
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,049
But I'm free if you wanna take it for a spin.

171
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,858
Actually, I was working with
one of your other salespeople last year.

172
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,595
She was really very helpful,
I ought to give her the business.

173
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,064
Gloria Trillo?

174
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,800
She's no longer with us.

175
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,735
You know where she went?

176
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,003
Actually, she died.

177
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,236
What happened?

178
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,317
She committed suicide.

179
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,676
Why?

180
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,479
I mean...

181
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,891
she was...

182
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,695
Salesperson of the Year, or something.

183
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,822
I didn't know her that well.

184
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,199
But I got the impression she wasn't
very lucky with men, that sort of thing.

185
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,799
- When was this?
- Month ago, maybe two.

186
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,632
What'd she say?

187
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,574
I mean, you know, in the papers you read...

188
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,471
they always leave a note.

189
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,216
She did leave a note on her desk.
The police took it.

190
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,621
Later, they told us it was just copy
for a classified ad.

191
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,988
She was selling her wolf stole.

192
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,721
Anyway, let me give you my card.

193
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,635
Chef Osso Bucco.

194
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,343
This is a rare pleasure.

195
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,746
Or is it medium- well?

196
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,410
A little restaurant humor.

197
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,210
So, you know...

198
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:21,692
if you brought a pair of dirty chef whites,
my friend here'll suck out the stains for you.

199
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,618
Sit.

200
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,130
Okay, in a nutshell.

201
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,141
- I'd like to borrow a little money.
- How little?

202
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,771
$50, 000, just for a couple of weeks.

203
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,878
- I'm upgrading the kitchen in the restaurant.
- Get the fuck outta here.

204
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,816
What you take out of that bar...

205
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,981
you must be sitting on money
like King Croesus.

206
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,056
I wish.

207
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,959
I won't be able to lend you
money for less than two points.

208
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,998
- It's not a problem.
- Just outta curiosity...

209
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,291
what's going to happen in two weeks?

210
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,203
The insurance check's gonna come.

211
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,537
I hate to do it, Artie...

212
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,044
but I think I'm gonna pass. Sorry.

213
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,550
- Why not?
- 'Cause if you don't pay me back...

214
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,489
I ain't gonna be able to hurt you.

215
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,993
So how you doing?

216
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,828
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

217
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,029
How about you?

218
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,202
Fine, thank you.

219
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,433
Really?

220
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,878
Business okay? Everybody hunky- dory?

221
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,381
You know...

222
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,619
onward and upward.

223
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,123
How's Gloria Trillo?
She still hanging around?

224
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,187
- It's a terrible tragedy.
- So you fucking knew.

225
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,757
You fucking lied!
You let me fucking sit there!

226
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,293
Please, sit down.

227
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,429
How the fuck am I supposed to trust you?
You're my doctor.

228
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,939
Please, sit down. You're scaring me.

229
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,006
- You've been drinking.
- Why the fuck didn't you help her?

230
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,042
- Sometimes you can't.
- I bet you charged her enough, didn't you?

231
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,052
Bet you didn't cut her a deal,
'cause you're an incompetent.

232
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,749
I give my patients everything I've got.

233
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,349
And when something like this happens,
I'm devastated.

234
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,658
She was a good kid.

235
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,128
But she was fucking crazy, and I told you.

236
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,736
And I want you to know that I was
up- front with her. She knew I was married.

237
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,069
I'm aware of that.

238
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,906
Suicide, Jesus Christ! What the fuck?

239
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,175
I have to respect confidentiality,
even after a patient is dead.

240
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,382
But with something like this...

241
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,754
there's no one cause.

242
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,392
You yourself just referred
to her emotional problems.

243
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,427
She slipped through everyone's grasp.

244
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,660
She did it after me, I mean, admit it.

245
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,795
You know, she...

246
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,967
reached out to me, for me to care...

247
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,745
and I wasn't there for her.

248
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,748
Why are you so quick to blame yourself?

249
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:16,883
Come in.

250
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,530
- What's up? You want coffee?
- No.

251
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,471
Artie, you need a favor.

252
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,307
- Why didn't you reach out to me?
- What are you talking about?

253
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,110
Ralph Cifaretto called me and told me
you came to him for money?

254
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,681
You need something,
you don't come to me?

255
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,378
- I'm your friend.
- Right.

256
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,253
I didn't want to impinge on our friendship.

257
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,760
But, Artie, this is me...

258
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,919
Tony.

259
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,393
If I was desperate, if Melissa had
a tumor instead of an overbite...

260
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,561
Madonna santo, knock wood...

261
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,800
you'd be the first place I went to,
but this was a business venture.

262
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,243
- What kind of deal?
- Elodi's brother.

263
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,738
Needs a bridge loan, $50, 000,
and I get back $57, 500 in 10 days.

264
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,979
- Thought it was for the restaurant.
- I told Ralphie that.

265
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,953
Don't want him going around me
to the principals.

266
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,183
- What for then?
- North American distribution rights...

267
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,025
for Domaine Vezelay Armagnac.

268
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,439
It's the new vodka.
This stuff is sweeping Europe.

269
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,375
It's gonna be bigger than Stoli, Goose.
Who ever heard of Goose before?

270
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,105
It's French vodka.

271
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,075
These guys, they're big players.

272
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,318
They're throwing millions
behind product introduction.

273
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,048
- All right, you got it.
- I told you, Tony, no.

274
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,053
What the fuck am l?
A toxic person or something?

275
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,320
No, Tony, come on, please.

276
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,259
I'll charge you a point and a half.

277
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,856
And that's a lot fucking
better than Ralph Cifaretto would do.

278
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,199
I insist.

279
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,035
Look here's, like, $3, 000.

280
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,833
Somebody's gonna come by,
give you the rest.

281
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,911
You're a great guy.

282
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,082
Come here.

283
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,360
It's a good idea.

284
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,525
Snifter, a nice cigar. You'll see what I mean.

285
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,470
Dinner's almost ready.

286
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,144
Shit.

287
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,334
Which do you wanna see?

288
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,025
This...

289
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,328
or this?

290
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,692
Cousin Brian's here!

291
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,502
Be right down!

292
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,949
- Brian, how you doing?
- Good, Ton', great to see you.

293
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,855
Brian brought the papers.

294
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,620
He said you called him last night
to hurry things along?

295
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,822
Yeah, the Soprano family living trust,
as discussed.

296
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,365
Now when I croak, it's her problem.

297
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,195
You have made me so happy.

298
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,369
And if I was, like, obnoxious about this,
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,641
Come on.

300
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,415
That's my lava cookies for the bake sale.

301
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,579
- Would you like a couple for your coffee?
- Thanks, but I gotta get back.

302
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,316
We'll see you and Janelle at the
Billy Joel thing, right?

303
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,857
Wouldn't miss it.

304
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,461
You know what, Ton'?
It's a shame you didn't get eight tickets.

305
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,524
Furio and Jessica could have come.
It takes the pressure off of a blind date.

306
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,728
Heshie's guy could only get six.

307
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:08,840
I'll get the originals back to you.
I'll have a copy, get one to your lawyer.

308
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,505
All right.

309
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,787
You know, that's a nice suit. What is it?

310
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,987
Boss.

311
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,691
- Yeah, I notice you like the good stuff.
- My only vice.

312
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,465
Call this number.

313
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,731
You ask for Patsy.

314
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,202
- Tell him I said to take care of you.
- Thanks, Tony.

315
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,243
- You're a great guy.
- All right.

316
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,444
- Don't forget to call on that meat order.
- No problem.

317
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,056
- Hi.
- Hi.

318
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,797
- Hi, Ma. This is Devin.
- Hi, Devin, how are you?

319
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,597
- Really well. It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

320
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,901
- Anthony, you want to turn that down?
- Yeah.

321
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,306
If you kids are hungry,
I can make a couple sandwiches.

322
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,177
No, we're fine, Ma.

323
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,080
Careful of my Lladro, please.

324
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,582
Yeah. Don't worry.

325
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,521
- What do you call it?
- Lladro.

326
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,556
I don't even wanna say how much it costs.

327
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,825
$3, 000.

328
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,063
I really wanted to be alone with you.

329
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,335
Your house is out, right?

330
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:55,041
My mom's boyfriend's using it as an office,
and I'm not at my dad's till next week.

331
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,811
- My sister's dorm.
- At Columbia?

332
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,310
Sure, let's go.

333
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,483
The 33 bus goes into the city every hour.

334
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,494
They're so smelly. I'll call a car service.

335
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,863
- How much is that?
- I'll put it on my AmEx.

336
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,362
I'll call her cell.

337
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,668
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

338
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:29,043
I'm on my way into the city with a friend,
and I thought maybe we could hook up?

339
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,948
Wow, great.
I'm not on campus, but you could meet me.

340
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:37,079
Take the Cross Bronx Expressway
to the corner of Brook Ave. and 161st Street.

341
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,386
- Brook Avenue and what?
- 161st Street.

342
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,688
- Okay.
- All right, see you soon.

343
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,056
I pictured your house different.

344
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,900
I thought it'd be like Don Corleone's
compound with gate, wall, big old Cadillacs.

345
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,999
Isn't that stupid?

346
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,837
Our place in Tahoe
looks exactly like Michael's in II.

347
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,500
Wow, really?

348
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,745
No, we don't have a place in Tahoe.

349
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,482
We have a boat though.

350
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,144
I'm like a gangster dude's girlfriend.

351
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:26,029
- Are you sure this is it?
- Brook Avenue and 161st Street.

352
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,999
- Columbia? This looks like Harlem.
- South Bronx.

353
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,278
Don't leave, okay?

354
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,198
Help you?

355
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,193
They're mine.

356
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,406
When did you get taller than me?

357
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,440
Cheokay, this is my little brother.
Cheokay just got accepted at Yale Law.

358
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,174
What's happening?

359
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,380
- I'm Meadow, Politeness Man's sister.
- I'm Devin.

360
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,114
Can I talk to you?

361
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,784
This is what you do on a Friday night?

362
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,828
The South Bronx Law Center.

363
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,797
It's a free criminal defense service
for those who can't afford legal counsel.

364
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,924
I intern here.

365
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,491
- I need to use your room.
- What for?

366
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,735
You know.

367
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,378
You've gotta be kidding. Anthony, no.

368
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,143
- Well, just for a little while. Why not?
- I don't even wanna think about it.

369
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,480
It's my bed.
How am I gonna go in there after?

370
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,215
We'll just stay on the coverlet.
We came all the way over here.

371
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,020
I thought you wanted to go into the city.
There's all this stuff going on.

372
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,561
I thought we'd go to the Alphabets.
A friend's reading.

373
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,256
She's a novelist.

374
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:09,964
The greatest cultural center in the world,
and you came over here for sex?

375
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,671
Probably just gonna cruise.

376
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,612
Is the tree up at Rockefeller Center yet?

377
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,276
Look at the way these people have to live.

378
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,015
I think they're overwhelmed.

379
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,690
I mean, they're in a cycle,
they keep having kids....

380
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,223
I know.

381
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:37,598
We're just so insulated from reality.
I mean, we have everything we want.

382
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,663
When you think about it.

383
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,365
They're on food stamps and welfare.

384
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,773
And my mom could go out
and buy a statue for $3, 000.

385
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,739
It's $3, 000.

386
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:51,111
- We have a housekeeper three days a week.
- We have one, too.

387
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:56,813
I guess I just lucked out to be rich
and live in a big house.

388
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,555
Even somebody like Steve Mussel.

389
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,425
He's got all right clothes,
but have you ever been to his house?

390
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,122
I don't think so.

391
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,222
His dad's a math teacher.

392
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,693
They don't even have a dining room.

393
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,564
There's five people living there.
It's just this little box.

394
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,803
Here.

395
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,510
Arthur, already 80 seats tonight.

396
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,413
They come to see you.

397
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,590
I eat so much of your gnocchi,
I'm gonna get a belly.

398
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,026
Elodi, is Jean- Philippe okay?

399
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,630
- What do you mean?
- He was gonna call me.

400
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,300
I left him a couple of messages,
he didn't call back.

401
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,311
Did you hear from him?
Does he call your mother?

402
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,448
He always works strange hours.
The time difference.

403
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,878
By the time we're waking up...

404
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,251
they're already at home,
eating dinner in Toulouse.

405
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,117
I almost forget.

406
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,429
I bring you something.
Boulevard des Slows. It's for the PA.

407
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,131
I have to put the flowers in the vases.

408
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,436
Problems with the investment, Arthur?

409
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,770
What do you mean?

410
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,068
Please. What do you think?

411
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,975
She suddenly wants to play
"hide the boudin blanc" with you?

412
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,553
We don't see you here anymore.

413
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,421
Or up at the house, either.

414
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,124
Christopher, he can't seem to shake this flu.

415
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,225
Yeah, I noticed his skin
doesn't look so good.

416
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,070
He's just stressed out.

417
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,333
Which reminds me.

418
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,274
Billy Joel?
Maybe you shouldn't count on us.

419
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,869
You mean, you might not be able to come?

420
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:06,246
There's been all these problems
at the Crazy Horse, and I don't know....

421
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,153
What a shame, that's awful.

422
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,056
What am I gonna do with those tickets?

423
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,230
God, I love marrow.

424
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,973
Remember Ma with the bone?

425
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,773
Sounded like half- price day
at the liposuction center.

426
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,074
Please.

427
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,679
It's nice, us having dinner together,
catching up.

428
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,084
I'm just glad I'm in a position to do it.

429
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:53,963
Chocolate souffle, gelato, sorbet sampler.

430
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,027
- On the house.
- Thank you.

431
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:00,298
Something for after dinner,
I got a nice Armagnac.

432
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,238
I used to drink that in France. Histamines.

433
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,335
I think it's good.

434
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,807
I know, Tony. Can I have a Nonino Picolit?

435
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,077
- I know it's expensive.
- Yeah, bring me one, too.

436
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,213
So you and Bobby Bacala, huh?

437
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,256
So that's it.

438
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,987
What is so fucking compelling to you
about my personal business?

439
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,756
Jesus Christ, am I such an ogre?

440
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,196
I was just gonna say he's a nice guy.

441
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,831
I gotta have an agenda?

442
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,160
No, Tony.

443
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,873
- I'm sorry.
- What am l, a toxic person?

444
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,840
You're a great brother.

445
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,134
We can go at it pretty good...

446
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,807
but you always seem to reach out
when it counts.

447
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,742
Yeah?

448
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,419
Did you ever know anybody that...

449
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,660
ever committed suicide?

450
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,227
Plenty. I used to live in Seattle, Tony.

451
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,463
Anybody close?

452
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,096
Murray Furlong.

453
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,997
He was a good friend. He lived upstairs.

454
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,042
People said he was in the CIA,
gone for long periods of time and...

455
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,604
I always thought he was gay. I don't know.

456
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,674
Maybe that's not mutually exclusive.
Anyway...

457
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,851
one day...

458
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:28,384
he sucked on the end of a deer rifle.

459
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,751
Do you feel responsible?

460
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,431
Yeah, I did.

461
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,559
You know, partly, we all did.

462
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,002
My last conversation with him
was an argument...

463
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:49,446
if you can call it that, about him asking me
to accept FedEx packages for him.

464
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,481
- But you never really know why.
- Probably it was his name.

465
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,022
You can leave the bottle.

466
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,698
And, Artie, put that on my tab.

467
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,103
Of course.

468
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,582
Tony, can I talk to you?

469
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,982
What's going on?

470
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,549
I just wanna give you a little heads up.

471
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,255
I know the money's due in a couple of days.

472
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,663
I'm a little concerned.

473
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:45,361
I can't get a hold of Jean- Philippe,
he doesn't return my calls.

474
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,331
- Did you go over there?
- Not yet.

475
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,386
Artie, you gotta go over there.

476
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,856
- The guy's not returning your phone calls.
- I know.

477
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,755
They miss a payment, start acting like...

478
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,491
they're doing you a favor
if they give you anything.

479
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,830
And then you gotta spend
all your time hounding'em.

480
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,268
You gotta get your arms around this thing.

481
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,374
You know what I'm saying?

482
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,280
Jean- Philippe, you're home.

483
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,220
I called you five times, qu'est- ce que c'est?
Message machine broken?

484
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,626
Nice crib.

485
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,823
What is that, Berber carpet?

486
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,964
Those fucking shoes you wear...

487
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,937
what are they, designer?

488
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,569
You fucking avoiding me, motherfucker?

489
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,080
Where's my money?
What, are you gonna cry now?

490
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:08,314
Stand up, you frog- eating faccia di cazz',
I will fuck you up, man.

491
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,751
It's you. Hello. Come in.

492
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:27,730
You're home. Qu'est- ce que c'est, man?
Message machine broken?

493
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,731
I'm sorry, I've been wishing to call you.

494
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,267
Nice crib.

495
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,862
You were supposed to give me my money
two days ago.

496
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,066
I know.

497
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,771
Credit Lyonnais, they didn't come through
with the second round of financing yet.

498
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,871
My partners are sick about it.

499
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,473
That's not my problem, Jean- Philippe.

500
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:51,117
- I want my money.
- I just told you, I don't have it.

501
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,688
- When are you gonna get it?
- I don't know, okay? I don't know.

502
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,052
It doesn't look too good.

503
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,194
What does that mean?

504
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,497
I mean, I don't know
if it's going to happen, all right?

505
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,273
They were not convinced
to our business model.

506
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,107
They didn't agree there was
as much potential for Armagnac.

507
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,581
The problem has been, it seems,
that people cannot figure out...

508
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,776
how to market Armagnac.

509
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,647
The hip approach, like with Stoli, fails.

510
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,784
You said it was the next vodka!

511
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,417
Hey, so we are big boys, we must move on.

512
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:33,195
Frog- eating, fucking faccia di cazz'.

513
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,824
- What did you say?
- I said, I want my money!

514
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,391
Are you stupid? That money's spent.

515
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,000
Operating expenses, notaires, travel.

516
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,129
No!

517
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,571
- You have my $50, 000.
- It's business, it's a risk.

518
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,944
- I have a daughter who needs braces!
- Listen to me, I don't have it right now.

519
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,974
You fucking, French, fucking,
lying cocksucker!

520
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,018
Fuck your mother!

521
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,838
My earring!

522
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,340
- You ripped my fucking ear!
- Du con.

523
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,909
- I want my money.
- Fuck you!

524
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,248
I see you again, I'll kill you.

525
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,228
The thing is to keep knocking on the door
without going in right away.

526
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,563
Poke the perimeter, tap on the gate
till she's out of her fucking mind, begging.

527
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,399
Then you own that shit, that pussy's yours.

528
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,268
I think she's ready.

529
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,641
We shall know forsooth.

530
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,568
Liz has been to her house.
She says it's nice.

531
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,249
It doesn't look that great.

532
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,046
It's kind of Bo Peep- ish.

533
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,580
Can I help you?

534
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,924
We're here to see Devin Pillsbury.

535
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,657
Proceed on up, park in the auto court.

536
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,869
Help you guys?

537
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,972
It's okay, Ted. Hi, guys.

538
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,513
You wanna pull it over here for me, sir?

539
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:47,191
Wow, nice place.

540
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,631
Get outta here.

541
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,670
No, it's true. Iceland is a volcano.

542
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,500
Hawaii is a volcano.

543
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,610
Come here.

544
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,177
Hello?

545
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,016
I just want you to know that I tried.

546
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,422
And I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

547
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:53,157
And I love you, and I'm sorry I let you down.

548
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,492
Artie?

549
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,432
What's the matter? What's wrong with you?

550
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,597
I'm a complete and total failure.

551
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,604
You take care of Charmaine.

552
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,339
What did you do, Artie?

553
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,346
What did you do?

554
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,939
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

555
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,281
Artie, did you take something?

556
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,120
Don't go to sleep!

557
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,485
Artie, you hear me? Don't go to sleep!

558
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,921
Jesus fucking Christ!

559
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,087
What's wrong? You gotta go?

560
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,762
A friend of mine.

561
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:32,435
Fucking idiot took some pills or something,
he's trying to kill himself.

562
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,728
What the fuck am I doing?

563
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,945
I'm gonna call 911.
They'll do him more good than I can.

564
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,913
I'm gonna call 911.
They'll do him more good than I can.

565
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,182
- Are these real?
- Yeah.

566
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,191
So this is, like, a real Picasso?

567
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,194
My dad collects his later stuff.

568
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,592
They're all cocks.

569
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,530
Picasso was an old man by then.

570
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,194
Shit, they must be worth millions, at least.

571
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,500
Isn't your dad afraid
we're gonna steal them?

572
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,672
What is that, a Sota turntable?

573
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,937
Whoa, Patrick, little Mr. Consumer.

574
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,413
You don't like that?
Do you want something else?

575
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,682
No, just....

576
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,622
I wish you would've said something.

577
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,417
It doesn't mean anything.

578
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,629
I feel so stupid. My mother's stupid Lladro...

579
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,267
and we have a housekeeper
three days a week?

580
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,566
I don't care. I like you.

581
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,100
Rubber Soul in mint condition.
This has gotta be worth, what?

582
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,076
- You should've told me.
- And what would you have done if I did?

583
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:55,812
I don't know, but if it wasn't such a big deal,
why didn't you say something?

584
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,391
Jesus.

585
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:09,429
What happened?

586
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,700
It all went to shit."The next vodka."

587
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,001
So this is what you do?

588
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:19,770
But you don't understand.
The money's gone.

589
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,908
Can't you come and talk to me?

590
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,478
I'm your friend.

591
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:33,350
Suppose you hadn't been able to reach me,
and I go to your house and find you dead.

592
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,781
How am I supposed to feel?

593
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,861
Take the restaurant.

594
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,793
I don't want the fucking restaurant.

595
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,641
Then how am I gonna pay you back?

596
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:57,103
$50, 000, it'd take the rest of my life.

597
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,014
It's $51, 500, vig- wise, Artie...

598
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,510
and technically,
you already missed a payment.

599
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,288
All right, look, let's just....

600
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,353
We'll wipe my tab at the restaurant.

601
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:14,928
Thank you.

602
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,430
Tony, that's what, $6, 000?

603
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,005
What about the rest of the money?

604
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,173
I'll assume the guy's dead.

605
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,237
- Collect the $50, 000.
- Thank you.

606
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,393
The cobwebs are now removed.

607
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,797
What the fuck are you talking about?

608
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,993
You saw this whole thing, didn't you?

609
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,469
You knew exactly what was gonna happen.

610
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,637
You can see 20 moves down the road.

611
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,373
Please, I don't blame you, I envy you.

612
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,678
It's like an instinct,
like a hawk sees a little mouse...

613
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,945
moving around a cornfield, from a mile up.

614
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,715
You think it's my fault
you're fucking lying in here?

615
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,280
It's just that somebody mentions $50, 000...

616
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,351
to bankroll a French digestif,
and your mind...

617
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,760
goes through all the permutations at,
like, internet speed and realizes:

618
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,264
"Worst case scenario: I eat for free."

619
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,804
You fucking suicide!

620
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,537
- You're disgraceful!
- I'm sorry.

621
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,536
No, fuck that!

622
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,578
Does anybody else know
I loaned you the money?

623
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,451
- Like who?
- I don't give a fuck who.

624
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,821
Adriana, Father Intintola, my wife, anybody?

625
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,597
All right, you got mugged.

626
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,859
Outside of your house,
it was a street crime, kids.

627
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,597
They took your wallet and your watch.
Where are they?

628
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,195
- Why?
- Come on.

629
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,336
Why?

630
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,547
You don't care what people think?

631
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,451
I do! Enough people hate me.

632
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,256
You fought back,
they ripped your earring outta your ear...

633
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,816
you were bleeding, went inside the house,
you took pills for the pain...

634
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,193
'cause you'd have to wait
at the emergency room for a couple hours.

635
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:32,462
They pumped my stomach.
They saw the Armagnac.

636
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,333
You got fucking mugged!

637
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,202
Do you understand me?
I didn't loan you shit.

638
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,434
I had this dream.

639
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,307
My grandfather's sitting at a table,
and in front of him is Steak Pizzaiola.

640
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,573
And standing next to him
is my grandmother.

641
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,911
And she's wearing a blue dress
and pouring him a glass of wine.

642
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,417
And he says to me,"You see this?

643
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,785
"lf you got a good wife,
you're a millionaire."

644
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:30,389
So the next day, I go over Carmela's house
for dinner with her family.

645
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,156
And in front of me is Steak Pizzaiola.

646
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,194
Before I could realize
the deja vu that was going on...

647
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,100
Carmela's standing next to me
in a blue dress...

648
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,297
pouring me a glass of soda.

649
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,573
The next day, I bought the ring.

650
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,703
That is so incredible, so romantic.

651
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,215
She's a romantic one, this one.

652
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,016
- She gonna clean my teeth for me.
- Really?

653
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:02,388
I have to confess. You know, sometimes,
I find the dentist erotic.

654
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,184
Brian, all night, I admire your suit.

655
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,355
My man, Mr. Soprano, turned me on to it.

656
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,524
Nice. Patsy?

657
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:14,597
- I'd like to propose a toast to our host.
- Hear, hear.

658
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,408
Tony, great tickets, great meal, great wine...

659
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,345
and for being a great guy,
who I'm proud to call a new friend.

660
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,791
So he says I planned it all along...

661
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,886
that I could see 20 steps down the road
how it was gonna go...

662
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,827
and how he was gonna get screwed.

663
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,388
Did you?

664
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,228
- See it?
- I don't know.

665
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:53,165
According to him,
it's subconscious, second nature.

666
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:58,179
- But the accusation bothers you.
- Is that the kind of person I am?

667
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,614
A hawk? That's an animal.

668
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:05,387
As I understand it,
you make a lot of your living through usury.

669
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,952
So why the pangs of conscience this time?

670
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:14,189
Do you think your reaction
would've been the same, if it all...

671
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,564
your friend taking the pills, all of it...

672
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:23,129
hadn't happened a week or so after
you found out about Gloria?

673
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:29,674
I'll tell you one thing.
One suicide is bad enough, but two?

674
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,347
They can both go fuck themselves.

675
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:37,312
I made a donation
to the suicide hotline in her name...

676
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,879
and that's it.

677
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:54,368
The projection screen in their media room
was as big as the small ones at AMC.

678
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:58,965
I heard Mr. Pillsbury is some kind of
