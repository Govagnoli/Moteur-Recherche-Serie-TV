1
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:31,534
The guy on
13th street,

2
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,536
i told him,
go see gigi.

3
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,038
You call beansie?

4
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,539
Gigi, beansie?

5
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,041
Us italians,
i think we're
the only ones

6
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,542
that use nicknames
to that extent.

7
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:42,045
No, your chinese.

8
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,046
Nah.

9
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,048
Yeah, this
violinist, yoyo ma.

10
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,050
"Soubriquet"...

11
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,053
it's another word
for nickname.

12
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:54,557
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:55,558
What's the
matter, hon'?

14
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:56,059
Nothing.

15
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,061
Tony?

16
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,563
How you doing,
sweetie?

17
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,564
Good, good.

18
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:04,067
I took danny
to the doctor
like you said.

19
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,072
My son.

20
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,573
Oh, yeah, yeah,
right, right.

21
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:11,574
How's he doing?

22
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:12,575
Good, you were right.

23
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,577
Just a chest cold,
not pneumonia,
thank god.

24
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:15,578
Oh, great, great.

25
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm glad to hear it.

26
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:22,085
I made you
some bread.

27
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,087
You know, like
a "thank you".

28
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,089
You didn't
have to do that.

29
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,091
Oh, really, i wanted to,
it's datenut for breakfast.

30
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,592
Listen...

31
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:31,594
tracee, right?

32
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,596
The bread'
s very sweet.

33
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:35,598
And you're
a great girl.

34
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,601
Don't take thi
s the wrong way,

35
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,104
but you can't be doing
stuff like this.

36
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,106
No good.

37
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:45,608
But i just wanted
to say thanks.

38
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:46,609
I know.

39
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,113
But i already got a family,
they give me gifts.

40
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:53,116
What we have is an
employer- employee thing.

41
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,118
Can't we be friends?

42
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,620
Well, i'm not so
sure that's such a
good idea either.

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,122
'Cause, you kn
ow, you and ralphie...

44
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,624
yeah, ralphie.

45
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:02,625
I'm glad your
kid's okay.

46
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,128
Let's go,
betty crocker.

47
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,639
Bread.

48
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,144
So, russell crowe,
i mean, he's
trapped, right?

49
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,646
They're gonna
sever off his head.

50
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,149
And he's telling them
how to do it?

51
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,152
I know, and they
he yanks the sword
from that dude.

52
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:31,154
That was so phat.

53
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,656
What about when the guy gets
hit with that spike thing

54
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,158
and chunks of his
head go flying?

55
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:36,159
Enough already.

56
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,660
We're making
conversation here.

57
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,162
People are
trying to eat.

58
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:40,163
Thank you.

59
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,664
Why do you let him
watch this garbage?

60
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:45,668
"Erin brockovich",
that was a nice one.

61
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,170
I didn't
care for it.

62
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,172
You did
too, what are
you talkin'?

63
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,175
See who that is.

64
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,179
Since when did i
become the butler?

65
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:59,182
It's probably jackie jr.
, he locked himself out.

66
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,184
No accountability,
this kid.

67
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,685
What, people forget
their keys.

68
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,687
There he is...

69
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,689
fresh prin
ce of new jersey.

70
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,191
Hey.

71
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,192
How you doing?

72
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,695
Don't get up,
don't get up.

73
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:13,696
I'll fix you
a plate.

74
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,698
Sit down, have
something to eat.

75
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,201
No, i can't,
dino zerilli's
out in the car.

76
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,203
You sure,
something quick?

77
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,205
Why don't you
go bring him in?

78
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,706
Next time.

79
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:24,707
I'll leave the
m in the mailbox.

80
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:26,209
That's alright,
we'll use my set.

81
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,211
I'll put the
m on the counter.

82
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,213
What am i, the
invisible man here?

83
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,214
Hey.

84
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:32,715
Hey, man,
your sister around?

85
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,717
She decided to stay
at school and study.

86
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:35,718
Any message?

87
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,720
No, just,
you know, hello.

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,222
Alright, i'm gonna
hit the road.

89
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,224
Sorry to interrupt
your dinner.

90
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,226
Stay out
of trouble.

91
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,727
So handsome.

92
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,229
Good kid.

93
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,730
Little pig- headed,
if you ask me.

94
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,732
Every advantage,
this kid.

95
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:52,235
College,
good home life.

96
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,738
I had to quit school
when i was in 11th grade

97
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,740
to help my mother.

98
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,243
Supposed to be
an architect.

99
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:07,750
So...

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,253
when did you
first notice me?

101
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,756
I don't know.

102
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,259
"History of film",
i guess.

103
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,262
The way you talked,
you know?

104
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:21,764
Turned around to
see who you were.

105
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,266
And?

106
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,768
Nothing.

107
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,271
What?

108
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,272
Say it!

109
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,273
No, no, no!

110
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:31,774
Leave me alone!

111
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,276
I'm not gonna stop
until you say it.

112
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,777
Okay, okay, wait.

113
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,279
I thought you
were cute, alright?

114
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,280
Ahh...

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,781
i knew it.

116
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:53,279
Ah, hello?

117
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,216
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,218
I just don't know
where else to go.

119
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,728
You guys
hanging out?

120
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,729
We were.

121
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,233
You okay?

122
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,735
I went over...

123
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,237
to see that movie over
at the student union.

124
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,240
Old, like, horror film
or something,"freaks".

125
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,743
Tod browning, 1932.

126
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,746
All these horrible
people in it with
pointy heads and stuff.

127
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,248
This one guy
had no legs.

128
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,750
He just hopped around
on his hands.

129
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,751
Caitlin...

130
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,252
we talked
about this.

131
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,254
You can't keep exposing
yourself to things
that upset you.

132
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,756
I know, it's just...

133
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,759
why is other people's pain
a source of amusement?

134
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,765
Caitlin, what
the hell are
you doing?

135
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,766
It's just a habit.

136
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,769
Well, stop it, alright?
You're gonna be bald.

137
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,772
It's obsessive
compulsive.

138
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,273
I'm gonna
head upstairs.

139
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,775
Don't go on
account of me.

140
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,277
I have that
poli- sci paper anyway.

141
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,291
Please,
don't be mad.

142
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,292
I'm not mad.

143
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,796
It's just you're
really moody, you know?

144
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,801
I think i miss
my ferrets.

145
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,803
You gotta snap out
of this, caitlin.

146
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,806
Maybe you need to
talk to somebody.

147
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,808
Yeah, well, i'm already
taking those buspar pills.

148
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,309
Well, maybe
that's not enough.

149
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,313
Where are you going?

150
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,315
To the library.

151
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,334
See you later.

152
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,337
I'm sure coming here
has been a culture
shock for her.

153
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,339
I mean, for us,

154
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,342
l. A. , new jersey,

155
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,845
we're kind of
used to the mean
streets, you know?

156
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,850
Someone like caitlin
from bartlesville,
oklahoma...

157
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,352
new york's
probably a little

158
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,354
overwhelming.

159
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,857
Maybe we should
try and be
patient with her.

160
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,362
What?

161
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,864
Nothing.

162
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,867
You're sweet.

163
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,369
Most guys wouldn't
even give a shit.

164
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,872
Well...

165
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,874
i'm not most guys.

166
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,397
Do you
have a condom?

167
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,442
Are you okay?

168
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,446
Yeah.

169
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,974
A. J. , call
lindsey blundetto.

170
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,476
Hi.

171
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,978
Hey, what are you
doing home, don't
you have class?

172
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,981
It's friday, o
nly in the mornings.

173
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,985
I got a postcard
from the dentist.

174
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,486
It's time to
schedule a cleaning.

175
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,988
God, i just went.

176
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,990
Smells gre
at, what is that?

177
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,492
It's a bunt cake
for a. J. 's fund raiser.

178
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,994
Nice shoes.

179
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,996
Is daddy home?

180
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,998
He's upstairs.

181
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,500
What's with you,
you seem...

182
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,002
what?

183
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,503
Nothing,
i don't know.

184
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,505
Hey, you know
what i read?

185
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,007
They're making a
movie with eloise.

186
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,508
Oh, really,
that should be cute.

187
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,510
It's supposed to come out
around christmas or something.

188
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,512
Remember at the plaza
that time?

189
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,014
That kid who kept
calling her heloise

190
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,016
and i almost got
in a fight with her?

191
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,517
Yes, that little
spanish girl.

192
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,019
She was so annoying.

193
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,520
I can't believe you
even remember that.

194
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,521
You were like,
nine or something.

195
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,522
Hey.

196
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,524
Hello.

197
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,527
Anyway, so, when it opens,
we are so there, you and me.

198
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:13,032
I know you're exci
ted to see me, but try
to control yourself.

199
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,534
So...

200
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,036
how is school,
what's new?

201
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,037
Caitli
n's still a pain.

202
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,538
She cries over
like, everything.

203
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,540
She probably
misses her family,
the poor thing.

204
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,042
Thank god for
noah, though.

205
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,044
He's the only one
that can calm her down.

206
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,046
She started pullin
g her hair out last night

207
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,547
'cause she saw
a scary movie.

208
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,548
She does it
all the time now.

209
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,050
Her scalp is like,
all raw.

210
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,551
Oh, my god.

211
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,553
Nothing a straight
jacket wouldn't cure.

212
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,056
Sorry, i forgot,
it's mr. Sensitivity

213
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,557
who doesn't have any
problems of his own.

214
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,059
I'm agreeing
with you.

215
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,060
Like you have a clue.

216
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,565
Jesus christ, what
the fuck already?

217
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,068
Cut her some slack, tony,
she's under a lot of strain.

218
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,070
And you did
start this.

219
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,071
Did you see?

220
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,572
How i didn't rise
to the bait?

221
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,074
The mulignan?

222
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,076
A lot of good
it did me.

223
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,077
Does anybody!

224
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,579
It's still going on!

225
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,608
Whoa, you're on
the poles tonight, honey.

226
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,610
Why the hell's
mandee in?

227
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,612
Vip work,
vip prices.

228
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,116
It's 50 bucks to me,
plus a blow job later on.

229
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,119
You know you're gonna make
at least half a "g" in there.

230
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,628
Oh, look at that.

231
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,631
It's like an
ad for a fucking
weight loss center.

232
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,133
Before...

233
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,634
and way before.

234
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,137
This guy ever stop
breaking balls?

235
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,638
Hear what i
said, ton'?

236
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,640
They're like an ad
for a weight loss center.

237
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,143
Before and after.

238
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,644
Come here.

239
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,646
I want to show you
where the horse bit me.

240
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,147
Hi, tony.

241
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,648
Hey.

242
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,153
Look at
this vision.

243
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,655
How you doing,
sweetheart?

244
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,160
Hey, ralph.

245
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,662
I have come
to reclaim rome

246
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,164
for my people.

247
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,665
How you doing?

248
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:34,173
I have come to reclaim
rome for my people!

249
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,675
I don't get it,
what do you mean?

250
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,677
Fucking "gladiator",
ya fuck!

251
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,179
Oh, the movie.

252
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,180
I didn't see it.

253
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,182
You're an
asshole then.

254
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,184
Ho, ho, ho.

255
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,686

256
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,688
What is this, a
handsome contest?

257
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,689

00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,191

00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,196

wondering where you were.

262
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,697
Oh, oh, oh,

263
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,200
How many cocks

264
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,202
Go on.

265
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,204
Get me a drink.

266
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,706

267
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,709

There'll be a
quiz next week.

280
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,240
They're gonna find
this piece of shit
in the trunk someday.

281
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,242
We are
all dead men,

282
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,245

283
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,746
hey, c'mon.

284
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,747
All we can do...

285
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,749
is choose...

286
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,251

287
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,753
That fucking hurts!

288
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,755
Nah,

289
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,257

290
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,759
He's out of control,

00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,265

To a murdered wife.

...my vengeance.

301
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,287
Jesus christ!

302
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,788

303
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,290

00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,797

00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,800
It was an accident.

310
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,305
What did you do?

311
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,806
Nothing, we were
fucking around.

312
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,309
It was an accident,
stop being such
a crybaby.

313
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,311
Take him to
the emergency room.

314
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,312
What?

315
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,313
Just take him.

316
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,316
C'mon, pussy boy.

317
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,821
Fucking stunad,

318
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,325
Did you li
ke the bread?

319
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,327
What?

320
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,828
The datenut bread.

321
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,829
I have recipes--

322
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,332
hey, sweetheart,
not now, alright?

323
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,346
I was up
all night.

324
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,847
You could've called
or something.

325
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,350
Sorry, i didn't realiz
e i needed your permission

326
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,352
to visit my house.

327
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,354
I'm sorry.

328
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,855
It's just--

329
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,358
i kept having this image
of you in the hospital

330
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,360
with your throat cut.

331
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,362
I apprecia
te your concern,

332
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,865
but maybe you should focus
on your own problems, okay?

333
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,368
You know, there was
this thing on tv once

334
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,370
about that pilot,
charles lindbergh,

335
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,373
and about how his baby
was kidnapped and killed--

336
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,375
jesus christ,
already!

337
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,377
Don't go.

338
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,878
I'm go
ing to noah's.

339
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,381
Well, at least
you have a boyfriend!

340
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,888
Now she's got me
all wound up.

341
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,390
Put her out
of your mind.

342
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,891
Duh, if i could
do that.

343
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,895
Maybe we shoul
d find her a guy.

344
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,897
Don't you have
any friends?

345
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,900
Do you really think
i'd subject one of my
friends to caitlin?

346
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,904
I have an idea.

347
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,407
I think
her birthday's
coming up.

348
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,409
Why don't we
take her out,

349
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,910
like to celebrate?

350
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,412
You mean l
ike to live bait?

351
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,415
Get her drunk, maybe
it'll cheer her up.

352
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,419
Please, she's bad
enough sober.

353
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,921
I bet i know what
would cheer you up.

354
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,424
Oh, yeah?

355
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,426
What?

356
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,934
Go to the fuse box.

357
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,438
In the cellar,
janice.

358
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,940
So, call the gas company
, what do you want from me?

359
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,943
You chose to l
ive there, remember!

360
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,950
Well?

361
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,452
What do you think?

362
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,453
About what?

363
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,455
What am i
looking at?

364
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,457
My teeth,
i got braces.

365
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,958
What do you want,
a parade?

366
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,959
Oh!

367
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,961
What did i tell you
about fraternizing?

368
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,963
I'm not, i was
just showing
tony my braces.

369
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:25,964
Yeah?

370
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,966
I didn't shell out
three crackers

371
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,468
for you to be
modeling your teeth.

372
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,470
Get to work.

373
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,971
C'mon.

374
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,973
Anything else?

375
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,482
Ralphie's the one
sticking her,

376
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,983
why don't he pay
for her teeth?

377
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,486
It's a loan,
i'm juicing her.

378
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,988
Usually it's fak
e tits they want.

379
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,491
Yeah, well, she
don't need those,
that's for sure.

380
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,493
That kid's
a thoroughbred.

381
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,995
But, madonn'
, those choppers.

382
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,498
A fuckin
g train wreck.

383
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,510
Well, happy
birthday to
us all.

384
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,012
That was a barrel
of monkeys.

385
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,014
That guy jeff
kept staring at me.

386
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,015
What do you think?

387
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,517
You want to
check out "smokes"?

388
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,519
I'm a little
tired, you know?

389
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,020
Yeah, yeah, right.

390
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,022
It is getting
a little late.

391
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,525
Oh, my god.

392
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,027
That is so sad.

393
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,029
The chairs,
the pears, the bears,

394
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,031
the social security cards.

395
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,032
C'mon, caitlin.

396
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,535
We should give
her some money.

397
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,037
Caitlin!

398
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,039
Excuse me, miss.

399
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,040
Miss!

400
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,543
Miss!

401
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,046
Oh, my god!

402
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,550
Not bad, chrissy.

403
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,051
Decent week.

404
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,553
Not bad?

405
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,554
I'm running
ragged here.

406
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,055
If i wanted to work
18 hours a day,

407
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,557
i could get
a job at denny's.

408
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,560
Like they'd
fucking hire him.

409
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,563
What, are
you crying?

410
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,064
Keep it up...

411
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,066
i'll give you
something to cry about.

412
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,575
Watch the
braces, honey.

413
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:23,081
God, it was
so horrible.

414
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,083
It's over,
caitlin, okay?

415
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,586
How can you be
so callous?

416
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,589
That was the most
horrific thing ever.

417
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,593
It was a homeless
woman with "the dail
y news" up her butt.

418
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,597
Every time i close my eyes,
i just keep seeing her.

419
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,099
Oh, my god.

420
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,101
Caitlin, why
don't we go over to
the health center?

421
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,603
They'll help you.

422
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,104
They'll give you
something to calm
down at least.

423
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,105
No.

424
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,107
No more drugs.

425
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,612
Caitlin, don't start
drinking, c'mon.

426
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,117
Listen...

427
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,620
i have to get up
really early tomorrow.

428
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,122
Josh is on the red eye
from l. A. And...

429
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,125
my friend, josh, from
crossroads high school,
i didn't tell you?

430
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,126
No.

431
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,629
Sorry, i
thought i did.

432
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,131
Anyway, he's coming in
and we're gonna head up

433
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,633
and see his brother
at hampshire.

434
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,138
Try and get
some rest, okay?

435
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,153
Where do you think
she sleeps at night?

436
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,162
Hi.

437
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,165
When did you
come in?

438
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,667
Just now.

439
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,669
Sorry, were
you sleeping?

440
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,180
It's a good thing we're
paying for that dorm room.

441
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,182
It's caitlin again,
i can't sleep there.

442
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,184
Forget about studying.

443
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,187
Like you were studying
at two a. M.

444
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,190
Noah and i took her
out for her birthday.

445
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,692
She's all depressed
to begin with

446
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,193
and then she starts
having conniptions

447
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,196
over this homeless
lady in the street.

448
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,203
And how are things
with noah?

449
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:29,207
He's going up
to hampshire college
with his friend from l. A.

450
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,711
He said he told me about
it, but i know he didn't.

451
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,213
Don't you think that's weird
that he would just do that?

452
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,716
I don't know, i
don't really know him.

453
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,217
And his friend,
josh, i mean...

454
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,219
i guess he's okay.

455
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,722
So, you two ar
e still dating then?

456
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,223
Is that a problem?

457
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,226
You started
this conversation.

458
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,732
The hygienist from
dr. Maceras called.

459
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,233
You never scheduled
your appointment.

460
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,736
I'm sorry, i forgot,
i'll do it.

461
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,741
And jackie jr.
Says hello.

462
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,247
Noah's great, but he
can be odd, you know?

463
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,248
It's like...

464
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,751
one minute he's all
affectionate and
then the next,

465
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,753
he's like a totally
different person.

466
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,260
Meadow, are you in
love with this boy?

467
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,263
I don't know.

468
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,766
I guess so.

469
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,771
At this point,
i better be.

470
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,273
At what point,
what does that mean?

471
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,777
Sorry, but we are so not
having that conversation.

472
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,300
Tony?

473
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,802
You ha
ve a second?

474
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,305
I know you said
we can't be friends,

475
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,307
but there's no one
else i can talk to.

476
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,312
I'm pregnant.

477
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,314
It's ralphie's.

478
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,816
Congratulations.

479
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,322
I don't know
what to do.

480
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,324
He acts like he
doesn't give a shit.

481
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,326
Did you ever think
he's not acting?

482
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,328
Well, what
should i do,
should i keep it?

483
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,831
I don't get involved
in affairs of the heart.

484
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,332
But if i have it...

485
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,834
you think he'l
l help me support it?

486
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,336
Oh, sure, it'll
be father knows
best over there.

487
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,843
Look, you want
my advice?

488
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,347
You already
got one kid.

489
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,850
Problems with that,
burning him with cigarettes,

490
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,851
whatever the fuck
you were doing.

491
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,853
I got help for
that, i had a lot
of repressed anger.

492
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,855
The county social worker
says it all goes back

493
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,857
to my mom and hold
ing my hand on the stove--

494
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,358
whatever,
okay?

495
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,861
Your age,
your situation,

496
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,864
you need another kid like
you need a fucking
hole in the head.

497
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,867
You're young,
still got your figure,
you're making money.

498
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,369
So, you think i should
get an abortion?

499
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,872
Believe me, with
ralphie as the father,

500
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,875
you'll be doing
this kid and the next
three generations a favor.

501
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,383
Hey, urban outfitters
is having a sale.

502
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,385
We're out of syrup.

503
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,387
'Cause you use a whole
gallon at a time.

504
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,388
Shut up.

505
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:30,889
A. J.

506
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:31,890
You wanna go?

507
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,891
What do you
need, shoes?

508
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,392
Shoes, some new tops.

509
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,393
I need underwear.

510
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,895
So, you wanna
go or not?

511
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,396
I put your whites
in at 10:30.

512
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,898
I need to wait until
the dryer's free.

513
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,899
Let lilliana do it.

514
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,400
Lilliana's off.

515
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,402
It's gonna be a zoo by
the time we get there.

516
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,424
Meadow here?

517
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,927
She paged me,
she's at her parents.

518
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:09,928
Oh.

519
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,931
Want to hang out?

520
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,432
I'm writing my paper.

521
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,935
You mind if i just
sit and study then?

522
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,437
I'm fine, really,
it's just...

523
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,440
you know, it's creepy
up there alone.

524
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,442
Um...

525
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,445
alright.

526
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,966
What are we,
short?

527
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,467
Who we missing?

528
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,969
Tracee.

529
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,471
Left sick on saturday,
haven't seen her since.

530
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,473
For three days?

531
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,976
Fucking twat.

532
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,997
I talked to my mom.

533
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,499
And she wants me to go
to vermont this weekend.

534
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,001
For what?

535
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,002
Friends of
my dad's.

536
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,004
Paul and
irione dudley.

537
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,007
Paul's a psychiatry professor
at dartmouth medical school

538
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,010
and they have a horse farm
and ride and talk.

539
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,512
Paul's very inspiring.

540
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,514
Sounds good.

541
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,018
I just feel
better already.

542
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,520
Irione is
an amazing cook.

543
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,523
Now, if i just don't
get freaked out

544
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,025
by the sound of
the pine trees at night.

545
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,526
I'm going to noah's.

546
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,035
This moltisanti kid, he's
got his head up his ass.

547
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,539
This is a great
gladiator movie?

548
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,542
Look at kirk douglas'
fucking hair.

549
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:08,046
They didn't have flat
tops in ancient rome!

550
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,049
What do you want
to drink, baby?

551
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,051
Get me a fresca.

552
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,060
C- fucking- minus and
it's all her fault.

553
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,063
You know, six hour
s i'm trying to work and
she just won't stop.

554
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,564
Tell me about it.

555
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,066
The questions,
the whining,

556
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,567
the crazy
goddamn nonsense.

557
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,070
She starts crying about
her economics class.

558
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,572
She doesn't get it,
so i give her my notes
from last year.

559
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,575
I'm talking primo
notes, i got an "a".

560
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,077
But even
that's a problem.

561
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,578
She doesn't understand
my writing.

562
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,581
"What does this word mean?
Blah, blah, blah, blah."

563
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,583
Nothing's ever
enough with her.

564
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,085
I mean, i know
i'm the r. A.

565
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,088
But technically she's
not even on my floor.

566
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,590
C- minus.

567
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,593
Really beautiful,
noah.

568
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,095
It's not
that bad, okay?

569
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,599
I want options when
i graduate, meadow.

570
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,601
I'm going to law school
in two short years.

571
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,104
A c- minus is
fucked for me.

572
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,607
It's early in the semester,
you'll make it up.

573
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,627
Is that alright,
honey?

574
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,129
Fine.

575
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,135
You know i take
care of you, right?

576
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,637
You, danny,

577
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,639
our gorgeous
little baby.

578
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,142
Who's that?

579
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,644
How the fuck
should i know?

580
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,146
Ralphie, open up!

581
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,150
Ah, shit.

582
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,654
Ralphie!

583
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,663
Where's tracee?

584
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,165
She's busy.

585
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,666
Hey, sil.

586
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,667
Put your shoes on!

587
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,669
Oh, what'd i say?

588
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,171
I don't know, what'd
you fuckin' say?

589
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,173
Three days
she missed work.

590
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,675
I've been sick, sil.

591
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,676
Oh, yeah?

592
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,678
I called your house.

593
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,181
Your mother says you
haven't been there
for two days either.

594
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,682
I was here, ralph's
taking care of me.

595
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,185
You got a little
kid at home!

596
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,187
Her mother
's watching him!

597
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,689
Mind your fucking
business, ralph!

598
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,191
Oh, where do you get
the balls to come here?

599
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,193
Three grand this
cunt's into me,

600
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,695
and where do i get
my fucking balls?

601
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,201
Go on, get out
of here.

602
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,703
Let's go!

603
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,710
What's the mat
ter with you, huh?

604
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,712
You know how m
any girls would kill

605
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,714
for the opportunity
you've got?

606
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,715
What, working for you?

607
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,217
Oh, go ahead
, keep it up.

608
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,718
Give me a break,

609
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,720
in two seconds i could
get a job at any other--

610
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,722
listen to me,
you little boochiac'.

611
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,724
Until you pay
what you owe,

612
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,726
that shaved twat of
yours belongs to me!

613
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,228
You understand?

614
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,231
I asked yo
u a question.

615
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,733
Yeah, now,
get in the car.

616
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,746
And then i go to pour the milk
and the carton is empty.

617
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,749
I keep telling you,
it's not me, it's a. J.

618
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,251
Nice try, mister.

619
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,752
How about the
football trance?

620
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,754
I swear to god, we can have
an entire conversation,

621
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,757
but if that tv's on, he's no
hearing a word i'm saying.

622
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,259
One time
this happened.

623
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,760
Forget it, gab,

624
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,762
you might as well be
talkin' to the furniture.

625
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,265
Well, that's because men
have the attention
span of children.

626
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,267
Sorry, honey
, what'd you say?

627
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,770
This cake, rosalie.

628
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,273
Really, ro,
delicious.

629
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,274
The whole meal.

630
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,776
I'm glad we could
reciprocate.

631
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,282
Hey, college boy
, how's school?

632
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,283
Good, you know.

633
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,285
Crackin' the books.

634
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,786
Almost dean's list.

635
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,288
What's this,
almost?

636
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,290
Give me his name,
no more almost.

637
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,293
I'm going out.

638
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,295
I'll probably end
up staying at bobby's.

639
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,796
No drinking
and driving.

640
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,298
C'mon, he knows
better than that.

641
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,799
Right, tough guy?

642
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,301
Yeah, whatever
you say, ralph.

643
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,802
Get lost.

644
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,304
Enjoy your youth.

645
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,307
I'm gonna kill you.

646
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,309
Why didn't you tell me
this place was so fancy?

647
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,311
Calm down, it'
s just my father.

648
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,314
Believe me, it'l
l be nothing compare
d to meeting your dad.

649
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,819
There he is.

650
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,820
Hey.

651
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,822
Hey, dad.

652
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,824
Meadow.

653
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,326
This is my
father, len.

654
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,327
Hello.

655
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,829
Len tannenbaum,
please sit.

656
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,333
How was
the flight?

657
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,337
Aside from tim daly
chewing my ear for an hour,

658
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,338
it was wonderful.

659
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,340
The guy from "wings",
you know him?

660
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,842
He did his deal
for "fugitive".

661
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,344
Usually i enjoy
l. A. To new york.

662
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,845
Five hours
without interruptions,

663
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,847
it's the only time i get
to do some real work.

664
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,848
Unbelievable.

665
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,350
He flies first class,

666
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,352
personal dvd player
with any movie he wants

667
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,354
never even
opens the case.

668
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,855
Bad enough representing
these people,

669
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,359
i have to suffer
through their movies too?

670
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,362
God, it must be
so exciting being an
entertainment lawyer.

671
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,364
Get to meet all
the celebrities.

672
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,866
It beats working
for a living.

673
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,368
He's in town to
meet with dick wolf.

674
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,369
The sportscaster?

675
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,871
Actually, he's
a tv producer.

676
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,873
"Special victims unit,
law and order".

677
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,375
"New york undercover".

678
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,876
I used to
love that show.

679
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,878
Good evening, may i offer you
a cocktail before dinner?

680
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,880
Guys, are we
drinking wine?

681
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,885
Clos pegase, the'94
if you've got.

682
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,394
So, meadow,
what business is
your father in?

683
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,898
Actually, um,
he's in waste management.

684
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,401
Ah, toxic chemicals,
medical waste,

685
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,403
that sort of thing?

686
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,406
Yeah, sort of,
environmental clean up.

687
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,916
Let's give a big bada bing
welcome to tracee.

688
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,939
Hey, that guy
cut the line.

689
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,447
What's the matter?

690
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,451
I told caitlin
if we went to th
e movies i'd call her.

691
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,953
I'm starting
to feel bad.

692
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,955
I stopped feeling bad
the second i saw that grade.

693
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,460
Did i tell you my father's
filing a restraining order
against her?

694
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,961
What?

695
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,965
You're kidding,
right?

696
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,467
You obviously
don't know my father.

697
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,970
He totally freaked when
he heard about the c- minus.

698
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,973
Well, i mean...

699
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,477
couldn't you try
talking to her first?

700
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,479
At this point?

701
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,481
She thinks
we're her friends.

702
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,483
Well, you have
to set limits.

703
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,485
The girl was
ruining our lives.

704
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,987
Think about it, we
couldn't do anything
without her horning in.

705
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,990
We certainly couldn't
take her to see this.

706
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,507
Mrs. Custer
grabs the artist,

707
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,508
"oh!

708
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,510
"I tell you
i want a painting

709
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,512
"commemorating my husband's
last thoughts,

710
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:59,016
you give me cows with halos
and indians making love?"

711
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,519
"Mrs. Custer,"
he says.

712
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,022
"Those are your husband's
last thoughts."

713
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,026
"Holy cow,

714
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,530
look at all
those fucking indians."

715
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,537
Oh, what,
not even a hello?

716
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,539
Fuck you, asshole.

717
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,041
Oh, that's nice,
very nice.

718
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,044
That's how you talk to a man
in front of his friends?

719
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,546
Yeah, right.

720
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,047
What man?

721
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,048
Oh, a double.

722
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,050
You tell him,
sweetie.

723
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,052
I like this girl!

724
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,556
Women, women, women.

725
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,059
Why was i born handsome
instead of rich?

726
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,573
Leave me alone.

727
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,074
What's the matter
with you?

728
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,577
What are you being
like this for?

729
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,079
Fuck you, three days
you don't call eve
n to see how i am.

730
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,081
Baby, i'm busy,
i gotta work.

731
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,584
How else am i gonna
take care of you

732
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,587
when you're nine
months pregnant?

733
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,589
You serious?

734
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,091
Of course
i'm serious.

735
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,598
We'll get
a little house...

736
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,601
in a cul- de- sac.

737
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,604
I know that guy who's
a mortgage broker.

738
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,605
Really?

739
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,109
Ralphie,
i love you.

740
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,612
I love you
too, baby.

741
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,114
Hey...

742
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,617
if it's a boy...

743
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,621
we'll name him
after me.

744
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,124
If it's a girl,
we'll name it
tracee after you.

745
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,628
This way she can grow up
to be a cock sucking slob

746
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,630
just like her mother.

747
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,634
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

748
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,639
Guinea motherfucking
piece of shit!

749
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,641
That's right, that's
right, get it all out.

750
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,643
Get it all out,
you little whore.

751
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,158
That make
you feel good?

752
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,160
You feel like a man?

753
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,197
Look at you now.

754
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,717
Oh...

755
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,220
give me a
fucking drink.

756
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,222
What happened
to you?

757
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,726
Tracee.

758
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,728
She slipped.

759
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,230
We were arguing,
i don't know.

760
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,232
She fell.

761
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,244
Holy fucking
shit.

762
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,247
Get a sheet, chrissy,
cover that up.

763
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,754
Where is he?

764
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:57,755
Inside.

765
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,256
Go get him.

766
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,774
She fell?

767
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,275
That's my story.

768
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,777
You stupid
motherfucker!

769
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,778
How fuckin
g dare you!

770
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,780
Take it easy.

771
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,781
You don't think.

772
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,282
You disrespect
this place.

773
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,285
That's the reason
why you were passe
d the fuck over.

774
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,287
It's my fault
she's a klutz?

775
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,799
Motherfucker!

776
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,802
Are you out of your
fucking mind layin'
your hands on me?

777
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,303
He's the bos
s of this family!

778
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,304
Shut the fuck up!

779
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,306
I'm a made guy!

780
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,811
Ton', we gotta
get you out of here.

781
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,813
Is this place open?

782
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,814
No!

783
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,316
Get the fuck out
of here, ralph!

784
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,823
Keep that
back door locked!

785
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,825
And get her th
e fuck out of here.

786
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,827
You got a rug,
a piece of carpet?

787
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,330
Cocksucker was
way out of line.

788
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,834
20 years old,
this girl.

789
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,836
That too.

790
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:24,842
Let's go.

791
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,873
What?

792
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,376
I think we
need to talk.

793
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:05,382
I think that maybe
we've been seeing
too much of each other.

794
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,885
And?

795
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,888
I don't know.

796
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,389
I mean...

797
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,394
i really like
you, meadow.

798
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,898
It's just...

799
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,903
i don't think we shoul
d see each other anymore.

800
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:30,407
Are you breaking
up with me?

801
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,909
Are you really
that surprised?

802
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,412
Why, i mean...

803
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:38,415
things were
going so good.

804
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,917
Look, honestly,

805
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,919
you're too negative.

806
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,421
It's like you have
this underlying cynicism

807
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,923
about everything.

808
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,424
What are you
talking about?

809
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,427
I really didn't
want to get into this.

810
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,448
So...

811
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,450
things are
better then?

812
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,452
Since our
first session?

813
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,962
Yes, i guess.

814
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,965
We seem to
talk more easily.

815
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,475
Sometimes even painful
sessions can break
the log jam.

816
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,477
Yes.

817
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,983
And then this.

818
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:49,486
You're being
particularly
quiet today.

819
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,989
Sometimes i got
nothing to say.

820
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,494
Anthony.

821
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:58,996
Carmela is here.

822
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:03,500
She's giving up her time to
talk about your panic attacks.

823
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,507
A young man who...

824
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,011
worked for us...

825
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,015
barone sanitation, he...

826
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,018
he died.

827
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,019
Who?

828
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,520
Who?

829
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,522
You don't know him.

830
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,528
He died, that's all.

831
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,034
Work- related death.

832
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,542
It's sad when
they go so young.

833
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,566
How was
the dentist?

834
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,583
God, is ther
e nothing to eat
in this house?

835
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,604
Who knows,
maybe she quit.

836
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,108
I heard she went
outside with ralphie
and never came back.

837
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,111
Do yourself a favor, keep
what you hear to yourself.

838
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,612
Parties are usually
friday night.

839
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,115
A lot of high rollers,
a lot of big tips.

840
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,616
You want in
the vip room?

841
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:02,619
It's 50 bucks to me
plus a blow job lateron.
