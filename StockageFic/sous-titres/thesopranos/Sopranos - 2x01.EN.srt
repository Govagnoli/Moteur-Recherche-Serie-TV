The tan ghost.

37
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,917
You're a good guy, tony,
but you abuse that joke shit.

38
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,919
What do you go
t to say to me?

39
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,921
I'm back, tony,

00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,924
I'm in a fucking
tan nightmare

41
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,926
what do you think,
i'm stupid?

42
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,428
I don't know it,

43
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,929
when every fuckin'
one of my friends

44
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,931
turns their hearts to
stone against me, fuck!

45
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,933
Easy, okay.

46
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,936
I don't think
you're stupid.

47
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,938
There was a fuckin' rat.

48
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,940
So, you finger me?

49
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,443
You think i didn't realize
what was going on

50
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,945
when you come to my house,
three o'clock in the afternoon,

51
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,448
telling me
you're my friend.

52
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,450
That's when i knew
i was in trouble, anthony.

53
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,951
When outta the blue,
you come,

54
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,952
and for no reason,

55
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,454
you start telling me
you're my friend.

56
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,955
Oh, is that right?

57
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,957
Anthony jr. , get up!

58
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,466
You owe me the
fuckin' explanation,

59
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,967
and you know what
i'm talking about.

60
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,470
Well, remind me, tony,
never to get sick again, huh?

61
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,473
Remind me, please, never
to have a serious illness,

62
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,475
because, with you,
and silvio, and paulie,

63
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,976
and all you pricks,

64
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,978
weakness could spread
as fuckin' treason!

65
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,480
You know what?
Fuck you!

66
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,981
I don't wanna hear about
your fucking back anymore!

67
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,483
Who's your
fucking boss, huh?

68
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,485
Who's your
fucking boss?

69
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,986
Who gets the
explanation?

70
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,488
What, am i
supposed to trust you?

71
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,992
You- fuckin'- off- the
reservation- cocksucker!

72
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,995
It was a broad, tony,
it was complicated.

73
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,997
My back was for shit,
you knew that.

74
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,500
I don't wanna fuckin' hear
anymore about your back!

75
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,001
That's how we met.

76
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:33,506
That's why i was
popping percosets
like freaking jujubes!

77
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:38,511
Anyway, my doctor,
he prescribes this
clinic for me,

78
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,012
in puerto rico.

79
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,014
I didn't exactly
object, tony,

80
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,517
given the fuckin'
vibes around here.

81
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,018
Go ahead, check.

82
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,020
You don't tell your wife
you're in the hospital?

83
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,522
That twat brought on
most of this.

84
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,523
How?

85
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,525
Listen, down there,
i met this girl.

86
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,028
26, an acupuncturist.

87
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,531
It was the only thing
that fuckin' really helped

88
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,032
with my sciatic nerve.

89
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,534
Anyway, one thing
lead to another.

90
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,536
You can't send
one feeler to me?

91
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,038
I'm gonna trust
you, paulie?

92
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,040
Take the word
of a degenerate
cop over me?

93
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:14,046
Tony, who are you
talking to down there?

94
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,550
Jesus!

95
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,552
So, why'd you
come back, huh?

96
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,054
What changed?

97
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,558
Nothing changed,
that's the problem.

98
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,060
I still got two kids
in college, tony.

99
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,063
One just got married,
needs my help.

100
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,065
I gotta start
earnin' again.

101
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,567
I gotta get
my action back.

102
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,568
Oh, just like that?

103
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,572
I came to you, tony,
i'm in your hands.

104
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,075
Bring up two cases
of bottled water with you!

105
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,584
Come here.

106
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,586
Come here,
you fat fuck.

107
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,596
Hey, my back, hey.

108
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:08,601
I still gotta get
these freaking shots.

109
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,103
You fuckin'
beached whale.

110
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:16,609
Hey, you wanna
pat this down, too?

111
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,612
Come here.

112
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,114
Come on.

113
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,624
Don't you ever pull
shit like this again.

114
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,632
So your uncle's
under indictment?

115
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,134
12 rico predicates.

116
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,136
Who stepped up
to run his crew?

117
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,639
His piss boy,
philly parisi.

118
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,141
Oh, yeah, philly.

119
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,145
Philly, don't
forget the pastries!

120
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,163
That's my favorite bag,
don't lose it.

121
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,192
Yo, philly.

122
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,203
Were you
waiting long?

123
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,705
Not bad.

124
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,206
We were late
landing, anyhow.

125
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,708
Hey, thanks for
doing this, philly.

126
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,210
Coming off the lam
, every nickel counts.

127
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,714
These fuckin' cabs.

128
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,216
So how's boston?

129
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,218
Well, it was good
to be back for a while,

130
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,219
then, you know.

131
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,221
Do i?

132
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,224
That place
is scranton,
with clams.

133
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,728
So, what's been
going on?

134
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,230
Same tale of woe.

135
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,234
What the hell do i hear about
tony soprano and his mother?

136
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,739
Some kind of accident?

137
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,741
He had her in a
nursing home,
you know?

138
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,742
Get the fuck
out of here.

139
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,243
And this, upse
t junior, no end.

140
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,745
And when junio
r come after him,

141
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,246
tony went to the home,

142
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,749
and tried to suffocate
his own mother.

143
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,751
Maybe you shouldn't
spread that rumor.

144
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,252
That's some ugly shit.

145
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,754
I'm only telling you.

146
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,257
Listen, you'd be
fuckin' amazed.

147
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,759
There's more?

148
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,260
Ehh...

149
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,264
no, what?

150
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,767
He was seeing
a psychiatrist.

151
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,268
Tony?

152
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,771
Fuckin' broad
from montclair.

153
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:07,279
Anyway, this,
is who leads us now.

154
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,781
There you go, kid.

155
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,283
There you go,
you big mouth fuck!

156
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,314
It's done.

157
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,325
Maybe she's
seeing someone.

158
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,329
You know,
the way i see you.

159
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:04,837
If she were,
she'd never tell me.

160
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:11,844
I'm afraid we'll
have to stop now.

161
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,847
When's your office
going to be finished?

162
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,349
Oh, my new carpet's
not in yet.

163
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,352
I'm sorry, i know
this is awkward.

164
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,856
My old therapist used
to work out of his home.

165
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,359
That's not
convenient for me.

166
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,372
Yes?

167
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,374
It's all over, it'
s safe to go home now.

168
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,376
How did you get
this phone number?

169
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,378
Where are you
calling me from?

170
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,381
Are you watching me?

171
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,889
You know, from
what you told me,

172
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,391
webistics would be perfect
for your portfolio.

173
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,894
I understand you're
on a fixed income,

174
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,395
but, with webistics,

175
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,897
you could triple
your money in a year.

176
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,401
Uh- huh, yeah,
10, 12 months.

177
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,910
What time is it?

178
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,414
So,"e. F.",
i'm listening.

179
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,917
It's fuckin'
tedious, this shit.

180
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,919
Well, you
are the boss.

181
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,421
And if it's your
executive decision

182
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,923
to go down the shore,

183
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,925
fuck it.

184
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,927
Yeah.

185
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,936
Yo, matthew.

186
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,438
I gotta take
a meeting...

187
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,440
keep things
in control here.

188
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,946
Word up,
later chief.

189
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:54,947
I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

190
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:55,948
The company's
webistics.

191
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,950
It's the next
yahoo right now.

192
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,951
We're really
only selling it

193
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,953
to prefrred clients.

194
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,455
Yeah, american forestry,
19 and 1/2, up 3/8s,

195
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,957
a very
sound company.

196
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,459
Uh- huh.

197
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,471
Well, it depends o
n whether you wanna go

198
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,973
for growth or value.

199
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,474
We got hundred
s of mutual funds

200
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,476
you can
choose from.

201
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,978
Ahh!

202
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,481
You're supposed
to push webistics!

203
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,483
I was giving
them alternatives.

204
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,986
Webistics is our
pick of the week.

205
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,990
Why, it's got a three
million float,

206
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,493
and their technology's
two years behind.

207
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,494
Your stock's a dog.

208
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,996
Ahh!

209
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,506
Hey, stop that!

210
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,509
Hey, i'm still
the manager here,
this is unacceptable.

211
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,011
Where's moltisanti?

212
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,013
I'm gonna make a call
if you don't think i know

213
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,014
who really
runs this operation.

214
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:07,519
Get back in your
fuckin' office.

215
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,023
Anybody else got a problem
with webistics?

216
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,534
Tony...

217
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,036
hey, counselor,
how are you?

218
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,038
How are you?

219
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,039
Good.

220
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,540
You look
good, huh?

221
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,045
Have a seat.

222
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,546
You want a drink?

223
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,547
No.

224
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,548
Before we commence,

225
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,550
a thousand thank yous
for webistics.

226
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,053
I sold off some of
my disney to buy it.

227
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,554
My pleasure.

228
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,557
So, where do we
stand this month?

229
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,560
Your uncle's petitioning
to get out of jail

230
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,062
on a medical
pending trial.

231
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,064
Let him.

232
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,566
Neil thinks they're
liable to let him out.

233
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,569
Maybe as a temptation
for you to act, again.

234
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,071
Since you are
at the helm,

235
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,073
it all gets back to
putting up bigger blinds.

236
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,077
Really limiting your exposure
to potential rico boo- boos.

237
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,578
The only way to run
a family these days

238
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,080
is bunker style.

239
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,581
You peer out
through the slit.

240
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,584
Excuse me.

241
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,585
Yeah.

242
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,087
You're not gonna
believe this.

243
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,088
Your sister's here.

244
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,589
Barbara?

245
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,091
Nope, janice.

246
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,092
You're shitting me.

247
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,093
Nope.

248
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,095
I wonder what
the scam is this time.

249
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,596
Whatever it is, i'm gonna
be five grand lighter

250
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:30,102
before she raindances
back to the commune.

251
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,604
Alright, tell her she can
stay with us if she wants.

252
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,605
Are you sure?

253
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,108
Yeah.

254
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,609
We'll get barbara
and tom and the kids,

255
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,112
and we'll make
a family reunion out of it.

256
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,114
But obviously...

257
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,116
your mother
isn't welcome.

258
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,618
Give janice my love.

259
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:53,125
See you later.

260
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,127
My sister's here
from seattle.

261
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,128
Nice.

262
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,135
Where is he?

263
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,137
Let me pinch those
bulldog cheeks.

264
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,140
Come over here.

265
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,141
Puerto rico?

266
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,142
Yeah.

267
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,643
That water
down there...

268
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,645
you think you woulda
shit some of this
weight off!

269
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,647
Did you tell him
we were about to

270
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,150
start crabbin'
the hackensack river
looking for him?

271
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,651
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

272
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,652
Tony explained it.

273
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,654
Listen to this.

274
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,656
You heard abou
t jimmy altieri?

275
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,658
Yeah, flipped,
fuckin' asshole.

276
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,660
He had two assholes
when they buried him.

277
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,662
So, all my money that
was on the street,

278
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,167
all those payments,
i guess, just evaporated.

279
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,168
We made your
pick- ups,

280
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,669
they're ready and
waiting for you.

281
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,171
Thanks, paulie.

282
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,174
I mean that,
no shit.

283
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,676
All those pricks
paid up to the letter?

284
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,678
A few things got
lost in the confusion.

285
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,181
I'm sure you could
picture.

286
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,683
We did the best we could
with the information we had.

287
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:57,189
The boss of the family
deserves the credit
right here.

288
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,193
Salut.

289
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,196
Salut.
Salut. Salut.

290
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,697
Hey, sil?

291
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,198
What?

292
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,699
"What."

293
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:12,204
I've been gone a long time,
let me hear it.

294
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,206
"Just when they
thought i was out,

295
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,709
"they pull me
back in.

296
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,713
"Alright, just
this one time.

297
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,216
I'll let you ask m
e about my affairs."

298
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:31,723
"Is it true, michael?"

299
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,725
"No."

300
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:38,730
"You fuck!"

301
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,732
"Our true enemy,

302
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,735
has yet to
reveal himself."

303
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,238
He's on a roll!

304
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:51,743
I gotta get
the fuck out of here.

305
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,746
Oh, tony, i hate
to ruin the party.

306
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,250
I got a call from
loiaco down at
brokerage.

307
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,752
Fuckin' chip and dale
sent one the brokers

308
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,754
to the
emergency room.

309
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,757
Oh, fuck me,
these kids!

310
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,760
My fuckin'
nephew, right?

311
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,763
You call him,
and you tell him

312
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,765
i wanna see him
right away.

313
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,278
It all checks out.

314
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,780
Puerto rico,
the clinic.

315
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,782
All that shit from
what i can tell.

316
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,797
How was the guest bed,
did you sleep alright?

317
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,798
Great.

318
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,800
Except, usually
i bring my own pillow,

319
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,302
ergonomic,

320
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,804
it got ripped off at
the bus stop in rapid city.

321
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,807
Linoleum's not good enough
for you to sleep on no more?

322
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,311
Look who decides to join us,
my little brother.

323
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,812
How you doing, jan?

324
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,814
Parvati.

325
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,816
I'm her brother,
i get a pass.

326
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,319
You look good,
you look...

327
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,820
like a teenager.

328
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,822
My therapist says
i'm regressing.

329
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,325
Oh, your therapist,
who pays for that?

330
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,826
The state of
washington.

331
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,328
Total disability.

332
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,829
Oh, yeah,
the epstein- barr.

333
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,332
Was. Chronic carpel tunnel
from my last job,

334
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:25,837
the steam milk machine.
No worse pain.

335
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,339
Hey, i stayed up
waiting for you,

336
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,840
when'd you get in?

337
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,344
Late, morning.

338
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,347
What the fuck
is that smell?

339
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,349
Miso soup,
it's seaweed.

340
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,351
She's been telling us
all about seattle.

341
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,852
If i see those
grunge pants on you,

342
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,354
you'll be on the
ground looking up.

343
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,855
Dad, how do you
stay so hip?

344
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,357
I'll be back in a sec.

345
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,858
And don't let your
father near my soup.

346
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,360
He makes fun,
but before noon,

347
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,866
he'll eat anything
that's not locked away.

348
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,368
You don't see your
sister for years,

349
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,370
right away you start
in on her diet?

350
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,373
Hey, believe me, she gives
as good as she gets.

351
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:11,383
Give me a hit
off that.

352
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:17,389
Oh, who's in
charge here?

353
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,391
You look sensational,
janice, really.

354
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,393
Not a line.

355
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,395
Two beautiful kids
, you must be proud.

356
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,397
Yeah, yeah,
how'bout that, huh?

357
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:31,903
Even with
our genes.

358
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,406
So, you still
with that, uh, adolph?

359
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,907
Rolf.

360
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,909
No.

361
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,914
Rolf went back
to andorra.

362
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,916
You seem good,
mood- wise.

363
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,918
Yeah, things are
very good nowadays.

364
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,921
So, how are things
really, with ma?

365
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:55,927
She's dead to me.

366
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,929
I don't wanna get in
your way here, tony.

367
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,931
You're the one who stayed,
you took the brunt.

368
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,933
Barbara and i, we're
never gonna forget that.

369
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,438
Well, you forgot it okay
for about 20 years.

370
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,440
At least barb
pitched in.

371
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,442
I know i made
my share of mistakes.

372
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,445
But, ma can't stay in
the hospital forever.

373
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,447
Let me tell you something
about this stroke of hers,

374
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,948
and i got this
from a doctor.

375
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,450
It's called a
conversion reaction.

376
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,952
It's a big fuckin' opera
brought on by repressed rage.

377
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,954
It's bullshit.

378
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,456
There was no infarc-
whatever- the- fuck.

379
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,458
But they also said
the symptoms are

380
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,960
the same as a stroke,
so the results is the same,

381
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,462
she cannot take
care of herself.

382
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,464
She's on the lam in
that fuckin' hospital,

383
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,965
from me.

384
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,967
Well, who did what to who,
it's not my business.

385
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,970
All i know is mom is
bewildered by all of this.

386
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,972
I mention you, her eyes
fill up with tears.

387
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,474
Oh, boy.

388
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,977
I'm not asking you
to step in, tony.

389
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,481
It's my turn now,
that's why i came.

390
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,485
She's a streg',
she's the devil.

391
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,986
She was.

392
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:59,991
Now, she's
just a confused,
frightened, old woman.

393
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,495
So, look, all i need is
a couple hundred bucks.

394
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,496
To fix her car

395
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,998
so i can get back and
forth to the hospital.

396
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,500
Then i'll take her
home to seattle.

397
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,502
Maybe, stay at her
house here temporarily.

398
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,504
Oh, i doubt that.

399
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,006
I just put her house
on the market.

400
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,509
Oh.

401
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:23,014
Look...

402
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,517
...i'm glad
you're here, okay?

403
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,019
You wanna play
florence nightingale,

404
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,023
that's your choice.

405
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,525
Only this is
the last time

406
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,527
we mention her
in this house.

407
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,529
Okay.

408
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:58,049
Hey, t!

409
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,051
Seven and seven
over here.

410
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,053
Whoa, whoa, what's
the matter now?

411
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,555
What's the matter?

412
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,557
I got a call from loiaco
down at the brokerage.

413
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,559
Your two friends beat
the shit out of a broker.

414
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,560
Two others quit.

415
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,061
The guy was pushing
some other stock.

416
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,064
It attracts
negative attention.

417
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,066
Then the two fucks
rip off a porsche carrera

418
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,068
from our
own building.

419
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,069
I'll call them.

420
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,071
No, you'll
go down there, now.

421
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,073
What did you get your
license for, christopher,

422
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:26,077
your resume, huh?

423
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,579
I've been
telling you,

424
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,081
spend more time down
at the brokerage.

425
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,083
You're the fuckin'
sce compliance officer

426
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,085
for christ's sake.

427
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,588
You gotta exercise
impulse control.

428
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,591
Okay, tony.

429
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,092
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,595
Okay, alright.

431
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,104
I can't show it
in this condition.

432
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,105
What the hell
is this?

433
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,107
There's a
high school
up the street.

434
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,109
A sink was left
on upstairs.

435
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,612
You don't even wanna
see the toilets.

436
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,616
Excuse me.

437
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,619
Wait until i catch
the kids who did this.

438
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,621
Break a few windows,

439
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,622
they think they're
johnny bad- ass

440
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,624
the fuckin' jackals.

441
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,125
Will you stop,
please?

442
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,127
Your sister barbara and
the kids are coming down.

443
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,129
You better not be
in this mood.

444
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,632
And i need you
to pick up sausage.

445
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,133
Yeah, yeah,
how many pounds?

446
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,134
Hot or sweet?

447
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,637
Don't you act
like it's a chore.

448
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,639
This party was
your idea.

449
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,641
You said
you were happy
janice was home.

450
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,644
And my parents
are coming.

451
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,146
Oh, really?

452
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,649
What, now that
the dragon lady's gone,

453
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,651
they'll step foot
in our house?

454
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,653
She said some
horrible things

455
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,657
to them
over the years.

456
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm not defending her,
she's dead to me.

457
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,662
I'm telling you,

458
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,663
you mope your
way through this,

459
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,164
i will cut
your throat.

460
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,165
What are you
talking about, mope?

461
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,166
I've been in
a great mood lately.

462
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,668
Right.

463
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,670
I think you need t
o start therapy again.

464
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,673
You're self medicating
, we haven't had sex in--

465
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,174
forget it,
no therapy.

466
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,677
You really should
take a look

467
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,179
at what they did to
your mother's bedroom.

468
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,687
They're rookies,
they're young guys,

469
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,689
they're not used to
this kinda of stress,

470
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,690
so, they get
impulsive...

471
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,191
he better not say
one fuckin' word.

472
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,694
...you got
my word on that.

473
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:26,698
I appreciate it,
chris, thank you.

474
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:30,201
Come on in.

475
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,704
Hey, chris, brough
t you a little capp'.

476
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,205
Thanks.

477
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,207
Sit down.

478
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,717
Refresh my memory abou
t this play we're making

479
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:46,718
on webistics.

480
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,219
We own 400, 000 shares.

481
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,723
Trade on the
bulletin board, otc.

482
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,225
If we cold- call enough
senior citizens,
pump and dump.

483
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,728
Yeah, listen, you guys
ain't spent much time

484
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,730
in the nfl,
let's face it.

485
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,732
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

486
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,233
Two years with
eddie stakes.

487
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,235
Besides waxing
eddie's car.

488
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,737
When he did
the jolt in county--

489
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,238
then you know when
you're bleedin' a guy,

490
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,240
you don't squeeze him
dry right away.

491
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,743
Contrarily, you let him
do his bidding,

492
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,245
suavely.

493
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,747
So, you can bleed him
next week

494
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:22,754
and the week after,
at a minimum.

495
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,256
You mean, we don't need one
of these guys getting pissed

496
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,257
and running to the sce.

497
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,260
I mean, is that
what you're saying?

498
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,762
Break it down.

499
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,764
Sorry, chris.

500
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,765
Webistics is at 80,

501
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,767
when are we
dumping the stock?

502
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,769
You'll know that
when you need to know that.

503
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,772
Excellent.

504
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:44,776
This is cold,
by the way.

505
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,777
Guys...

506
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,780
anymore porsches disappear,

507
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,783
make it two towns over,
and i want a taste.

508
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,785
You're the man.

509
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,796
Grandma's gonna be
so happy to see you.

510
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,798
Grandma, it's me.

511
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,299
Look who's here.

512
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,801
Ma, i'm going
downstairs.

513
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,303
You spend the whole day
on that elevator.

514
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,313
Grandma,
you've gotta eat.

515
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,315
Let me die.

516
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,317
Don't say that.

517
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,319
I saw a light,

518
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,823
there were voices
calling out to me.

519
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,825
Grandma, what went on
between you and dad?

520
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,326
Mom won't tell
me anything.

521
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,328
What, why,
what did he say?

522
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,330
Nothing, he won't
mention you at all.

523
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,332
Oh, that one.

524
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,334
He blames me
for everything.

525
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,336
I know,
me too.

526
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,339
At night,
they hit us.

527
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,842
Why can't this family
just get along?

528
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,844
Some peopl
e don't wanna.

529
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,846
But you, you
listen to him.

530
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,348
You do what
he says.

531
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,851
He's your father.

532
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,854
I won't let them leave
you here like this.

533
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,857
They can't stop me
from seeing you.

534
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:10,361
Meadow, meadow,
take that.

535
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,363
In the drawer.

536
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,866
In the drawer,
take it.

537
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,373
Oh, my god.

538
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,876
This was your
grandmother's,
wasn't it?

539
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,378
It's so you won't
forget me.

540
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,921
Come on, motherfuck!

541
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,423
Motherfuck...!

542
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,928
...fuck...

543
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,949
i told my family
i got broadsided, but,

544
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:45,957
i passed out
behind the wheel.

545
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:52,964
See, my mother and me,
we had a fallin' out.

546
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,968
And, since then,
things have been good.

547
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,970
Clean break.

548
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,972
What kind of
falling out?

549
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,474
One of those
unfortunate
situations.

550
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,977
A lot of
screaming.

551
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,979
Profanity.

552
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,982
Anyway,
things were good.

553
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,985
And then my sister
came back.

554
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,486
It's good to see her,
i guess.

555
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,489
Cues from childhood
kick in, older sister.

556
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,491
That should be
obvious enough.

557
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,993
Yeah, but
those feelings

558
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,995
are starting to bleed
into my business.

559
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,496
What sort of
business are you in?

560
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:30,501
Commercial waste.

561
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,504
Mr. Spears,

562
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,507
i watch the news,
like everyone else.

563
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:40,011
I know who you are,
and i saw "analyze this".

564
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,513
I don't need
the ramifications
that could arise

565
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:48,019
from treating someone
like yourself.

566
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,521
"Analyze this"?

567
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,024
Come on, it's
a fuckin' comedy.

568
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,027
I'm not taking
new patients right now.

569
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,048
Oh, my baby
sister!

570
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,049
Oh, you look great.

571
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,551
Who is thi
s little guy?

572
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,053
Traffic was terrible.

573
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,555
Keep it down out there,
you'll scare the neighbors.

574
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,058
Fuck!

575
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,075
Carm, tony says
the fire's almost ready.

576
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:49,080
Great, par',
i'll be out in a second.

577
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,083
Parvati, she's
a cheese now?

578
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,584
It's a hindu goddess.

579
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,086
Nice for her.

580
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,587
She still answers
to janice, ma,

581
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,589
if it makes you
more comfortable.

582
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,093
Hugo, go t
o the market,

583
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,595
pick up a couple
of cans of pears.

584
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,597
Canned pears,
not fresh.

585
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,100
That's the secret
to my pound cake.

586
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,602
Get some basinigol
' while you're there.

587
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,105
The pears,
you want
the dole?

588
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,608
I'm not even gonna
answer this time.

589
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,610
There is a new market, dad,
down on pompton pike.

590
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,113
A lot of changes
since you've been here.

591
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,114
With that
"mommy dearest" around

592
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,116
never again,
i swore it.

593
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,118
Which is exactly
what she wanted.

594
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,620
You played right into
her hands with that.

595
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,123
Remember what she said
to you at your wedding?

596
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,125
She said it
was a mistake,

597
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,627
tony would get
bored with you.

598
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,136
Hey, take
it easy!

599
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,146
I love seeing them
like that, over a fire.

600
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:58,149
They're better
over a spit.

601
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:02,153
Who's anthony look like
to you, right now?

602
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,155
Dad.

603
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,658
We stopped in to see
ma on the way over.

604
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,660
How do you
think she is?

605
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,663
Mom, a little weak,
but, she's all there.

606
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,165
Some family reunion.

607
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,666
The woman who
bore them all

608
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,667
is barred from
the premises.

609
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,669
I don't think you should
get too close, janice,

610
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,671
look what she tried
to do to tony.

611
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,174
I have no fantasies
about my mother.

612
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,176
You know, he's trying
to sell the house?

613
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,177
What house?

614
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,181
Ma's house.

615
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,183
See, that's what
i'm talking about.

616
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,186
Don't get involved
, let tony handle it.

617
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,689
I only called you
'cause you're far away.

618
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:42,193
I thought you
would wanna know
if your mother was ill.

619
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,195
$180, 000 he's asking
for that place.

620
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,697
Like he needs that.

621
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,200
Well, i'm glad
someone's taking charge.

622
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,703
You'll get your cut.

623
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,205
Ma's not dead yet,
and there's no will.

624
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,707
What?

625
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,710
I mean, ma still
has rights.

626
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,713
Tony pays for the
retirement home,

627
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,216
the upkeep
on her car.

628
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,718
Hey, parvati,
take it easy.

629
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,221
According to you, that
coulda been robert mitchum.

630
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,224
Jesus christ, fuckin'
paulie gaultieri.

631
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,728
Isn't he dead yet?

632
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,230
You're not gonna
stay for dessert?

633
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,231
We got ben
and jerry's,

634
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,732
we got a pear grappa
cake my mother made.

635
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,234
Yeah, i know,
but my friends

636
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,236
are havin' this gallery
opening in chelsea.

637
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,238
I'm tryin' to get them
to finance my video.

638
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,741
I'll leave some
cake out for you.

639
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,245
Hey, i'm sorry.

640
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,246
Hey.

641
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,247
What's up?

642
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,786
What the fuck?

643
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,788
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

644
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,290
There is,
there is.

645
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,292
Take ma back
to seattle.

646
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,795
She came here for the
house, and a $400 car.

647
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,297
That was the con
from the first.

648
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,298
That's the level
she works at.

649
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,799
Maybe the sign
was broken.

650
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,301
Maybe it fell down.

651
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,802
I'm still a little
fat kid to her.

652
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,804
What does she think?
She's gonna stop
the house sale

653
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,306
by picking up one
fuckin' sign?

654
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,807
If she were here

655
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,311
i'd be bouncing her
head against the wall!

656
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,313
Look at yourself, tony.

657
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,315
Look at how
angry you are!

658
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,816
What do you care
about that house?

659
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,318
It's not gonna stop
with the house.

660
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,320
The $300 pillow which
we're gonna pay for.

661
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,321
The video equipment,

662
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,323
which you already
heard her talkin' about.

663
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,824
When are you getting
back into therapy?

664
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,827
Don't star
t with that.

665
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,330
I'm not fuckin' insane,
and i'm not overreactin',

666
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,333
'cause you don't know
this wretched little...!

667
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,336
Alright, alright, this
is getting you no place.

668
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,338
Go outside,
join the party.

669
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,340
Be with your friends,
have some pleasure.

670
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,343
Go ahead.

671
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,344
Fuckin' bitch.

672
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,846
Tony, go ahead,
go have a beer.

673
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,359
What the fuck
are you doing?

674
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,861
Second seatin'
coming up.

675
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,864
Fuckin' moron.

676
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,866
Look at my wife
over there.

677
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,368
No wait, ton',

678
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,371
the neighbor's st. Bernard
is on your property.

679
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,878
You're a
fuckin' moron.

680
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,881
Anyway, we flew
first class...

681
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,383
what service,
forget about it.

682
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,885
Since when do you get
frequent flier upgrades?

683
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,887
The only time
you ever took a trip

684
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,889
was with that rockette that
you claimed you were fuckin',

685
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,391
and then she put
lsd in your drink.

686
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,892
Where'd you get the tickets?
The cuban?

687
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,894
I always thought
there was some way

688
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,397
to divert frequent flier
mileage on a grand scale.

689
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,898
To do that, yo
u gotta break into

690
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,400
the airline's
main computer.

691
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,402
What do they
call it, crackin'?

692
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,903
Hackin'.

693
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,907
Shelley hack,
remember her?

694
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,452
You didn't like it?

695
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,456
Fuck off.

696
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,958
So, when do we get
to roll with tony?

697
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,460
What?

698
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,961
What, are
you trippin'?

699
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,964
We gotta work
our way up,
get introduced.

700
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,966
You must be deep,
hangin' out with him.

701
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:16,967
Who?

702
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,970
Mr. T. You's cap
motherfuckers together?

703
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,473
Nah, he's
too big for that.

704
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,974
He doesn't get
his nails dirty.

705
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,477
You tell him,
we don't mind that shit.

706
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,978
We'll do
anything.

707
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,980
Wet work,
pick up his shirts.

708
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,985
Does tony ever
talk about us?

709
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:40,491
No.

710
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,992
You gonna drink or
just sit there?

711
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,494
Sit.

712
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,495
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

713
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:45,996
What's the matter?

714
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,498
You leave
my gas burner on?

715
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,999
I almost lit a cigarette,
i could have died.

716
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,000
I apologized.

717
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,502
Why you can't
use a lighter

718
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,003
to cook your shit
like normal people

719
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,505
is beyond me.

720
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,507
When everything was finally
going good between us--

721
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,008
shut up
about that!

722
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,010
Why, they're still
gonna kiss your ass.

723
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,515
They don't care
if you're a junkie.

724
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,516
Sit down!

725
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,518
I hate you,
fuckin' pig,
get off me.

726
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,019
You fuckin' whore.

727
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,521
Fuck you!

728
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,023
That's it, go home,
get my dinner ready!

729
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,545
Don't yell,
don't scream.

730
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:41,552
All cutlery stays
right where it is.

731
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:46,557
How's the bagels
in this place?

732
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,059
Come on, you don't
answer my calls,
i got no choice.

733
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,061
Walking away
is a choice.

734
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,063
Ruining my practice,
it's a choice.

735
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,566
You got your office back,
no harm done.

736
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,568
One of my patients
committed suicide

737
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,570
because i wasn't
available to her.

738
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,573
You know what
that means to me?

739
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,075
She can't eat bagels,

740
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:09,079
she can't call in sick
because she's feeling blue,

741
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,582
she's gone.

742
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,084
She's in the ground,
because of you.

743
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,592
I don't deserve
your help.

744
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,094
I hate your
fuckin' system,
i told you.

745
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:29,600
Fuck you.

746
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,603
But, i got a family,
and believe it or not,

747
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:35,105
they're better off
with me than without me.

748
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,608
I don't know
what else to do.

749
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,611
I drove off the road
a couple days back.

750
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,112
You look fine.

751
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,115
The air bag.

752
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,619
You always told me
if i was drivin'--

753
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,622
that was a different
time for us.

754
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,632
Alright,
i don't blame you.

755
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:05,135
Maybe you can recommend
somebody else?

756
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,137
I would never ask
another colleague

757
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,640
to get involved
in this.

758
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,141
How many more
people have to die

759
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,143
for your
personal growth?

760
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,144
Look at me.

761
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,146
I swear,
to jesus christ,

762
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:22,653
nobody got killed
because of you.

763
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,655
Get out of my life.

764
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,198
Hey.

765
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,702
What are you doing
home at this hour?

766
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:15,706
Nothing.

767
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,709
I thought it was a. J. ,
home from school.

768
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,210
Yeah.

769
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,226
You alright?

770
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,728
Yeah.

771
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,236
Want a little
cold past'?

772
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,238
I can microwave it.

773
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,784
Looks good.

774
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,286
You want cheese?
Something to drink?

775
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,287
No.

776
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,296
Sit down.
