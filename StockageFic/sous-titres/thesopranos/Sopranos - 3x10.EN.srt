1
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,285
I'm in asbury.

2
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,288
I'll be at your
boatyard in 15 minutes.

3
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,291
No, i got a meeting,
i'll come there after.

4
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,327
O. J. Simpson's acquittal
they still cannot accept,

5
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,330
and now they're suing
him in civil court.

6
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,832
Simpson's attorney
is outraged,

7
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,834
fred goldman
is philosophical.

8
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:33,336
In jersey, they'd have
fried his worthless ass.

9
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,839
Well, he's shunned
on his golf course now.

10
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,340
Oh!

11
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,843
There he is,
f. Lee fatfuck.

12
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,845
Hold my briefs.

13
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,847
What's the
matter with you?

14
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:47,851
My back, fucki
n' valuejet, tryi
ng to save 50 bucks.

15
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,852
How was boca?

16
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,353
How do you think?

17
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,355
Your uncle's
quaking in his boots
i was there to pop him.

18
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,858
Ho, wait till we
get outside, huh?

19
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,860
Junior's looking
for a way out.

20
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,862
But, he's
got that iron
rod up his ass.

21
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,864
He thought he
was in line
to be boss.

22
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,366
Now he's gotta
take orders
from somebody

23
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,868
who used to
fetch him
his sambuca.

24
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,870
Hey, fuck him.

25
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,371
Is he gonna sit
down or not?

26
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,373
If tony
will guarantee
his safety.

27
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,876
You deal with it
, alright, tony?

28
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:16,880
Make it
christmas,

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,382
this way i don't have to
go on that fuckin' cruise.

30
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:21,384
No sooner do i get
back from florida

31
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:24,387
than ange has
booked a suite on
the dawn princess.

32
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:27,390
5, 000 bucks a week
and no way off.

33
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,892
Thank god carm
gets seasick.

34
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,895
We're staying home thi
s year so jackie can
study for his sats.

35
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,897
Ro found him a
great tutor.

36
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:34,898
Pray he goes to
a state school.

37
00:03:35,398 --> 00:03:36,900
You oughta see terri's
bills from villanova.

38
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,902
And matt and kevin
right behind her--

39
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,403
hey, sal,
you need money,
you come to me,

40
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,905
you hear what
i'm sayin'?

41
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,907
Don't be moving that
"h" no more, puss.

42
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,408
It's too risky.

43
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:53,416
I always wanted a
house by the ocean.

44
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,918
Maybe in another life.

45
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,424
Ton'!

46
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:02,926
Tony?

47
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,929
Hey, paulie.

48
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,430
We gonna go
see your boat?

49
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,435
Nah, i'm just...

50
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:15,438
thinking about
our former friend.

51
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,439
Who?

52
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,444
Him?

53
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:22,946
Not me,

54
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,948
never.

55
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:27,951
Me and jackie
met him down here in'95,

56
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,953
when he go
t back from boca.

57
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,455
Oh, yeah, that crazy
shit with your uncle.

58
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:33,957
Junior hijacked
jackie's truck.

59
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,458
What about it?

60
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,960
I should've seen it
then, that's all.

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,462
Don't waste another second
on that rat fuck, ton'.

62
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,965
I'd kill him
again if i could.

63
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,969
Tommy angeletti,

64
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,471
he's doing a re- bar
at the esplanade.

65
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:49,973
Yeah?

66
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,976
He's into me
for 100 large on
college basketball.

67
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,979
Now ralphie's holding
up the contractor
for more money.

68
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,982
He's got the site
shutdown on a strike.

69
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,985
Angeletti
can't work.

70
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,487
Paulie, your
fuckin' book

71
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:07,490
against millions gonna
roll in off the esplanade?

72
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,492
I figured you'd
take his side.

73
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,994
But, ralphie
shouldn't come across

74
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,996
with a couple
of no- show
electrician jobs?

75
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:15,498
I shouldn't get
something outta this
fuckin' esplanade?

76
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,003
Alright, i'll
talk to him.

77
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,551
Oh, go
od, you're up.

78
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:10,553
I just got the digital
video for meadow.

79
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,555
It's three down,
three to go.

80
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:15,558
Plus, the scooter is
ready, but you're gonn
a have to pick it up.

81
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,060
It's on my list.

82
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,062
You're not gonna like this
next bit of news, either.

83
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:21,564
Janice is insisting on cooking
christmas dinner this year.

84
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,066
Christmas eve or
christmas day?

85
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,567
I'm doing
christmas eve.

86
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,069
You wanna turn her
loose on shellfish?

87
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,571
She's determined to co
ok goose on christmas day.

88
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,073
Why?

89
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:31,574
Well, her impulses are rig
she's over here all the time.

90
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,077
She volunteered me to make
the gravy and the lasagna,

91
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,079
so, with everything else
i gotta do today,

92
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,580
i gotta bring half
my kitchen over there,

93
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,583
and she needs you
because the fuse b
ox is on the fritz again.

94
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,085
Oh, fuck,
come on, i'm busy.

95
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,086
What, i'm not?

96
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,594
Well, i was
feeling good,

97
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,597
all of a sudden, i'm
back to square one.

98
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:56,099
What do you mean?

99
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,102
I had another one of
those attacks this morning.

100
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,607
Not the whole thing,

101
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,609
but, it was right there,

102
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:09,112
under the surface,

103
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:12,615
that feeling like i go
t ginger ale in my brain.

104
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,617
Are you taking
your medication?

105
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,620
Not every day.

106
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,123
Is that what the
prescription says?

107
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,125
Another thing
to feel bad about.

108
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,126
Well?

109
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:26,629
Can you tell me
what led up to this?

110
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,131
You know my log,

111
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,133
i was supposed to write
everything down for you?

112
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:33,136
Look, it's just a
list of shit i gotta
do for christmas.

113
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:35,138
All the pressure
we put on ourselves

114
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:38,641
this time of the year.

115
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:41,144
I call it
"stressmas".

116
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,146
That's cute.

117
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:47,650
I was looking forwar
d to christmas this year.

118
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,651
No shit.

119
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,654
Now, here i go, right back
in the fuckin' rabbit hole.

120
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:56,159
Okay, let's do
the drill.

121
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,661
The attack,
what preceded it?

122
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,663
Yesterday i we
nt down to the shore

123
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,165
to get my boat
winterized.

124
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,666
What happened?

125
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,172
I started thinking
about this thing

126
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,673
that happened
years ago.

127
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:13,176
I haven't thought about
it since it happened.

128
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:14,677
Tell me about it.

129
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,681
I can't.

130
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:19,682
I see.

131
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:22,185
We're at one of our
favorite junctures.

132
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,691
Without going
into specifics...

133
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,699
i can tell you it was
a friend of mine.

134
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,703
I found out he was working
for the federal government.

135
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,708
Enough said?

136
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,710
I see.

137
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:53,216
Am i ruining
your christmas?

138
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,223
A- major?

139
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,226
E- major.

140
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,230
I don't know.

141
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,232
Do you think
it's too down?

142
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,234
I mean, with
the chorus,

143
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:13,236
"his blood clean
s every stain"?

144
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,738
Oh, it's a great
mother- jumping
lyric, jan.

145
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,740
What are we
sellin', ajax?

146
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,243
"His blood
cleans stains"?

147
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,746
My brother
, i hope.

148
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,249
Shit, fuck.

149
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,252
Hey, you guys,
come on in.

150
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,753
We're just
working.

151
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,255
On the fuse box?

152
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,756
No, we're
making a demo,

153
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:36,259
tryin' to get
some major label
interest here.

154
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:40,763
God, the
poor thing.

155
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,276
I'm not coming
to eat here

156
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,278
unless this pig
sty is cleaned up!

157
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,280
It's my
wrist, tony.

158
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,783
And the percodans
aren't even
working anymore.

159
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:02,785
You got an
y rubber gloves?

160
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,287
I'll get started,

161
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,289
and we can work
on the stock.

162
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,296
Whoa, your wrist,

163
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,798
i thought the
doctor said it
was just a sprain.

164
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,800
Apparently, there's
nerve involvement.

165
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,802
I may need
an operation.

166
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,811
From the russian?

167
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,813
It was the worst
night of my life,

168
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:34,317
but, it led
me to jesus.

169
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,319
Come on, janice,
when's the last time

170
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,821
you went to a
prayer meetin'?

171
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:41,824
I know.

172
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,827
And, aaron and i
don't even sleep
together anymore,

173
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,330
but in a
larger sense,

174
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,832
christianity's brought
about a business,

175
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:50,833
with this ccm.

176
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,335
The what?

177
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,338
Christian
contemporary,
tony, ohh!

178
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,840
It's the fastest growing
marketing sector

179
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,343
in the music
business today.

180
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:00,843
Here.

181
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:06,349
You knocked over
your drink, honey.

182
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,350
Ugh...

183
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,853
really hurts, huh?

184
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,355
Yeah.

185
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:14,357
Janice!

186
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,883
Ooh, here's
a branch.

187
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,386
I don't see the
rest of the tree.

188
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,888
Fuck that
philosophical shit.

189
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,890
Oh, jesus.

190
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,891
What?

191
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,393
Oh, shit.

192
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,396
That i
s depressing.

193
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,399
I don't even
wanna fuckin'
touch this thing.

194
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,900
Hey.

195
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,402
The wife
sends her love.

196
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,903
How are
ya, ray?

197
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,905
How ya doin',
hesh?

198
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,907
Tony,

199
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,410
guess what
we found

200
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,412
in the bottom of
the christmas box?

201
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,414
The santa
outfit.

202
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,416
You guessed!

203
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,918
Burn the
fuckin' thing.

204
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:17,420
This is the firs
t christmas in history

205
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,422
i remember him
not bein' santa.

206
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:20,923
Oh, big pussy.

207
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,425
We were talkin'
the other day

208
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,926
about that f
at piece of shit.

209
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,929
When he got back f
rom boca at christmas of'95,

210
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,431
how he wasn't himself.

211
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,932
What happened to,

212
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,435
"not wasting your breath
on the cocksucker"?

213
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,437
Two- faced fuck!

214
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:37,440
To sell out your friends
to save your own ass,
it's despicable.

215
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,442
That's one rid
e i would've loved t
o have been along on.

216
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,443
Yeah, me too.

217
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,445
Enough of this shit,
put up the fuckin'
decorations.

218
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,947
We still gotta
find somebody
to play santa.

219
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:50,453
Get the fuck
outta here.

220
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,954
It's
fitting,
you know.

221
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,457
After all, it was
your father who started
this whole tradition.

222
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:55,958
That's right,

223
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,461
when johnny boy
busted this place
out and took it over,

224
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,463
and old man
satriale put a
bullet in his own head,

225
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,965
there was a lot of
sadness on the block.

226
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,967
Nothing a christmas
ham couldn't fix.

227
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:06,969
Come on, t.

228
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,472
Fuckin' stop,
alright?

229
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:10,973
Find somebody
else to do it.

230
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:31,994
The big man!

231
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,496
Come have drink.

232
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:34,997
Where's slava?

233
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,499
Working probably.

234
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,005
Anthony...

235
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:45,007
how you doing?

236
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,509
How are ya?

237
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,011
You want
somethin'?
Food?

238
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,012
No, we're just
gonna talk.

239
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:53,015
Oh, high level.

240
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,517
Shh.

241
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,522
Looks like valery's
started to celebrate
christmas early.

242
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,023
You don't know
the half!

243
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,526
Russian christmas don'
t come till mid- january.

244
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,535
There's a quarter
mil in there,

245
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,537
my own personal funds.

246
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,540
I'll send it to moscow
with the ibm thinkpads.

247
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,042
But, this time, i want
to use promstrybank.

248
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,045
Anyway, they will se
nd it to the isle of man,

249
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,047
to your bank,
numbered account.

250
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,549
Agron...

251
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,060
thanks.

252
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:42,064
Galina loved
the escalante,
by the way.

253
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,066
You think you
can get another one?

254
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,068
There is
something, maybe,

255
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,070
you can help me with.

256
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,573
You tell me what it is
, i'll tell you if i can help.

257
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,576
I'm looking
for this russian,

258
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:56,078
he's a friend of
svetlana kirilenko,

259
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,080
you know,
irina's cousin.

260
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,582
The one- legged woman
, i know who she is.

261
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,084
But, i don't
want her involved.

262
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,587
All i know about this guy
is he drives a livery cab,

263
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:08,090
and he wasn't very nice
to someone important to me.

264
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,592
Don't think another
thing about this.

265
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,094
I'll find him, i'll kick
the shit out of him.

266
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:14,096
No, no, no,
i'm gonna do this.

267
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:16,098
This motherfucker's mine.

268
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,136
What happened
to the jarlsbe
rg that was here?

269
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,638
What, sil?

270
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,640
Stop the music.

271
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,642
Cut, stop the music!

272
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:03,646
There was an entir
e wedge of jarlsberg
here this morning.

273
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,147
What happened to it?

274
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,148
I don't know.

275
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:07,149
Goddamnit!

276
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,651
Debbie had a rondelay
of french brie

277
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:10,152
missing from her
purse yesterday.

278
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:11,654
In there?

279
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:12,655
Uh- huh.

280
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,683
Ever since w
e found that suit,

281
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,185
now i'm dreaming about
that fat rat bastard.

282
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,187
What about it?

283
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,189
We did the
right thing.

284
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,194
You're startin'
to worry me.

285
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,196
You got a problem?

286
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,699
'95.

287
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,202
I can't believe
i didn't see it.

288
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:03,706
I had a fucking lamp
down here, but meadow
took it to school.

289
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:06,208
You think it was
down in boca, though,

290
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,711
i mean, he was
bringing the s
hit in through there?

291
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,713
No, it wasn't boca.

292
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,715
They didn't
flip him in boca.

293
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,717
He was down there
for 24 hours

294
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,719
to set up the sit- down
with my uncle,

295
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,220
and i know,
for a fact,

296
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,722
he was with my uncle
the whole time.

297
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:22,224
It was the sit- down.

298
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,227
Simpson himself attend
ed barbieri's deposition,

299
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:26,729
but made no comment.

300
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:29,231
Next week, simpson
faces another challenge,

301
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:31,734
the goldman attorney
is seeking access...

302
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,235
i'm saturated
with it.

303
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,739
...in anticipation of
collecting punitive damages...

304
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:42,745
corrado.

305
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,747
John.

306
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:47,750
Where's
bonpensiero?

307
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,251
He's not here yet.

308
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:50,753
He supposed
to be here.

309
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,255
He brokered
the fuckin' thing.

310
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,757
Hey, i'm here.

311
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,258
What do you think?

312
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,260
I'm gonna let'em hurt
my only uncle?

313
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,261
No.

314
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:00,763
Sit down.

315
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,769
Where the fuck
were you?

316
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:11,273
You better have a good excus
for why you're still alive.

317
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:13,275
I'm sorry,
skipper, it'll
never happen again.

318
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,277
I hope nobody called
the house, though.

319
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:16,779
I told ange
i was with you.

320
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,281
My goomar's mother, we were
in the hospital all night,

321
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,783
t. I. A. , that's
a small stroke,

322
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,285
she lost use
of her left hand.

323
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,788
It's coming back now,
but, i didn't eat--

324
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,790
did you get laid?

325
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,291
Yeah.

326
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,295
We should've known,
right then,

327
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,798
when he was m. I.
A. From that sit- down.

328
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,802
That's all the
time you need.

329
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,804
When they
flip somebody,

330
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:44,306
they try to get
him back on the
street right away,

331
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,808
that very day.

332
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,812
So, you don't
have time to think.

333
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,816
Sil, what are you gettin'
your goomar for christmas?

334
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,819
Cash, that's the
only thing tha
t shuts her up

335
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:58,821
about bein' al
one over the holidays.

336
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,322
Michelle likes "ice".

337
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,324
I'm getting a piece
from a jew in the city.

338
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,827
T, what are you gettin'
your new goomar?

339
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:05,828
She did me a favor.

340
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,830
She went to morocco
over the holidays.

341
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,331
On her own?
She paid for it?

342
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:10,332
Yeah.

343
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,834
She went
to morocco?

344
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,836
Who is she,
bada bing crosby?

345
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,838
She's not one
of those girls.

346
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,840
She's got
a real job.

347
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,843
She sells mercedes,
smart, gorgeous...

348
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,845
too good
to be true.

349
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,347
Speaking of which,
who's that piece of ass?

350
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:29,852
Oh, madonn',
look who it is.

351
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,356
It's the miracle
of christmas.

352
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:36,358
Next the blind
will see,

353
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:38,360
and the lame
will walk.

354
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,368
So, how is
everything here
so far, tonight?

355
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,871
Much better now
that we've cast
our glims

356
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,372
on you,
sweetheart.

357
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,874
How you doin',
'mainy?

358
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,376
Fine, tony- oni.

359
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,379
Listen...

360
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,382
i thought
you'd wanna know.

361
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,384
Two guys over there,
at that table...

362
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:03,886
yeah?

363
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:05,888
I think
they're fbi.

364
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,392
I'm kidding.

365
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,896
I'm kidding,
enjoy.

366
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,905
He's ready.

367
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:31,914
You are
a hypocrite.

368
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,415
That's what
you are.

369
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,417
You vilify a man
behind his back,

370
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:37,419
and then you
smile in his face.

371
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,924
Something's gotta
keep the customers
coming back

372
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:45,928
and it's not gonna
be your mooshata
raviolis, lately.

373
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,434
Hey.

374
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,436
Charmaine...

375
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,439
sometimes we're forced
to work the same shift.

376
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,442
Your wife, her ass may
be improved artie, but--

377
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,444
hey, hey, hey,
come on, sil.

378
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,451
She's over here
joking about the fbi.

379
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,953
Since when
is that funny?

380
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:15,958
Yeah.

381
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,963
No, wait,
hold on a minute.

382
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,966
Go ahead.

383
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,474
Alright, great.

384
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,977
Yeah...

385
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:37,980
merry christmas
to you, too.

386
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,984
Mr. Valdez?

387
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,485
That's me.

388
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:55,998
I know you.

389
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,500
You look like maybe
someone, i don't know...

390
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,002
he's the
designata drive.

391
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:01,503
Me?

392
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:03,505
No, you the
designata drive.

393
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:06,008
No, no, you,
you, it's you.

394
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,509
You!

395
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,511
Airport ramada,
right?

396
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,013
Yeah.

397
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:12,514
Yeah, let'
s go, c'mon.

398
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,528
How was dinner?

399
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:28,030
Good.

400
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,533
Was charmaine there?

401
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,035
Yep.

402
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:35,537
She looks good,
doesn't she?

403
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,039
What, are you
disappointed?

404
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,042
Her husband dumped her,
you thought she was gonna
look like a krull?

405
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,544
A krull?

406
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:46,048
A crone, a troll,
i don't know.

407
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,552
Holiday traffic.

408
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:53,555
My head is
clanging like a bell.

409
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,557
I got the scooter.

410
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:11,073
Yay!!

411
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,074
Hello bedford falls!

412
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,575
Oh, jesus.

413
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:15,077
Merry christmas!

414
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,578
Enough already.

415
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:19,581
Merry christmas, george.

416
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,084
Santa, we still
haven't got one.

417
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,085
You wanna
do it?

418
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:25,087
Me, what do
i know about it?

419
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,089
I don't have kids.

420
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,091
You don't have to,
santa doesn't
have any kids.

421
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,093
Yeah, that's strange,

422
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,595
that mr. And mrs. Claus
didn't have kids of their own.

423
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,098
Probably why
they got into it
in the first place.

424
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:37,599
I used to think the
elves were their kids.

425
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,101
They were running
a sweatshop over there.

426
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:40,602
There was
something on tv,

427
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:42,604
the original
elves were ugly,

428
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,107
traveled with santa to
throw bad kids a beatin',

429
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,109
and he gave
the good ones toys.

430
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,611
The fuckin' grinch.

431
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:52,114
Maybe that's where
they got the idea.

432
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,616
And fuckin' dr. Seuss
ripped it off.

433
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,618
That grinch, man,
that's where the money is.

434
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,620
A couple hundred mil.

435
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,622
Put jim carrey
in the motherfucker.

436
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,124
Tony...

437
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:03,125
hey!

438
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,127
I got stuff for
the party, toys.

439
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:06,628
From me and junior.

440
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,130
They're not wrapped,

441
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,132
but this way they can
see what they're getting.

442
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:11,633
Tell junior
thank you.

443
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,642
What?

444
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,644
Ho- fuckin'- ho.

445
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:24,646
You're right.

446
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,148
What are you
talking about?

447
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:28,150
You wanna play santa claus
at the party this year?

448
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,651
No, i can't do that.

449
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,153
Why not?

450
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:33,655
I don't know,
i don't know how.

451
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,157
What's to know?

452
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,658
You ask'em what
they want for christmas,

453
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:39,161
you give'em a nice to
y, and that's the end ofit.

454
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:40,662
No, not me,
i can't.

455
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:41,663
Yes, you can.

456
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:42,664
I can't!

457
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:43,165
Why not?

458
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:44,666
I'm shy.

459
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:51,673
The boss of this
family told you

460
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,175
you're gonna
be santa claus,

461
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:54,676
you're santa claus.

462
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:57,179
So, shut
the fuck up
about it.

463
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:09,691
A strange and macabre
christmas story,

464
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:12,194
another sad incidence
of continuing violence

465
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:13,695
against livery drivers.

466
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,198
In downtown newark,
police were called
to the scene

467
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,700
of what appeared to
be a christmas prank
gone awry.

468
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,203
Livery driver
igor parnasky

469
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:23,705
was found trapped
under santa's sleigh,

470
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,708
and severely beaten
inside the window display

471
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,210
at curran's
sporting goods.

472
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,711
The russian emigre
also suffered

473
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,713
injuries
from broken glass.

474
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,215
From his description
of his assailants,

475
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,217
police are
questioning members

476
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,718
of a marauding
youth gang...

477
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,220
oh, my god!

478
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,221
...their turf.

479
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,722
Merry christmas.

480
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:43,725
Reporting live
from downtown newark...

481
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,231
oh, my...

482
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:53,735
aaron, honey, honey?

483
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:55,237
Yeah?

484
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:58,240
I think i know wha
t's missing from the song.

485
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,243
It's the brother concept.

486
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:02,244
He ain't heavy?

487
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,246
No, i mean
, not exactly.

488
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:08,750
Maybe we can try t
o get something down.

489
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,753
Jan, you're crying.

490
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:14,756
Sometimes
we really don'
t see our loved ones.

491
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:25,267
Hi, whatcha doing?

492
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:30,272
Just enjoying
the tree.

493
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,774
I love this
time of year.

494
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,276
Me, too.

495
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,286
You'
re ho
me early.

496
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:47,789
Hunter went
into the city
with hadley.

497
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,796
So, where's
jackie tonight?

498
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:57,799
He had to go visit a frien
d of his in the hospital.

499
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,301
Oh, no, who?

500
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,303
Someone from school,
they think it's
appendicitis.

501
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:02,804
Oh, my god.

502
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:07,809
So, you and jackie are
getting pretty close, huh?

503
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,320
That new angel
looks really great.

504
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,330
...that's
what he said.

505
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,831
Wanna see
50 gs?

506
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:31,333
Holy shit!

507
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,834

508
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,337
Yeah, my wife

509
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:37,339
Wild turkey,

How are you?

513
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,352
Carmela was right,

00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:52,354
you look great.

515
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:53,855
Thank you.

516
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:56,858
I'm trying to
give you a compliment.

517
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:57,859
Well, don't.

518
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,861
What's your
fuckin' problem?

519
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:01,863
All these years,
i've sat here and
i kept my mouth shut.

520
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:04,366
I didn't want you and
your boys comin' in here.

521
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,368
And look
what happened,

522
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:07,869
look what you've
done to my husband.

523
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,871

Let's get the fuck

528
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,884

00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,934

00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,936
Gettin' a

535
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:19,441

C'mon.

537
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,945
C'mon, it's alright,

538
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,447
C'mon.

539
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,950
It's a bachelor party,
my frat brothers.

540
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,454
I didn't d
o anything!

541
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:33,455
Shut up!

542
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:37,959
Put your hands up,

543
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,461
No...please.

544
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,464
C'mon, you fuck!

545
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:45,467
You fuckin' puss
y piece of shit.

546
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,969
All i did was tell
your old man what
a good kid you were,

547
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:49,971

548
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:50,972
I'm sorry!

549
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,475
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:56,478
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,481
What's this?

552
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:01,983
Hmm?

553
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:04,986
Nice.

554
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:07,489
I'm sorry,
i'm sorry.

555
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:10,992
You bottomed out.

556
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,994
What do
you mean?

557
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:22,504
You bottomed out.

558
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:38,520
I wish i could get up
at 11:30 every morning

559
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,022
after being out all
night, god knows where.

560
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,528
Stop with the
pots and pans.

561
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,029
Where were you
last night?

562
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:49,030
Nowhere,

563
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,532
i wasn't anywhere.

564
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:53,535
I was the monogamy
poster boy, swear to god.

565
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,536
Oh, please.

566
00:30:56,538 --> 00:30:59,541
Well, i break up
with the so- called
russian whore,

567
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,042
i'm towing
the line,

568
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:02,544
and this is
the thanks i get!

569
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:04,546
What about
charmaine?

570
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:06,047
Charmaine?

571
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:08,049
Mm- hmm, i know
all about you.

572
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,551
What?

573
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,553
I didn't d
o anything.

574
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,054
Yeah, you did
in high school.

575
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,055
High school?

576
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:16,057
Don't try
to deny it.

577
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:18,560
Oh, okay,
high school, okay.

578
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,562
Her husband dumps her and
she never looked so good?

579
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:22,564
You gotta ask
yourself why.

580
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,067
I didn't
do nothing.

581
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,569
I didn't do nothing!

582
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,070
It's too late.

583
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,572
I don't believe
anything you say.

584
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:41,082
My wife had her doubts
about jackie jr...

585
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:45,086
and all along i
kept defending the
little two- faced prick.

586
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:49,090
Do you feel responsible
for their relationship?

587
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,593
Meadow thinks she'd still
going out with the oreo cookie

588
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:53,595
if it wasn't for me.

589
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:55,597
Well, that's true,
isn't it?

590
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,602
The question i
s, what am i gonna
do about jackie?

591
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,604
Should i tell my wife?

592
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,606
Meadow,
jesus, she's--

593
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:08,610
it'd break her heart
if she knew.

594
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,622
On another subject,

595
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,124
i was thinking about
what we were talking about

596
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,126
last time
you were here.

597
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,127
You know,

598
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:29,130
your friend who was working
for the federal government?

599
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,633
Granted i get
most of my information

600
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:34,135
from the movies
and bill curtis.

601
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,137
But i was thinking...

602
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:49,651
they're around
the block out there.

603
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,152
Biggest one yet.

604
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,154
Where's the
friggin' beard?

605
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:55,156
I saw it
in the box.

606
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,658
It's gotta
be there.

607
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,660
Even without padding,

608
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,162
the suit's too small
on this fatso.

609
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,668
Motherfucker.

610
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:09,671
What, ton'?

611
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,673
He was wearing a wire...

612
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,676
when he came
to the party

613
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:17,679
he already
had the suit on.

614
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,682
Alvin!

615
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:22,684
Okay!

616
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:29,691
Hey, look
at this.

617
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:31,693
Oh...!

618
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,695
You been walking
around like that?

619
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,697
Boosting salvation
army kettles now.

620
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,699
Kevin, go make
me a sandwich.

621
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:38,700
Okay, dad.

622
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,201
He's a method actor.

623
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,203
Getting into character
like al.

624
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:43,204
Yeah...

625
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:45,707
"it was you, fredo."

626
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,209
Look at that, don'
t even need a pillow.

627
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,211
Hey!
Watch the suit!

628
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:53,715
He can't
make a joke?

629
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,217
What, are you
mr. Sensitive

630
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:58,720

Hey, hey, hey!

Oh, it's as cold as
your sister's tit out there.

648
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:42,764
You should see the crowd

Have you b
een a good girl?

00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:25,306
What do you want

667
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:27,308
I want a new doll

668
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:29,310
You want a new dol
l and a kitchen.

669
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,812

My little elf

672
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,317
He called
me dad.

673
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:38,319
You like i
t? Big enough

674
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,320
Merry christmas.

675
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:40,822
Thank you, santa.

676
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,323
Oh, how cute.

677
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:43,324
Who's next?

678
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:46,828
C'mon, don't be shy,

Merry christmas.

680
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,332
Next in line, we

Wait a minute.

00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,841
I gotta give you

00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:01,843
C'mon, single file
over here!

686
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,344
C'mon, next
one in line!

687
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:05,847
It would kill him
to say "ho, ho, ho"?

688
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:07,348
You were
just here.

689
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:08,850
I was not.

690
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,852
Yeah, you were
, you were on my lap
five minutes ago.

691
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:11,853
No, i wasn't.

692
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,354
Yes, you were.

693
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,356
Now you're going
on santa's list an
d you're getting nothing!

694
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:16,858
Fuck you, santa!

695
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,860
Hey! Hey!

696
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,361
Gregorio!

697
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,363
How dare you talk
that way to santa.

698
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,365
He never talks
that way at home.

699
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:25,366
My friend,

700
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,869
you don't talk
that way to santa.

701
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,871
Get back there, tell
santa you're sorry.

702
00:36:30,371 --> 00:36:31,372
Go on.

703
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,877
I'm sorry,
santa.

704
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:36,878
That's better.

705
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,384
I don't care,
you are punished.

706
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,887
What the hell's
wrong with you, bobby?

707
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,889
You got kids
of your own.

708
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,390
I didn't
wanna do this.

709
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,892
Shyness
is a curse.

710
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:53,394
Why don't you
lighten up a little
bit? It's christmas.

711
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:56,898
C'mere, honey.

712
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,900
Don't be
scared of santa.

713
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,401
C'mon,
there you go.

714
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:03,404
Next year he goes
to santa school.

715
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,907
Fuckin' ho hum
, if you ask me.

716
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:07,909
I don't miss pussy's
fake fuckin' good cheer,

717
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,410
tell you the truth.

718
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,412
Let him st
ay with the fish.

719
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:15,917
Why'd you go to
that psychic last year?

720
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,419
Since you don't
dwell on this shit.

721
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:19,921
That was different.

722
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,422
Chrissy was shot.

723
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,925
That was
a paranormal event.

724
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:26,427
What the fuck are
you talking about?

725
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:29,430
That psychic told
you those guys were
haunting you.

726
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,932
The guys
that you...

727
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:32,433
pussy,

728
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:34,936
i loved that cocksucker
like a brother

729
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,438
and he fucked
me in the ass.

730
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:40,441
That's the difference
between puss and the others.

731
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:43,444
Him you loved.

732
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,446
The world
don't run on love.

733
00:37:45,446 --> 00:37:47,949
He was a rat bastard.

734
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,951
One thing
you got to admit,

735
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,953
he made a great
santa claus.

736
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,955
He did.

737
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,457
In the end,
fuck santa claus.

738
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,467
Another sweater.

739
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,469
That's from nana.

740
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:11,973
You're gonna tell
her how much you like
it when she gets here.

741
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:13,474
Who could that
be so early?

742
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:16,477
Let me see,
maybe it'll
fit me.

743
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,479
It's not bad,
better than last year.

744
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,481
Jackie jr. , hi.

745
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:21,983

746
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,484
Merry christmas,
aunt carm.

747
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,486
It's okay
if i come in?

748
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,990
We're just
opening our presents.

749
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,002
Merry christmas,
ton'.

750
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,003
Good morning.

751
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:43,504
Merry christmas.

752
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,006
Merry christmas.

753
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:48,009
These are from mom
for everybody.

754
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,013
This is
for you.

755
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,015
Wow,
thank you.

756
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:55,516
Let me get
your present.

757
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,518
No, you can open
yours first
if you want.

758
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,020
Okay.

759
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:12,033
This is so
beautiful, jackie,

760
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:13,534
thank you.

761
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,037
There's something
on the back.

762
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:20,541
"To m. S. From j. A.

763
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,543
I will
always be true."

764
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:25,046
Oh, jackie.

765
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,059
I'll be
right back.

766
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,561
C'mere, le
t me see that.

767
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,572
Can i talk to you?

768
00:39:57,578 --> 00:40:00,081
I flunked out
of rutgers.

769
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,586
I'm sorry, i know
i fucked up.

770
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:08,089
I got distracted
this year by things.

771
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,593
Ralph said i was probably
wasting my time

772
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:14,595
if i didn't
have the aptitude.

773
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:15,596
Ralph?

774
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,599
You know, he didn't
go to school,

775
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,602
and look at the money
he was making
when he was my age.

776
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:23,104
And the piece,

777
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,106
my car got broken into
a couple of times
at the frat house,

778
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,608
so ralph
gave it to me.

779
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,612
It was fuckin'
stupid, i know it.

780
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:33,614
But tony, i'm gonna
be alright now.

781
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,616
I'm gonna
design men's suits.

782
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:38,619
Meadow thinks i
should go to the
fashion institute.

783
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,622
I really think i
could be good if i
applied myself.

784
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:45,126
You bullshit me
and you betray
my daughter.

785
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,130
I'm sorry.

786
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,632
I'm sorry.

787
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:54,635
Go back inside.

788
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,140
I'm gonna
be frank on this.

789
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,143
I haven't decide
d what to do with you.

790
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:13,654
Comin' through!

791
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,658
You can't
stay?

792
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:20,161
I still have
to give you
your present.

793
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,663
I'm driving mo
m up to the home
to see grandma.

794
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:30,171
Thank you for my
beautiful necklace.

795
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:43,184
Merry christmas.

796
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,689
Merry christmas.

797
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,693
Go be with your family
and open your presents.

798
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:54,195
Love you.

799
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:06,707
Oh, my god.

800
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:08,709
Lemme see, mom.

801
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,211
Look at this.

802
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,212
Wow.

803
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,213
Wow.

804
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:13,714
Mmm.

805
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,716
Well, uh,

806
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:20,221
this is gonna
seem really stupid
after that, but,

807
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:22,223
it's your turn, dad.

808
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:24,225
This is for you.

809
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:29,730
I didn't think
you were gonna
get me anything.

810
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,732
After...

811
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:33,234
it's christmas.

812
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,740
Thank you.

813
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:41,742
Come on,
open it.

814
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:43,744
What is it?

815
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,252
"Big mouth billy bass",
what is that?

816
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:52,753
Oh, those are good.

817
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,256
Wait till you see
what it does.

818
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:56,757
What does
it do?

819
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:58,759
You'll see.

820
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,761
I know i give you
a lot of stuff, dad,

821
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:04,765
i don't kn
ow what you do
with it, but,

822
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:08,269
i want to see this
on your desk, promise?

823
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,270
Yeah.

824
00:43:16,277 --> 00:43:19,280
That is hilarious.

825
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:24,285
Wait, mom.

826
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,793
What a riot.

827
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:37,298
It's cute.

828
