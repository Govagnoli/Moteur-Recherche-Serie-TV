1
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,119
Ton', will you
get that?

2
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:49,125
Hello?

3
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,627
Tony, it's me.

4
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,129
Don't hang up.

5
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,132
The fuck are you
calling here for,

6
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:57,634
you know who could
answer this phone?

7
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:59,636
Please, you are
so conceited.

8
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:02,138
Do you really think
i want to call you?

9
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:03,640
I think you're
drinkin' and dialin'.

10
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,643
I can smell the vanilla
stoli from here.

11
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:08,144
Yell to your sister,
not to me.

12
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,146
A week it's be
en and my poor cousin

13
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,148
still is not havin
g her prosthetic leg.

14
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,150
What the fuck
you want me to do?

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,652
Tony, please,

16
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,654
i miss you so much.

17
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,155
Can you co
me over here?

18
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:22,158
Don't ever
call here again.

19
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,665
Didn't you see my
favorite patient today?

20
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:29,666
Tomorrow.

21
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,668
How's that going?

22
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,170
Let's not,
richard.

23
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,172
I so wish to christ
you hadn't taken him back.

24
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,174
I took you back.

25
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,676
You think the synergy
escapes me?

26
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,178
You start treating
him, we start seeing
each other again.

27
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:43,680
Richard, richard.

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,681
No, seriously.

29
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,182
If you rea
lly want to know,

30
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:48,184
he had a rea
l breakthrough
last week.

31
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,686
Break- through what?

32
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:50,687
Somebody's jaw?

33
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:53,189
You're right, i'm
wasting my time.

34
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,191
Better i should
boycott with

35
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,694
the national
italian- american
foundation

36
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:00,697
and save the world from,
uh, what is it this week?

37
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:02,198
Um...

38
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,700
"gangster"?

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,703
The very idea abc would
even think of producing

40
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:09,706
that stereotypical
goombah- fest.

41
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:13,710
Richard, we're an
advertisement for the
american experiment.

42
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,211
We did great.

43
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,714
I'm so fed up with people
assuming i'm a thug.

44
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:19,716
Because my name
ends in a vowel.

45
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,218
Undershirts,
yelling.

46
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:24,721
Hollywood tries
to give these sociopaths

47
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:27,223
the tragic grandeur
of al pacino.

48
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,225
You know, he's an
expert at this, jen.

49
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:30,727
The guy's conning you.

50
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,729
Condescend to
me, richard.

51
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,231
It gets me so hot.

52
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:39,235
Tell me a little more abou
t this breakthrough then.

53
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,738
You yourself said
the guy's alixithymic.

54
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,740
You said nothing
's gonna get through.

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,242
Not if it threatens
that straw house
he's built inside his head

56
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:47,744
to shelter his
base criminality.

57
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:50,246
It really concerns m
e you don't see this, jen.

58
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:51,748
I mean, pink slip
this guy.

59
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,750
He's dangerous.

60
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,251
I'm gonna
pink slip you

61
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,253
if you don't get that
chicken in the oven.

62
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:01,758
Is that new?

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,762
Looks good.

64
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,763
Did you bring
your log?

65
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:09,265
My log?

66
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:10,767
Remember
last week?

67
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,769
You were gonna
keep a record.

68
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,272
I asked you to write down
any feelings of anxiety

69
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:19,275
or memories of past
anxiety attacks.

70
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,278
Yeah, my parents
and the pork store.

71
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,279
I know.

72
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,781
Yeah, that was...

73
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,283
interesting.

74
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:30,286
Have you thought
at all about that?

75
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,290
How do people
find the time?

76
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,292
To get well?

77
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,297
Look, my mother's dead.

78
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,800
I haven't had
a panic attack since.

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,302
You've gone months
without them before.

80
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:50,306
The conflicts that cause
them and your depression

81
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:53,309
are buried
deep inside you.

82
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,313
Are you happy?

83
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,314
Am i happy?

84
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,818
That's not even...

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,822
look...

86
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,825
i'm sorry i didn't
bring the list.

87
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,327
I'll bring i
t next week.

88
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:19,335
We oughta think
about bringing your
wife into this.

89
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:20,837
In here?

90
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,839
Carmela?

91
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,842
You're the one who
wanted to take a more
proactive approach.

92
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,844
That's not
in the future.

93
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,847
Let's talk frankly.

94
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:33,349
You demanded
more of me.

95
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,851
Fine.

96
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,854
But you're
not trying.

97
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:38,855
Yeah, i know.

98
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,857
The past.

99
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,862
But shit happens
in my daily life

100
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,864
that needs
attention now.

101
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,867
I've got some
genuine concerns...

102
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,369
about my son.

103
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,372
He shies away from anything
that requires effort

104
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:58,374
and i think maybe he
picks that up from me.

105
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,877
I mean, he's i
n football now, right,

106
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,379
but carmela's just as
guilty about this as i am,

107
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,381
'cause she indulges him.

108
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,885
Richard was right.

109
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,388
I've been charmed
by a sociopath.

110
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:13,890
Why didn't i listen?

111
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,892
Why, do you think?

112
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,895
Why did i reject a
good man like richard
in the first place?

113
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:22,398
If you think about my
life, it's so textbook.

114
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,901
Marry a man
10 years my senior,

115
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,905
of course richard's gonna be
protective and patriarchal.

116
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:32,408
Then i reject him
for being exactly that.

117
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,911
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to be safe, jen.

118
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,412
It's a bas
ic human need.

119
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,914
I know richard's right.

120
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,916
I should get
tony soprano--

121
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,918
oh, shit.

122
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,920
I always thought
it was that other
guy in the news.

123
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,422
Little augie aprile.

124
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:50,927
I can't believe
i revealed his name.

125
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,428
Why did you?

126
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,933
Does richard know
who he is?

127
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:00,436
I think he saw it
in my daytimer once.

128
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:05,942
That's why he's been
so adamant, because
soprano is very high up.

129
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:09,445
If he was just some
button man you wouldn't
be treating him?

130
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,448
Elliot, please, huh,
with the terminology?

131
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:13,449
Jennifer...

132
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,952
you know psychotherapy
is limited

133
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,954
in the treatment
of anxiety disorder.

134
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:20,957
Now, you've medicated
soprano properly,

135
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,459
you've helped him gain wha
t insight he's able to absorb.

136
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,463
It's time to send
him on to a behaviorist.

137
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,482
Janice!

138
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,494
Janice!

139
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,001
I was downstairs
cleaning up.

140
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,502
When did you
change the locks?

141
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:10,006
The minute that ukrain
ian dye job was out the door.

142
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:14,010
Don't mess with
the russians, janice.

143
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,511
That's all
i'm gonna say.

144
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,013
She can have
her leg back

145
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,015
when she returns
ma's record collection.

146
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:22,018
And don't say you wouldn't
have done the same thing.

147
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:25,521
I'm getting calls at
my house from her cousin.

148
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,024
Miss petrograd
carburetor
works of 1987?

149
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,025
I can't have it.

150
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,027
Don't fuck with me
on this, janice.

151
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:32,028
Give back the leg.

152
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,030
Tony, those records,
they're yours too.

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,531
It's sad that
you don't care.

154
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,533
Those old albums...

155
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:41,037
they're a window
into ma's soul.

156
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,541
In fact, i'm making
a documentary.

157
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,545
The world war ii generation
and their music,

158
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,546
exemplified by ma.

159
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,548
Who the fuck
are you kiddin'?

160
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,050
You're gonna sell them
on the internet.

161
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,052
I have work to do.

162
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,054
Yeah, right,
cleaning up
the cellar.

163
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,556
Good luck finding the lost
dutchman's gold mine, janice.

164
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,058
You'd make more money
working a real job.

165
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,061
Right, like the minute
i'm out of here,

166
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,562
you're not gonna h
ave contractors downstairs

167
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,564
tearing apart
the walls.

168
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,566
Oh, janice...

169
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,580
eh- eh- eh.

170
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,084
You finished?

171
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,586
I want to meet
my bud at the gym,
we're gonna spar.

172
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,091
You got a
girlfriend?

173
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,595
You know who's turning
into a little mink, though?

174
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,598
That meadow soprano.

175
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,101
Look at him
perk up.

176
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,603
I've known her since
we were kids, for chrissake.

177
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:50,606
Speaking of the royal family
i heard you did a stick- up

178
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,108
with christopher moltisanti.

179
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,110
I wanted to fly down to
south beach, see friends.

180
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,611
My mom wouldn't pay.

181
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:58,614
Don't worry, i'm not
gonna tell her.

182
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,117
Look, kid...

183
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:05,121
i'm trying
real hard here.

184
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,623
I know it's
tough on you.

185
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:10,626
I'm the guy that's
datin' your mom.

186
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:11,627
Datin'?

187
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,129
Don't get fuck
in' filthy about it.

188
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,633
Anyway, this...

189
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:21,137
was a good idea she had.

190
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,139
Us going
out to dinner.

191
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,640
Not that i think
one conversation

192
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,642
ever solved
anybody's problems.

193
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:30,146
I'm only here so i
don't have to hear
her bitching and crying.

194
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,150
The gym, huh?

195
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,658
Mind if i ma
ke a stop first?

196
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,668
My brother- in- law's
out of town.

197
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,170
He said you knew.

198
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,172
I get the bad
tempered one.

199
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,673
Bashir sai
d he told your man

200
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:59,175
that this month payment
could be late

201
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,177
because we had problems
with the trucks.

202
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,679
Three of them needed
new hydraulics.

203
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,681
Well, nobody
talked to me.

204
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,184
He said yo
u approved.

205
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,686
You're collecting on
my fuckin' routes,

206
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,188
you gotta pay
me a use fee.

207
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,191
They're only your rout
es because you say they are.

208
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,193
You want to question a new
jersey business practice

209
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:19,695
that goes back 70 years?

210
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,198
Hey!

211
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,699
What is all this,
ralphie?

212
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:26,702
I oughta stick
a shish kebab
up your ass.

213
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:30,206
Why do you
provoke me, huh?

214
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,708
This young buck...

215
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,714
he'll fuck your wife
until she moans.

216
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,717
You fucking wop.

217
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,219
You began it, huh?

218
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,220
The fuck you call me?

219
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,221
You bring my wife
into this?

220
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:46,722
Put it down!

221
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:47,723
Hey, mister,
come on!

222
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,225
Hey!

223
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,226
Ow!

224
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,227
Get the fucking bat!

225
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,231
You alright,
he get you?

226
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,732
Fuckin' asshole!

227
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:57,733
School this prick.

228
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,236
In the bread basket.

229
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,238
Good, kid.

230
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,241
Introduce him
to his desk.

231
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,745
You oughta take an
anger management course.

232
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:12,248
Fuckin' racial slurs.

233
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,250
Why are you doing
this to me?

234
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,259
That's what you
get for using
a baseball bat.

235
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:31,734
Let's go, kid.

236
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,751
Yeah?

237
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:49,752
Ginny?

238
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:53,255
Tony soprano.

239
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,257
Omigod, what's
wrong with me?

240
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,259
I'm a mess here
with the moving.

241
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:58,761
C'mon in,
i'll get john.

242
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,264
John!

243
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,768
John, get down here,
you got company!

244
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,771
Oh, look who's here.

245
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,273
The guinea
welcome wagon.

246
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,775
This is for yo
u, you piece of shit.

247
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,778
Carmela's bringing
something nice to th
e housewarming for ginny.

248
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,784
They call this
the great room.

249
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:24,286
I don't see
what's so
great about it.

250
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,788
It's mediocr
e, if you ask me.

251
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,790
We got a fucking
living room right
over there.

252
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,294
I didn't know you were
moving to jersey.

253
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:34,296
Ginny wanted to be
near her sisters,

254
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,298
and the schools
out here.

255
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,802
We were sitting with
carmine all night long,

256
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,805
you never once
mentioned you boug
ht a place in jersey.

257
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:43,806
It's not carmine's
favorite subject,

258
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:45,307
me living in jersey,
but it's what,

259
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:48,811
half an hour,
40 minutes
over the bridge?

260
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,813
Why didn't you tell
me you were moving here?

261
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,815
Why?

262
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,817
I gotta find out
second hand?

263
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:55,818
The fuck
do you care?

264
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,319
What do you work
in a toll booth now?

265
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,322
Besides i already
got the condo in
point pleasant.

266
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:02,825
You should hav
e fuckin' told me.

267
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,326
Ah, tony, i'm
telling you now.

268
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,328
This is strictly
a place for
me to live.

269
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,330
I got no intention of
stickin' my beak in.

270
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,835
I mean, there's our
family and then there's
the soprano family.

271
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, don't i ge
t to see the res
t of this shit hole?

272
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,843
Maybe you can help
me unstick this rain bird.

273
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:23,846
I'm a stranger in
a strange land out here.

274
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:39,361
Madonn',
look at this pair.

275
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:43,365
How many napoletans
does it take to screw
in a lightbulb?

276
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,368
There's only candles
in naples right now.

277
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,370
The cardinal of
the church controls
that racket.

278
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,372
That's a
good one.

279
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,875
You like it,
you have can have it.

280
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,877
Use it on
your paesans.

281
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,379
We don't have
those bulb joke,
they don't translate.

282
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,380
Oh.

283
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,884
Tony, i go get
a cappuccino.

284
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,886
Two thousand of
that is mine.

285
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,889
Fuckin' sand monkey
on 17, he's holding
out on us.

286
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,892
So, you treat his
brother- in- law to a
ride in an ambulance.

287
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,393
He said a very
bad word.

288
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,395
Lemme ask you
something.

289
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,898
Why would you take
jackie's kid on
something like that?

290
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:18,400
Somebody's gotta show him
how the real world works.

291
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,903
Kid's got a chip
on his shoulder,
23- years- old,

292
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,404
he's still
living at home.

293
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:23,906
So, he can keep an eye
on the pencil prick

294
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,408
that's banging
his mother.

295
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:29,912
No matter how nice i am
to that little bastard,

296
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:30,913
he still hates me.

297
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:31,914
Don't look at me.

298
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:32,915
I got a daughter
that age.

299
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,416
It's all
a fuckin' mystery.

300
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,918
Amen.

301
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,420
I was thinkin',
being a parent,
that's the hardest job.

302
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,422
It's harder than
this other
shit we do.

303
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,423
The garbage route,
whatever.

304
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,425
Like my first
marriage, my
kid, justin.

305
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:44,927
Ralphie.

306
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:46,428
I got some news
you're not gonna like.

307
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,932
I'm putting our friend
in over there as captain.

308
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,433
What?

309
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:57,940
No, no.

310
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,443
Fuckin' gigi,
are you shitting me?

311
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,945
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,948
This bullshit
with the arab,

313
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:06,949
so, i went over the top,

314
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,451
but i'll take care of
it on a people level.

315
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:10,953
You know this isn't
the first thing.

316
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,955
Well, then at least
tell the truth, ton'.

317
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:14,456
You want one of your
own people over there

318
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:15,958
so, he can spy on
the aprile crew.

319
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,959
Yeah.

320
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,460
But i shouldn't
have to.

321
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,964
You got some bad
tendencies, ralphie,
and i sympathize

322
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,966
'cause i got'em too.

323
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,467
But also, you're partnering
up with joe brooklyn

324
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,969
on that shit
at the port.

325
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,971
C'mon, tell me tha
t was a bum decision.

326
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,472
The bottom line
speaks loudest.

327
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:31,974
I'm earning my
ass off for you.

328
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:33,475
It's my decision.

329
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,979
Jesus christ, ton'...

330
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:40,482
i eat dinner
at your house.

331
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,484
This is business.

332
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,994
See?
Turned it off.

333
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:55,998
Since we last met,

334
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:58,000
i've been thinking about
your course of therapy.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,501
You're the doctor.

336
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:04,506
I think you're
ready to move on

337
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:07,009
to behavior
modification therapy.

338
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,512
What's that mean,
talk to somebody else?

339
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:13,015
Is this because of
what happened last time?

340
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,520
Look, i'm sorry,
but like you said,

341
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,522
it's hard to think
about that stuff.

342
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:23,525
It took me how long to
remember it even happened.

343
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,027
I realize that.

344
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,029
You know, you're
fucking unbelievable.

345
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,031
I ask you to get
serious in here,

346
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:31,033
and when it gets hard,

347
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,036
you pawn me off
on somebody else?

348
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,541
I'm just introducing
the idea.

349
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,543
Something for you
to think about.

350
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:45,547
I'm going to bring in
some things for you to read

351
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:49,051
about behavior

Yes, richard.

353
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,556
He was here
earlier today.

354
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:57,559
Yes, we talked about
behavior mod. , but--

355
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,564

356
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:06,568
Listen, i told you i would
discharge him and i will

357
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,071

358
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:12,574
Richard, look.

359
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,077
I'm going into the garage,
i'm gonna lose you.

360
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:16,578
I'll see you later.

361
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:26,088
Shut up!

362
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,589
Don't turn around.

363
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:28,590
I said shut up.

364
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,592
I got a knife,

365
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:32,594
Ah!

366
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,096
Help!

367
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,099
Get off!

368
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,600
Shut up!

369
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,107
I'll give
you all my money!

370
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:52,114
Shut up, shut up!

371
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,615
No, come on!

372
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:55,117
I'm gettin
g the panties off.

373
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,618
Stop it!

374
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,620
I'm gonna
fuck you, bitch.

375
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,621
No!

376
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,130
You fucking bitch!

377
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,635
Stop it!

378
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,638
Stop it!

379
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,660
She's almost done, we just
need a few more swabs.

380
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,664
Oh, for godsake, jen.

381
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:45,167
Richard.

382
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,173
You're alright,
you're gonna be alright.

383
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:52,674
I thought that i...

384
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,177
i broke my leg,

385
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:59,181
but it's just really
badly sprained.

386
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,685
Jesus, oh, god.

387
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:05,687
Bastard.

388
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,190
Did they tell you
that they caught him?

389
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,691
Thank god.

390
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,193
We apprehended somebody
with the description

391
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:13,695
at a popeye's chicke
n not far from the scene.

392
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,697
Of course, the jer
k is denying it,

393
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,199
but he had
her palm pilot.

394
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,701
Says he found it
on the street.

395
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,703
This is
detective piersol.

396
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:24,206
She's been great.

397
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:25,707
There's no way
to describe this.

398
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,209
It's overwhelming.

399
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,210
Of course.

400
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,711
The sonofabitch,

401
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:30,712
who is he?

402
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,214
Jesus rossi.

403
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,215
Rossi?

404
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,216
Lives over
in elizabeth.

405
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:35,717
28- years- old,
no priors.

406
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,719
Rossi, that'
s an italian name.

407
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,721
Am i missing
something here?

408
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,223
The girl said he was...

409
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,225
puerto rican
, that's all.

410
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:46,228
I just want to
take a shower, okay?

411
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:49,231
We'll be done
here soon.

412
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:50,732
Alright.

413
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:51,733
Mom!

414
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,235
Jason.

415
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:54,736
Jesus, mom.

416
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,739
What did these
lousy fuckers do?

417
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,742
It's okay, i'm
gonna be alright.

418
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:03,745
I can't believe this
shit, i'm gonna kill
these motherfuckers.

419
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:04,746
Jason--

420
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:05,747
fuck it, dad!

421
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:07,749
The whole worl
d is a fucking sewer!

422
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:09,251
It's nothing,
but a fucking sewer!

423
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,253
It's a bunch of animal
s out there running wild!

424
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,754
And they're
fucking winning!

425
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:16,758
Jason, the police caught
the man that did it,
it's okay.

426
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,760
I want five minute
s with that asshole!

427
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,262
Jason, this
isn't helping.

428
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,264
Your mother doesn't need
to hear this, so stop it.

429
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,765
Why don't you go outside
and settle down?

430
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:25,267
I'll be right out.

431
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,268
Go ahead.

432
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,776
Hello?

433
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,778
Hello, may i speak to
anthony soprano please?

434
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,780
He's not available
to the phone right now.

435
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,282
Whom may i tel
l him is calling?

436
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,284
This is jennifer melfi.

437
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:44,786
Is this mrs. Soprano?

438
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:48,290
Yes, it is,
dr. Melfi,
how are you?

439
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,791
Actually, that's why
i'm calling.

440
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,793
I need to cancel
tuesday's appointment.

441
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,795
Oh, he'll be
so disappointed.

442
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:55,297
Nothing serious,
i hope.

443
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:58,300
A little car accident,
but i'm fine.

444
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,301
Oh my god.

445
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,802
I hope they
had insurance.

446
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,804
You weren't hurt,
i hope?

447
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,306
Well, my knee got
the worst of it,

448
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:07,809
but i'll be up and about
in a couple of days.

449
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,311
Well, i'll tell him.

450
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,313
You stay off of it
, you take care.

451
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:12,814
Who ate the last
piece of cake?

452
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:14,316
Thank you, i will.

453
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:17,819
Thank you for
giving him the message.

454
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:21,323
That's gotta b
e some marriage.

455
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:23,325
Hello, kate?

456
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,826
This is jennifer melfi.

457
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,329
I know talking on
the phone upsets you,

458
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,332
but i need to canc
el our next appointment.

459
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,335
Tell him what?

460
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,837
That was
your therapist.

461
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,840
Why don't you just
announce it on wfan?

462
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,343
Go find some dust.

463
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,346
She was in
a car accident.

464
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,348
She has to cancel
your next appointment.

465
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,849
She alright?

466
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,852
She said she was okay,
she hurt her knee.

467
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:53,355
Her knee,
really?

468
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,357
What happened?

469
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:57,359
I don't know
, she didn't say.

470
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,863
I hope she don't
need stitches.

471
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:05,367
Stitches on the knee,
they never heal right.

472
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,369
It could leave
a very bad scar.

473
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:12,874
Any knee injury
can be very serious.

474
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:16,378
You can get arthritis
for the rest of your life.

475
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,880
Ask joe namath.

476
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,882
No, thanks.

477
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:29,891
Listen, last time
she mentioned that

478
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:34,396
maybe you would
come into my therapy...

479
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:37,399
give your perspective
on the panic attacks

480
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,401
and kind of...

481
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:41,903
our home life...

482
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:43,905
whatever.

483
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,909
Sure.

484
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,413
But not no
w, she's sick.

485
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,922
They call yet?

486
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:03,425
No, not yet.

487
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:06,428
I would've thought
they'd call by now.

488
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:11,933
They said they'd call wh
en they want us to come down.

489
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,435
Well...

490
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,937
the hell with it,
i'm gonna call them.

491
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,939
Where's that
detective's card?

492
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,441
They said
they'd call.

493
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,443
I don't wa
nna bother them.

494
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,446
I'm not gonna let
you just wait here.

495
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:26,948
I'm gonna call them.

496
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,954
Hello, hi,
det. Piersol?

497
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:34,456
Oh...

498
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,458
i'm on hold.

499
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:41,463
Oh, she is?

500
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,465
Oh, then maybe
you can help me.

501
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:44,466
This is
dr. La penna.

502
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,468
I'm calling for
jennifer melfi.

503
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,470
The rape.

504
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,972
Right, det. Piersol
was gonna call

505
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,975
when you were ready
for us to come down
for the line- up.

506
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,478
What, why not?

507
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:58,980
What's going on?

508
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,482
Well, why?

509
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:01,983
That's absurd,
that's ridiculous.

510
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:02,984
Richard,
what happened?

511
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:04,486
It isn't even piersol.

512
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,987
She's moved
over to juvi.

513
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:07,489
She never said
anything about that.

514
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,991
So, you just let him g
o, are you fucking crazy?

515
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:12,994
Yes, i do need to use
this kind of language.

516
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:13,995
Obviously...

517
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:16,498
i don't fucking care
if you're sorry.

518
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:17,999
Richard!

519
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,000
Fine, you do that.

520
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,002
You people haven't
heard the end of this.

521
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:22,504
I'm contacting
my attorney.

522
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:24,005
Asshole!

523
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,508
What happened?

524
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,510
They mishandled
the chain of custody,

525
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,512
so, they had to
let him go.

526
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:33,014
What chain of custody?
They let him go?

527
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,016
Somebody misplaced
the evidence kit

528
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,518
for a little while
or something.

529
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,521
I don't know what
the fuck they did,
those stupid idiots.

530
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:42,023
Did they just let
him out until the trial,

531
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:43,525
because i can
identify him.

532
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,527
It's a legal thing.

533
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,028
I think they just
have to let him skip.

534
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,532
That's impossible.

535
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:51,533
You must h
ave misunderstood.

536
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,034
Gimme the phone.

537
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:54,536
I want to call them.

538
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:56,538
I just told you
everything he told me.

539
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:59,040
Before or after yo
u started cursing at him?

540
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,043
Give me the phone,
i wanna call them back.

541
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:04,045
Alright, i'll call.

542
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:13,054
Det. Lindheim,
please?

543
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,056
Yes, i'll hold.

544
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,058
Now, it's not
even the same cop.

545
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,063
Hello, sergeant,
dick la penna again.

546
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:25,567
I want to apologize for
losing my temper, but--

547
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,570
could i please
have the phone?

548
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,071
Just a second.

549
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:37,579
Hello?

550
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:40,582
I'm sorry, i
don't understand
what's going on.

551
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:44,085
I don't know what you
people did but i
can identify him.

552
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,093
I don't know
what to say.

553
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,596
I'm stunned.

554
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:02,604
They...

555
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,607
they had t
o let him go

556
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:09,110
because they fouled up
the chain of custody.

557
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,113
What am i gonna do?

558
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,115
Well, you're gonna have to
have someone escort you

559
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:15,617
to your car at night.

560
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,619
What's that
supposed to mean?

561
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,622
That's what the rape
counselor woman told me.

562
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:23,124
Deserted parking garages
are where a huge percentage

563
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,126
of these attacks happen.

564
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:26,628
You think this
is my fault.

565
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,130
You blame me for w
hat happened, don't you?

566
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,633
How many times did
i tell you to call
the security guard

567
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,134
when you left
work late?

568
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,137
It wasn't late.

569
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,639
This isn't doing
any good, jennifer.

570
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,140
Let me tell
you something.

571
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,644
If i hadn't had be
en on the phone withyou

572
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:46,147
maybe i would've seen
that guy in the stairwell.

573
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:47,649
What?

574
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,652
You and your
fucking hard- on
about my patient!

575
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,654
So, it's
my fault now,

576
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:56,157
you should
've seen your face

577
00:27:56,157 --> 00:28:00,161
when you heard that that
fucking shitbag that rapedme

578
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,163
had an italian name.

579
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:04,666
What?
I registered surprise.

580
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,168
You were the one
who told the police
he was a puerto rican.

581
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:09,170
What differenc
e does it make?

582
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,673
Are you so asham
ed of your background

583
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,175
that any misdeed
by an italian

584
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:17,679
somehow damages
your self esteem?

585
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,681
This is so
misdirected.

586
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:23,184
The whole fucking world'
s about your self esteem.

587
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:26,187
Maybe you don't
have enough.

588
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:28,690
Jennifer, come on.

589
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,192
Oh, fuck you,
richard.

590
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,811
Jen!

591
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:45,206
So, how was ralphie,
with you over him?

592
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:46,708
He busts balls.

593
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:47,709
Cute.

594
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,211
Anyway, he played it
like it was his idea

595
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,713
to make me captain of
the aprile crew.

596
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:53,214
What else
is he gonna do?

597
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:54,716
Tony cut o
ff his gazzis.

598
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:56,217
Very prudently, ton'.

599
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:59,220
Not that you ain't
gonna hear mor
e about that later.

600
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,222
Most of the conversation
was about johnny sack

601
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,724
moving to jersey
and all that there.

602
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:06,227
Yeah, ginny sack told
gabriella she needed
a bigger house.

603
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:07,228
Ginny sacrimoni?

604
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:09,230
What she needs is
her own zip code.

605
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:12,734
New jersey's a small
state, she moves in.

606
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,235
She could
tip it over.

607
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:17,238
I like a woman you can
grab onto something.

608
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:18,740
You grab onto
ginny sacrimoni,

609
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,742
your fucking hands
will disappear.

610
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:23,244
She's so fat, he
r blood type is ragu.

611
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:24,746
She's so fat,
she goes camping,

612
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,248
the bears have to
hide their food.

613
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,251
When ginny hau
ls ass, she's got
ta make two trips.

614
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:32,754
Two guys could fuck
her at the same time

615
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:34,255
and still never meet.

616
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,758
Oh, johnny!

617
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,760
Fuck who?

618
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,761
What?

619
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,763
What's so funny?

620
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:44,265
Nothing, we're just talkin
g about one of the girls.

621
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:46,768
Is that all
you deadbeats
do over here,

622
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:48,269
is talk
about cooze?

623
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:49,771
When we're not
planting potatoes.

624
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,272
Welcome to
the garden state.

625
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:52,774
You want a drink?

626
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,776
I mean it, you
don't keep up with
current events?

627
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,778
What?

628
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:58,780
It's all ove
r 1010 wins.

629
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,781
It's right there
in front of you.

630
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,283
You fuckin' illiterates,
turn it up.

631
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:03,785
That's right, gary.

632
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,787
After years of planning
and delays,

633
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:07,789
there's finally
good news for newark.

634
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,291
Coming from the ba
nks of the passaic river

635
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,794
where today state
assemblyman,
ronald zellman,

636
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,796
held a press conference to
announce the release of

637
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:20,301
the first 25 million dollars
in state and federal
matching funds.

638
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:22,303
25 fuckin' million,
maddon' mia!

639
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:25,807
The time has come to return
the city of newark

640
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,309
and its waterfro
nt to its past glory.

641
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,814
By the year 2003,
this long- neglected
stretch of riverfront

642
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:37,819
will be alive with
condominiums, film
studios, and public parks.

643
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:40,321
A self- perpetuating
revenue base.

644
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,323
The 100 million dollar

645
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:45,326
newark museum of
science and trucking

646
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:47,829
will serve to
make this esplanade

647
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,831
the destination attraction
of the tri- state area...

648
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,332
and beyond.

649
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,835
This fuckin'
busted valise.

650
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,837
He's worth every
cent of his cut.

651
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:58,339
Fuckin' drywall
contracts alone.

652
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,341
Thank you very much.

653
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:12,854
Jen, can i come in?

654
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,863
I'm sorry.

655
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:27,368
I'm just so
frustrated.

656
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,871
We both are.

657
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,873
I just wanna go
find that bastard

658
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:34,375
and kill him w
ith these hands, jen,

659
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:36,878
and i could,
and i would.

660
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:39,380
But i can't.

661
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,883
They'd put me
in jail.

662
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:44,385
That's how messed
up things are.

663
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:45,887
I know.

664
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,896
You said satriale's
at one.

665
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,898
So, now you know
how it feels.

666
00:31:56,898 --> 00:32:00,902
T, i know why i'm here
and i apologize.

667
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,403
I won't let it
happen again.

668
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:04,906
Don't step in that,
that's my mother's flowers.

669
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:15,416
I fuckin' asked you to
watch out for jackie jr.

670
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,418
I specifically said

671
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:19,420
don't let the kid ge
t involved in this thing.

672
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,422
Now, i gotta hear about
some joint on campus

673
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,424
and jackie's
a part of it.

674
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:24,425
He only drove.

675
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,427
I said i was sorry.

676
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,930
But lemme tell you something,
t, he was an asset.

677
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,933
He pissed on the car
seats, but he handle
d himself very good.

678
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,935
No cowboy shit,
nothing.

679
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:35,436
Are you listening to me?

680
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:36,938
Leave him out of it.

681
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,940
The fuckin' kid
begged me for a taste.

682
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,942
He's the heir apparent.

683
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:42,944
I don't want him mixed
up in this shit.

684
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:44,946
I promised
his old man.

685
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,447
Oh.

686
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:47,448
But it's alright
for me?

687
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:49,450
I didn't say that.

688
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,451
What else
did you say?

689
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:51,953
That the life'
s good enough for me,

690
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,955
but not for little
lord fuckpants?

691
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:56,457
Look, he's not
suited to it.

692
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:57,959
He's not like you.

693
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,460
Like us.

694
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,965
Kids today,
they're bored,
they're spoiled.

695
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,469
Look, i promised
his old man.

696
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:09,470
What?

697
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,471
You promis
ed him what?

698
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:12,974
I don't know.

699
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,477
I was his best friend.

700
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:19,981
Don't bust my balls.

701
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,484
I gotta go make
a stop in nutley.

702
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:26,988
Come here.

703
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,495
I love you.

704
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,498
You're a good boy.

705
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,010
"Little lord
fuckpants"?

706
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,012
Whose moniker
is that?

707
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:53,014
I'm not sure
it is a moniker.

708
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,501
Hi.

709
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,004
C'mon in.

710
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,506
Jesus.

711
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,508
What's the other guy
look like?

712
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,522
Jesus christ, must'v
e been some accident.

713
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,024
What happened?

714
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,028
Oh, someone ran
a stop sign on
eisenhower parkway.

715
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,030
It was just on
e of those things.

716
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,532
I know a woman
with one leg.

717
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,533
Terrible
thing.

718
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,037
Last time we met,
we talked about

719
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,540
getting you into
some behavioral therapy.

720
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,544
I brought a couple of things
for you to look at.

721
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,016
"Feel the fear
and do it anyway".

722
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,019
You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

723
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,024
The title leaves
something to be desired--

724
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,031
it's okay,
it's just your...

725
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,534
it's okay, sorry.

726
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,035
Sorry.

727
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,038
You want me to...

728
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,540
it startled me,
that's all.

729
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,042
Maybe you came back
to work too soon.

730
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,044
It's better for me
to be busy.

731
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,546
Right.

732
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,555
I'm okay.

733
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,558
Really.

734
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,060
And i appreciate
your concern.

735
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,570
You see, that's what's wro
ng with the world right there.

736
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,573
An innocent person
is driving along,

737
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,075
minding their own business
and some fuckin' asshole

738
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,578
comes out and
smashes into'em.

739
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,083
You can't control
everything that happens.

740
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,585
But you can
get pissed off.

741
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,588
And then what,
lose control?

742
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,089
Who said anything
about that?

743
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,592
You direct your anger
where it belongs.

744
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,093
You have
panic attacks.

745
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,097
Panic occurs when feelings
of anger, revenge, whatever,

746
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,599
overwhelm you.

747
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,603
That's where behavioral
therapy comes in.

748
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,606
It can teach you to
control those triggers.

749
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,611
Then how do you get people
to do what you want?

750
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:57,615
You tell your
mother it's hers
anytime she wantsit.

751
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,618
How was your
cousin's shower?

752
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,120
It just sounded like
a bunch of screaming to me.

753
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,623
I was wondering
whose z24 was sitting
in the driveway.

754
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,124
What, did
you get a
new car?

755
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,626
Yeah.

756
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:12,630
Where did i put the sleeves
for that samovar?

757
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,633
You want anything?

758
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,634
Coke?

759
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,135
No, i'm set, ton'.

760
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,639
I heard about ralph
cifaretto, that he
got passed over.

761
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,640
You heart
about what?

762
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,141
Who?

763
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,143
I'm just saying, ralph,
that was probably
a smart move.

764
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,645
I mean, the more
i get to know him,

765
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,146
he's kind of
a cool guy, but--

766
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,648
this is none of
your fuckin' concern.

767
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,650
You told me you we
re gonna go to college

768
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,652
then i gotta h
ear from chris the shi
t i'm hearing about you?

769
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,654
Oh, you didn't
talk to chris.

770
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,655
Oh, shit.

771
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,656
That's right.

772
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,158
I promised your dad.

773
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,160
Don't make thi
s hard on me, jackie.

774
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,162
I already got one son
to bust my balls.

775
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,665
I'm home!

776
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,167
Ma?

777
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,670
Hey, jackie.

778
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,171
What are you
doing here?

779
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,173
I'm waiting for you.

780
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,178
What, i do
n't get a hello?

781
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,681
I need $200 for
november to put in
my student account.

782
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,683
You don't talk to
me for weeks, but my
money's still green?

783
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,685
I'm looking forward
to total independence,

784
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,186
believe me.

785
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,689
African- americans
go to columbia, dad.

786
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,190
Some of them
are my friends.

787
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,193
Friend, my ass,
under a blanket
on my couch,

788
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,695
watching television
with his shoes
off with you.

789
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,197
Meadow, when did
you get here?

790
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,208
See you later, jackie,
say hello to your mother.

791
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,711
Come into the city,
we'll do sushi.

792
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,213
Don't worry, ton',
i won't say anything
about the mulignan.

793
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,716
You just remember
what we talked about.

794
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,224
I'll have a chicken
avocado wrap, no dressing.

795
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,226
And a coke, please.

796
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,229
One number three,
dressing on the side.

797
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,733
Thanks.

798
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,298
Ah!

799
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,299
Excuse me,
wait a minute.

800
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,801
Let go of me!

801
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,803
Let the fu
ck go of me!

802
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,804
We don't want
continuation.

803
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,806
You give us leg,
and we go.

804
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,307
What leg?

805
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,308
Don't do
this to me!

806
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,810
Don't push me
to edge.

807
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,311
Repent on yourself.

808
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:15,813
Motherfucker,
do you know i am?

809
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,815
Do you know wh
o my brother is?

810
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,816
Mother what?

811
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:19,817
What did you say?

812
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,818
Motherfuck--

813
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,325
those records were
all i had to remember
my mother by.

814
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,827
What could they possibly
mean to her?

815
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,829
A few pennies?

816
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,331
Are you people
really so callous?

817
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,833
Fuck you,
you are callous.

818
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,921
Ah!

819
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,422
Oh, my god!

820
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,424
Help me, please!

821
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,425
Ah!

822
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,445
I felt such
a sense of relief.

823
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,449
I felt safe for
the first time
since it happened.

824
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,451
Empowered.

825
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,955
The vending machine.

826
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:41,458
My guilt for putting
myself in harm's way.

827
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,460
I read about that too.

828
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,963
That honeymooner
in gainesville, florida,

829
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,464
who rocked
a vending machine

830
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,466
and it fell on top o
f him and killed him.

831
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,970
The dog, though...

832
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,972
i don't know.

833
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,475
The forbidden part
of your psyche,

834
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,478
murderous rage.

835
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,482
Yeah, but at first,
i thought he was after me.

836
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,984
The door said "danger".

837
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,986
Actually, no.

838
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,988
It said,"high voltage,

839
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,991
"call n- j- g- e
before digging."

840
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,994
Jersey gas
and electric.

841
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,997
Was richard anywhere
in all this?

842
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:20,998
No.

843
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,501
Oh, my god.

844
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,003
The dog.

845
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:26,503
What?

846
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,005
A rottweiler, elliot.

847
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,008
Big head,
massive shoulders.

848
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,511
Direct descendants
of the dog used
by the roman armies

849
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,013
to guard their camps.

850
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,514
I didn't know that.

851
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,016
And digging?

852
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,018
Who do i dig with
and who's dangerous?

853
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,521
Who could i sic on
that sonofabitch

854
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,524
to tear him
to shreds?

855
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,027
Oh.

856
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,529
Lemme tell you
something.

857
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:56,533
No feeling has ever been
so sweet as to see that pig

858
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:01,538
beg and plead and
scream for his life.

859
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,042
Because the justice system
is fucked up, elliot.

860
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,045
Richard's got his
attorney looking
into this

861
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,047
at $300 an hour,

862
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,051
but meanwhile that
employee- of- the- month
cocksucker

863
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:18,055
is back on the street
and who's gonna
stop him, you?

864
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,059
Jennifer...

865
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,562
civilization--

866
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,064
oh, don't worry.

867
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:31,068
I'm not going to break
the social compact.

868
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:36,073
But that's not saying there's
not a certain satisfaction

869
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,576
in knowing that i could
have that asshole

870
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,578
squashed like a bug...

871
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,947
if i wanted.

872
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,593
What happened?

873
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,597
Janice.

874
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,102
I can't drive.

875
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,604
And they broke
three ribs.

876
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,606
What did i
tell you, hmm?

877
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:13,110
I told you not to mess
with those people.

878
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,613
I was supposed to be married
at this point in my life.

879
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,115
Yeah, so?

880
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,117
The man i loved died.

881
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,124
This is all
i fucking need.

882
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,626
Thanks, janice.

883
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,628
What?

884
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,629
What do you mean, what?

885
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,631
They slapped
my sister around.

886
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,632
Oh.

887
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,134
I'm gonna have
to get payback.

888
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,635
It's always something
with you, isn't it?

889
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,138
Every time i hear
your voice on that phone,

890
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,139
i know it's
gonna cost me.

891
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,141
Time, money.

892
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,144
You never do anything
to simplify my life.

893
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,147
I stole a woman's
prosthetic leg, tony.

894
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:54,151
When did i get
like this?

895
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,152
You really
want to know?

896
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,153
When richie died.

897
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,655
Till that time,

898
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,159
i was functioning
at a very high level.

899
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,664
I think there's on
ly one trajectory for me.

900
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,166
Really?

901
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,668
God.

902
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,170
See what i mean?

903
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,673
All this
soul searching, janice,

904
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,675
it's always
on my fuckin' dime.

905
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,677
I've hit bottom, tony.

906
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,182
But it's odd...

907
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:29,186
'cause i feel bo
rn again in the lord.

908
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,688
Hmm.

909
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,190
And i pray togod

910
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:39,196
and i asked him to forgive
svetlana for what she's done.

911
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,699
Janice, we've been
here before.

912
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,703
With vishnu and
richard fuckin' alpert

913
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,705
and the coyote spirit.

914
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,207
And you know what
it always spells?

915
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,708
Trouble...

916
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,710
for the rest of us.

917
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,213
So, put your fuckin'
clothes on.

918
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,216
Seriously, 'cause i gotta
get the fuck out of here.

919
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:03,220
I give myself
up utterly

920
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,721
and totally to god.

921
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,724
If this is the bottom.

922
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,227
If not...

923
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,229
you can go now.

924
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,230
Billing needs
to see you.

925
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,232
Follow the blue line.

926
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,246
Carmela...

927
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,249
gorgeous
as ever.

928
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,750
My god,
this house.

929
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,752
You already
got one.

930
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,756
Jesus.

931
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,258
Move to jersey,
okay,

932
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,260
but maybe take
a little bit of
a halfway step.

933
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,262
Fuckin' wife of mine.

934
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,772
Gentlemen, wha
t we do in life...

935
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,775
echoes i
n eternity.

936
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,278
He's fucking obsessed
with "gladiator".

937
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,280
C'mon, it's a great
fucking film.

938
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,782
Streng
th and honor.

939
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,284
Scotch...

940
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:08,785
and soda.

941
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,787
As long as you're on
the way to the bar.

942
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,289
Ball breaker.

943
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,291
J & b,

944
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,792

ace like this set john back?

946
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,797
Who gives a shit?

947
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,800
Fucking landscapin'
alone's gotta be
100, 150 g's.

948
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,302
And to keep
up this lawn.

949
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,804
Property taxes
, and you gotta
pay those.

950
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,806
Taxes.

951
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:32,809
Why don't they use the
money to fix the godda
mn air traffic controllers?

952
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,811
Fightin' terrorism,
that's what we should do.

953
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,813
How about that fucki
ng stampede in zimbabwe?

954
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,316
Fuckin' soccer game.

955
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,818
No assigned seating,
always a problem.

956
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,338
You're not usi
ng the cane anymore.

957
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,347
I've been...

958
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,849
making my list.

959
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,852
I even...

960
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,856
bought a little
notebook.

961
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,858
Good, that's good.

962
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,364
And i've been thinking abo
your behavioral therapy idea.

963
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,366
Maybe yo
u got a point.

964
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,868
I could use some help
with a few things

965
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,371
and if they can
help me there,

966
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,373

967
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:38,875
No.

968
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,377
You sure about that?

969
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,879
Because the last
couple of times,

970
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,881
i've been gettin
g the distinct feeling

971
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,383
that you were
giving me the boot.

972
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,894
Oh!

973
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,896

974
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,898

00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,419
Go sit over there.

981
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,421
We'll do this.

982
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,424
Go!

983
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:32,929
It's just my knee.

984
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,943
It's okay, go on.

985
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,448

986
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,951
