1
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,712
You got the
crescent wrench?

2
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,715
Fucking thing, nobody
ever puts it back-

3
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,252
oh, my god.

4
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,253
Oh, my god!

5
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,754
Tony!

6
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,756
Tony!

7
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,761
Oh, my god, tony,
are you alright?

8
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,264
Uncle ben.

9
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,266
What happened?

10
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,801
Hey.

11
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,802
What are you
doing here?

12
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,804
We had to
drive out here

13
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,808
'cause some schmuck st
the vcr from the common room.

14
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,312
"Public enemy",
this is a great movie.

15
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,813
For a class.
..just finished.

16
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,316
We're out of here.

17
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,318
40 grand a year to
watch old movies?

18
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,319
Who's "we"?

19
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,821
Just a friend
from class, okay?

20
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,828
Your mom
likes lavender.

21
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,830
I'll be ready
to bolt in a sec.

22
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,331
Mr. Soprano?

23
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,332
Yeah.

24
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,333
Hey, i'm
noah tannenbaum.

25
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,335
How ya doin'?

26
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,836
I appreciate you
letting us screen here.

27
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,338
Those bose direct reflectors
make all the difference.

28
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,340
You a film buff?

29
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,343
People say hawks invented
the genre with "scarface",

30
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,845
but cagney
was modernity.

31
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,848
Muni was not, so i giv
e the nod to william wellman.

32
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,852
Noah, i'm just gonna g
rab the "barenaked ladies" cd,

33
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,354
and then,
let's hit the road.

34
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,361
Last year this course
is being offered.

35
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,365
"Images of
hypercapitalis
t self- advancement

36
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,367
in the era of
the studio system."

37
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,869
So, you guys...

38
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,870
you and meadow...

39
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,372
are you...?

40
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,374
Little early to say.

41
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,377
What's your background,
noel?

42
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,878
Noah.

43
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm from los angeles,

44
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,381
west l. A.

45
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,382
What i mean is--

46
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,883
my family'
s in the business.

47
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,885
I mean show business
, i don't know why the
y call it "the business".

48
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,887
Those old
"tarzan" movies?

49
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,889
My dad's an
entertainment lawyer.

50
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,893
What i mean is,
we're italian.

51
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,896
My dad is jewish
and my mother's family
is african- american.

52
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,898
"Tannenbaum",
right.

53
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,901
But on your application
to columbia,

54
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,902
you didn't check
jewish, did you?

55
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,905
No, they can't ask abo
ut religious affiliation.

56
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,407
Oh, right, right,
of course.

57
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,908
What'd you check?

58
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,410
African- american.

59
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,412
So, we do understand
each other here?

60
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,413
You're a ditsoon.

61
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,414
Excuse me?

62
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,418
Uh, charcoal briquette,
a mulignan.

63
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,919
What's your problem?

64
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,921
I think you know
what my problem is.

65
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,423
You see, your little
friend up there.

66
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,925
She didn't do you any favors
bringing you into this house.

67
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,427
I don't know what the
fuck she was thinking.

68
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,429
We'll get to
that later.

69
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,431
See, i got business
associates who are black.

70
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,932
And they don't want my son
with their daughters

71
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,434
and i don't want
their sons with mine.

72
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:35,935
Fuck you!

73
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,438
See, that's the kind of thing
i'm hoping to avoid.

74
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,441
So, when my little girl
comes down the stairs,

75
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,443
you're gonna say how
nice it was to meet me.

76
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,944
Then you're gonna go
drop her off at school

77
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,946
and you're gonna
say goodbye.

78
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,449
C'mon, if you want to
see the garden state.

79
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,951
We're gonna drop by hunter's,
i want her to meet noah.

80
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,953
Then we'll be back
to pick up my laundry.

81
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,957
Later, dad.

82
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,497
I don't got time f
or these fucking attacks.

83
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,499
You were so good
for months.

84
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,501
If you didn't
instigate things--

85
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,002
i instigate?

86
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,004
He's just
a new friend, tony.

87
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,506
You didn't see the way they
were looking at each other.

88
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,008
You want her to be with
him, just keep it up.

89
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,510
Keep playi
ng the race card,

90
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,012
you're gonna drive her
right into his arms.

91
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,514
Not if i cut off
those fucking arms.

92
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,515
Stop it!

93
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,017
Let me deal with it,

94
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,519
if anybody's gonna
deal with it.

95
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,522
Make things wors
e with your bullshit,

96
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,023
i'm gonna
be really pissed.

97
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,027
I should
call cusamano.

98
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,029
You might need
stitches.

99
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,035
Yeah, if one
of my sisters

100
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,537
ever brought home
a fuckin' butterhead,

101
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,539
you know what my
old man would do?

102
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,048
Hey, ma.

103
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,550
Look who calls.

104
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,051
Actually, i'm standing
here in front of you.

105
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,553
Ah.

106
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,554
Hey.

107
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,056
So, how's it going?

108
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,058
What do you care?

109
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,060
Out of sight,
out of mind.

110
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,563
Brought you some
books on tape.

111
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,567
Since you say you can't
concentrate to read.

112
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,069
I wish the lord
would take me now.

113
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,071
Well, in the meantime...

114
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,575
brought you "the
horse whisperer".

115
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,076
Why, what's wrong,
tell me?

116
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,078
What, are you
gonna freak out

117
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,580
every time i try to do
something nice for you?

118
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,582
Jesus.

119
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,084
What's this?

120
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,088
She's going to
finish baby journals
from long time ago.

121
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,590
My idea.

122
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,093
Oh, yeah,
i remember these.

123
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,095
Carmela gave you one of these
for each of the kids

124
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,597
when they were born.

125
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,598
What the fuck?

126
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,099
Look at this.

127
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,102
Supposed to fill these out,
20 years, fat fuckin' nothing.

128
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,106
Now, look here, i don't
like that kind of talk.

129
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,108
Now, just stop it,
it upsets me.

130
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,110
Carmela's ma returne
d these books to the kids

131
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,112
filled with memories.

132
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,615
You can't write stuff
down from your life
foryour grandkids?

133
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,617
It's none of
anybody's business.

134
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,119
Yeah, you're too busy
feeling sorry for yourself.

135
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,120
She will do it.

136
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,123
It's good for her,
she realize that.

137
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,125
Keep her mind active.

138
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,128
Why do anything if there's
not something in it for her?

139
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,131
Alright, listen up.

140
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,134
I want you to concentrate,
i know it's difficult.

141
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,136
Remember the
airline tickets?

142
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,639
The tickets
were stolen.

143
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,641
Did you say that or
did the feds say that?

144
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,143
What did you tell them
when you were in the lockup?

145
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,145
What?
What did i do?

146
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,146
This is important.

147
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,148
They're trying to buil
d a rico case against me.

148
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,652
What are you gonna say
if they put you on
the witness stand?

149
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,153
'Cause the only reason
they let you go

150
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,655
is to get
your cooperation.

151
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,157
Don't wave
your hanky atme.

152
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,160
What are you gonna say
from now on?

153
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,664
I never stated those tickets
were stolen, capisce?

154
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,666
Now, barbara will testify
i didn't say it,

155
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,167
but you gotta
back her up.

156
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,670
I suppose i should've just
kept my mouth shut...

157
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,171
like a mute.

158
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,674
In the future, any kind of
deal they try to make,

159
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,176
you keep
your mouth shut.

160
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,182
You know, for a ye
ar, i didn't speak to you.

161
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,185
Maybe i should've
kept it that way.

162
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,689
Fuck it,
do what you want.

163
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,237
Did you say something
to noah?

164
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,740
If you're smart, you'll ke
ep walking down those stairs.

165
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,242
You did, what
did you say?

166
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,244
He was all quiet at hunter's,
she thinks he's a snob.

167
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,246
Now he's just
sitting out in the car!

168
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,748
What, you didn't
hear me?

169
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,750
Maybe if i say it
in swahili!

170
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,752
Meadow, can you
come up here please?

171
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:53,753
What?

172
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,756
I need your help
with this clasp.

173
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,260
That ain't our beer,
where'd you get this?

174
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,262
Well, it's good,
ain't it?

175
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,264
Is my laundry done?

176
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,266
You can sell ours
for the same price.

177
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,769
I can't help it if
i have to buy from them.

178
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,270
They tell me
the same thing
that you do.

179
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,272
Ah, you're yella.

180
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,276
Ah, please, you ai
n't gonna slug me, are ya?

181
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,302
What?

182
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,308
Uh, your mother died.

183
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,310
You're kidding?

184
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,815
I mean...

185
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,317
jesus christ.

186
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,819
Svetlana just called.

187
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,821
She said that...

188
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,824
after dinner, your mother went
upstairs to get ready for bed.

189
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,325
When svetlana came up,

190
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,828
your mother was under
the covers in her nightgown.

191
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,331
Svetlana thought
she was asleep.

192
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,854
Svetlana's waiting
for us over there.

193
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,355
She's dead.

194
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,858
I'm sorry, dad...

195
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,862
that your mom died.

196
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,864
Me too.

197
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,365
Your grandmother
loved you.

198
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,367
She loved
both you two...

199
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,369
very much.

200
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,410
They just removed.

201
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,412
We saw.

202
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,414
She was in no
pain, tony.

203
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,417
What about the cause
of death, did they say?

204
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,919
Massive stroke.

205
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,420
Yeah.

206
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,421
So...

207
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,423
she will not be
finishing journal.

208
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,425
I break promise
to you, tony.

209
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,427
Does not oft
en happen with me,

210
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,930
that these old one
s get away with something.

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,431
Journal?

212
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,433
Nothing.

213
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,438
Those "granny remembers"
books you bought her

214
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,940
when the kids
were born.

215
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,943
She never
touched them.

216
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,449
What's your beef?

217
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,952
Asshole robert frost.

218
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:13,953
How am i supposed to
know what this means?

219
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,956
Like i even care.

220
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,964
"Stopping by woods
on a snowy evening".

221
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,466
Oh, my god, i'm so glad i'
m not in high school anymore.

222
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,968
You read this?

223
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,969
Sure.

224
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,971
What does it mean?

225
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,473
I have to turn in a
close- read by tomorrow.

226
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,474
What does it mean?

227
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,476
"The woods are lovely
dark and deep,

228
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,980
but i have promises
to keep and miles to
go before i sleep."

229
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,481
Okay, look.

230
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,983
Where is he?

231
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,985
He's in a field
on a horse.

232
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,486
He's not o
n the horse.

233
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,487
The horse has bells.

234
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,488
So?

235
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,490
What kind of horse
has bells?

236
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,491
I don't know!

237
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,493
Just give me the fucking
answer so i can write this?

238
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,495
A horse that's
pulling a sleigh.

239
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,997
Oh...

240
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,000
so, this is
a thanksgiving poem...

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,002
like,"over the river
and through the woods

242
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,003
to grandmother's
house we go".

243
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,005
No, it's not
a thanksgiving poem.

244
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,007
What's coverin
g the field?

245
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,008
Snow.

246
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,009
Yay!

247
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,011
And what doe
s snow symbolize?

248
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,012
Christmas?

249
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,513
Hello?

250
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,015
Cold...

251
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,018
endless white,
endless nothing...

252
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,519
i don't know!

253
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,021
Death.

254
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,022
I thought
black was death.

255
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,024
"He has miles to g
o before he sleeps."

256
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,026
So, he must be far away
from his house.

257
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,027
The sleep of death.

258
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,029
The big sleep.

259
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,530
He's talking
about his own death,

260
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,033
which is yet to come,
but will come.

261
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,535
That's fucked up.

262
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,539
Gottago.

263
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,541
I thought
black was death.

264
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,044
White too.

265
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,046
I'm coming, i'm coming!

266
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,573
Grandma?

267
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,579
I just can't believe it.

268
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,081
What are you
gonna do?

269
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,583
I'll call janice.

270
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,085
I'll meet you
at cozzerelli's...

271
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,586
around noon.

272
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,588
I already called.

273
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,590
Ma didn't want any
kind of service, tony.

274
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,092
No remembrance at all.

275
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,596
So, we'll pick out
a simple urn or whatever.

276
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,099
I'll see you there.

277
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,620
Proshai livushka.

278
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,123
Which means what?

279
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,625
Goodbye,
little livia.

280
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,133
He's been in this situation
a million times

281
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,135
and has upped
the ante when needed.

282
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,636
Every time.

283
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,139
Let's see what happens
tonight, there he is,

284
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,140
he's pulling thatin.

285
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,641
He's got the...

286
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,644
ton'.

287
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,147
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,151
We all know...

289
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,153
how much
you loved her.

290
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,157
Thanks.

291
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,664
I could imagine
how you feel.

292
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,666
Yeah, well...

293
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,668
what are you
gonna do?

294
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,171
I'm sorry, t.

295
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,690
What are you
gonna do, you know?

296
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,694
At least she
didn't suffer.

297
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,696
Thank go
that's right. D.

298
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,203
My god.

299
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,705
What next, huh?

300
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,211
How is tony
taking it?

301
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,213
Oh, what the fuck!

302
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,214
Goddamn
fucking bitch!

303
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,716
She was so awful.

304
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,220
What do i tell my kids
when their own aunt

305
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,221
won't even come
to a funeral?

306
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,722
Take it easy
, i'll handle it.

307
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,232
And then he goes,"you gotta
work on columbus day weekend."

308
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,734
Eat your eggs, baby.

309
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,739
Ace garage.

310
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,242
You're not coming to your own
mother's fucking funeral?

311
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,744
May i speak?

312
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,246
You got your
sister sobbing!

313
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,748
May i speak?

314
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,251
Go the fuck ahead!

315
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,256
You may recall, tony,
that i have very good
and valid reasons

316
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,758
why i should not present
myself in the state
of new jersey.

317
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,261
Oh, jesus, that case is
colder than your tit.

318
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,263
It'd do you good to
show up here at this point.

319
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,764
Nothing to hide.

320
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,766
I don't do well
at funerals, tony.

321
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,268
Who does?

322
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,269
You just don't wan
t to get your ass

323
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,270
out of whatever
chair it's in.

324
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,771
I'm gonna hang
the fuck up!

325
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,273
She didn't even want
a funeral, janice,

326
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,274
but can't you come
sit with your family

327
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,775
during this
stressful time?

328
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,277
She was
your mother.

329
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,780
You can just get on a plane
before us working folk.

330
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,282
Oh, listen to this,
woody guthrie over here.

331
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,784
You know, they got special
rates for family death.

332
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,787
Yeah, half of
full fare coach,

333
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,789

this late date

00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,292
comes to $1, 100.

335
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,793
Fully researched
and everything, huh?

336
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,296
Alright, fuck it,
i'll pay it.

337
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,797
Can i bring
my fiancee?

338
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,798
Fuck that!

339
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,800
One seat,
coach.

340
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,302
And if you don't show up,
let me tell you right now,

341
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,803

breezing in here

342
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,305
when it comes time
to carve up the estate.

343
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,807
I know you think ma's got
money buried in the house.

344
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,813
What are you telling people
about that other thing?

345
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,814
Richie?

346
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,317
He vanished into the
witness protection program.

347
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,818
It's the truth,
right, janice?

348
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,820
Cozzerelli's
funeral home...

349
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,822
noon tomorrow.

350
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,824
Does harper know
his grandmother died?

351
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,825
Him i'll pay for.

352
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,328
Bring him down
from montreal.

353
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,829
He is your son.

354
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,332
Hal is on the pavers,
tony, he's um...

355
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,334
a street person.

356
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,336
I'm sorry,
i didn't know.

357
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,837
See, you're not the
only one with problems.

358
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,840
Be there tomorrow.

359
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,359
Ain't you got
a drink in the house?

360
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,860
I wish--

361
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,862
there you go with that
wishing stuff again.

362
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,367
I wish you was
a wishing well...

363
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,869
then i could tie a bucket
to you and sink you.

364
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,372
Maybe you found someone
you like better.

365
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,380
Oh, tommy, let me
make you a cup of tea.

366
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,382
Listen, ma, i came ove
r to give you something.

367
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,884
Here, take this.

368
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,387
And when you need
anymore, just say so
, i'm making plenty.

369
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,389
We don't want your money,
i'm taking care of ma.

370
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,890
On two bits a week?

371
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,392
Ma don't go to nightclubs
and she don't drink champagne.

372
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,393
How do you know?

373
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,895
I used to dance
when i was a girl.

374
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:37,896
Money don't me
an nothing to me.

375
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,398
No, i guess not.

376
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,400
But with no heart and no
brains, that's all you've got.

377
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,401
You'll need it.

378
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,905
Tommy, tommy!

379
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,908
Tommy!

380
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,927
His mother died
last night.

381
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,429
No shit.

382
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,956
Ton', i'm so
sorry to hear.

383
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,459
What are you
gonna do?

384
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,465
I know how you feel.

385
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,968
We lost mom
last year.

386
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,471
You remember?

387
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,986
At least she
didn't suffer.

388
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,488
Ralphie, i need to
talk to you...

389
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,490
albert...

390
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,991
you too.

391
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,993
Vito, have
a sfogliatelle.

392
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,996
Carmela,
she's gone.

393
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,501
C'mon.

394
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,012
Alright, who gave
the order to torch
one of albert's trucks?

395
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,514
One of the trucks.

396
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,015
Be quiet, albert.

397
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,517
Talk to him, he lit up
two of my dumpsters.

398
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,520
What's the matter
with you?

399
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,021
Both of you.

400
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,524
We're in the newspapers
every fucking week
with this shit.

401
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,526
My crew...

402
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,028
is in line for the raritan
township contract, okay?

403
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,031
This guy over there keeps
whispering to albert--

404
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,032
your what?

405
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,034
What did you say?
Whose crew?

406
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,537
You're the boss, you
get to put in anybod
y you want over the crew.

407
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,539
You're a captain, ralphie,
when i say you're a captain.

408
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,041
And i'm gonna turn u
p my hearing aid
so i don't miss it.

409
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,543
Oh, you're gonna
get cute with me?

410
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,545
With my mother
lying dead?

411
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,547
Raritan township,
the recycling manage
r over there, joe...

412
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,549
zachary.

413
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,051
He knows who's in line
for that contract.

414
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,054
But he keeps playing
footsie with albert.

415
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,057
The next minute,
he's threatening to go
to the epa, bust us all.

416
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,058
He said that?

417
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,064
Alright, fix it.

418
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,067
No- more- fires.

419
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,086
Dude, i'm gonn
a ditch spanish.

420
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,589
I'll meet you by
the trophy case.

421
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,091
How could we
possibly get busted?

422
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,593
Don't worry
about it.

423
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,094
The boys' room
behind the stage?

424
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,096
They never check
in there.

425
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,610
Mr. Soprano,
janice, barb, please.

426
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,612
Accept my condolences.

427
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,616
I'll use all my powers,
all my skills.

428
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,619
Don't go crazy,
i mean, you know.

429
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,122
Then we're not envisioning
any visitation hours for mom?

430
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,626
Well, you see, she
didn't want any service
of any kind.

431
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,628
I find that
hard to accept.

432
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,633
Is...

433
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,135
is she still down at
the hospital morgue?

434
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,637
We brought mom
here this morning.

435
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,639
She's downstairs.

436
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,145
There's gonna be a priest
or something, though, right?

437
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,147
Yeah, sure,
a priest, i guess.

438
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:53,151
What would that be?

439
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,653
You're not hav
ing a funeral mass?

440
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,655
And i'm not
trying to sell here.

441
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,157
Well, she was catholic,
but not religious.

442
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,160
I thought maybe
we'd have a shindig

443
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,163
at the house,
you know...

444
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,166
after, so the grandkids
could, you know.

445
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,669
I don't know.

446
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,675
I do know what
mom's wishes were,

447
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,176
but not to have
a wake or a funeral?

448
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,679
It makes us look like
we're unloving children,

449
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,180
not to mention
cheapskates.

450
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,181
Who gives a shit
what it looks like?

451
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:24,683
The woman
expressed her wishes.

452
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,685
I wish to honor
my mother.

453
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,686
There's a lot of things
i could say right now

454
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,187
that i'm n
ot gonna say!

455
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,196
What, you think we should
do something now?

456
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,199
When she was young, she used
to picture her funeral.

457
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,702
Alright, fine, you
want to do something?
Let's just do it.

458
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,203
Let's just stop
talking aboutit.

459
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,705
Cozzerelli,
you arrange everything.

460
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,707
The wake, the funeral,
you send me the bill.

461
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,209
I want you to know,
tony, that this all
won't fall on you.

462
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,212
I'll do a painting for
the overleaf of the program

463
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,213
at the service.

464
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,216
Motifs from the mexican
day of the dead.

465
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,719
Oh, one thing i'd like
to suggest very strongly

466
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,721
is at the house,
everyone gathers

467
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,724
and each one can
voice a remembrance

468
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,726
or a feeling
about mom.

469
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,729
No, no, i don't want any of
that california bullshit.

470
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,231
People can drink, they
can eat some gorgonzola,

471
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,234
they want to yak about ma,
that's their business.

472
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,751
No,"i'm sorry",

473
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,253
"my condolences",
nothing.

474
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,760
Actually
, that's good.

475
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,261
It's a relief you'
re not saying nothing,

476
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,763
you want t
o know the truth.

477
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,267
Everybody else,
all bullshit.

478
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,277
Here's the thing.

479
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,779
I'm glad she's dead.

480
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,282
Not just glad,
i wished she'd die.

481
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,284
Wished.

482
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,787
I had this court
case oming up.

483
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:12,791
She might have testified
against me, so...

484
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,795
when i heard she was dead,
relief flooded into my veins.

485
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,803
How do you feel about
the fact that your own mother

486
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,805
would have testified
against you?

487
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,307
Oh, c'mon, will yo
u listen to yourself?

488
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,312
I mean, is that right,

489
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,814
wishing her dead?

490
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,816
Is that bein
g a good son?

491
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,817
A good son?

492
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,318
Yeah, a good son.

493
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,820
I mean, bad sons...

494
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,321
bad sons, what?

495
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,824
They should
fucking die.

496
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,327
That's a fucking miserab
' disgusting thing to be,

497
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,328
a bad son.

498
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,830
I mean, your
kid up at bard.

499
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,331
He better be
a good son, right?

500
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,344
You know,
you're right.

501
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,346
Why the fuck shoul
d i be a good son

502
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,348
to that fucking
demented, old bat?

503
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,350
The fucking selfish
miserable cunt?

504
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,855
She ruined
my father's life.

505
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,356
Oh, yeah.

506
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,358
But he wasn't
her son.

507
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,861
What did she
do to you?

508
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,864
C'mon, that's a matter o
f public record in here.

509
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,365
We both know.

510
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,867
You don't like to
say it, do you?

511
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,369
Who knows if she eve
n knew what she was doing.

512
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,871
You're letting her off.

513
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,372
My uncle denies
it, you know,

514
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:34,873
that she took part.

515
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,374
Your uncle loves you.

516
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,876
I never said
he didn't!

517
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,379
Grown children often secretl
wish for an aged parent to die

518
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,382
and it's not necessary
for the parent to be

519
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,884
a witness for
the prosecution.

520
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,387
It's a taboo
thought, but common.

521
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,391
Particularly if the parent
has lost all capacity

522
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,394
for joy at
being alive.

523
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,404
So, we're probab
ly done here, right?

524
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,907
She's dead.

525
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,414
What's happening?

526
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,917
Tony soprano's mother's
wake is tonight.

527
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,920
Want me to
wear a wire?

528
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,924
Why not, you
need batteries?

529
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,926
Let's go right over
here to office depot.

530
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:39,938
Janice.

531
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,441
I'm downstairs!

532
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:47,445
Hey.

533
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:48,947
Hey.

534
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,950
Mom would want
a closed casket,
don't you agree?

535
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,451
Definitely.

536
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,454
They usually put a
picture on the casket,

537
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,956
what do you think?

538
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,457
Wow, look at that.

539
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,959
She's smiling.

540
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,960
She looks...

541
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,462
normal.

542
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,465
Maybe it was us kids
who turned her into
a freakin' sourpuss.

543
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,466
Maybe it was
one of us.

544
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,968
Oh, get--
get the fuck--

545
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:10,969
get off!

546
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,471
Alright, alright!

547
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,981
You know, maybe
you're right.

548
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,985
My shrink says tha
t all women are not cu
t out to be mothers.

549
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,987
Is that a slam at me?

550
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,989
No.

551
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,992
Look, if my father
was in the freakin
' "cirque de soleil",

552
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,994
maybe i would've
turned out like har--

553
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,996
hal.

554
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,497
This is fucking weird.

555
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:40,999
What?

556
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,001
None of my childhood
schoolwork or artwork

557
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,503
or anything, for that matter
is here anymore, nor barb's.

558
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,007
Get the fuck
out of here.

559
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,510
"Anthony soprano.

560
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,013
7th grade,
mr. Martino."

561
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,014
I had him.

562
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,016
"Why "fear strikes
out", by jim piersall

563
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,017
is a good book."

564
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,519
Take a look.

565
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,521
She only saved yours.

566
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,522
What are you
talking about?

567
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,024
Here's barbara's
communion certificate.

568
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,026
Here's h
er baby shoe.

569
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,527
Yeah, that's it.

570
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,031
Nothing of mine.

571
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,539
Everybody agreed
that i had

572
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,043
extraordinary
visualization skills.

573
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,047
Those pencil drawings
i did of grandpa.

574
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,550
They're good.

575
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,065
Ton', sorry.

576
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,070
Tony, i'm sorry.

577
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,072
He's disrespectful.

578
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,076
Thanks for coming.

579
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,080
Fucking motherfucking
pain in the fucking ass!

580
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,581
Could we not, huh?

581
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,083
With the tantrums?

582
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,585
For this shit, i miss th
e jet's first home game!

583
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,091
Are they sayin' when your
making ceremony might happen

584
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,093
now with this delay?

585
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,595
Stop asking
fucking questions!

586
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,098
Even if i knew
, i couldn't tell you.

587
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,603
Hit me, hit me.

588
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,609
Every little
bit helps.

589
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,112
Anything to get
through these events.

590
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,647
Hey.

591
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,654
What a fuckin' blow.

592
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,655
Not you too.

593
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,656
I'm serious.

594
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,658
What are you...

595
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,161
breaking the terms of
your house arrest?

596
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,163
I got a dispensati
on from the marshals.

597
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,665
She's my sister- in- law,
for chrissake.

598
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,170
My dad's very ill too.

599
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,674
Thanks.

600
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,676
Thanks for coming.

601
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,678
Tony,

602
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,180
allow me to expres
s my condolences

603
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,681
and those of
the eighth ward.

604
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,683
Thank you,
assemblyman.

605
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,684
I met your m
om once or twice.

606
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,186
That was...

607
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,688
a proud newarker.

608
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,692
Oh, hey, hey.

609
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,194
My sympathies, tony.

610
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,696
We talked about this
day, did we not?

611
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,702
You know state assemblyman
zellman, right?

612
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,204
From the
eighth ward?

613
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,205
Do i know this guy?

614
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:07,705
You bet.

615
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,207
Yes, we go way back.

616
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,208
How are yo
u, assemblyman?

617
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,209
Reverend.

618
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,218
Uncle jun',
you alright?

619
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,721
They're droppin'
like fucking flies.

620
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,725
It's all that
charcoal- broiled
meat you people ate.

621
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,227
Nobody told us
till the'80s.

622
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,229
I'm kidding you,
you old fuck.

623
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,230
What's the matter
with you?

624
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,233
Bacala said you
wanted to seeme.

625
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,235
I gotta talk to that
wife of yours first.

626
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,736
Uncle jun', c'mon.

627
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,739
This is a funeral, enough
of her soigne attitude.

628
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,253
What do you want?

629
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,255
I'm hoping that we can
use this sad occasion

630
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,757
to put bitterness and
sore- headed feelings aside.

631
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,261
I'll behave
how tony wants.

632
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,763
I don't want to
add to his stress.

633
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,765
There they are.

634
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:08,766
Hi, uncle jun'.

635
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,767
Hi, uncle jun'.

636
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,269
How's that surfboard
i gave you?

637
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,270
Ow!

638
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,771
Jun'...

639
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,274
tony's waiting.

640
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,785
Ralphie cifaretto

641
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,288
got word to me.

642
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,797
So, what does
he want?

643
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,299
He wants a bump
up to captain.

644
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,801
The kid's been a
top fucking earner

645
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,803
ever since that rat bastard
went in the program.

646
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,305
You can't deny it.

647
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,307
Ralphie's whipped richie's
crew into shape over there.

648
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,308
And three months
ago by you

649
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,810
the rat bastard was
the second fuckin' comin'.

650
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,312
Why do you
do this to me?

651
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,314
Because i'm the boss o
f this family, you forget.

652
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,815
I forget nothing.

653
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,817
Don't make me say things
to you we'll both regret.

654
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,320
Go ahead, i'm
fucking fed up.

655
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,323
Hey.

656
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,325
I'm on the street.

657
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,327
That's the arrangement.

658
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,329
Stay home, clip your
coupons, be a happy man.

659
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,331
Things are good,
i'll grant you that.

660
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,333
But this economy
is so robust,

661
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,335
you get credit for shi
t you had nothing to do with.

662
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,837
Fucking chinks
and housewives are
betting football.

663
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,839
You better
be finished.

664
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,864
Joe zachary?

665
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,366
Yeah.

666
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,867
Oh, boys,

667
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,369
no fires.

668
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,372
Tony doesn't
want any fires.

669
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,409
I ain't so tough.

670
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,416
Well, zach, what
do you think?

671
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,417
Can't say.

672
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,419
Well, we'll hope
for the best.

673
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,920
Doctor...

674
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,924
this is tom's mother,
brother, and miss doyle.

675
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,941
The lord bless her
and keep her.

676
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,946
The lord make his
face to shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

677
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:13,951
The lord lift up his
countenance upon her
and give her peace.

678
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,454
Amen.

679
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,465
Did you talk to her?

680
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,967
She's sure you said
something to him.

681
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,470
He won't discuss
it, he clams up.

682
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,474
Beautiful sendoff, t.

683
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,976
Thank you,
thank you.

684
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,989
I want to thank you fo
r all you've done for her.

685
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,492
She was much work,

686
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,994
but in the end,
she defeated me.

687
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,996
Anyway...

688
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,999
we're not gonna be
needing your service
s anymore, obviously.

689
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,001
I'll be moving
into the house.

690
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,503
So, if you could
just get your stuff

691
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,504
out of there
by this weekend,

692
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,505
i think th
at would be good.

693
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,006
I stay there
only during week

694
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,509
when my fiance has
his children with him.

695
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,012
Tony says i can
continue situation

696
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,014
until bill and
me find house.

697
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,517
See, tony should hav
e consulted me first.

698
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,018
I'm gonna be living
at 55 benedek

699
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,021
while we deal
with the estate.

700
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,023
Speaking of which...

701
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:29,527
my mom had this kind o
f extensive record collection.

702
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,530

Many of them w
ere in mint condition.

705
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,035
Do you kno
w where they are?

706
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,537
She gave to me
those records.

707
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,038
What?

708
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,040
She know i like
american show tunes,
so she give to me.

709
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,542
I didn't ask her.

710
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,043
But those are my
mother's records

711
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,546
and i feel ver
y close to them.

712
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,549
I don't want to make
trouble, but miss janice,

713
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,551
i feel i have to
respect her wishes.

714
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,553
Oh, c'mon.

715
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,555
This is just about
you bogarting those
discs for your ass.

716
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,558
Now, they're worth a fortune
to the right collector.

717
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,560
I will not
answer such here.

718
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,062
I want the entire
discography

719
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,065
back at the house
by this weekend.

720
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,573
Mrs. S.

721
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,577
How are you?

722
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,579
Sit down.

723
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,581
How's your mother?

724
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,583
You call her
every day.

725
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,084
Mom passed away.

726
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,085
Really?

727
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,086
When?

728
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,090
About six months ago.

729
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,093
Please giv
e her my regards.

730
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:40,598
Is she still on
that crazy diet?

731
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,606
I brought
you something.

732
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,107
Umm...

733
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,609
from my restaurant.

734
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,110
I don't know
if you remember...

735
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,612
vesuvio?

736
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,115
Mrs. S.

737
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,619
What's the matter?

738
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,121
After what my son
did to you...

739
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,124
how can i look you
in the face?

740
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,626
What did
he do now?

741
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,629
You don't blame him
for setting the fire?

742
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,131
Artie, what ar
e you doing?

743
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,133
C'mon, we have
people arriving.

744
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,135
Let'sgo.

745
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,137
Thank you
so much.

746
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,639
Thank you.

747
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,145
Look at her.

748
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,648
She's already
becoming a robot
like the rest of us.

749
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,150
I'm so sorry
about your
grandma.

750
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,652
At least she
didn't suffer.

751
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,154
All her innocence
is gone.

752
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,664
...comes to that point
in the service

753
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,666
where the rabbi's
supposed to extol

754
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,167
the virtues of
the deceased.

755
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:54,171
The rabbi says,
"alas, i did not know
this man, i'm new here.

756
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,674
You all knew him, you say
something good about him."

757
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,175
Dead silence.

758
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,677
Goes on for about a
minute, two minutes.

759
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:03,681
Finally, a voice
from the back,"his
brother was worse."

760
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,197
I'm walking ou
t with the provolone.

761
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,200
And i think he think
s i smell like that.

762
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,207
This "survivor"
show...

763
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,711
somebody should find winne
r, stick a pistol in the face,

764
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,713
and say,"you not
gonna survive this

765
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:39,216
unless you give me
25 percent of that
fucking million dollars."

766
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,718
That's not bad.

767
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,219
We could find ou
t where they live.

768
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,722
"See how good
you survive this,

769
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:45,222
you pezzo di merda."

770
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:50,227
Everyone, please, may
i have your attention?

771
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,731
At this time, we would
like to ask you all

772
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,233
to join us in
the great room.

773
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,236
Form a circle, sit anywhere,
the floor, whatever.

774
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,239
Get comfortable, so th
at we can all be together

775
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,243
and share a remembranc
e or a feeling about the woman

776
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,245
who has brought us
all here today.

777
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,246
Goddamnit.

778
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,748
Please, everyone
join us.

779
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,252
Paulie gualtieri,
join us please?

780
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,257
Thank you.

781
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,262
What the fuc
k did i say, hmm?

782
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:31,268
If you'd rather, i
can invite them all
back to her place.

783
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,771
Janice, what are
you doing?

784
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,272
Very good.

785
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,775
We could all take a break
from eating for five minutes,

786
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,777
it won't killus.

787
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,279
Most of you will
probably remember

788
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,782
that this was
her favorite song.

789
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,786
I thought it might
help us get rolling.

790
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,349
Herman? Rabkin?

791
00:45:57,354 --> 00:46:00,858
You two went back,
almost to the pyramids.

792
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,361
I...

793
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,865
i guess what
struck me most was...

794
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,368
she didn't mince words.

795
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,880
Between brain and mouth,
there was no interlocutor.

796
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,394
Anthony jr.

797
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,398
I don't know
what to say.

798
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,900
Ah, c'mon.

799
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,902
Lay off him,
janice, move on.

800
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,907
She was my best friend.

801
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,917
If anybody
died or was
in the hospital,

802
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:04,421
i could be sure
i'd get a call from
lee letting me know.

803
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,431
Thank you, fanny.

804
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,432
Thank you.

805
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,941
Okay.

806
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,443
What's good
for the goose...

807
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,949
well, most of you will
probably remember that i have

808
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,451
an extraordinary
visual sense.

809
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,455
When i was a child,

810
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,458
my mother didn't let me
rest on those laurels.

811
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,962
She didn't flatter me.

812
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:51,969
She believed that wild
flowers blossomed best...

813
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,971
among the rocks.

814
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,973
With little water.

815
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,475
She was tough.

816
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:02,479
But she was right.

817
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,484
And she's the reason
i make videos today.

818
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:16,994
Tony?

819
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,498
Maybe you'd like
to tell them...

820
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:25,502
how ma saved all your
childhood schoolwork
and varsity letters

821
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,006
and none of mine
or barbara's?

822
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,009
You just did.

823
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,511
Wrap it up,
janice.

824
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,521
I hear she
didn't suffer.

825
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,025
For that we can
be grateful.

826
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:51,528
Thank you.

827
00:48:54,531 --> 00:49:00,537
They say there's no two people
on earth exactly the same.

828
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,041
No two faces.

829
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,044
No two sets of
fingerprints.

830
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:10,047
But do they know
that for sure?

831
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:13,550
'Cause they would
have to get everybody

832
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,553
together in
one huge space.

833
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,055
And obviously,
that's not possible,

834
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,556
even with computers.

835
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,561
Not only that,
they'd have to get
all the people

836
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,562
who ever lived,

837
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,064
not just the ones now.

838
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,066
So, they got no proof.

839
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,567
They got nothing.

840
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,081
Hey.

841
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,088
So, ton',
she's dead.

842
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,090
What?

843
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,594
I guess our
little secret...

844
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,598
dies with her.

845
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,115
Hey, pick that up!

846
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,117
What am i doing
out here?

847
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:23,620
Everybody's in there
telling stories of her.

848
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,122
I got a beaut!

849
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,123
Artie.

850
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,127
Artie!

851
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,629
Artie, don't
talk about that!

852
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,631
Mrs. Soprano may
have passed,

853
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,133
but who's to say there
isn't another mrs. Soprano

854
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,136
just like her
or will be?

855
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:43,140
Maybe not with
the same fears and
paranoia, but...

856
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,142
the same.

857
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,148
What i'm saying is...

858
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,158
thank you, chris.

859
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,160
Thank you.

860
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,668
Umm...

861
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,673
this is such a
crock of shit.

862
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,175
Carmela.

863
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,676
I'm sitting here thinkin
g i should protect my children

864
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,179
from the truth about their
grandmother on the one hand.

865
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,181
On the other, i'm
saying to myself,

866
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,683
what kind of example
am i setting?

867
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:32,189
Evading and smiling,
passing out cheese puffs...

868
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,692
over a woman that we all k
was terribly dysfunctional!

869
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,195
Who spread no cheer.

870
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,696
At all.

871
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,697
Carmela, be quiet.

872
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,199
This is my house!

873
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,200
I'm leaving.

874
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,701
Let her talk.
Sit down!

875
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,203
I'll speak
if i want!

876
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,704
Goddamnit,
who are you,

877
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,706
minister of
propaganda?

878
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:53,210
We suffered for
years under the
yoke of that woman.

879
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,211
Years!

880
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,713
She estranged us
from our own daughter.

881
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,717
Ruined i don't know how
many goddamn christmases,

882
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,219
i don't want to
even begin to count.

883
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,220
Hugh.

884
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,721
Don't hand me that!

885
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,223
Bullshit!

886
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,226
You wanted it,
you got it.

887
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,729
Here, here.

888
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,234
From beyond
the grave even.

889
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,238
This is a woman who
didn't want a funeral.

890
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:25,742
You all, her children,
you ignored her wishes.

891
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:29,246
Only after she's
dead, by the way.

892
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,750
She didn't
want a funeral.

893
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,253
She didn't want
a remembrance
of any kind.

894
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,754
Why?

895
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:41,258
She didn't think
anybody would come.

896
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,764
She wouldn't write down her
memories for her grandchildren

897
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,767
because she figured nobody
loved her enough to read them.

898
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,273
She knew there
was a problem.

899
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:15,292
Um, there's desserts...

900
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,795
in the dining room
if anybody wants some.

901
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,300
Yes, um...

902
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,803
and they're all
from vesuvio.

903
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,807
Our new pastry chef,
bobby vasquez.

904
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,809
Thanks.

905
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,820
Mike's here.

906
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,822
He's come
to see you.

907
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:49,826
You must like mike
a lot better than me.

908
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:54,831
No, no, tommy boy,
you're my baby.

909
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,334
You're going to get
well and strong.

910
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,336
All of us
together again.

911
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:04,841
I'm almost glad
this happened.

912
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,855
Yeah, this is mike.

913
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,358
When?

914
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,360
You were?

915
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,361
Fine.

916
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:25,862
Ma, they're
bringing tom home.

917
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,364
They are, when?

918
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,365
Right now,
he's on his way.

919
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:29,866
Oh, it's wonderful.

920
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,868
I'll get his
room ready.

921
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,871
I knew my baby
would come home.
