1
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,930
# When I was a child
I had a fever #

2
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:04,731
# My hands felt like just
two balloons #

3
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:16,668
What are you doing up
so early?

4
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,371
I couldn't sleep.

5
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:28,814
- You want breakfast?
- Yeah, all right.

6
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,683
- Anthony.
- What?

7
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,418
I am making
french toast.

8
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,122
I'm not hungry. Jesus, how
many times you gonna ask me?

9
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,859
You've heard the term comfort food.
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

10
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:42,495
I know this is hard
for you to believe,

11
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,930
but food may not be
the answer to every problem.

12
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,867
- Neither is acting like a whiny little bitch.
- Tony.

13
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,436
I'll eat at work,
okay?

14
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,438
My shitty-ass
pizza job.

15
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:55,273
If it's so horrible,
take a day off.

16
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,944
My fiancee left me.

17
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:00,946
That job is all I have
in my life.

18
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:04,350
It's better to have loved
and lost, AJ.

19
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:07,386
- What?
- It is.

20
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:20,566
I feel bad for him,
but what the fuck?

21
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,034
Why's he gotta
take it out on us?

22
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,175
I'm looking
for a miter saw.

23
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:32,812
I got the Makita, carbide
blade, laser guide.

24
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,348
- Lists for $600... $200.
- Sold.

25
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,317
- Mike, you got that? The Makita.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,686
Cheese it.
It's the off-duty cops.

27
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:44,056
- You know my son-in-law Chris,
the movie producer? - How you doing?

28
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,258
- Let me know about that ticket.
- It's squashed, forget it.

29
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:49,595
Thanks. How you doing?
How's my little girl?

30
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,665
- Good. You coming Sunday, right?
- Yeah. 2:00, she said.

31
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:56,602
For you. Tell your friend Paulie
to keep these power tools coming.

32
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,776
Madonn', those fucking belt
sanders flying off the shelves, huh?

33
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,778
You ain't seen this
many cops lined up

34
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,047
since the centennial
of Dunkin' Donuts.

35
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,715
They're all handymen.

36
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:13,018
They got side jobs so they can
afford those 18-foot bass boats.

37
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,355
Cataldo, that state trooper, he's
putting a drop ceiling in my basement.

38
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,657
Thanks, sweetie.

39
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:22,428
12k in there.
I took my cut.

40
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm seeing Al again
next week.

41
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,100
- To business.
- You're gonna jinx me? Toast with water?

42
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,970
It's club soda.
What's your problem?

43
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,507
You got the problem, my friend.
You're a real fucking drip lately.

44
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,909
When I was using,
I was a disgrace.

45
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,378
Now I'm sober, and I'm a drip.
The fuck you want from me?

46
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,847
How's about being normal?
That so fucking hard?

47
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,350
Actually, yeah, Paulie,
for some of us it is.

48
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,720
Don't get cunty.
I'm breaking your balls.

49
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,659
What do you say
we take a ride?

50
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,328
Little prime rib?
On me.

51
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,100
- Maybe next time.
- What are you, watching your cholesterol now, too?

52
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:04,437
Yeah, you're fucking
hilarious.

53
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,090
Hey, Tony.
What's the good word?

54
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:27,159
- Can't complain.
- Sure you could. Phil Leotardo.

55
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,565
My first assignment out of
the academy was in Brooklyn.

56
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,600
Never cared for him.

57
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,937
He tried to set up this other
rookie, female, for rape and beating.

58
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,477
Listen, that subject
we talked about...

59
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,346
If I was
to know something

60
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,882
possibly terror-related

61
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,350
and help you out,

62
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,186
could I bank the
resulting goodwill?

63
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:56,722
Well...

64
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,991
What happens is

65
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,527
I would personally write you
what's called a 5k letter.

66
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,097
It's a document setting forth
your cooperation and service.

67
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,099
Is letter would be
placed in your file

68
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,902
and if you were ever
convicted of a crime...

69
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,173
It'd be presented
to a judge when he or she

70
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:17,576
would be considering
sentencing guidelines.

71
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,884
Well, there were
a couple of guys,

72
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,753
I don't know, arabs,
arabians maybe.

73
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,222
They used to hang around
the Bing,

74
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,391
and somebody I knew

75
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,161
may have did some
business with them.

76
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,030
At the port?

77
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,668
- You were saying.
- The point is they used to be around all the time,

78
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,770
these two,
you know, drinking

79
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,006
and trying to tit-fuck
the girls, whatever.

80
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,908
And then suddenly,
they disappeared,

81
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,444
and I mean completely.

82
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,846
And then a week or so ago
I'm driving, and I see 'em

83
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,450
with these other guys,

84
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,951
they had the headgear
and the beard

85
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,687
and the whole
fundamental bit.

86
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,858
But there's nothing
illegal there, right?

87
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,427
What were they doing?

88
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,863
Walking.

89
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,699
But then they meet up
with this other group.

90
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,768
I don't know.
It seemed...

91
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,371
You got a name?

92
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,206
One was Ahmad

93
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,875
or Jamali...

94
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,214
Hold on, hold on.

95
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,224
Hey, T.

96
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,226
Yeah, I'm here
with some people,

97
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,561
and, uh... The arabs from the
Bing. What were their names?

98
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,997
- Some people?
- Exactly.

99
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,835
Oh, fuck, yeah,
Ahmed and Mohammed.

100
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,305
- What did they do?
- Ahmed and Mohammed.

101
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,574
You know, actually,
I got a cell number.

102
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,911
I called him recently, but
he don't answer no more.

103
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,415
Ahmed Al Najafi.

104
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,186
973-555-0146.

105
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,422
Ahmed Al Najafi.

106
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,960
Tell me they're not gonna blow up
the chemical plant or some shit.

107
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,130
I don't know.
I'll call you later.

108
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,436
- Cell phone.
- That's a real prize.

109
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,770
Thank you.

110
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,542
So finally I said,
"okay, you know,

111
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,544
as long as you don't
mind yesterday's pizza.

112
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,679
"No, no", he said,
"It's cool.

113
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,248
"So great," I told him.
"Come back tomorrow."

114
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,884
You are so bad.

115
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,353
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

116
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,454
- I'll add you overtime?
- Yeah, thank you.

117
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,894
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Some guy.

118
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,830
What are you,
going out with him?

119
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,666
He smiled, Anthony.
He works here.

120
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,702
- You gotta stop.
- Or what?

121
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,404
Or I won't
see you again.

122
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,539
Oh, like meeting me for
coffee is such a big deal.

123
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,908
Honestly, I don't even think
it's a good idea anyway.

124
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,410
How come?

125
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:08,314
'Cause last time you started crying
and had to leave the Starbucks.

126
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,021
I can't sleep at night
without you.

127
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,125
It'll get better, okay?

128
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,495
I love you so much.

129
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,597
I gotta go back
to work.

130
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:28,167
Stop.
You're embarrassing me.

131
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,847
You knock off early,
we go back to your place,

132
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:44,250
christen those new sheets
you were telling me about.

133
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,252
A man with a plan,
huh?

134
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,355
The man with the erection.

135
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,595
Let me take this.

136
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,330
Hey.

137
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:02,134
It's me. I need you to come home. It's AJ.

138
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,303
- What happened?
- I am worried, Tony.

139
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,272
I have never seen him
like this.

140
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,475
I'm supposed to meet the
realtor to see a new property,

141
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,278
- but I am afraid to leave him alone.
- Afraid, why?

142
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,546
Will you just
come home, please?

143
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:22,822
Go away.

144
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,558
It's me.

145
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,562
What's the matter?

146
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,236
- What happened?
- You know what happened.

147
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,804
Blanca still.

148
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,609
All right, that's it.
Enough's enough.

149
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:46,178
Look, I'm fucking
depressed, okay?

150
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,081
You broke up. How long
you want to cry about it?

151
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,083
She was my life.

152
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,386
You're 20 years old.
You barely have a life,

153
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,388
and you're better off
anyway.

154
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,991
She was cute, okay, but come on.
With another guy's kid to boot.

155
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,594
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

156
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,172
What you're going through,

157
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,541
what you're feeling
right now...

158
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,044
It happens sometimes.

159
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,480
Everybody gets the blues.

160
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,683
There's a half-a-billion-dollar
industry devoted to it.

161
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,185
What, Prozac?

162
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,355
No, the music business.

163
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,224
They write thousands
of songs about this shit.

164
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,993
"Tears on my pillow,"

165
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,662
"Mona Lisa," right?

166
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,502
Listen,
these fucking women,

167
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,006
they'll drive you nuts with
your emotions and whatnot.

168
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,843
And I know it feels like you're
never gonna love anybody again.

169
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,746
But trust me, there's
millions of girls out there

170
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,548
that are dying
to meet a guy like you.

171
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,318
- I see 'em every day.
- Oh, right, I'm so special.

172
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,655
You're damn right you are.
You're handsome and smart

173
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,356
and a hard worker,

174
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,493
and let's be honest...
white.

175
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,995
That's a huge plus
nowadays.

176
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,599
Go out
and get a blowjob.

177
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,535
I don't want a blowjob.

178
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,937
Keep your voice down.

179
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,339
Why?

180
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,575
- Who's listening out there?
- Nobody.

181
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,378
Oh, fuck me!

182
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,613
You saw her again,
didn't you?

183
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,950
I knew it.

184
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,618
I don't wanna talk
about it.

185
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,288
I love you, Anthony. It's
killing me to see you like this.

186
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,191
What's the fucking point?

187
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,764
- Point of what?
- Just leave me alone.

188
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,882
Honestly, I was glad
when they broke up.

189
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,651
The culture divide...
But now...

190
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,653
Everything turns to shit.

191
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,827
Hi.

192
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,329
- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- Sure.

193
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,331
I'm so nervous cooking
for all these people.

194
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,501
- Dad, do you remember Tony's sister Barbara?
- Of course.

195
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,904
- Hi, nice to see you.
- Her husband Tom, Stefan, Alyssa.

196
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,439
- Hi, this is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

197
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,340
And the baby.

198
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,076
Oh, come in.
Come in.

199
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,446
- Oh, look at that baby.
- Smile for grandma.

200
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,349
- Can I play the Xbox?
- What happened to folding the napkins?

201
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,756
- How you holding up?
- I'm totally freaking.

202
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,926
I gotta take
the ziti out.

203
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,141
You okay, T?

204
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,511
- You having a good time?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,714
So it could be good. Got
a lot of money in this.

206
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,486
Oh, look at that
wrist action.

207
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,621
All those years
yanking it

208
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,524
finally starting
to pay off.

209
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,926
That non-alcoholic shit
any good?

210
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,163
It's all right.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,303
Less filling,
tastes like ass.

212
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,309
This is nice.

213
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,311
About time you invited
everybody over.

214
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,247
It was Kelli's idea.

215
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,516
She's been wanting to get her
teeth wet with the entertaining.

216
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,651
Good thing,
else I'd never see you.

217
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,386
What are you
talking about?

218
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,822
- Steak's done.
- You think so?

219
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,058
It keeps cooking even
if it's off the flame.

220
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,827
The juices.

221
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,999
So what's up
with you?

222
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,367
You've been
like a ghost lately.

223
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,335
You're around one second,
next thing you're gone.

224
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,938
- I was by the Bing the other day.
- For, like, five minutes.

225
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,175
You know, you of all people
should understand how hard it is

226
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,177
for me to be
around that place.

227
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,046
- I should? Why?
- 'Cause you're in therapy.

228
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,383
You understand the human
condition, at least.

229
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,387
Still doing that?

230
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,756
Turn those ribs.

231
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:26,525
Truth is, between the booze
and the strippers over there,

232
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,527
half of them
are fucking cokeheads.

233
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,563
It's hard, you know?

234
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,532
And Satriale's,
that fridge full of beer.

235
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,468
You know how tough it is
to eat a sausage and peppers

236
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,802
without a cold one?

237
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,305
So then just quit. You
want a beer, too bad.

238
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,374
- Show some balls.
- I got balls.

239
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,476
I can't eat eggplant no
more 'cause of my stomach.

240
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,544
Might put me
into a relapse.

241
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,314
Now believe me,
I'd like to, but I don't.

242
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,616
It's not that simple.

243
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,852
- Well, make it simple.
- It's a disease.

244
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,588
I inherited it. You know
the problem with my mother.

245
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,093
I gotta be honest.
This whole disease concept,

246
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,795
I think it's bullshit.

247
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,997
So you know more than
the leading scientists now?

248
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,566
- I know a crutch when I see it.
- So my dad?

249
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,935
You obviously must have
knew he had a crutch.

250
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,939
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Come on, Ton', huh?

251
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,841
Between the coke,
the vodka,

252
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,310
whatever the fuck else he
was squirting up his arm...

253
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,080
Let's be honest about the
great Dickie Moltisanti:

254
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,183
my dad, your hero,

255
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,085
wasn't much more
than a fucking junkie.

256
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,004
- Hey, don't fucking move!
- Whoa, whoa, Al, whoa, whoa.

257
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,606
- Easy easy.
- What the fuck is going on?

258
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,276
Paulie, remember?
Germani.

259
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,278
We met at your
granddaughter's christening.

260
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,846
The fuck
are you doing?

261
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,115
- My uncle didn't call you?
- No...

262
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,818
- Who's your uncle?
- Paulie Gaultieri.

263
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:02,188
- These are for his friend down at the union.
- What union?

264
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,057
He was supposed to call you.
You fucking believe this?

265
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,365
Al, this is a big
fucking mix-up.

266
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,467
I thought Paulie
called you.

267
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,536
- The guy's waiting.
- So you break in?

268
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,672
I got a silent alarm that
goes right to my house.

269
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,940
He'll take care
of you. Don't worry.

270
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,108
Let me talk
to my son-in-law.

271
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,077
Chris? Fine by me,

272
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,914
but if I were you, I wouldn't make
a problem where there ain't one.

273
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,905
- Take over, okay, Felix?
- What you do?

274
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,740
- I'm leaving.
- Who?

275
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,009
I'm going home,
all right? I quit.

276
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,011
Why you do that?

277
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,180
If Dale calls,
just tell him I'm sorry.

278
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,049
But you're the manager.

279
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,854
- Ton', hey.
- Hey.

280
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,924
- How you doing?
- This always helps.

281
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,494
Ooh!
God bless the NFL.

282
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,697
I tell ya, I owe a spot of it to my son.

283
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,934
I was against this kid
even going to college.

284
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,037
But once him and Carlo's kid
started taking action on campus,

285
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,374
far as I'm concerned, he
should stay till he gets a Phd.

286
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,309
Benefits of a higher
education.

287
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,878
Don't get me wrong.
He's learning stuff, too.

288
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,281
The shit this kid knows
about computers...

289
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,283
He set his mother up
with a whole web site

290
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,718
for her
ceramics business.

291
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,086
You must be
very proud.

292
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,223
Believe me, I thank God every day.

293
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,060
I gotta take a leak.

294
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,606
Oh, Parisi the younger. I was just
talking to your dad about you.

295
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,076
- What did I do now?
- To hear him tell it, u're the golden boy.

296
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,115
- Hey, ton'.
- What the fuck's with you?

297
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,184
Root canal.
They got me on Oxycodone.

298
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,186
My whole fucking head
is numb.

299
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,955
Well, that answers
a loof questions.

300
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,291
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

301
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,130
I'll see you inside, Ton'.
I got something for you.

302
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,239
- So how's Rutgers?
- You see those envelopes?

303
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,842
Majoring in cash,
Minoring in ass.

304
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,645
Things change,uh?

305
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,615
When I was in college, it wasn't
so much with the sports betting.

306
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,151
- Hey, how's AJ doing?
- Good good.

307
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,154
He's working. Broke up
with that girlfriend of his.

308
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,157
That spanish chick? He took her
to my cousin Angela's wedding.

309
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,625
She was smoking,
that girl.

310
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,693
Yeah yeah,
you know, whatever.

311
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,562
He didn't want
to get too serious.

312
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,297
Fuck, Jay,
check it out.

313
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,037
Holy shit.

314
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,509
So Sil tells me

315
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,211
you booked a party
here next week.

316
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,880
- Yeah, yeah, it's our frat.
- You should call AJ.

317
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,550
He's probably busy, but I
know he'd love to see you guys.

318
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,518
- Yeah, sure, absolutely.
- Definitely, absolutely.

319
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,326
- Who is it?
- Me.

320
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,768
- How you doing, kid?
- What the fuck, Paulie?

321
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,003
I left you
four messages.

322
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,839
My flight was delayed.
I just got home.

323
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,074
And I've been dealing
with Al for two days.

324
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,176
Just tell him to relax.

325
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,613
They busted into his store.
His acid reflux is acting up.

326
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,049
He woke up Kelli,
got her all upset.

327
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,218
It's my fault your
father-in-law's a crybaby?

328
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,652
They told him
I'd take care of him.

329
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,322
- What's his problem?
- I'm stupid now?

330
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,592
You know and I know they
were there to boost that shit.

331
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,360
It couldn't wait, okay?
I pormised a load

332
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,062
to lenny down
the joint-fitters union.

333
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,864
What do I give a fuck?
It ain't my union.

334
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,399
Lower your voice.
I got neighbors.

335
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,300
Fuck your neighbors.
When you gonna pay me?

336
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,771
When you suck the money out of
my ass! Now get the fuck out!

337
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:23,315
Add three more M.R.I.s and
you're looking at a 10% increase

338
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,217
- Across the board.
- Listen, I gotta talk to you.

339
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,421
- Now?
- It can't wait, T. This fucking paulie!

340
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,589
What happened?

341
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,896
He sent his idiot nephew and jason
molinaro to my father-in-law's store.

342
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,798
They boosted a pallet
of power saws.

343
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,800
- They did?
- Yeah.

344
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,135
Not exactly. Al caught
'em while they were there.

345
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,171
So they did or they
did not take the saws?

346
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:49,175
They did
under false pretense.

347
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,433
And this is what you couldn't
wait to talk to me about?

348
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,813
They broke into
the guy's store, T!

349
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,948
Yeah, I hear you.
I get it.

350
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,950
But we're in the middle
of talking about an ongoing,

351
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:01,287
potentially multimillion
- dollar proposition here, Christopher.

352
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,688
It ain't the money,
Ton'.

353
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,092
Oh, really? Well, I'm
glad you feel that way.

354
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,428
A pallet of drills.
You believe this shit?

355
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,065
Go have a lime rickey or whatever the
fuck it is you're drinking these days,

356
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,800
and we'll be done
in a few minutes.

357
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,371
Forget it, all right?
I got other shit to do.

358
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,709
Come in.

359
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,078
I need to talk
to you guys.

360
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,881
What's the matter?
Finn?

361
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,450
What? No.

362
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,819
It's not about me.
AJ.

363
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:37,156
- What about him?
- I know he's upset,

364
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,526
but he's been saying some things
that are really disturbing.

365
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,863
- Like what?
- Like nobody gives a shit about him.

366
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:47,400
What's the point
of anything? Stuff like that.

367
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,736
I told you about that girl
hadley in my dorm sophomore year,

368
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:54,073
the one who threw herself
off the library balcony.

369
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,642
These are the exact kind
of things she was saying.

370
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,180
I don't mean
to get you all upset...

371
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,716
Of course not. I'm
glad you said something.

372
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:06,385
Good night.

373
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,422
- Good night, sweetie.
-  Get some sleep.

374
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,806
<i>I'm just a guy looking
to punch you in the mouth.</i>

375
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,408
<i>Oh, you can
take a punch.</i>

376
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,010
<i>I guess we knew that
already, didn't we?</i>

377
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,183
<i>You can actually land
a punch, too.</i>

378
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,357
<i>- You're pretty good...
-  Thanks.</i>

379
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,359
<i>... against a 36-year-old
out-of-shape lieutenant.</i>

380
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,547
I came here today
to tell you

381
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,217
in all seriousness
that I'm done.

382
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,754
I did what you said.

383
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,789
I gave it a lot
of thought,

384
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,625
and I decided that
once and for all,

385
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,128
it's over.

386
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,664
The truth is

387
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,934
this therapy is a jerk-off.

388
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,170
You know it,
and I know it.

389
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,106
I actually don't know it,

390
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,942
but please continue.

391
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,812
- It's a jerk-off.
- Yes, you've said that.

392
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,075
Anyway, I was coming here
to quit.

393
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,755
Had it all planned out.
But guess what.

394
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:55,127
My son is
talking suicide.

395
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,129
So now I'm trapped
here forever.

396
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,331
My god,
what did he say?

397
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,867
His girlfriend,
fiancee, whatever...

398
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,502
She broke up with him.

399
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,805
He's beyond devastated.

400
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,708
Would you like me to recommend
someone for him to talk to?

401
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:12,611
Carmela's getting a referral
from his own pediatrician.

402
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,512
Oh.

403
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,981
After that incompetent you sent Meadow to?

404
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,225
So I suppose now comes the
inherent fucking grilling

405
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:30,062
- about how I feel about all this.
- Isn't that why you're here?

406
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,469
Friends of mine,
they got sons his age,

407
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:40,005
and they're happy,

408
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,008
ambitious.

409
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,111
They fucking take life
as it comes.

410
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,746
I know it seems
that way,

411
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,816
but do you really know
these other boys?

412
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,753
I know what I see, my
son curled up on the couch

413
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,589
in a fetus position when he
should be out banging coeds.

414
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,592
- Have you talked to him?
- Till I'm blue in the face.

415
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,994
We both have, and now
we're afraid to talk to him

416
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,831
because of what
he might do.

417
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:13,039
Obviously,
I'm prone to depression...

418
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,908
A certain bleak attitude

419
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,210
about the world,

420
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:21,380
but I know
I can handle it.

421
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,516
Your kids, though...

422
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,423
It's like
when they're little,

423
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:33,125
and they get sick,

424
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,931
you'd give anything in the
world to trade places with them,

425
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,200
so they don't
have to suffer.

426
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,438
And then to think
you're the cause of it.

427
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,373
How are you
the cause of it?

428
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:51,410
It's in his blood, this
miserable fucking existence.

429
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,381
My rotten fucking
putrid genes

430
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,883
have infected
kid's soul.

431
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,052
That's my gift
to my son.

432
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:15,735
I know this
is difficult.

433
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,806
But I'm very glad
we're having this discussion.

434
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,908
Really, really?

435
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,244
'Cause I gotta be honest.
I think it fucking sucks.

436
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,813
- What does?
- Therapy, this.

437
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,815
I hate this fucking shit!

438
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,789
Seriously, we're both
adults here, right?

439
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,659
So after all is said

440
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,094
and done,

441
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,130
after all the complaining
and the crying

442
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:47,333
and all the
fucking bullshit,

443
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,936
is this all there is?

444
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,176
Yes, welcome.

445
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,845
Hi, I'm Chris. I'm an
alcoholic and drug addict.

446
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,414
Hi, chris.

447
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,249
I want to go back
to what Stan said...

448
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,951
How not being able
to socialize

449
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,354
is hard
when you're a salesman.

450
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,389
In my case,
it's the same thing.

451
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:13,392
It's actually taking food
out of my daughter mouth.

452
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:17,063
My boss, for all his
bullshit encouragement,

453
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,065
how he respects
what I'm doing,

454
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,734
the reality is
he resents my sobriety.

455
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,469
I had the same thing
at Unicor.

456
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,471
They were all onboard
for the intervention,

457
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:28,674
but skip one golf outing,
and you're ostracized.

458
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,410
He's an enabler, too, this
guy, the worst fucking kind.

459
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,479
Pours you a drink
with one hand,

460
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,748
judges you with the other
if you take it.

461
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,817
And he wonders why I'm distant...
At least he says he does...

462
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,119
Why I wanna branch out
into other things.

463
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,621
But I can promise you I'd
have more money in my pocket,

464
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,891
plus more responsibility
if I sat with him drinking,

465
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,927
watching that scotch
drool out

466
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,730
of his fat
fucking mouth.

467
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,504
<i>... embedded that dream
into our culture...</i>

468
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,375
Hey.

469
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,218
What are you watching?

470
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,286
Nothing.

471
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,256
Oh, whoa,
that's a good one.

472
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,391
John Wayne.

473
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:29,301
Two Jasons call you?

474
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:31,270
Invite you to a party
tomorrow night?

475
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,739
I don't know.

476
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,941
Well, either they did
or they didn't.

477
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,445
Yeah, I guess.
Jason Gervasi called.

478
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,882
What'd you tell him?

479
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,483
I didn't
call him back.

480
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,885
How come?

481
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,454
'Cause I don't
want to go.

482
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:53,125
Of course not.
Beer, strippers,

483
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,828
fuckin' around with guys
your own age...

484
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,064
You hate all that shit.

485
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,101
You gonna call him?

486
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,836
Said I don't
want to go.

487
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:08,441
I know you don't
want to go.

488
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,910
You don't want to work,
you don't want to eat,

489
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,645
you don't want to talk either.

490
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,246
So, all that
being the case,

491
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,248
you're gonna shower tomorrow
night, you're gonna shave,

492
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,251
you're gonna get dress,
you're gonna go to that party.

493
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,291
I'm not gonna
debate you on this.

494
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,099
Fine.

495
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:41,507
<i>...just how soon before they
attempt to blow this fire out?</i>

496
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,210
<i>They won't try to kill it till
they're ready to cap the well.</i>

497
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,947
- Your boss is your uncle.
- Once removed.

498
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,550
That's gotta add
to the source.

499
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,021
We used to be so tight.

500
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:59,625
And producing movies
is high-stress enough.

501
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,296
I have a happy marriage.

502
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,167
But there was a woman...

503
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:14,407
She worked with us
in a club we had.

504
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:18,144
Anyway, she became
a problem to deal with,

505
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,313
and...

506
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,516
I sided with him.

507
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,584
She was out
of my life.

508
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,257
Okay, fine.

509
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,627
But he never
appreciated it.

510
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,397
Give give give,
it's all I ever do.

511
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,668
I think that's when the relationship
between me and him got poisoned.

512
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,759
How's it going?

513
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,227
Al here?

514
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,062
You just missed him.
He went to lunch.

515
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,597
- Eh.
- Can I help you fellas?

516
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,065
We're here
for the drills.

517
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:14,600
What drills?

518
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,135
You know,
in the back.

519
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,143
I know what you mean, but Al didn't
say nothing about picking anything up.

520
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,711
This fuckin' guy.

521
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,380
Get him on the phone.

522
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,614
All right.

523
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:29,949
What's your name?

524
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,917
Me? I'm Mike.

525
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,152
Paulie.

526
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,321
Nice to meet.

527
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,655
Voice mail.

528
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,424
Gimme that.

529
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,593
Yeah, Al,
it's paulie.

530
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,495
Listen, we're here
with mike.

531
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,965
We're gonna take the drills. I'll
call you later about that other order.

532
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,901
Huh?

533
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,017
What's her name?

534
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,621
Blanca.

535
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,957
Had you and Blanca
been engaged long?

536
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,961
Only a couple
of weeks.

537
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,963
She had a son too,

538
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,832
from when she used
to be married.

539
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,134
What do you think
went wrong?

540
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,104
Her husband was
an asshole, supposedly.

541
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,672
With your relationship?

542
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,374
Oh.

543
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,711
I don't know.

544
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,813
I mean, I wish there
was a reason, but...

545
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,448
She says there isn't.

546
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,521
I think maybe it's because
we have way more money

547
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,156
in my family than hers.

548
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,891
They're immigrants,

549
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,793
and that might
have scared her.

550
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,771
Have you been feeling
suicidal, Anthony?

551
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,479
A little bit.

552
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,481
Have you ever tried
to kill yourself?

553
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,984
No.

554
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,887
I mean, once,
me and my friends

555
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,655
jumped off my
garage roof,

556
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,258
but you know, that was
just to fool around.

557
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,668
You sleeping a lot?

558
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:33,072
I'm tired,

559
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,673
but I keep waking up.

560
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:36,375
Nightmares?

561
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:39,512
I just keep thinking
about her.

562
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:42,715
I mean,
it hurts, but...

563
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,450
I can't help it.

564
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,086
Does anything in life
give you pleasure lately?

565
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,423
I don't know.

566
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,757
Not really.

567
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,894
There's a medication
called Lexapro.

568
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:56,328
It's an antidepressant.

569
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,064
I have friends
who take that.

570
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:00,733
Well, I'm going to
write you a prescription.

571
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:06,005
I'm making mad
fuckin' money, bro.

572
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:08,240
I gotta shut
my phone off sometimes.

573
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,009
You should totally
do it, man.

574
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:13,112
I'm not really good with
betting and percentages.

575
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,381
I got like a 450
on my math SAT.

576
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:18,384
Fuck that shit, bro. I could
hook you up in like 10 minutes.

577
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,389
Can I dance
for you, baby?

578
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,558
I guess.

579
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,431
Yeah, dude!
Yeah!

580
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:35,101
Yeah!

581
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,583
Look at this pile
of shit.

582
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,651
Yeah, so get some
toilet paper.

583
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,286
What is that,
comedy?

584
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:55,588
Actually, yeah.

585
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,123
Come on,
what are you gonna do?

586
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,992
Fuck it,
I'm all in.

587
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:01,627
Fuckin' idiot.
Toilet paper?

588
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:03,129
Fuckin' cunt!

589
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,164
- Fuck!
- Ho, chris!

590
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,266
You were my friend.

591
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,938
Whoa! No!

592
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,212
Oh, fuck!

593
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,448
Call an ambulance!

594
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,557
Tony, wake up.
I need to talk to you.

595
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,895
What?

596
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:40,299
You let our underage son go
to a party at a strip club?

597
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,303
What time is it?

598
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:53,479
Take it easy, will you?
What's the big deal?

599
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,181
He just got in
three hours ago.

600
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,951
He is still drunk and
he's not even drinking age!

601
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:00,486
Yet he could die
in iraq.

602
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,388
What does that
ha to do with anything?

603
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:05,825
Jesus Christ, Carm, he's
gonna be 21 in two months.

604
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:08,060
He's an emotional
wreck, tony.

605
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:11,597
So, seeing a pair of tits is
gonna send him over the edge?

606
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,033
Got him out of the house,
around people his own age.

607
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,501
At the fuckin' Bing?

608
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,770
Well, they're college kids.
It's what they do.

609
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,539
I know you'd rather see him
in his room drinkin' cocoa,

610
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:23,309
but this is
the way back,

611
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,911
believe me... And the
way back to college...

612
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,549
Fraternities,
frat boys.

613
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,394
Hey.

614
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,303
I did a stupid thing, Ton'.
I won't deny it.

615
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:53,105
Stupid? Just
hung up with Paulie.

616
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,574
His nephew's got
six broken vertebraes.

617
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,650
I know that,
and I'm sorry.

618
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,119
But this is the second
fuckin' time

619
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,722
Paulie flouted his
authority to my face.

620
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:13,592
This shit with the tools...  I know he
set up the deal with the cubans,

621
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,862
but this is my father-in-law we're
talkin' about, tony, my family.

622
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:19,932
In any case, this bullshit could
have been handled with a conversation.

623
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,614
I came to the Bing, remember?
I tried to talk to you about it.

624
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:39,249
And I told you to wait, and you left
to go God-knows-where.

625
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,554
I got to be honest,
Christopher,

626
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:43,956
I can't help thinkin' that this goes
directly to what we talked about...

627
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:45,424
More than once.

628
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,960
If you were around more, you
had your finger on the pulse,

629
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:50,429
problems like this would
be squashed in the womb.

630
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,798
Whether I'm around's
got nothing to do with it.

631
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,468
He needed the tools, he
could have left me a message.

632
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,510
We're supposed to leave
phone messages

633
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,512
about interstate
hijacking now?

634
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,247
How about faxes?
Emails?

635
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:10,850
Make it even easier
for the cops.

636
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:13,018
This is a face-to-face
business, Christopher.

637
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,221
And yeah, I'm gonna talk to
paulie, 'cause believe me,

638
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:16,989
there's a few things
that he needs to hear.

639
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,625
But in the meantime, you figure
out how much he owes for the tools,

640
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,128
and we're gonna deduct that
against what you're gonna owe

641
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:24,563
for little Paulie's
hospital bills.

642
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,348
- Yeah?
- He tore up my lawn, Ton'!

643
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,051
Drove his fuckin' car
right up on the grass.

644
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:47,219
- Who did?
- Fuckin' Paulie, who else?

645
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,522
40 grand
in landscaping.

646
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,857
Terrorized my wife
and daughter.

647
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,726
Destroyed the bushes,
the grass,

648
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,828
and every fuckin'
flower she plant

649
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:58,998
- Just relax, okay?
- I am fuckin' relaxed.

650
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,666
I'm not gonna
do nothin'.

651
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,269
Because I love you, because
I'm committed to my work,

652
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:04,670
I ain't gonna do shit.

653
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,338
I'm gonna sit tight
and hold my tongue,

654
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:08,540
and not cause
no problems for you.

655
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:31,997
No, bad was '99. Mets/Braves
national league championship.

656
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:33,499
My dad went apeshit, man.

657
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,534
He threw a fuckin' vase
right through the tv.

658
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,270
Ho, Victor. What are you
doing at a deek party, bro?

659
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:39,538
You settlin' up?

660
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,540
Come on, it's friday.
Bills are sunday.

661
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:44,043
What are we, fuckin' Citibank?
How long we gonna carry your ass?

662
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:45,711
Buffalo's a lock.

663
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,279
Give me a dime
at two and a half.

664
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,548
If not, my father's sending
my check this week anyway.

665
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,984
Fuck that. If not...
You see this guy right here?

666
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:53,352
Tony Soprano Jr.

667
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,388
Know what that means,
right?

668
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:58,224
Monday, bro.
One way or the other.

669
00:40:58,324 --> 00:40:59,959
Don't be
a dick about it.

670
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,371
Is he still sleeping?

671
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,906
He's not home.

672
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,075
He stayed
with his friends.

673
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,511
He sounded good.
They were playing cards.

674
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,780
Well, it's been a week
almost, on the meds.

675
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,417
All I know, is it's a pleasure
not to have him laying around here

676
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:25,918
like a miserab'.

677
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:28,354
It's companies like Wal-Mart
we got to thank.

678
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:30,756
They're always fighting
against tightenin' imports.

679
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,925
So, our provolone,
our perfume,

680
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,661
whooop! slides right
under the fuckin' door.

681
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,264
All those inspections slow
down wal-mart's operation.

682
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,499
And what about terrorism...
Missiles and shit?

683
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,702
There he is...
The missing link.

684
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,336
Hey.

685
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,874
How you doin'?

686
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,209
Good.

687
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,578
I called Sal Vitro
like you said.

688
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:55,047
He's coming by this week,
resod the lawn.

689
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:59,485
And I talked to paulie. We
worked out a payment schedule.

690
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:00,686
He's here?

691
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,455
Yeah.

692
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,524
All right.

693
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,727
Let me say hello.

694
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:14,900
Hey.

695
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,502
How you doing, kid?

696
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:18,204
How's little Paulie?

697
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:19,839
He's fucked up.

698
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:21,841
He got your flowers,
though.

699
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:24,243
Good.

700
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,746
- Listen, Paulie...
- Forget it, okay?

701
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:29,348
Shit happens.
What are you gonna do?

702
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:31,516
There's no point
in ruminatin'.

703
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,152
You're right.

704
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:35,388
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

705
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,862
Me too.

706
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:46,198
Do this again, sweetie.
And get him a club soda.

707
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,737
You know what?
Fuck it.

708
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,539
Whatever he's having.

709
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,416
Good times.

710
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:04,850
Salut.

711
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:15,561
- That's fuckin' rocket fuel.
- One more, one more.

712
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:17,029
- One more.
- Ah yeah...

713
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:18,764
- What's going on, baby?
- Are you nuts?

714
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,767
When, now?
Who else is there?

715
00:43:21,901 --> 00:43:23,536
Let's do it.

716
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:24,770
Deek!

717
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:27,506
Deek deek deek deek!

718
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:28,774
All right, yeah...
No, definitely.

719
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:30,609
In like 20 minutes.

720
00:43:30,743 --> 00:43:32,912
- Yeah!
- All right, bye.

721
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,781
Yo, Donna Amato, they're having a
party and guess who's over there?

722
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:39,385
- Victor.
- That welchin' little prick,

723
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:41,153
you fuckin' kidding me?

724
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:43,622
You wanna come?

725
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:45,958
Oh I don't know.
I'm just gonna hang here.

726
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,927
Oh come on!
It'll be fun!

727
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:55,267
11 more credits and I can
transfer to Syracuse.

728
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:57,503
Their business program
is awesome.

729
00:43:57,603 --> 00:43:59,605
Hey, you made it.

730
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,340
Fuck.

731
00:44:03,342 --> 00:44:05,611
Vic, where are you
goin', buddy?

732
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:08,147
I was just grabbing a beer.
What's up?

733
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,782
Listen, I'm getting
your money, okay?

734
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:10,983
- No, yeah.
- Cool, great.

735
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:13,819
Let's take a ride and
talk about it, all right?

736
00:44:13,953 --> 00:44:15,788
Come on, guys,
stop.

737
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,256
What's going on?

738
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:18,924
Nothin', we're just
fuckin' around.

739
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:26,766
- Get in the fuckin' car!
- No!

740
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,968
Get in the fuckin' car!

741
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:40,679
Fuckin' deadbeat.

742
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,349
You know what happens when
you don't fuckin' pay?

743
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,619
Stop stop!

744
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,887
What, are you gonna cry?

745
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:50,122
What are we,
fuckin' assholes?

746
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:51,290
Come on, man.
Where's the shit?

747
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,792
Yo, help us hold him down,
come on.

748
00:44:52,892 --> 00:44:55,661
- Come on!
- Get off me!

749
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:57,897
- No!
- Quit kickin', bitch!

750
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,732
Get his shoes.

751
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,567
Hey, dude, you ever
take chemistry?

752
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,903
'Cause Dr. Parisi and me, we're
gonna do a little experiment.

753
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,639
We want to see what happens when
you mix sulfuric acid with toe jam.

754
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,642
Fuck no!
No! No!

755
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:12,712
Don't, don't,
don't do it, fuck!

756
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:13,913
That hurt?

757
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:16,916
- You little bitch.
- No!

758
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:23,989
I mean,
you have a kid,

759
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:26,058
and they look at you...

760
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,427
You look back.

761
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:31,764
And you're looking
at yourself, really.

762
00:45:33,332 --> 00:45:36,235
Or part of you,
plus another person...

763
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:37,603
That love.

764
00:45:39,672 --> 00:45:41,240
I look at
her eyes, man,

765
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,109
and she looks up,

766
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:45,044
back at me...

767
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:48,080
How the fuck do I put
myself up for adoption?

768
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,284
- What?
- Nothing, go ahead.

769
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:54,620
- She ain't adopted, Paulie.
- I'm kidding.

770
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:57,022
What were you saying?

771
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:03,362
My point...
What the fuck was...

772
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:07,533
Is babies.
They're the future.

773
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:16,976
Do you realize by the time
Caitlin's out of college,

774
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:20,379
it'll be like,
the year 2027 or something?

775
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:23,115
She takes after you, she won't
be out of fourth grade by then.

776
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:28,154
Look, by that time, she'll be
working here, so who gives a shit?

777
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,255
- Ho, what are you doing?
- Nothin'.

778
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:04,657
- Oh!
- Come on, come on.

779
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,425
- We're just fuckin' around.
- It's late.

780
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:08,360
I gotta go.

781
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,616
- Hello?
- It's me.

782
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:38,557
I'm fuckin'
losing it, man.

783
00:47:38,624 --> 00:47:40,059
Chris,
it's 11-fuckin'-30.

784
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:41,794
Well, you're awake,
though, right?

785
00:47:41,961 --> 00:47:43,529
I'm sorry.
You sleepin'?

786
00:47:43,629 --> 00:47:45,965
I'm working. I'm on a
deadline for a "Law & Order."

787
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:48,534
Marianne's
left me alone.

788
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:50,136
How much did you drink?

789
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:52,571
I don't know.
A lot.

790
00:47:52,638 --> 00:47:55,641
I'm gonna make some coffee, and
then we're gonna call your sponsor.

791
00:47:55,741 --> 00:47:57,476
He's gone. Eddie,
he's away someplace...

792
00:47:57,543 --> 00:47:58,811
Philadelphia.

793
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:02,515
This fuckin'
Paulie, man.

794
00:48:02,581 --> 00:48:04,550
You think he's your
friend, this cocksucker,

795
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,152
all these pricks...

796
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,655
What are you doing?

797
00:48:09,755 --> 00:48:11,323
You're drunk.
I'm making coffee.

798
00:48:11,424 --> 00:48:13,259
I don't want
fuckin' coffee.

799
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,329
It's an urban myth,
anyway.

800
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:24,904
- What do you write?
- "Law & Order."

801
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:30,176
I'll give you stories
make your fuckin' head curl...

802
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:32,745
The shit I seen.

803
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:34,747
Fuck that, the shit
I did personally.

804
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,415
I don't want
to hear it.

805
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:38,918
What you need to do is sober
up and get to a meeting.

806
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:40,519
That's your
fuckin' answer?

807
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:43,889
It is the answer.
Work the program.

808
00:48:43,956 --> 00:48:45,691
You know,
you're a fuckin' robot.

809
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:47,760
Anybody ever
tell you that?

810
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:50,896
You got any fuckin'
emotion in there?

811
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:53,866
I don't know about you,

812
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,935
but my friends
have abandoned me.

813
00:48:56,035 --> 00:48:58,637
I've been totally
fuckin' ostrafied.

814
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:01,040
Because when
we drink and we use,

815
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,942
we are not pleasant
to be around.

816
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,213
My heart's fuckin' breaking
and you're blowing me off?

817
00:49:07,313 --> 00:49:09,382
You know, my father
fuckin' abandoned me.

818
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:12,485
I thought he was shot.

819
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,622
You have any idea,
if I wanted,

820
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:18,824
what I could do
to these pricks?

821
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,261
One phone call
and it's over.

822
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,563
The whole fuckin' castle
comes down...

823
00:49:24,663 --> 00:49:25,998
Whoa whoa whoa!

824
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:28,267
Do you remember
my girlfriend, Adriana...

825
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:29,735
My fiancee?

826
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:32,071
My friend,
ralph cifaretto?

827
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,974
- I know shit, my friend.
- Chris, come on!

828
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,775
Serious fuckin'
things,

829
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:38,576
that would have
major implications

830
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:39,912
on a lot of
fuckin' people...

831
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:41,313
Chris, I shouldn't
hear this shit.

832
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:42,681
I know, right.
You said.

833
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:45,418
You just want to write
about it, leech off me.

834
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:47,686
I'm trying
to help you, man.

835
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:52,191
That fuckin' program...

836
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:54,927
The government has
got money to burn.

837
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:57,096
Gravano was livin' large
down in arizona,

838
00:49:57,263 --> 00:49:58,764
all on that federal tit.

839
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:00,933
- All right, let's get you home.
- I like the sun,

840
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,035
be closer to
hollywood anyway.

841
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:04,537
Give me your phone.
I'm calling your wife.

842
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:06,772
- What?
- I have told you

843
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:09,508
repeatedly, I do not
want to hear this shit.

844
00:50:09,808 --> 00:50:12,077
I let you be part
of my movie.

845
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,447
You let me?

846
00:50:16,048 --> 00:50:18,117
I'm pouring
my heart out, man.

847
00:50:18,284 --> 00:50:20,052
And I'm very sorry.

848
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,054
- But we met in AA.
- Chris!

849
00:50:22,154 --> 00:50:24,156
You're in the mafia.

850
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:32,131
Fine.

851
00:51:34,894 --> 00:51:36,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

852
00:51:38,297 --> 00:51:40,199
Early night, huh?

853
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:43,803
...they're slouching up
57th street,

854
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:46,238
so next time we're in
the city, I want to go.

855
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,741
What's this?
Party time?

856
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:51,210
Rachael Ray was on "Leno."
We got hungry.

857
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,045
Sit down,
I'll get some plates.

858
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:57,550
Where were you guys?

859
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,118
- Frat party.
- Had a meeting.

860
00:51:59,218 --> 00:52:01,153
Did you go out tonight?

861
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:02,621
I met a friend
for coffee.

862
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:04,090
That's probably why
you're still awake.

863
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:06,492
I guess so.

864
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:08,728
Miss Meadow
had a mystery date

865
00:52:08,894 --> 00:52:11,330
- she refuses to discuss.
- oh yeah?

866
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:18,437
What are you doing?
Sit down.

867
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:20,906
I'm wired.
I don't know.

868
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:27,146
So what's the mystery?

869
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:28,914
That you had a date
begin with?

870
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:30,716
Bite me, okay?
