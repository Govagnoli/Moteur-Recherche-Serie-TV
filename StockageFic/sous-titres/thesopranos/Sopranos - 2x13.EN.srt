1
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,541
Have some eggplant.

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,543
I told you,
i'm not hungry.

3
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,046
Now you won't even accept food
from your own mother.

4
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,547
Will you please
stick to the topic?

5
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,049
Oh, sure, sure.

6
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,551
You believe that
uncle of yours.

7
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,054
I never conspired
with him.

8
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,057
I wish somebody would tell me
what you're talking about.

9
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,558
Ask your brother.

10
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm here to get your living
situation settled,

11
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,062
now with janice gone.

12
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,064
Barbara asked me
to come here.

13
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,066
Beyond that, i got
nothing to say to you.

14
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,068
Ma, you can't
come live with us.

15
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,070
I'm sorry,
but tom won't allow it.

16
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,571
Janice was right.

17
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,574
I won't go back
to that place.

18
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,575
You got that right.

19
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,077
They won't have you
back at green grove.

20
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,078
Tony!

21
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,080
She was abusive
to the staff!

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,581
Maybe tom
and i should just--

23
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,083
no, no, no, no.

24
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,584
Don't listen to
the manipulation.

25
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,086
You got your own life!

26
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,090
If you had a mother that had
one shred of gratitude in her,

27
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,092
one shred,
but you don't.

28
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,594
She's taking a page from
your wife's book.

29
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,096
Oh, that is
fucking outrageous!

30
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,597
Carmela asked you
how many fucking times

31
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,602
to come live with us?

32
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,104
Well, he's gone.

33
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,106
Nice work, ma.

34
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:57,110
Carmela's been
so sweet to you.

35
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,612
I'm tired of this shit.

36
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,116
Every fucking time.

37
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,117
What?

38
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,618
What are you doing?

39
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,120
You're not gonna
live with her.

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,122
There's two tickets,
first class.

41
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,623
Go to tuscan,
stay with aunt gemma.

42
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,126
Take aunt quinn with you,
the other fucking miserab'.

43
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,128
I've done my part,
that's all you get from me.

44
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,630
My sister quintina
won't fly.

45
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,133
So, throw her out
on the fucking tarmac!

46
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,688
To business.

47
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,220
How are you?

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,221
Alright.

49
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,223
Oh, maddon'.

50
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,225
Missed a great
meal too.

51
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:53,726
Fantastic.

52
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,727
Indian food.

53
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,229
That envelope's
just the first week.

54
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,730
I love it.

55
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,731
Patsy been in?

56
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,233
He's looking for you.

57
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,235
Where'd the fuck they get
the fried zucchini flowers?

58
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,736
It's fantastic.

59
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,738
It's stuffed with
melted dry riccoti.

60
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:06,739
Yeah?

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,741
Help yourself,
you fat fuck.

62
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,242
They good?

63
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,244
Mmm.

64
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,745
You too?

65
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,248
Anybody else?
How about you?

66
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,250
Tell arthur of the ritz

67
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,252
to send a couple of plates
of zucchini flowers out.

68
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,754
And some zuppa di mussels.

69
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,256
You got it.

70
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:28,261
So, telecommunications once
again fails to disappoint.

71
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,762
What's this thing?

72
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,264
Telephone calling cards.

73
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,267
You find a front man
who can get a line of credit,

74
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,270
you buy a couple of
million units of calling time
from a carrier.

75
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,772
You become
"acme telephone card company".

76
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,774
"Acme".

77
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,777
You're now in the business of
selling prepaid calling cards.

78
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,779
Immigrants especially,
no offense.

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,782
They're always calling back
home to whoever the fuck.

80
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,284
And it's expensive,
right?

81
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,287
You sell thousands of these
cards to the greedy pricks,

82
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,788
cards at a cut rate.

83
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,291
But you bought the bulk time
on credit, remember?

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,792
The carrier gets stiffed.

85
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,295
He cuts off the service
to the card holders,

86
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,297
but you already
sold all your cards.

87
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,299
That's fucking beautiful!

88
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,302
It's a good one.

89
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,803
Oh.

90
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,305
Prince rogain.

91
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,309
Here you go,
some zuppa di mussels,

92
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,312
and tony, you got
the last dozen flowers.

93
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,813
Do me a favor,

94
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,815
put these on the menu
for meadow's graduation party.

95
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,318
Hey, those were some colleges
she got into, your kid.

96
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,320
Yeah, you must
be very proud.

97
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,322
Hey, holy cross.

98
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,325
I mean, heather didn't exactly
walk away with un gatz.

99
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,826
Excuse me.

100
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,329
I give carmela
all the credit.

101
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,331
Hey, you had something
to do with it too.

102
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,332
Cheers.

103
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,333
Salute.

104
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:45,838
Salute.

105
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,840
Things are good,
what the fuck?

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,343
Richie aprile's in
the bermuda triangle.

107
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,347
All my enemies
are smoked.

108
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,848
Oh, oh, oh!

109
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,849
Hey, patsy.

110
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:57,850
What the fuck?

111
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,352
Don't bring
that in here.

112
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,354
Wait outside in the car,
i'll come out.

113
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,856
What did i say?

114
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,358
In the car.

115
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,871
You still up?

116
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,374
The gifts for
grad night.

117
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,375
What's that?

118
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,877
Oh, it's
a vestimenta suit.

119
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,380
Got a price.

120
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,383
You know it looks fatter
than a suit, right?

121
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,387
I hate that when the air gets
trapped inside the suit bag,

122
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,389
you know,
when you zip it up.

123
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,390
Yeah.

124
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,392
Don't you hate that?

125
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:40,893
What?

126
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,395
What do you want?

127
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,397
Air in the bag.

128
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,900
The only thing to do
is unzip it a little,

129
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,906
let the air out.

130
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,408
Holy shit.

131
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,411
My suit's growing
a fucking beard.

132
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,913
Oh, tony, will you
let me work here, please?

133
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,916
Growing a beard or
a mirkin or something.

134
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,917
Ah!

135
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,918
It's fucking alive!

136
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,420
It's alive!

137
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,421
Oh, my god!

138
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,422
Oh, my god.

139
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,424
Tony, what did you do?

140
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,925
It's for you.

141
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,927
Oh, my god.

142
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,429
Yeah.

143
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,431
We're having
a good week.

144
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,433
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

145
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,948
You look beautiful, carm.

146
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,950
Come here.

147
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,501
You believe this shit?

148
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,002
Fucking june.

149
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,504
My daughter's
graduating in a week.

150
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,005
Spring snow.

151
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,507
Happened when
my parents got married.

152
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,008
Won't last.

153
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,016
So, they here yet?

154
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,017
Not yet.

155
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,018
Ton'.

156
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,020
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,522
When they make
the diagnosis?

158
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,023
About a month ago.

159
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,526
The wife and kids know?

160
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,527
No.

161
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,529
And there's nothing
they can do for you?

162
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,532
The various protocols
to date are ineffective.

163
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,534
What can i say?

164
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,536
You have my sympathy.

165
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,037
September 5th.

166
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,039
That's how long they've
given him to live.

167
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,041
But instead of
waiting until then,

168
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,043
he's gonna light
himself on fire.

169
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,545
Yeah.

170
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,047
Is that balls of
concrete or what?

171
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,049
Very considerate.

172
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,552
How many guys are gonn
a do that for you, heh?

173
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:25,558
Spare you all those
fuckin' visits to the hospital.

174
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,561
By the way, patsy,
coat went over big.

175
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,062
She loved it.

176
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,566
I'm philly.

177
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,568
Sorry, right,
philly.

178
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,069
Yeah.

179
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,571
Thought you were
your brother.

180
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,073
You know, i just
bought a sable off him.

181
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,076
I'm sorry i had
to do that.

182
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,584
Fuck this.

183
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,586
They're never coming.

184
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,603
Where's pussy?

185
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,614
Hey, ton'.

186
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:28,621
What if these doctors
are wrong?

187
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,622
Carm.

188
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:34,627
What?

189
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,630
Might as well just
fucking kill myself.

190
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,633
I've never been so
fucking depressed.

191
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,635
Tony.

192
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,136
Sorry.

193
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,138
It's alright,
go back to bed.

194
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,142
No, no, what?
What now?

195
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,144
It's all a big nothing.

196
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,646
What is?

197
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,648
Life.

198
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,150
Tony, that is
your mother talking.

199
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,154
Everything's black.

200
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:06,158
You have a tendency
towards depression, yes.

201
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,660
But listen to me,
alright?

202
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,662
Everything's gonna
be alright.

203
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,664
I'm here,
i'm with you.

204
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,166
The kids are safe
in their beds.

205
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,668
They love you.

206
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:21,173
What?

207
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,678
It's coming
from here.

208
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,680
It's not my fucking head.

209
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,182
It's my stomach.

210
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,684
I'm nauseous.

211
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,685
Jesus.

212
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,689
Fuck!

213
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,694
Oh, fuck,
it's the chicken vindaloo.

214
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,698
Fucking
motherfucking wogs!

215
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,700
Mom, what's going on?

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,201
Your father is sick.

217
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,703
Oh, my god, daddy,
what happened?

218
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,705
He went to
an indian restaurant.

219
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,707
That is so racist.

220
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,710
Who's letting
those big ones?

221
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,213
There better be coke
left in that fridge
is all i can say.

222
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,224
How did it go?

223
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,234
Was sundip there?

224
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,235
Yeah.

225
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,747
My whole cut.

226
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,256
Here.

227
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,257
What's the matter?

228
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,759
"What's the matter?"

229
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,761
I know, i know,
tony's your best friend.

230
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,263
President franklin
is my best friend.

231
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,765
And he's in there.

232
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,266
Look...

233
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,769
some cooperators, when they
finally get their new identity,

234
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,771
do pretty fucking good.

235
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,273
One snitch
i worked with

236
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,275
became recycling
and garbage commissioner

237
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,277
of a good sized
city in florida.

238
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,287
You alright?

239
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:19,291
Yeah, it's
all out of there.

240
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,293
Here.

241
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:27,299
Here, small sips.

242
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,802
Wondered about
that chicken.

243
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,804
Probably a fucking
cocker spaniel.

244
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,806
Oh, stop it, tony,
here, lie back.

245
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,308
You feel a little hot.

246
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,812
Fucking goddess
with the six arms.

247
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,814
No wonder.

248
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,817
Here.

249
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,818
Sip.

250
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,820
I said sip, tony.

251
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,834
What?

252
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,336
I said, you still
like your coat?

253
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:09,842
I love my coat.

254
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,878
Where you going?

255
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,379
I don't know.

256
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,381
What are you
looking for?

257
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,382
Somebody's
looking for me.

258
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,386
Who?

259
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,390
I don't know.

260
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,895
Our true enemy has yet
to reveal himself.

261
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,950
Three hearts.

262
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,954
And a seven.

263
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,956
Make it a dime.

264
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,474
Tony, are you up yet?

265
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,484
How are you feeling?

266
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,493
I had fucked up
dreams last night.

267
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,997
Fever dreams.

268
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,999
I shot this guy.

269
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,500
He's a friend of mine.

270
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,504
Now, in real life, this guy does
do some things that annoy me.

271
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,007
Like every christmas, he sends
out these typed reports

272
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,509
of what his nieces
and nephews have been doing.

273
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,014
Who got into west point,
who got a hole in one.

274
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,516
And he hums...

275
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,518
tv commercials.

276
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,522
Drives me fucking crazy.

277
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,525
But he's...

278
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,028
one of my best guys,
a terrific earner.

279
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,031
So, what the fuck
would i do that for?

280
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,538
I was filled with--

281
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,539
anger.

282
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,541
Yeah, right, anger
, you know everything.

283
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,543
You have never dealt
with your anger.

284
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,045
And look at the cost.

285
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,047
You are the biggest
threat to yourself.

286
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,049
That's what being
a human being is.

287
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:44,056
But some people are more
self- destructive than others.

288
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,558
You're gonna make me
eat something now?

289
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,060
Maybe.

290
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,062
If you keep this up.

291
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,063
No.

292
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,575
I'm dying.

293
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,578
I'm gonna cover you
with this blanket, okay?

294
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,081
I don't want you to
see me like this.

295
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,082
Please.

296
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,584
I'm fucking freezing.

297
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,587
Your teeth are
chattering.

298
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,589
You want to go
back into the bed?

299
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,092
Might as well
just leave me here.

300
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,094
Motherfucking fucking!

301
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:27,099
I think you have
food poisoning.

302
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,600
Fucking dreams,
jesus christ.

303
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,102
It's alright.

304
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,103
It's alright.

305
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,112
Where is he?

306
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,113
Who?

307
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,614
Pussy.

308
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,137
Hey.

309
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,139
What are you
doing here?

310
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,641
Finalize the menu.

311
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,644
Oh, shit,
i completely forgot.

312
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,148
Tony had food poisonin
g all night, the poor guy.

313
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,650
Ooh, oh, hey,
it's not from my place.

314
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,652
Was he at vesuvio
last night?

315
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,154
Yeah.

316
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,156
But i got an "a" rating.

317
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,157
It's...

318
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,658
sure, of course,
nobody's saying.

319
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,659
Is that artie?

320
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,161
Hey, ton'.

321
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,661
Send him up!

322
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,663
Tony, go to sleep.

323
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,665
You don't even make
any sense when you talk.

324
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,168
Send him up!

325
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,683
Oh, jeez, you picked up
a bad one somewhere, huh?

326
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,684
Somewhere?

327
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,686
You know, maybe.

328
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,688
Just out of consideration
for others,

329
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,690
you'd dump those fucking
mussels you gave me

330
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,192
before you cause
a fucking outbreak.

331
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,193
Whoa, nellie.

332
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,195
I hand pick every piece
of shellfish myself.

333
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,196
Oh, yeah?

334
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,697
You smelling them
as you're picking them

335
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
or you're staring
off into space?

336
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,701
Worrying about paying
your fucking rent

337
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,703
or whatever it is
you fucking worry about.

338
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,205
That's a serious
allegation.

339
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,707
Nobody's gonna
fucking sue you.

340
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,209
You see, this is what
i'm talking about.

341
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,210
Tony, you ate mussels?

342
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,211
Prince edward island.

343
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,712
Top of the line.

344
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,714
After an entir
e indian dinner?

345
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,216
You ate at
an indian restaurant?

346
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,717
There you go.

347
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,718
It was the mussels.

348
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,221
They came up undigested.

349
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,723
They came up undigested,
how could they be the cause?

350
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,226
It's why my body shut down,
self protection.

351
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,728
You know what they cook with
at indian restaurants?

352
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:37,729
Ghee.

353
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,731
It's clarified butter.

354
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,733
I mean, you get a rancid
hit of that and...

355
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,235
you can imagine.

356
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,736
You know,
it's interesting too

357
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,238
'cause when indira ghandi
got assassinated,

358
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,739
i was watching
the satellite feed

359
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,242
when they broadcast
the cremation.

360
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,744
Did you know that they douse
the body and the funeral pyre

361
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:57,249
in clarified butter
just to get it burning?

362
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,755
Did you call pussy?
He had the mussels too.

363
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,757
Jesus, artie,"call pussy",
some concern maybe?

364
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:10,262
I am, i feel very
bad for him.

365
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,764
Sal.

366
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,267
It's arthur bucco.

367
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,768
What the fuck?

368
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,774
Hello.

369
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,276
Hey, man,
it's artie.

370
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,278
Yeah, i know,
what's up?

371
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,279
Listen, i'm at
the soprano's house.

372
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,781
And tony's a little
green around the gills.

373
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,283
Flu, i'm guessing.

374
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,286
But maybe he ate something
didn't agree with him.

375
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,787
Food poisoning?

376
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,289
No, what, salmonella?

377
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,291
No!

378
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,792
But he had a reaction.

379
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,294
You guys ate at
an indian restaurant.

380
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,797
It would help if we knew,
did you have any symptoms?

381
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,798
No.

382
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,800
Well, once during the night,

383
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,303
i did have a slight
touch of diarrhea.

384
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,305
That's all, it passed.

385
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,306
Nothing.

386
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,808
Touch of diarrhea.

387
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,310
You motherfucker.

388
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,811
A touch.

389
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,812
Nothing right, puss?

390
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,814
Not what like tony's
going through, right?

391
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,316
Like from bad shell- fish
or anything.

392
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,318
What the fuck?
Am i gonna get sick now?

393
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,319
No!

394
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,321
Listen, did you guys
eat the same thing

395
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,822
at the indian restaurant?

396
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,824
Well, we both
had the papadums,

397
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,327
but different courses.

398
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,329
Both had the papadums,
different entrees.

399
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,331
Stop talking
about food.

400
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,332
Okay, puss.

401
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,834
Yeah, i'm sorry
to bother you.

402
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:27,339
Okay, thanks a lot,
okay.

403
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,841
I'm sorry, tony,
but i feel vindicated.

404
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,344
I can't get of
f the boardwalk.

405
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,845
I'm gonna call
dr. Cusamano.

406
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,348
This is worrying me now.

407
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,350
Poor sonofabitch.

408
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,852
Oh, you gotta
go again?

409
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,354
Just let me die.

410
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,355
No.

411
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,356
C'mon.

412
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,357
Ally oop.

413
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,359
Up, up, up, up.

414
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,860
So, where we headed?

415
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,363
This way.

416
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,367
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a few moments

417
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,369
we'll begin general
boarding on flight 129

418
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,870
with non- stop service
to tucson.

419
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,372
At this time,

420
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,874
we'd like to begin boarding our
first class passengers only.

421
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,376
Those traveling
with young children

422
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,378
and those requirin
g special assistance.

423
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,380
You can't understand
a word they say.

424
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,881
Go on.

425
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,883
Livia soprano?

426
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, pussy.

427
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,901
Oh.

428
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,408
C'mon in.

429
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,920
So...

430
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,925
who's your friend?

431
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,427
Pussy?

432
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,429
I'm confused.

433
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,432
Isn't pussy
your friend?

434
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:01,933
Yeah.

435
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,935
But that's the friend
that was almost carried off

436
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:08,440
by the ducks, right?

437
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,942
You know what the worst
part of this is?

438
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,445
This is one of those situations
where i know i'm dreaming.

439
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,447
Well, let's look at it.

440
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,449
When you say pussy
you mean my friend, pussy,

441
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,451
or you know...

442
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,453
pussy.

443
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,457
Whatever seems to be
dominating your thoughts.

444
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,958
I got pussy on the brain.

445
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,461
I always do.

446
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:33,965
I wanna fuck you,
i always did...

447
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,467
do.

448
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,469
I told you that
the first time we met.

449
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,971
I find you immensely
attractive, anthony.

450
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,973
I thought
i repulsed you.

451
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,475
You go out of your way
to repulse me.

452
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,976
But you like that.

453
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,478
You just admitted
you find me attractive.

454
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,480
You're the one
that's fucked up.

455
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,482
Anthony, anthony.

456
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,985
What are we gonna
do with you?

457
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,006
What's he
smiling at?

458
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:19,010
No, he's gritting his teeth,
he's freezing.

459
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:24,015
Tony.

460
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,517
Hey, guy.

461
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,519
Not feeling
too good, huh?

462
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,021
I'm dying.

463
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,525
No, no, you got
a small case of e. Coli,
campylobacteria, maybe,

464
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,527
but you're gonna be fine.

465
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,028
Let me die.

466
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,530
Should he maybe
go to the hospital?

467
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,531
Nothing we'd do.

468
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,032
Pump his stomach?

469
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,034
Not with this.

470
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,536
He should suck
ice chips.

471
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:49,541
It's good for the fever,
keeps him hydrated.

472
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,542
Anyhoo...

473
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,043
fucking ragheads.

474
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,545
I don't think so, tony.

475
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,547
Those spices kill
microbial agents.

476
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,048
Very smart.

477
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,050
That fucking
artie bucco.

478
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,052
Meadow's graduation
is tomorrow.

479
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,554
Ah.

480
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,581
Hey, ton'.

481
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,591
How's it going?

482
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,593
You didn't get sick?

483
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,594
Nah.

484
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,595
How much you weigh?

485
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:44,596
Eight pounds.

486
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,097
Lost a lot of weight.

487
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,098
Swimming.

488
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,600
The best exercise.

489
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,101
Works every
muscle group.

490
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,603
Get the fuck
out of here.

491
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,104
You never exercise
d once in your life.

492
00:27:53,104 --> 00:28:00,111
Anyway,
four dollars a pound.

493
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,114
You know i've been working with
the government right, ton'?

494
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,118
Don't say it.

495
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,620
C'mon, ton'.

496
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,622
Sooner or later
you gotta face facts.

497
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,123
I don't want
to hear it.

498
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:16,127
Well, you're gonna hear it.

499
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,629
Fuck.

500
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:22,634
You passed me over for
promotion, ton', you knew.

501
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,135
How much shit
you give them?

502
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,638
A lot.

503
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,640
Jesus, puss.

504
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,648
Fuck of a way for
it all to end, huh?

505
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:37,649
Yeah.

506
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,651
Yeah.

507
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,654
These guys,
on either side of me,

508
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,656
they're asleep.

509
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,657
Don't say that.

510
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:52,664
It's not fucking funny.

511
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,167
I don't want to see you
floppin' around down there!

512
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,184
No way, tony.

513
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,186
Get your ass
back in bed.

514
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,188
Cramps are gone,
i got to go out.

515
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,690
Help me with this.

516
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,692
Tony, you are out
of your mind.

517
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,694
I brought you
some consomme.

518
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:28,199
I wasn't even sure
you could handle that.

519
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,202
God help you, tony, if your head
is in that bowl for graduation

520
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,204
because i sure
as hell won't.

521
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,710
Tony.

522
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,211
Hi, ang, how you doing?

523
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,713
Good, good,
how are you?

524
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,715
Oh, madonn',
my poor ass.

525
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,717
Is the man at home?

526
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,218
Yeah, come in,
he's still sleeping.

527
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,722
I'll go get him.

528
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:55,727
Give me a minute, ang!

529
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,729
Hey, tony,
how you feeling?

530
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,730
Better.

531
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,231
Good,
you look better.

532
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,233
I mean--
than i thought you would.

533
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,234
Artie called.

534
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,236
Hopalong che- se- dic',

535
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,237
Can't complain.

536
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,740
You want some coffee?
You in the neighborhood?

537
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,242
No, no, i got a call
about a boat, a sea ray 50.

538
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,744
I want you guy's
opinion on it.

539
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,745
What, now?

540
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,747
The owner's
got two offers.

541
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,248
I gotta decide
this morning.

542
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,249
Cuban guy.

543
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,751
Oh, yeah.

544
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,752
Okay.

545
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,253
Just throw some
clothes on.

546
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,254
C'mon.

547
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,255
Okay.

548
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,257
Oh, jesus.

549
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:32,263
Round 12.

550
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,766
You know, i could use
that cup of coffee.

551
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,267
Yeah, right.

552
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,770
We don't need
to see this.

553
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,773
I promised gab i'd pick up
10 bags of the garden mulch

554
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,275
from home depot before
i did anything this morning.

555
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,276
See?

556
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,278
And you're sitting there,
shame on you.

557
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,781
How long is
he taking up there?

558
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,293
I'm looking forward
to the graduation party.

559
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:44,335
So, who's ready
to go buy a boat?

560
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:49,841
Might as well
tell you now.

561
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,343
I bought the most
beautiful boat today.

562
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,344
Cool.

563
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,846
The 50 footer?

564
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,347
The very same.

565
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,849
I might as
well tell you.

566
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,851
I decided on columbia.

567
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:00,852
Oh!

568
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,361
You want?

569
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,864
It's a little early
in the day, no?

570
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,365
Sea legs.

571
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:20,371
Yeah, what the fuck.

572
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,373
You sure you want
to go out today, t.?

573
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,375
Just getting
over the trots.

574
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,379
Time and tide wait
for no man, right?

575
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,882
It's got a decent
displacement for its size.

576
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,384
Mill puts out about
700 horsepower.

577
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,385
Beautiful boat, tony.

578
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,387
I've been waiting
40 minutes.

579
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,889
The cuban had to go
see the harbor master,

580
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:43,394
but we're free to
give it a spin.

581
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:44,896
C'mon, puss.

582
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,912
Rides nice.

583
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,915
Let's go down below,
check out the mahagony.

584
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,416
C'mon.

585
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,956
Take a seat, puss.

586
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,459
Should we test- drop the anchor,
see how she holds?

587
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,964
Later.

588
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:59,470
Yeah, right.

589
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,972
Why you making me
do this,

590
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,974
you fat, fucking,
miserable piece of shit?

591
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,976
What, tony, what?

592
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,986
When did
they flip you?

593
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,488
Tell me,
don't lie.

594
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,489
Flip?

595
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,992
Who?
What?

596
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:58,529
They had me,
tony.

597
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:03,534
I was going away
for pushing h.

598
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,536
How long?

599
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,038
30 to life,
i had no choice.

600
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,539
How long?

601
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,043
How much
do they know?

602
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,046
A year and a half,
no less.

603
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,547
A year and
a fucking half

604
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,549
you been running your own
fucking gossip column?

605
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,552
Motherfucker!

606
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,556
Let me explain.

607
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,558
I fed them bullshit.

608
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,559
Nothing.

609
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,063
Whatcallmallit,
disinformation so i could live,

610
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:35,566
keep earning on any
subsistence level whatsoever.

611
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,068
I will
do nothing, tony,

612
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,070
nothing to put you
in harm's way,
all of yous!

613
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,073
That's how they got tipped off
about the bevilaqua hit, huh?

614
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,574
'Cause you did nothing.

615
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,578
On my mother's eyes,
that wasn't me!

616
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,582
Little things,
pickyoon shit.

617
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:55,086
Be specific.

618
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,587
They know about
the calling cards.

619
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,089
I'm not in that.

620
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,590
What else?

621
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,591
That's it.

622
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,592
That's is,
recently.

623
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,096
What not recently?

624
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,597
I'm thinking.

625
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,600
Fucking noise!

626
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,601
Where you going?

627
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:14,105
The other shit, none of it
amounted to anything.

628
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,107
I've been careful,
i've got this down.

629
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:20,111
I'm mind- fucking these donkeys
like you wouldn't believe.

630
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:24,115
Webistics?

631
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,617
Oh, jesus christ.

632
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,622
But mostly i talked up
the scatino bust- out,

633
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,624
nothing federal there
to link you, tony.

634
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,626
They need
serial numbers.

635
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,130
I'm telling you,
this disinformation shit

636
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,134
is an effective technique,
it's a freaking ace!

637
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,163
What's the matter
with you?

638
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,165
It's this
fucking swell.

639
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,666
I got food poisoning.

640
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,168
You don't see me
getting all fucked up.

641
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,669
Don't yell at me!

642
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,172
I'll fucking yell at you,
you don't like it?

643
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,699
We got any
good tequila?

644
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,735
You know that acupuncturist
down in puerto rico?

645
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,237
26...

646
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:31,242
tell you, this broad,
her ass was the second coming.

647
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:38,249
Never wore panties.

648
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,750
Brushed her teeth
with this shit.

649
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,253
Every night she'd drink me
under the fucking table.

650
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:46,257
And i'd eat her out
when i was down there.

651
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,768
Hey, puss.

652
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,771
Did she even
really exist?

653
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,779
Fucked up.

654
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,300
Not in the face,
okay?

655
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,303
You give me that?

656
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,804
Huh?

657
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,807
Keep my eyes?

658
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,311
You were like
a brother to me.

659
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:46,817
To all of us.

660
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,319
Yeah.

661
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,826
I'm starting t
o feel it now too.

662
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:00,831
My inner
ear balance is off.

663
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:20,351
What?

664
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,854
Jesus christ.

665
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,857
I gotta sit down.

666
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,360
I feel like
i can't stand.

667
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,362
Is that okay, tony?

668
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,863
That i sit?

669
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,381
Get the weights.

670
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,495
You're not gonna forget
to go to comp world,
get the gift?

671
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,996
If we gave her the one
i could've got

672
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,999
it would've had a smaller screen
but it would've cost us nothing.

673
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,001
Don't snap
at me, okay?

674
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:57,007
Don't press your luck
with this diarrhea.

675
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,509
I can't shake it.

676
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,510
Whose fault is that?

677
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,016
Hello.

678
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,017
Put anthony on.

679
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,019
Don't call here.

680
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,522
I am at
newark airport.

681
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:17,528
We've been held here
since 9:00 this morning.

682
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,030
Your mother is still
at the airport.

683
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,032
Tough shit.

684
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,035
Go get anthony,
i need a lawyer.

685
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,038
I'm in
airport security.

686
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,040
She's at
airport security.

687
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,044
I can't do it,
i can't call.

688
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,546
I don't know
what to do.

689
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:41,051
They say that anthony
gave me a stolen ticket.

690
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,554
They're gonna
call the fbi.

691
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,056
Here, you better--
i don't know.

692
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:50,561
The fun never stops.

693
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,562
What?

694
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,564
Anthony,
the tickets are stolen.

695
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,065
What the fuck?

696
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,066
What did you say?

697
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,568
Did you?

698
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,069
Ma, i'll send someone
down there to pick you up.

699
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,571
But i don't know
what you're talking about.

700
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,573
Okay?

701
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:06,076
Jesus christ.

702
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,579
How fucking hard is it
to get on an airplane?

703
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,086
What do you want?

704
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,588
Agent harris.

705
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,089
Anthony soprano.

706
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,091
We have a warrant
to search your house,

707
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,093
property, and
your family vehicle.

708
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,595
What are you looking
for today, boss?

709
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,096
Stolen airline tickets,

710
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,098
constituting mail fraud,
wire fraud,

711
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,100
and any other
federal violation.

712
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,103
Let's see
your warrant.

713
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,605
You can also
see the tickets.

714
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,607
We found them
in your suburban.

715
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,609
You have the right
to remain silent.

716
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,110
I bought them,
talk to my lawyer.

717
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,112
You have the right
to an attorney.

718
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,114
What, are you a fuckin' parrot?
What'd i just say?

719
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:47,117
We're entitled to search
the rest of the domicile.

720
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:52,122
Let's go.

721
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,624
Upstairs.

722
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,627
Michael,
over here.

723
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,629
Our daughter is
graduating high school.

724
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,131
You can't wait a few days
to persecute him?

725
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,633
To persecute us?

726
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:07,638
Jerry,
get the door.

727
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:15,646
I'm gonna keep trying, mink,
i don't trust that secretary.

728
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,647
Oh, my god.

729
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,148
Med, it's alright,

730
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,150
i'll be home in
a couple hours,
don't worry.

731
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,653
I'm graduating tomorrow!

732
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:34,665
Let's get outta here.

733
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,668
What, do you guys need another
picture of me for your wallets?

734
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:44,174
Other hand.

735
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,676
Tony soprano,
weak in the knees,

736
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,678
can't stand
the heat?

737
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,179
I got food poisoning.

738
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,181
You think this bothers me,
you fuck head?

739
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:55,185
This way.

740
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,198
I gotta
tell you, frank,

741
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:12,202
i'd forget about any deli tray
coming your way in the future.

742
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,721
Meadow,
are you sleeping?

743
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,222
Yes.

744
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:39,229
I want to
talk to you.

745
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:43,233
God, am i so not
going to miss this.

746
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,246
You have to understand
that your father means well.

747
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:06,256
He's given his life for you,
for your brother, for us.

748
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:07,758
All i'm saying,

749
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:12,262
how you reacted downstairs,
now you're sitting
up here by yourself.

750
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,766
I know it was
embarrassing for you, but...

751
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:20,771
anyway, if you ever
wanted to talk--

752
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,272
this is
who dad is.

753
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,775
My friends
don't judge me.

754
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:32,282
And fuck them if they do,
i'll cut them off.

755
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,284
I knew i was giving her
a bad ticket.

756
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:38,789
That voice
, that voice.

757
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,291
It's done, tony, over.

758
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,793
My advice now
is to put it behind you.

759
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,295
If this is all there is,
these 23 tickets,

760
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:49,800
they don't have "bubkes"
and they know it.

761
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,302
I know it's a small thing,
but that's the fucking point.

762
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,306
One more minute,
if i could've just stood there

763
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,309
saying,"yes, ma,
okay, ma, i hear you, ma",

764
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,812
one more minute,
i wouldn't be in this spot.

765
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:05,315
I beat a homicide
and now i fucked up, neil.

766
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,817
I blew
an easy one.

767
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:07,818
I blew everything.

768
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,319
Tony.

769
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,822
No, we got fuckin'
federal charges,
we got the faa.

770
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,824
Before this is over

771
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,325
they're gonna pin that
egypt air thing on me

772
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:19,329
and you fucking
know it!

773
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,332
I got predicates
up the ass,

774
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,834
fucking rico case.

775
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:24,835
30 to life.

776
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,837
Don't think
about that now.

777
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,339
You'll make bail.

778
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,842
There's no
capital crimes.

779
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:37,848
Get on with life.

780
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,871
My mother,
my fucking goddamn idiot

781
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,372
of a mother.

782
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,875
You'd think she was never
married to johnny soprano.

783
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:09,379
Is there something else
bothering you, anthony?

784
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,381
That's not enough?

785
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,384
Fucking demented,
old bat.

786
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,888
You're so angry
with your mother
and the airline tickets.

787
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:21,391
I'm not saying
that it's not serious,

788
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:25,395
but a year ago your mother
colluded to have you killed,

789
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,397
yet you never say
"boo" about that,

790
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:32,903
even when
i try to elicit.

791
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,405
If she tried to have
you killed a year ago,

792
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,408
believe me,
in your childhood,

793
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:43,914
she's inflicted serious
psychic injuries
that are still there.

794
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:47,417
Poor me.

795
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,927
And your father,
the gangster, tough guy.

796
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,430
Did he protect you kids
from borderline mother?

797
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,932
What the hell
was going on there?

798
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,934
What is this?

799
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,437
Little snacks for thought
for me to take home?

800
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:10,941
I haven't pushed you enough
to confront these things.

801
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:17,447
Somewhere along the line,
i became frightened of you.

802
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,449
Frightened.

803
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:25,455
Maybe i should've seen
that clearer in the beginning.

804
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:30,460
Maybe, baby.

805
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,964
Rage, anthony,

806
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,968
is a big, loud, flaming,
self distraction

807
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,470
from feelings that
are even more frightening.

808
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,974
What feelings
might those be?

809
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,975
Sadness.

810
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:50,480
You go off on a racist rant
about indian food,

811
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,986
your demented,
old bat of a mother.

812
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,487
What else
has happened?

813
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:01,992
Nothing.

814
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,995
After two years treating you,
i've learned things.

815
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,998
And i pick up sorrow
coming from you.

816
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,510
I had a dream
i fucked your brains out,

817
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,512
right on that desk.

818
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,014
You loved it.

819
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,516
You threw that at me
like a rock.

820
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:30,020
Sadness, anthony,
stay with that.

821
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:38,528
Mommy tried to kill you
and you gave her
airline tickets.

822
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,529
Fuck you.

823
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,031
And now you're
really in trouble.

824
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,532
I'm gonna beat this shit,
you kidding me?

825
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:45,535
With that...

826
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:57,047
anthony...

827
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:10,060
scott richard sipronowski.

828
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:26,576
Meadow mariangela soprano.

829
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,587
Jonathan tiffen.

830
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:50,100
Anthony tomasello.

831
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,102
It's fucking
graduation day.

832
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:57,107
So i might as well
take this opportunity.

833
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:01,611
I'm proposing you
to get your button.

834
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,613
I fucking
deserve it.

835
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,616
Got no spleen, gene.

836
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,619
Congratulations.

837
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,121
Thank you,
thank you.

838
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,623
Yeah.

839
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:19,129
Oh.

840
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,631
What the fuck?

841
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,134
That's right,
get an education.

842
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,636
Excuse us.

843
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,139
Carmella sees you,
she's gonna cut you
a new asshole.

844
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,640
I'm leaving.

845
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,655
It's great to see
your kid graduate, huh?

846
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,158
The youth,
that's what's important.

847
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,160
What we do
is small potatoes.

848
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,163
And eric,
state college, right?

849
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,664
He got accepte
d to georgetown.

850
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,666
There's a little
money pinch.

851
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:00,170
I heard you and charlene
split up.

852
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,671
Christine.

853
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,174
I'm getting
the fuck out of here,

854
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,176
i got a job
on a ranch out west.

855
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,178
What?

856
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,180
Don't make me
fucking laugh.

857
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,683
I lived in new mexico
until i was 11, remember?

858
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,185
You ever try riding?

859
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:17,187
Uh, no.

860
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,689
The airlines are running
specials non- stop to nevada,

861
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,193

half hours drive.

862

You should
come hang out.

New day.

864
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:32,202
Vegas, huh?

865
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,704
Alright, david,
take care of yourself.

866
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,206
Drive safe.

867
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,214
I'm so
proud of you.

868
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,222
Sal knew it was today,
i told him over and over.

869
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,224
He's so
self centered.

870

Here you go, sweetheart,
