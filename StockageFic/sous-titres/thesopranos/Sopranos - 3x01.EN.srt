1
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,531
How's your mom, ton'?

2
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,033
The same.

3
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,534
But my ex- goomar's cousin,

4
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,503
i got her coming in
to take care of her.

5
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:37,006
Russian girl.

6
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,008
Who was it telling me
about the bevilaqua kid?

7
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:41,511
You know that family has
money from construction?

8
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,012
That fucking matthew...

9
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:44,514
was never any good.

10
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,516
He sure cried li
ke a baby that night.

11
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:50,019
I think the family was
relieved he got taken out.

12
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,021
What are you
gonna eat?

13
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,023
Hey, waiter!

14
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,027
That's the closest
cw- 16 ever got tony

15
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:01,030
to discussing
the bevilaqua
murder on tape?

16
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,032
I think at this point
it's time to consider

17
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:05,034
16 bonpensiero compost.

18
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:08,037
Bonpensiero...

19
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:11,541
was crucial to
the webistics
stock fraud case.

20
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,543
So, rico- wise.

21
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,046
The airline tickets.

22
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,548
Mail and wire fraud.

23
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:20,049
Especially if
the mother testifies

24
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,051
in exchange for immunity.

25
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,554
C'mon, whose
own mother's gonna
testify against him?

26
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,556
I say focus on
his garbage business.

27
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,058
Extortion,

28
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,560
interstate trucking.

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,062
It's also the most
likely to yield
a prosecutable murder.

30
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,064
Richie aprile,
exactly.

31
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:38,067
No doubt about
it the cartel
had him whacked.

32
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,570
Okay, garbage, but tony
shows real due diligence

33
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,572
when it comes to
electronic debugging.

34
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,073
What about
the home?

35
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,576
Bonpensiero told me
him and tony talk
in the basement there

36
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,077
on more than
one occasion.

37
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,079
His own basement,
really?

38
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,581
Where's the due
diligence there?

39
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,083
Tony avoids talking business
in the house if he can.

40
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,586
But if he has to, he'll take
somebody out by the pool.

41
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,589
Except there he
fears parabolics.

42
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:02,091
The basement
has these
noisy a. C. Ducts.

43
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,594
He turns on the air
and he feels it's safe.

44
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,549
"Surreptitiously
enter said premises

45
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,050
and leave
without notice."

46
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,552
This is a "sneak
'n peek" warrant.

47
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,553
Correct,
your honor.

48
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,555
I said you could enter
the basement to drop a wire.

49
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,056
I mean, how many times
do we have to impact

50
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,558
this family's
right to privacy?

51
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,059
First, when the
home is empty,

52
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,060
we enter to take
sound levels,

53
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,062
determine where to
best place the wire.

54
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,564
Once that's decided,

55
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,566
the listening devi
ce will be fabricated

56
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,568
and we will reente
r to install it.

57
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,572
See that they limit
both entrances to
the basement only.

58
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,074
It's not a
"better homes and
gardens" tour.

59
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,578
Happy hunting.

60
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,595
The coffeemaker's gotta be
plugged in for it to work!

61
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,066
Same time
as yesterday.

62
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,073
Listen, i'll save
you some gas.

63
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,075
I'm just going
down to the
stationary store,

64
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,576
then i'll
be right back.

65
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,078
You don't gotta follow
me like yesterday.

66
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,079
Alright?

67
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,085
In order for the s. E. T. Te
to drop a wire in that house,

68
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,087
there's gotta be nobody at
home for at least two hours.

69
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,089
Actually, the maid is
gone for a little while

70
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,090
on tuesday afternoons.

71
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,591
Gone why?

72
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,094
English language
classes, she's getting
a u. S. Citizenship.

73
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,097
She's gone from the house
from 1:00 till about 2:45.

74
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,598
An hour class,

75
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,600
then she and her
husband usually have
a picnic lunch.

76
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,104
He's applying for
citizenship, too.

77
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,106
What's his
name again?

78
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,109
Stasiu
wosilius.

79
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,111
I'll run that by
anti- terrorism...

80
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,112
just for laughs.

81
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,115
Carmela's gone the same hours
on tuesday, tennis lessons.

82
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,117
As long as we have somebody
on her during tennis,

83
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,618
and on the maid
and tony

84
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,120
and everybody that's
got a key to the house.

85
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,122
The daughter's at
columbia, lives
in the dorms.

86
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,125
Why risk it,
she's 45 minutes
away via the g. W.

87
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,626
Put somebody on her.

88
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,128
Anyone of them
breaks for home,

89
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,131
we need to warn
the s. E. T. Team to get
the hell out of there.

90
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,669
Unit one,
this is control.

91
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,171
Baby bing
headed your way.

92
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,173
Copy, control.

93
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,700
Unit two, you got
badabing headed your way.

94
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,203
Excuse me.

95
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,705
Unit three, mrs.
Bing also in motion.

96
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,233
Unit five, you have visu
al contact of princess bing?

97
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,734
Roger, control.

98
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,249
Unit four,
in approximately one minute,
you'll have the maid,

99
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,250
gray jetta.

100
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,252
S. E. Team, the
location reads secure.

101
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,753
You have one hour
and 30 minutes.

102
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,754
Roger, control.

103
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,773
Control, we're headed into
the sausage factory.

104
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,825
Oh, look at this.

105
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,826
Just in time
for lunch.

106
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,328
Set a plate.

107
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,330
You got it.

108
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,832
I had him dart i
t in the shoulde
r like she wanted

109
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,335
and reinforced the hem.

110
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,836
It shouldn't hav
e torn like that.

111
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,338
Beautiful coat.

112
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,339
What the fuck
you doing?

113
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,840
Lunch is ready.

114
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,342
Wash my hands.

115
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,843
You just washed
your hands.

116
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,345
Then i tied
my shoes.

117
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,846
So what?

118
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,349
I can't stand touching
fucking shoe laces.

119
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,850
You ever go to
tie your shoes

120
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,353
and you notice the end
of your laces are wet?

121
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,854
From what?

122
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,356
Why would
they be wet?

123
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,857
I got no
fucking idea.

124
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,860
You go in public bathrooms
, you stand at the urinals.

125
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,861
Oh, c'mon,
will ya?

126
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,363
He's asking me,
i'm tellin' him.

127
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,864
And frankly,
it's important.

128
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,866
Even if the
lace is dry,

129
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,868
and even if you
don't touch the
body of the shoe.

130
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,371
Bacteria and
virus migrate
from the sole up.

131
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,872
You see this on tv?

132
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,375
I gotta watc
h tv to figure
out the world?

133
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,378
Your average men's
shit house is a
fucking sewer.

134
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,879
You look at
ladies' johns,

135
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,382
you could eat maple walnut
ice cream from the toilets.

136
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,884
Ah, there's exceptions.

137
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,886
But a men's...

138
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,888
piss all over
the fucking floor.

139
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,891
Urinals jammed
with cigarette
s and mothball cakes.

140
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,894
And they can pour all
the fucking ice they want
down there, my friend,

141
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,896
it does nothin
g to kill germs.

142
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,398
Even if you keep
your shoes tied,

143
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,400
and you're not dragging
your laces through urine.

144
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,901
Shut the fuck up!

145
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,406
Control, this
is s. E. T. Four,

146
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,907
i have access
to the box.

147
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,411
I'm disabling the line
to the phone company.

148
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,414
Phone line to
the alarm company's
now neutralized.

149
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,915
Go ahead,
cut it.

150
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,418
Hold your breath
, i'm clipping
the siren wire.

151
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,921
Pick it, wilson.

152
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,927
Control, we are
working on entry,

153
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,429
estimate
three or four minutes.

154
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,947
You're not hungry?

155
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,450
Have some bracioll'.

156
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,951
No, thanks.

157
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,455
I got no appetite.

158
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,458
Today would've
been our birthday.

159
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,460
Our birthday?

160
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:37,963
Oh, yeah.

161
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,966
Spoons.

162
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:42,968
Hey, happy birthday.

163
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:43,969
How old are you?

164
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:44,970
51.

165
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,473
Who was born first,
you or spoons?

166
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,976
Philip was my kid
brother by 11 minutes.

167
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,978
Hey, it was a
fucking tragedy.

168
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,982
What are you
gonna do?

169
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,485
It's the life we chose,
am i right, pat?

170
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,488
But my brother was never
a heavy guy with anybody.

171
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,491
He was a sweet,
gentle man.

172
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,994
Your brother was
your twin brother.

173
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,496
Philly.

174
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,500
Friends like u
s called him "spoons".

175
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,503
Somebody whacked
the kid

176
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,005
a couple months
before you came over.

177
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,507
You big mouth fuck!

178
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,508
Fuck!

179
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:29,014
It's you identical
twin or the
other kind?

180
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,015
Identical.

181
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,017
Here, have something
to eat.

182
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,020
There's a twin bond.

183
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,023
Unless you
experienced it

184
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,525
you can't understand it.

185
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,526
You okay with
onions, right?

186
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,528
Maybe it sounds
fucking crazy to you.

187
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,531
Hey, nothing sounds
crazy anymore.

188
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,532
The older i get.

189
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,035
It's over, right?

190
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,544
Don't it happen that
identical twins
a lot of times,

191
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,546
they'll die within a coupl
e of days of each other?

192
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,548
That would've been
okay with me, believe me.

193
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,550
Hey!

194
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,055
I miss him so much.

195
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,557
Well, that's natural.

196
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,059
But you're
with us now,

197
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,562
so why don't you leave
the morbid shit

198
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,065
back at junior's crew
and have a happy birthday.

199
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,066
Happy birthday.

200
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,568
Salut.

201
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,069
You want to
commit suicide,

202
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,572
tie your shoes and have
a bite of bracioll'.

203
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,077
Hey, stoonad,
it's a joke, c'mon!

204
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,086
Hello.

205
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,090
God don't
transfer me now.

206
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,093
Adriana la cerva.

207
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,097
How green was my
fucking valley?

208
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,098
Carmela.

209
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,100
Hi, ed.

210
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,602
Hey.

211
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,104
This is my friend
i was telling you about,
adriana la cerva.

212
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,105
Ed restuccia.

213
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,608
Well, i'm delighted to
teach any pal of carm's.

214
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,110
She's my most
disciplined student.

215
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,112
Perfect muscle tone
doesn't hurt either.

216
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,116
Unfortunately, listen,
i have to apologize, carm.

217
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,618
I thought i
called everybody.

218
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,620
But i'm not gonna be
teaching here anymore.

219
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,123
Everything's alright,
i hope.

220
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,627
Yeah, basically, kitty got
this dot- com job in san diego.

221
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,129
So, we're moving.

222
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,631
I didn't even know
you were married.

223
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,132
Yeah.

224
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,635
But you're in luck.

225
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,136
Birgit here is
taking over for me.

226
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,638
How wonderful.

227
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,140
I never even
played like once.

228
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,642
That's why
you're here.

229
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,644
Oh, carm,
before you start,

230
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,146
it'll really help
if i can get letters
of recommendation.

231
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,659
Oh, by the way,
this company
kitty's joining,

232
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,160
they sell antiques
on the web,

233
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,662
so if you ever wanted
a special piece...

234
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,665
i don't have antiques,
my house is traditional.

235
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,667
Um, i'm cutting in
to your lesson, sorry.

236
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,168
Carmela, bye.

237
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,670
Nice meeting you.

238
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,671
Take care.

239
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,185
Baby bing is leaving
school property.

240
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,187
I'm on it.

241
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,690
Taking orders, dude.

242
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,190
Peach snapple.

243
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,191
Me, too.

244
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,192
I only g
ot two bucks.

245
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,197
Mrs. Celeste almost saw
my board in my locker.

246
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,700
What kind of retard rule
is that, no boards at school?

247
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,202
Why can't they see how usefu
boards would be at school?

248
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,704
Like in the cafeteria.

249
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,707
Each person on line coul
d just roll past the food pans

250
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,209
or whatever and make
the decisions in
like half the time.

251
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,210
Yeah.

252
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,712
That food tastes
like ass anyway.

253
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,221
Alright, hit it!

254
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,233
I only had eno
ugh for one snapple.

255
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,735
A. J. , give me a hit
of your snapple.

256
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,736
Don't backwash.

257
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,239
I'm not doing anything
for this school.

258
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,741
My mom's all
,"get involved".

259
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,743
It's like,"hello,
i am involved...

260
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,744
with boarding."

261
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,245
Oh, it's egon.

262
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,747
Hey, kosma.

263
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,749
Okay!

264
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,255
Where you

265
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,256
Orthodontist.

266
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,257
S'up, slim?

267
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,759
What class you
guys ditchin'?

268
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,760
Assembly.

269
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,261
Excellent jersey.

270
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,263
Yeah, wait...

271
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,765
you went out
for j. V. Ball?

272
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,266
Yeah.

273
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,268
Excuse me, m
r. Quadripleg
ic of the future.

274
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,770
Remind me no
t to visit you
in the hospital.

275
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,271
It is a cool shirt.

276
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,272
Yeah.

277
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,275
Whoa!

278
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,276
What position?

279
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,277
Douchebag.

280
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,795
Okay, cut it!

281
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,304
...jell- o shots...

282
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,306
on bhs,

283
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,808
on bhs,

284
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,310
fight right
through that line!

285
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,813
Run that ball
to the goal line!

286
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,316
Y'all
should've come.

287
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,819
Where'd you go?

288
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,322
We started off
at smoke's as usual,

289
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,326
but we wound up
at this place ruby
foos'round, um...

290
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,329
broadway and 65th
or something.

291
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,332
It was so fun.

292
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,335
God, did i
get hammered.

293
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,837
Don't you have
a quiz today?

294
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,840
Frosh week technically
ended at midnight.

295
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,341
What do they expect?

296
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,843
I'll study now.

297
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,344
I know, i
have a bio lab,

298
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,346
i haven't read
any of the chapters.

299
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,349
Aww...

300
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,851
still miss
new jersey?

301
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,353
It's only like
half an hour away.

302
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,355
It's just
this transition.

303
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,857
It's a lot of work.

304
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,860
I just think new york
is an experience

305
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,862
that unalterably
changes a person.

306
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,363
It is really great.

307
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,366
All this freedom
of college.

308
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,880
When did you have
your last cocktail?

309
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,382
11:30 this morning.

310
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,334
Jesus, caitlin.

311
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,855
"What is the most
important right

00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,358
Right to vote.

314
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,863
Special capers
from italy.

315
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,865
Soprano kids
don't like them.

316
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,869
"Who wrote'the star
spangled banner'?"

317
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:15,370
Martin luther king.

318
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,372
Stasiu,
you know this.

319
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:19,374
I want to eat.

320
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,878
Francis scott key.

321
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:28,884
"What holiday was celebrated
for the first time

322
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,886

323
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,387
Martin luther king.

324
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,388
Stasiu!

325
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,891
That's answer
to number 49,

326
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,393
"who was civil
rights leader?"

327
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:43,398
Which sandwich
is for you?

328
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,900
I don't care.

329
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:01,416
Ready.

330
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,919
Start shooting
over here.

331
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,922
Back in lodz,

332
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,926
i was an engineer
with 20 employees

333
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:13,929
and a grant from the sta
te to do autonomous research.

334
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,933
Oh, it bores you?

335
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,939
Don't take those
steak knives out.

336
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,942
Put them with capers,
i take them home.

337
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,457
That's just for
anthony jr.

338
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,459
Looks like they're
expecting world war iii.

339
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,461
More likely
the columbo wars.

340
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,464
Hey, he's got
the black & decker.

341
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,967
I got one of those.

342
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:00,475
120- gallon
water heater.

343
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,978
My house we're shivering
after a shower and a half.

344
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,981
Whoa, wait a
minute, go back.

345
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:09,484
Look at the brown water,
right there, freeze it.

346
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:10,485
What?

347
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:11,987
You don't see it?

348
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:15,991
Creep forward, give us
some magnification.

349
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:18,994
That baby's
gonna blow.

350
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,495
My dad was a plumber.

351
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:22,497
Tony's got about six months
left to go on that lining.

352
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,499
Aw, it's a shame that
we can't warn him.

353
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,002
Maybe during the discovery
phase of his rico trial,

354
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,004
we can inform his lawy
er that tony needs a plumber.

355
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,006
Except that's
at least a
year from now

356
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:33,008
and by that
time...boom!

357
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,013
Okay, now you
see that lamp there?

358
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,033
Is that the c- 140
microphone?

359
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,534
They took
sound readings.

360
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,036
That's a new one.

361
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,538
Assumption is
the wiseguys
stand and talk

362
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,540
where the air
conditioning's loudest.

363
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,542
And that's where
we're gonna place it.

364
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,068
When's this puppy
going in?

365
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,570
Tomorrow.

366
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,593
Okay, fellas and gals,
our big day.

367
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:00,595
And as i speak
, i have baby bing...

368
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:03,098
right on time.

369
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,599
Handing off to
you, george.

370
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,609
I'm on baby bing's
car pool vehicle.

371
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,122
Furio giunta
cadillac dts returning.

372
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:30,125
Went past me up the street
about five minutes ago.

373
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,626
Well, well, well.

374
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,129
Der bingle's up early today,
he's in the caddy.

375
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:36,131
Copied, i've got
the handoff.

376
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:37,632
Roger that.

377
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,159
How's the
new stock doing?

378
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,161
Up three at the close
of the dow yesterday.

379
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,662
Another two
so far today.

380
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:09,664
Beautiful.

381
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:13,168
Listen, ton', i think
we may have a problem.

382
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:14,669
Log off.

383
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,671
That cookies shit
makes me nervous.

384
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:21,676
I think we may have
a problem about our
friend, the twin.

385
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,178
Yeah, so?

386
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,679
My goombah,
joey flies,

387
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,681
he hangs out at the
nest in bloomfield.

388
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:28,183
Gyp la monica's place.

389
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,184
Yeah.

390
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,685
So, our friend is
a fixture down there

391
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:34,156
and joey says lately he's been
into the booze very heavy.

392
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,157
He's all fucked up.

393
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:38,160
A couple of times, i had to
pick him up off the floor.

394
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,661
So, chip went to him.

395
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,663
"Pat, what the fuck?

396
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:44,666
Can i do anything",
etcetera.

397
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:47,169
Patsy launches into
this single malt diatribe

398
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,171
about how people can
smile in your face

399
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:50,672
and still
be a villain

400
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,175
and that he knows
how his brother died

401
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:56,178
and who's responsible
and all that there.

402
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:57,179
He mention me
by name?

403
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,181
No, me neither.

404
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:03,185
You hearing this?

405
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,187
How the fuck would patsy
know we clipped spoons?

406
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,189
What, that fucking
twin telepathy?

407
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:10,192
Somebody's putting
ideas in this
kid's head.

408
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,195
Sweet shot, really
beautiful shot.

409
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,697
He just set himself
up perfectly on
this hole...

410
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:18,700
don't let us interfere
with your golf game.

411
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,702
Maybe a cop
trying to flip him.

412
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:24,706
Getting him worked
up with theories.

413
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,711
He was talking weird
the other day.

414
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,213
What should we do?

415
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,714
We brought him ove
r from junior's crew

416
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,216
to keep an
eye on him.

417
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,718
So, that's what
we'll keep doing.

418
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,222
I mean, make
no mistake.

419
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:42,224
Part of this guy
loves you.

420
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:45,227
But it's gotta be hard
coming into work every day

421
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,729
looking right into the eyes
of the guy you know

422
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,731
ordered your
brother whacked.

423
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:51,733
And even having
to smile.

424
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:55,237
We always
have the option.

425
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,746
Mrs. Bing in motion.

426
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:07,249
S. E. Team, we got the
housekeeper to wait out,

427
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,251
then the house
is all yours.

428
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,266
Hit low to
high, carmela

429
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,768
and think
about your grip.

430
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,271
Fuck!

431
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,772
No, that's good.

432
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,774
Nice extension.

433
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:33,775
Ah!

434
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:35,777
Racquet back,
carmela, c'mon!

435
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:41,783
Fuck.

436
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,285
No, that's good.

437
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,287
Shouldn't that housekeeper
be out of there?

438
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:46,788
Edge closer,
take a look.

439
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,291
Ow!

440
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,793
Okay, guys,
collect.

441
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:54,296
Actually, ade, let m
e work with you here.

442
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:56,298
Carm, you collect.

443
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:13,315
Maid's car's
still here.

444
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,322
Okay, let's just focus,
be serious...

445
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:23,325
and follow through.

446
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,827
Right, right.

447
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,829
Almost, almost.

448
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,338
Did you hear
something?

449
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:37,839
I don't know.

450
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,846
We think we
heard something.

451
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:47,849
From inside the
sausage factory.

452
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,351
Hold your position.

453
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:52,854
Okay.

454
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:54,356
Stand up straight,
okay?

455
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:55,357
Okay.

456
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:56,858
Here you go.

457
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:58,860
Low to high.

458
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,362
I can't do this
with you.

459
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,882
She's leaving
the court.

460
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,896
Der bingle's leaving
the bing, too.

461
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:50,912
This does
not look good.

462
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:54,416
Mrs. Bing bearing north
on grandview avenue.

463
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,921
She's turned
onto foxwood road.

464
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,923
She's heading
toward the factory.

465
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,931
Abort,
repeat, abort.

466
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,434
S. E. Team get the hell
out of there now!

467
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,436
Abort, andy,
it's not a go.

468
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,438
Repeat, we
are not a go.

469
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,458
It must be a crisis
with one of the children.

470
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:40,462
Control, i place baby bing
in the school building.

471
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,464
Unit five report.

472
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:44,466
That's a big roger
from this end, too.

473
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,968
She went into her room
about two minutes ago.

474
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:49,471
I heard her tell her friend
she was gonna get some sleep.

475
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,473
You think
somebody made us?

476
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,475
I don't know.

477
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:56,478
But we're finished
for today here,
ladies and gentlemen.

478
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,488
10 years.

479
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:09,991
10 fucking years he
said this fucking
thing would last!

480
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:10,992
Fuck!

481
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,494
You said that, tony.

482
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:13,495
Are you doing
anything over there?

483
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,997
I told you not to put
this shit down here!

484
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:22,504
Fuck!

485
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:24,506
Fuck!

486
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,508
Never mind tha
t, save the pictures.

487
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,020
The prom.

488
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,523
Look at this,
fucking ruined.

489
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:43,525
Mr. Ruggerio
, thank god.

490
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,527
The fucking
water heater blew.

491
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:47,529
Just blew!

492
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:50,532
Your guarantee's
gotta be expired by now.

493
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,535
Madonn'.

494
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:57,038
Do we have any idea
what went down?

495
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,540
No.

496
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,542
It's a family
emergency of
some sort.

497
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,043
The plumber's truc
k went up there.

498
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:05,046
Look, we don't
have any idea
what happened, so...

499
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,550
let's not speculate.

500
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,553
All i know is that
we're shit out of luck
till next tuesday.

501
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:15,557
Send somebody up
there tomorrow,
stake the house out.

502
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:18,560
Maybe we got a
long- term problem.

503
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,563
Well, we're heading
back to quantico.

504
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:25,066
We got a job in denver
day after tomorrow.

505
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,067
A mosque.

506
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,076
Morning.

507
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:36,578
Hi.

508
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,079
We'd like to get onto your property

509
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,581
so we can trim some
growth in the back

510
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,583
that's posing a safety hazard

511
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,585
with all the powerline
s running through there.

512
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,087
Okay.

513
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:47,589
Go around
the side.

514
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:49,090
While we're at it,

515
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:51,092
our records show t
hat our repair department

516
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:53,094
had some crews
out here yesterday.

517
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:56,097
Were you affected
by any of the
shortfalls?

518
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:58,600
Yesterday?

519
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:00,602
No.

520
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,605
Oh.

521
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:06,107
The people next door
have had some trucks
go up there i think,

522
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:08,610
but, no,
we've been fine.

523
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,112
How about them?

524
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,615
Do you know if
everything's okay
over there?

525
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:17,118
As far as i know.

526
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,120
Well, we'll go
talk to them.

527
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,623
Probably you should.

528
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,125
They're in the--

529
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,126
pardon?

530
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:28,630
Nothing.

531
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,633
They're different.

532
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:32,634
For this neighborhood,

533
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:34,636
they're a little
different, that's all.

534
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,139
We'll get busy
in the back.

535
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,641
Thanks.

536
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,651
Still nothing
out of the ordinary.

537
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:52,153
Is the kid home
sick from school?

538
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,156
I don't see him.

539
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:57,659
But, i see an arm,
a piece of robe.

540
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,160
It could be tony.

541
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,163
He's eating
sugar pops.

542
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:04,165
Wait, somebody just walked
past the kitchen window.

543
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,668
No, that's the maid.

544
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,671
They're good.

545
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:11,673
Fresh this morning,
ferrara's.

546
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:13,174
How are things over
on bloomfield avenue?

547
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:16,678
The cuban was at
the casino last night.

548
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:19,681
And by the way,
big john's okay
with a 60- 40 split

549
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,683
because we own
the building.

550
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:22,684
What the hell?

551
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:23,685
What?

552
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:32,193
What the fuck,
is that pat parisi?

553
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:36,698
Oh, shit.

554
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,204
What should we do?

555
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:56,217
He's drunk!

556
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,219
Anyway, i told johnny,
i says,"look--

557
00:33:58,219 --> 00:33:59,721
let's talk
downstairs.

558
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:12,734
Motherfucker...

559
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,238
i don't understand
this at all.

560
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,742
Cocksucker.

561
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,263
What's up, ike?

562
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:45,266
What happened at
the soprano house was
the water heater blew.

563
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:48,770
Our unit saw ruggerio
come back with a flatbed

564
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,271
and haul the old one out.

565
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:51,773
Ruggerio...

566
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:53,274
a plumber?

567
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,276
Why?

568
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,278
My sister used t
o live up near there.

569
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,280
She was friend
s with mrs. Ruggerio.

570
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,783
Yeah, it's mr. Ruggerio's
neighborhood.

571
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:05,286
Anyway, we have to
get this thing in there

572
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,288
before our warrant
goes stale.

573
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,791
Boy, we've had eve
ry one of tony's phones

574
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,293
bugged for four years.

575
00:35:12,293 --> 00:35:14,796
But the guy says
less than harpo marx.

576
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:16,297
Next tuesday.

577
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:18,299
The wire drop's
a definite go.

578
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,806
Der bingle has
left the building.

579
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,813
They fucking
made me.

580
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:34,315
Wire drop is
still a go.

581
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,818
Confirming access
to switching box.

582
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:38,820
I'm going in.

583
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:47,328
Unit two,
mrs. Bing in motion.

584
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,832
Just the maid
and it's all yours.

585
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:52,834
Copy that.

586
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:57,338
Siren wire's cut.

587
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,343
The teacher
knows nothing.

588
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:05,346
Why do you quarrel
with him always?

589
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:07,849
English is his
first language.

590
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:09,851
C'mon,
waste our time

591
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,853
with those childish
trick questions.

592
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,855
"Stop,
men at work".

593
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,356
And how do we know
it doesn't mean

594
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:18,359
"stop all men
who are working"?

595
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,862
He shouldn't have taken
a point off my grade.

596
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,865
He thinks i'm a ha
ck cabbie from pakistan.

597
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:26,367
Lilli, lilli!

598
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,869
Where ar
e you going?

599
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,871
I'm going
back to work!

600
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,384
Excuse me, ma'am.

601
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:44,385
Scared me.

602
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:45,887
I'm sorry,
can you tell me,

603
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,889
is the west essex
language school
around here?

604
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:48,890
There.

605
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,893
Is it coed?

606
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,394
What?

607
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:55,897
You wouldn't happen
to be polish by any
chance, would you?

608
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:56,898
Yes.

609
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,402
My grandmother
is polish.

610
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:13,414
It's locked today.

611
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,421
Yeah, yeah,
my grandmother, she--

612
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:21,923
excuse me.

613
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,925
How can i
help you, sir?

614
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,927
I was just wonderi
ng if i could ask you

615
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,929
a few questions ab
out the language school.

616
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:29,931
How is it?

617
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:33,434
Sweet mother
of jesus.

618
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:35,937
Look at her today.

619
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:44,946
Hi, ade!

620
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,448
Hi, guys!

621
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:48,950
Be back
in a second.

622
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,452
Listen to this
now,"hi, ade!"

623
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:54,455
Hi.

624
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:56,958
Hey, you.

625
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,461
I love those.

626
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:01,963
Oh, yeah?

627
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,965
Oh, my god.

628
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,466
Where did you
get them?

629
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,468
Near my house.

630
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:09,470
Ay- ay- ay.

631
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,482
Wait, wait, wait,
this table's been moved.

632
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:22,984
Cleanup fr
om the flood.

633
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,986
It's not under
the right duct anymore.

634
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,487
Should we
move it back?

635
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,990
What, two, three feet,
who's gonna notice?

636
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,493
Yeah, you know, wait,
wait, wait, somebody might.

637
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:35,496
You gotta figure though,
normal course of events,

638
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:38,499
tony will assume carmela
moved it back or the maid.

639
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,501
If anybody
even notices.

640
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,503
Make an
executive decision.

641
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:44,005
Grab an end.

642
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,008
Easy, easy.

643
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:48,509
When hadley heard i
was deferring a year,

644
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,512
she was like,
"well that's sketchy."

645
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:56,017
Steve said eric scatin
o hates montclair state.

646
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:57,518
And he's been doin
g all this acid.

647
00:38:57,518 --> 00:38:59,520
God, he was
so straightedge.

648
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,022
Hi, caitlin.

649
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:03,024
Hi.

650
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:06,527
This is hunter, my
friend from home i
was telling you about.

651
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,535
Wow.

652
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,539
Do you like
citron jell- o shots?

653
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,542
Actually, i haven't had
any alcohol in a week.

654
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:25,046
I know, i was gonna
say we should go
over to panchito's,

655
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,048
but i remembered,
bad idea.

656
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,552
I went over to
the health center.

657
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:33,554
That problem
swallowing thing?

658
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,057
They gave me this
prescription for buspar.

659
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,059
That's for like,
anxiety, right?

660
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,562
I guess.

661
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:43,564
There was like,
this weightlifter guy

662
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:45,066
on the subway today.

663
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:47,068
And he was eating thes
e cacciatore chicken parts

664
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:49,070
from this massive
tupperware thing

665
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,572
and spitting the bon
es back in the container.

666
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,074
And the whole car...

667
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:54,575
reeked.

668
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,077
This poor blind man
sitting next to him.

669
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:59,580
I mean, you could tell
he felt completely invaded.

670
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,083
We all did.

671
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:05,586
Everybody just stared
straight ahead.

672
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:07,088
New york.

673
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:47,628
Hey.

674
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:56,137
Where is everybody?

675
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,142

00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:02,643
Receipts f

677
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:18,159
You got a problem?

678
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,660

679
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,661

I don't know, i heard maybe
you got a fuckin' problem.

683
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,670
Like you don't
like being here.

684
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,673
I like being here.

685
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,175
You sure?

686
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:35,176
Yeah.

687
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,627
You sure?

688
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,128
Yeah.

689
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,631
Don't say you're sure
if you're not sure.

690
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,641
Who was telling me you bought
your daughter a nice house

691
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,143
after you came
over with us?

692
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,647
Yeah, that's nice.

693
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,148
Wonderful thing.

694
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,156
And your brother,
a buon anima.

695
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,160
You've recovered
from that shit there.

696
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,663
You put your grief
behind you.

697
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,673
You put your grief
behind you.

698
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,178
Let me hear
you say it.

699
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,185
I put the grief
behind me.

700
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,690
I'm gonna go get
a coffee and a bun.

701
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,197
You got a younger
son too, right?

702
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,199
You oughta bring him
up to the house.

703
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,701
He can hang
out with a. J.

704
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,702
We can get
something to eat.

705
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,704
They can go
in the pool.

706
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,217
We'll have to leav
e this junk on the table.

707
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,220
Don't know
where to put it.

708
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,224
Control,
you hearing me?

709
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,727
Loud and clear,

00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:17,728

I'm good to go.

713
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,741
Control,
we're in motion.

714
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,242
We have left the
sausage factory.

715
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,243
Touchdown.

716
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,746
Dig, soprano,
c'mon, dig it!

717
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,247
You wanted to jo
in the football team.

718
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,750
You think it's all for
show and not for go?

719
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,752
Dig in,
you chubette!

720
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,253
You're out of
there, george.

721
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,255
Unit three,
we're in.

722
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,779
So, i got
a job for you.

723
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,280
Right.

724
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,783
It might get
a little messy.

725
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,284
I understand.

726
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,286
Wet work.

727
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,789
Alright.

728
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,791
I'll make it
worth your while,

729
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,792
don't worr
y about that.

730
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,294
I'm not worried.

731
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,799
Look over here.

732
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,301
Minimization,
40 seconds.

733
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:34,805
The old one blew.

734
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,307
Flooded the whol
e goddamn place.

735
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,811
I can smell the
mildew, you know?

736
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,312
So, lilliana say
s you're an engineer.

737
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,314
I figured maybe you
could rig some system.

738
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,818
If it happens
again, some pvc
shit or something.

739
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,820
So, if it happens again,
you get the overflow

740
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,821
and you put it over
into the corner over there

741
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,823
to a sump pump.

742
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,825
You chip out
the concrete.

743
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,326
4- 0.

744
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,828
Yeah, they're no
t discussing oc.

745
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,336
Two minutes, we're allowed
to check back in.

746
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:12,843
What do
you think?

747
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,846
Whatever.

748
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,848
Well, how much?

749
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,852
Time, materials.

750
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,354
I don't know how to
concoct estimate.

751
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,356
Hmm, well.

752
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,859
Fair enough.

753
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,861
Let me get measure.

754
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,362
Get started.

755
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,364
Alright.

756
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,367
Hi, stasiu.

757
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,873
You gonna

758
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,875
You want it,
take it.

759
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,376
No, you go ahead.

760
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,878
Go ahead, i'll
use the bike.

761
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,880
I have to sort through
meadow's laundry anyway.

762
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,381
She's gonna be here
at noon to get it.

763
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,884
Lilliana's making
her a leg of
lamb to take back.

764
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,886
Back in lodz,

765
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,890

the state to do an
autonomous research.

766
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,391
You got your workout
clothes on,

767
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,392
why don't you use it?

768
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,393
I'll take the bike.

769
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,395
Jesus, already,
no, you go ahead.

770
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,903
Stas said he could smell
the mildew down here,

771
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,404
right, stas?

772
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,410
We gotta open these
windows up, let the
place dry out.

773
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,922
Got some russian girl
coming in to take
care of my mother.

774
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,423
Oh, yeah,

775
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:34,925
Agency.

776
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,944
It was good coffee
this morning.

777
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,446
Vienna roast.

778
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,448
It's not as acidic
as the italian.

779
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,451
Cleaned me right out.

780
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,955
What you need is more roughage
overall in your diet

781
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,456
is what you need.

782
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,961
I've had something stuck
in my teeth for two days now.

783
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,462
Jesus.

784
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,464
You gotta use
the other floss.
