1
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,675
Carmela: ah, stupid thing.
The pressure is shot.

2
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,444
Can you live with regular
instead of espresso?

3
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,680
Never mind, sweetie.
Thanks anyway.

4
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,984
Hey hey.
Sorry for the ambush.

5
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,619
I brung up your paper.

6
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,722
I am meeting
the new realtor.

7
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,724
Yeah?
Good luck.

8
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,800
Got a call from sergeant
danny over in newark p.d.

00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,069

00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,813
Willie overall...

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,414
labor day, 1982?

13
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,332
Danny says he hears it's larry
barese that's been talkin'.

14
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,238
Lotta work
for a dead fuckin' bookie.

15
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,742
Come on, kid. Do it.

16
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,248
You made your bones
with that prick, eh?

17
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,184
Yeah.

18
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,087
Old zepupin's house.

19
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,356
You were shaky a little,
but you did good.

20
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,291
I remember
tellin' your old man.

21
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,228
25 years, t.

22
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,896
Possible there's
nothing left.

23
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,966
There'll be bones,
teeth.

24
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,936
What are we gonna do?

25
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,507
We're gonna pack
our toothbrushes.

26
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,178
Call you in a few days
on the alternate cell.

27
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,082
Any emergencies,
call sil or bobby.

28
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,151
And if you need
more cash, call me.

29
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,353
I know the drill, tony.

30
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,792
You know, it's not like
I won a trip to paris.

31
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,712
You have everything?
Your razor?

32
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,881
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

33
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,918
I... I can buy
whatever I need.

34
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,721
- will you make sure you wear your sunblock?
- it's nothing.

35
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,423
A little gambling charge,
that's all. It's gonna be fine.

36
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,792
It's just... You know,
better safe than sorry.

37
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,862
I know, it's just... This
is what life is still like...

38
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,064
At our age?

39
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,668
My tomatoes
are just coming in.

40
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,975
It's good to see you.
- yeah.

41
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,378
You seem good, junior,
I gotta say.

42
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,881
Fuck does that mean? I'm fuckin'
incarcerated, for christ's sake.

43
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:18,618
The medicine, the aricept,
it agrees with you.

44
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,754
You're not repeating
yourself so much.

45
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,456
You gotta get me
out of here...

46
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,625
The smell alone
in this fuckin' place.

47
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,664
What do you hear
from my nephew?

48
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,501
Tony? They sent me
a card for my birthday.

49
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,037
I'm still waitin'
for an apology. Tell him.

50
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,872
All right.

51
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,508
Which one of you's
gonna tell him?

52
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,643
We'll figure it out,
junior.

53
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,615
If you made
an appointment

54
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,884
with an outside dentist,

55
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,519
that might do
the trick.

56
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,721
What trick?

57
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,389
We'll meet you there

58
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,658
and sneak you off
in our car.

59
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,129
Dinner, 10 minutes.

60
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,131
So what do you think,
junior?

61
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,833
Enchiladas tonight.

62
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,774
Here's the electricians' union.

63
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,031
Don't let 'e
take my plate, kid.

64
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,398
Make sure there's enough
so everybody can buy in.

65
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,537
$60.

66
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,440
- for sodas and fuckin' candy?
- caffeinated sodas and sugar.

67
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,942
You know some of them
ain't allowed this shit.

68
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,412
Gets them all riled.
I could lose my job.

69
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,315
- fuckin' stick-up artist. I already gave you
my watch. - don't count my money, nigga.

70
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,318
You're makin' 500%
off these motherfuckers.

71
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,488
You're good
till lights out.

72
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,357
I'll steer people
away from the door.

73
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,237
All right.
No-limit five-card stud.

74
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,173
$40 buy-in to the house.

75
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,009
The white buttons are five
bucks. The red buttons are 10.

76
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,178
"red buttons."

77
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,280
what'd you say?

78
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,086
Today, we got coca-colas...

79
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,654
Fuck was I just sayin'?

80
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,357
- the soda, junior.
- what soda?

81
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,127
Right, the coke.

82
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,162
The real kind,
not the diet shit,

83
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,031
ice cold,
five buttons.

84
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,736
Plus, we got snickers,
kit-kats and sprees, also five.

85
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,704
Ll take some sprees.

86
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,308
Okay, ante up.

87
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,319
This is nice, huh?

88
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,321
A lile road trip,
just you and me...

89
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,223
All things considered,
of course.

90
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,893
Yeah, just like
the old days.

91
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,296
Willie-fuckin'- overall,

92
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,899
after all these years.

93
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,403
You remember drivin' around with that
prick in the trunk lookin' for a spot?

94
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,075
What was it, like a week
before a.j. Was born, right?

95
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,044
No, meadow.

96
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,713
- now she's gonna be a dr.

97
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,416

00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,317
me, puss, ralphie.

99
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,935
Chevy chase... Fuck ever
happened to him?

100
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,277
Let me ask you something.

101
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,779
You mentioned ralph before.

102
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,215
A few years ago, he had
that beef with johnny sack,

103
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,050
he made a crack about ginny...

104
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,286
Huge fuckin' mole
on her ass or some shit.

105
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,721
Yeah?

106
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,390
Who the fuck would tell
johnny about that joke?

107
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,891
How should I know?

108
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,632
Nine of clubs.

109
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,838
You know, I try
to be cooperative,

110
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,173
but it's that same
message over and over!

111
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,709
Walter,
what do you got?

112
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,246
Flush.

113
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,348
No, you don't.
George?

114
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,417
- uh...
- what?

115
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,019
- george, what do you got?
- hmm?

116
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,724
- your hand.
- he's got alzheimer's!

117
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,827
- help him, for christ's sake!
- pair of jacks.

118
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,800
Guy comes home with a
bouquet of flowers for his wife.

119
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,336
"I guess I'll have to spread
my legs now," she says.

120
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,938
"why?" he asks.
"don't you have a vase?"

121
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,081
high rollers only.
Keep walkin', professor.

122
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,350
I'm not here to gamble.
I'm here looking for keith.

123
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,118
Keith's busy. Take a hike.

124
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,387
We had
a chess match, keith.

125
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,423
The pride of rutgers...

126
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,458
Slits his wrists
in the faculty lounge

127
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,026
after he stabbed
the dean.

128
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,732
At least some of us
know when we need help.

129
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,568
Get the fuck out of here,
ya fuck...

130
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,608
What did the blind man say
when he passed the fish market?

131
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,678
I don't know.

132
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,647
"good morning, ladies."

133
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,684
what's going on, guys?

134
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,920
- they're gambling, warren.
- relax, brian.

135
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,689
What did we
say about this?

136
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,257
What?
It's a friendly game.

137
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,727
Corrado, it's too stressful. Lookt him!

138
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,862
He's not even playin'.

139
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,932
Come on, guys. Let's wrap it up.

140
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,505
I saw your girl today
at pet therapy.

141
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,841
Hodoes she keep
her coat so shiny?

142
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,047
...they can be unexpected,
frightening events.

143
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,418
But they're justutiful
part of the scenery. Park,

144
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,121
- crater lake is located high in the cascades

145
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,990
of south-central oregon, about
250 miles south of portland...

146
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,458
I brought you your tea.

147
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,970
You did a good job tonight,
kid. Here's your taste.

148
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,173
- that's all right.

149
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,509
Take it.
You earned it.

150
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,550
Time once, I was a kid.

151
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,385
You know, my oldan
was a stonemason.

152
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,690
He took me to work...

153
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,192
A job building a wall around
some rich lady's garden.

154
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,129
She mes home.

155
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,864
I help carry her groceries.

156
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,100
She goes to give me
a quarter,

157
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,170
which was a lot in
those days, but I say no.

158
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,741
She goes in. No sooner
does she close the door,

159
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,111
when... Crack! My old man gives
me a belt right across the mouth.

160
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,980
"what are you, a millionaire?
You no need-a money?

161
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,615
You no like-a eat?"

162
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,084
"what are you, a millionaire?
You no need-wow.ney?

163
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,152
Even still, he was right.

164
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,989
He made me
walk home that night.

165
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,827
11 fuckin' miles from
essex fells back to newark.

166
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,762
I'm from essex fells.

167
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,164
- a rich kid, huh?

168
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,871
Uh... Warren said I should
get my buttons back

169
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,540
on account of we weren't
really supposed to be gambling.

170
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,109
Tell warren
he can fuck himself.

171
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,077
Got a problem with that,
tell him to come see me.

172
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,749
Can I get a kit-kat
at least?

173
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:39,285
Do you believe this guy?

174
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,521
Get the fuck out of here?

175
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,664
Once in third grade...

176
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:55,168
I got a 96 on my spelling test,
highest mark in the class.

177
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,203
I was so proud.

178
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,572
I brought it home
to show my dad.

179
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,208
"what happened to thother
four points?" he says.

180
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,613
Fuck you!
Fuck... You!

181
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,557
... Uz f.m. Fredericksburg.

182
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,726
Your home
for classic rock.

183
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,594
96.9.

184
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,931
Paulie, we should stop.

185
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,434
- fuck are we?
- virgin.

186
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,772
You remember that place...

187
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,941
The dive with
the fuckin' massage beds?

188
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:38,178
It was in culpepper,
virginia.

189
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,180
- the havenaire.
- ah!

190
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,583
We met those 16-ye-old
hillbilly whores

191
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,151
near the taxi stand.

192
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,087
Yeah.

193
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,155
You want the old days,
let's go there.

194
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,624
We'll get a room, bucket
of ice from the machine,

195
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,060
bottle of scotch,
order up a couple steaks...

196
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,363
Heh heh heh.
Now you're fuckin' talkin'.

197
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,709
Excuse me!
This place, is it new?

198
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,978
I think maybe,
I don't know.

199
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,347
There was a motel
on this spot though, right?

200
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,850
- the havenaire?
- I don't know.

201
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,487
Fuckin' guy.

202
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,160
Mr. Spears,
you're all set.

203
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,929
Two king rooms, one night,
checking out tomorrow.

204
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,899
From 6:00 to 10:00 we offer a
complimentary buffet breakfast

205
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,634
in the courtesy room
off the lobby.

206
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,236
Sign there, please.

207
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,804
Can you have
room service send up

208
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,539
two fifths
of glenlivet?

209
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,541
I apologize, sir,
we don't serve bottles.

210
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,443
There is a minibar
in the room however.

211
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,579
- all right, a couple steaks then.
- with baked potatoes.

212
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,815
Wraps and salads only
after 11:00.

213
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,419
Buckingham's
is still open though.

214
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,154
You could get some nachos.

215
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,827
Your dad, boy.

216
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,962
Him and me made this
trip a thousand times

217
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,564
back in the '60s.

218
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,100
He had a piece
of that dog track, right?

219
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,669
Among other things.

220
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,005
This one time,
my first trip ever,

221
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,140
we're going
through georgia.

222
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,710
He's got a '59 eldorado
with the fins.

223
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,346
The biarritz,
he used to let me steer.

224
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,948
I'm like 20 at the time,
I'm a kid.

225
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,221
Neveanyway, I'm drivin',
we get pulled over.

226
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,890
State trooper with the hat,
fuckin' sunglasses.

227
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,526
I got no driver's license.

228
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,195
Of course not.

229
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,163
I'm shittin'
a brick.

230
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,199
This is the deep
fuckin' south we're in,

231
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,767
and we're italian.

232
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,069
I turn to your dad...
"what do I tell this prick?"

233
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,039
"relax," he says. "tell him
your cousin's on the job."

234
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,974
he gives me
a southern-sounding name.

235
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,076
The guy comes over.

236
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,712
"oh, my cousin's a state
trooper too," I tell him.

237
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,547
"maybe you know him."

238
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,883
"what's his name?"
"barney fife." pow!

239
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,221
The prick gives me a shot, I
don't know what the fuck hit me.

240
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,356
Your dad's fuckin'
pissing himself.

241
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,725
I mean, I never watch tv.
How the fuck do I know, right?

242
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,462
- so what happened?
- your dad had to "duke" the guy 100 fuckin' dollars.

243
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,664
Probably ath's salary
in those days.

244
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,735
You know, I remember you
around that time.

245
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,604
When I was bad,
my dad used to threaten me

246
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,739
he was gonna get uncle
paulie to come get me.

247
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,310
Fuckin' johnny boy, eh?

248
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,681
He loved you, my friend.

249
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,884
I remember the night
you were born.

250
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,986
Only time
I ever saw him cry.

251
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,188
Heh.

252
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,290
It's funny, you know, I...

253
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,794
Never knew where
I stood with him.

254
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,297
Like he didn't believe
in me or something.

255
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,100
Fucking kidding?
He trusted you enough

256
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,835
to give you
the willie overall thing.

257
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,739
- and you were what, 24?
- 22

258
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,641
so there you go then.

259
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,318
I tell the guy,
I said, "listen,

260
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,886
I don't mind paying
for the tailpipe,

261
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,722
but that fuckin' muffler's
still under warranty."

262
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,791
- all set?
- yeah.

263
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,728
- nice talking to ya.
- yeah, you too.

264
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,163
Enjoy miami.

265
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,301
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

266
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,204
- what?
- you tell some fuckin' goober your life story?

267
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,639
We're supposed
to be laying low.

268
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,844
I'm gonna grab
some danish for the road.

269
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:55,168
- you have shit on your pants, don.
- please be patient with him.

270
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,237
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,575
Visiting day
at the zoo.

272
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,711
Don't feed the chedrools.

273
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,349
- uh, ma.
- how was church?

274
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,285
It was fine.
It was good.

275
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,953
You remember mr. Soprano?

276
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,690
Corrado, please.
Hello, my dear.

277
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,960
- how are you today?
- I'd complain, but who'd listen?

278
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,032
They have me on some new
medication. It makes me salivate.

279
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,805
I'll leave you two to visit.
I have some letters to answer.

280
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,141
- he's a good boy, this one.
- thank you.

281
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,913
I have this new medication they
put me on. It makes me salivate.

282
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,968
How are you feeling?

283
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,173
- fine.
- maybe you can clear something up.

284
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:12,479
Dr. Mandl says you've been acting
aggressively toward other patients?

285
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,914
First of all, that is
total fucking bullshit.

286
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:18,084
- carter...
- secondly, why don't you just lead off with that?

287
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,753
What are you
talking about?

288
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,155
Instead of pretending to
give a shit how I feel.

289
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,159
Now, apparently, you are becoming bully.

290
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:31,031
Dr. Mandl feels you're modeling
your actions on the wrong people.

291
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:35,368
- ally? Like who?
- you know who. That gangster.

292
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,772
You of all people should know not to
believe what you read in the paper.

293
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,874
All that crap
they wrote about daddy.

294
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,043
That was
"the wall street journal."

295
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,611
it was entirely different.

296
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,880
It's never enough, is it?

297
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,916
My whole time at m.I.t., you told
me to get out and make friends.

298
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,552
Now I finally do learn
to assert myself a little,

299
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,654
suddenly that's a negative.

300
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,029
Checking in... Spears.

301
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:12,138
- sil.
- I'll get us settled in.

302
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,142
- hey.
- it's not good.

303
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,278
The feds found a body.

304
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,281
Skeleton. They tentatively
I.d.'d it as the guy.

305
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:24,150
- ah, fuck.
- try and relax, huh?

306
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,319
How's paulie holding up?

307
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,322
Jaws are holding up fine.
He won't shut the fuck up.

308
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,792
- that's too bad.
- what the fuck's he gotta worry about anyway?

309
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:36,262
Scenario like this, the feds ain't
interested in him, believe me.

310
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,800
Look, I love the guy,
it's just...

311
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,269
- you know how he is.
- believe me, I hear you.

312
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,271
What else?
Let me think.

313
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,639
Um...

314
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,475
I looked in on carm
and she's okay.

315
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,710
All right, thanks.

316
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,846
Call me if you hear anything.

317
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,217
...use your hat!

318
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,188
- "and hope to hear from you soon."

319
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,758
"sincerely... " no.

320
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,960
"respectfully,
corrado soprano."

321
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,263
read it back.

322
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,333
"dear vice president cheney,

323
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,070
as a powerful man all too
familiar with accidental gunplay,

324
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:20,440
I am writing in the hope that
you will intervene in my case.

325
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,543
Like yourself, I was involved
in an unfortunate incident

326
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,312
- when a gun I was handling misfired."

327
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,948
- head up, yo.

328
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,619
- I's you, I'd lay off the card games awhile.
-  fuck's the matter?

329
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,388
The professor snitched
you out to dr. Mandl.

330
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,827
What do you do
with those, jameel?

331
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:43,563
Autographed pictures of the
man who capped tony soprano?

332
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,066
Shit, them motherfuckers
go right on ebay.

333
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,536
Come on now, sign.

334
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,771
That was our deal.

335
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:55,075
You wanna keep
getting them sodas?

336
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,414
Sick fuckin' world.

337
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,191
- for you.
- oh, wow.

338
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,059
I got one

339
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,527
Thanks.

340
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,030
Where's the dvd?

341
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,200
That never occurred to me.

342
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,370

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,879
Hey, listen,

345
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:36,116
remember that cuban guy I was telling
you about? He knocks over trucks.

346
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,518
Last load was
american standard

347
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,287
sinks, toilets, tubs...

348
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,323

349
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,292

350
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,461
Now, check this out.

351
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:52,132
You're not gonna believe what I found
when we were moving into the new house.

352
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,806
Holy fucking shit.

353
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,714
Mickey pinto
took that in 1963.

354
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,582
Look at that hair.

355
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,085
Handsome fuckin' guy, eh?

356
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:14,154
That wristband,
the leather thing,

357
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,122
I remember getting
one just like it,

358
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,824
me and all my friends.

359
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,759
Wanted to be a tough guy
just like him.

360
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,631
That big one,
that's your uncle junior

361
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:27,267
and your old man
in front of satriale's.

362
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:35,175
There he is.

363
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,111
It's the biarritz.
We were just talking about that.

364
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:42,082
I tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna have my daughter

365
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,151
scan them into the computer so I
can get a couple of copies for you.

366
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,190
Oh, that's my wife.
I gotta take this.

367
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,025
No, stay, stay.
It's all right, come on.

368
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:54,961
Uh, I gotta
empty my bag anyway.

369
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:56,629
Hey, honey, sweetie, h?

370
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,632

371
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,376
He pisses in a bag now?

372
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,411
Jesus christ,fuckin.

373
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:17,684
Supporting them with
a huge warehouse covering 28 acres!

374
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:20,553
Stuffed to the rafters
with over 3,000 products

375
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,689
you can order
at rock bottom prices

376
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,492
and sell for profits
of up to 300% and more.

377
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,894
It's easy to wish
for a better life...

378
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,501
Just pick up the phone and
call this toll-free number... )

379
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,005
- hello.
- junior, it's pat.

380
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,573
You put any thought
to our plan?

381
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,742
What plan?

382
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,844
The dentist,
know, like we said

383
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:48,415
- who is this?
- it's pat!

384
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:51,618
The dentis remember? You were
gonna make an appointment.

385
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,688
You sneak me off,

386
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:58,525
- where would I lam it?
- um... A safe house, I don't know.

387
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,196
The time's not right.

388
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:06,700
I'm being watched.
Call back later.

389
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:10,270
- 'cause I'm headed back to sarasota soon...

390
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,342
...free to get started.
They give you plenty of ideas

391
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,811
and support and the
quality of the product

392
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,280
is even better than what you
see in the catalogs.

393
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,682
I decided I wanted something
where I was my own boss...

394
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:26,419
Back in the day...
'70s... Fuckin' '80s...

395
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,422
You didn't make a move
in north jersey

396
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,257
without this one
up your ass.

397
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,660
I wasn't even born yet.

398
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:38,198
Please. Wanna talk
about stand-up guys?

399
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,402
Sorry, beans.

400
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,973
Hey, carlo, can we get
some more champagne please?

401
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,975
Hey, remember that
yokel at the feast

402
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,643
mouthing off
to your cousin?

403
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:53,446
This maniac threw
a vat of hot oil

404
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,648
right from the zeppole
stand on this prick.

405
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,484
Oh my god.

406
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,819
Little powdered sugar,
he would've been done.

407
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,289
And ton', remember
when we all rented

408
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,991
that house
down the shore?

409
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,694
- with the bedbugs?
- summer of '78.

410
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,829
Carlo, silvio,
frankie napoli...

411
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,164

412
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:12,799
...sonny spinz

413
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:14,200
that's where
that hippy kid

414
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:16,336
"mysteriously" drowned
during that party.

415
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:24,511
Hey ton', you okay?

416
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,179
Yeah yeah.

417
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,782
You sure, t?
Yore being kinda quiet.

418
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,117
That's 'cause...

419
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:33,586
"remember when" is the lowest
form of conversation.

420
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,941
I told tommy deleo
you're the boss now.

421
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:58,978
This fucking deleo construction
has always been a problem.

422
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:03,083
Tell him I personally
am upset.

423
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:10,457
- nice gravy, huh?
- yeah.

424
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,959
Anyway, yo taste.

425
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,930
How's patricia?
You mind?

426
00:28:20,734 --> 00:28:23,136
Go ahead.

427
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:32,012
Now I'll start by making a
mountain fold on each corner.

428
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:35,015
Folding the corners into
the center of the paper...

429
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,916
Touche, "captain blood."

430
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,057
checkers,
the thinking man's game.

431
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,092
You looking for a smack
in the fuckin' mouth?

432
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,894
Corrado?

433
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,429
Language, please.

434
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:57,937
- what do you want?
- if you'd move, perhaps I could reach the chess set.

435
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,273
And if I don't, what the
fuck are you gonna do then?

436
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,043
- you don't intimidate me.
- corrado!

437
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:09,649
- you're lucky she's here, you little prick.

438
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:12,519
You're only toughwhen ty

00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:16,089
so things don't go too far.
Oh, how the mighty have f...

440
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:17,624
Corrado!

441
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:22,929
Get him! Get him!

442
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:25,598
How do you like that, huh?

443
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,867
Fuckin' smart guy!
How do you like that!

444
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,170
God, no!

445
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:34,741
I'm gonna kill this prick.

446
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:39,245
Would you describe mr.
Soprano as the aggressor?

447
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,082
Is he generally
a troublemaker?

448
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,150
Nah, he cool.

449
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,820
You just gotta know
how to talk to him is all.

450
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,089
That's a lovely watch
you're wearing.

451
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,724
Is that vintage?

452
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,329
Bulova, yeah.
Flea market.

453
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,666
Must have been
quite expensive.

454
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:05,005
Why am I the only caregiver
being interrogated here?

455
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:08,508
It wouldn't happen to be because of
the color of my skin, now would it?

456
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:11,077
Thank you for your
cooperation. You can go.

457
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:24,491
I'm gonna write a change
order for soprano's meds.

458
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:27,494
Yeah, I need a bridge loan.
If ya could.

459
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,463

- done.

460
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,866
What can il you?
I've been fucking mush lately.

461
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,601
It happens.

462
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,503
I lost the 1:00 game
by a field goal.

463
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,039
It was a pick 'em. Then the
4:00 game, I'm chasing the money,

464
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,840
I picked
the 49ers minus two.

465
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,843
Ah, fuck it,
you don't want to hear this.

466
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:46,212
It's been this way
the last couple months though.

467
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,715
- listen, this too shall pass.

468
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:51,051
- thanks, tateleh.
- any time.

469
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,919
All right.

470
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,021
Is this a nonsmoking room?

471
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:29,989
Go ahead.

472
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,804
Dinner was fun
the other night.

473
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,207
- yeah.
- how do you know per?

474
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,776

475
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:51,644
Beansie?

476
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,616
He's an old friend...

477
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,251
From the neighborhood.

478
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:01,154
So the other guy?
The one with, um...

479
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,256
White hair thingies?
What's his name again?

480
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:06,559
- paulie.
- right.

481
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:08,628
What is he,
like, your best friend?

482
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:11,698
- he say that?
- I just figured.

483
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,199
The way he was talking.

484
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,503
Honestly, I thought heas
your dad at first.

485
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:19,172
There was a time
when I wished he was.

486
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,910
He... He used to work
for my dad.

487
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,679
I know, he told me.

488
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,499
Corrado?
Corro?

489
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:49,102
- huh?
- it's time for group.

490
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,841
It's these new pills
last couple of days.

491
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:56,743
I got no pep.

492
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,613
Oh, that'll change. There's
a slight adjustment period.

493
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,216
But I'm sleeping all the
time now. I can't focus.

494
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,618
Just givit some time,
you'll feel a lot better

495
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:07,520
and your memory will
improve too.

496
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,863
You know
that's bullshit, right?

497
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,933
They're trying
to numb you out,

498
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,736
'cause of what you did
to the professor.

499
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,945
Where the fuck

500
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,647

00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:54,668
What the fuck is this?

503
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,670
Ho! Ho ho ho!
God damn it.

504
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,009
Who's ramon?

505
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,579
Waiting long?

506
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,982
So everybody come tonight

507
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,751
All right, hold

508
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:14,521

00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:16,589
This is esteban

510
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:21,761
So our friend in the wheelchair tells
us you get regular access to goods?

511
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,537
Okay.

512
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:33,139
I got a trailer
full of power tools,

513
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:35,041
coming in later on
this month.

514
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:37,977
Factory-sealed black
and deckers and makitas.

515
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:40,780
I can get r you
50¢ on the dollar.

516
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,782
60 grand.

517
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:47,053
Well, 55 would work but that
includes shipping to jersey.

518
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,788
We look
like fucking u.p.s.?

519
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:52,425
Look, you send the truck up
north, we send it back-loaded.

520
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,961
I got a line on air
mattresses, pool toys,

521
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:58,365
and I can round the load
out with kerastase,

522
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,801
it's a french shampoo...
$20 a bottle retail.

523
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:04,304
Now yoget 5%
after sale,

524
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,473
but that's gonna
involve a little trust.

525
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:10,243
'sta bien.

526
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,412
All right.

527
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,614
We're looking for
a long-term relationship.

528
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:16,883
- we'll be calling.
- all right.

529
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,485
You okay, tío?

530
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:35,335
Corrado, how you
doing today?

531
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:37,804
I'm dying a slow death,
that's how I'm doing.

532
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:40,006
Just take
your meds, yo.

533
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:43,009
Real fucking
nazi now, huh?

534
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:44,744
Stop fucking pushing!

535
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,246
Ah! I wasn't!

536
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,682
yo, stop bumping
dickheads out there!

537
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,739
You should have
seen him out there.

538
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:14,708
The fuck can
handle himself.

539
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:17,911
He's got the gazzis
of a 20-year-old.

540
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:21,915
He's my friend, but, jesus,
what a fucking chiacchierone.

541
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,583
"yup-yup-yup-
yup-yup-yup."

542
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:28,588
heells me, "don't say nothing
to nobody." he's got prostate.

543
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:31,057
I say, "sure."
he tells everybody.

544
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:33,326
He was always like that.

545
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:35,929
Nah, he was
gary-fucking-cooper.

546
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:37,297
You forget.

547
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,767
One time, I fell asleep
while he was on the phone.

548
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:42,736
I wake up
20 minutes later,

549
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:45,138
and he was still going.

550
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:54,514
I gotta say...

551
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:57,917
It concerns me.

552
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,419
Lately.

553
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:01,421
Nah.

554
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,256
Come on, huh?

555
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:09,095
Hey, people live alone,
they get like that. It's sad.

556
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,733
I'm leaving
for my card game.

557
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,101
Are you two okay?

558
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,437
- dinner was great, hon.
- any time, you know that.

559
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,105
Thank you.

560
00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:24,878
That's a great girl
you got there.

561
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:26,546
The way she stood by you.

562
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:28,848
Now you see, that's what
paulie doesn't got.

563
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:32,452
Now I'm speaking
to your point.

564
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:34,187
He's got no wife.

565
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,922
He's got no kids.

566
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,724
He's got no steady
income stream neither.

567
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,761
Which is coming
to an end. Barone,

568
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:45,098
I told him, if you
can't show legit income,

569
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,467
you're vulnerable
to the feds.

570
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,637
He don't do
shit about it.

571
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,841
I think you're worrying
for nothing, tony.

572
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:58,678
Things are going great.

573
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:01,114
Finally.

574
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:03,450
Maybe I'm just...

575
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:05,618
Waiting for the other
shoe to drop.

576
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,487
All I know is,

577
00:38:07,587 --> 00:38:10,824
paulie gualtieri
is a stand-up guy.

578
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,159
Has he ever really been
put the test?

579
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:23,703
You know, he had this
painting of me in his house.

580
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,906
I was all dressed up
like a fucking general.

581
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,143
I heard out that.

582
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,012
Yeah, it pissed me off.

583
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:34,447
Thought it was
a fucking joke.

584
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,353
- but I don't think it was.
- he loves you, ton'.

585
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,188
You're all he's got.

586
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:46,259
You, the guys
and his image.

587
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:53,366
I love him too.

588
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:55,468
You always did.

589
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,202
Hey, sil.

590
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,737
I'm here with bobby.

591
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:33,440
- he just got a call frojenna.
- who?

592
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:34,574
Karen's sister.

593
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:36,943
Works in the courthouse.

594
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,778
Oh, yeah yeah.

595
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,246
And?

596
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:43,483
- are you sitting down?
- just fucking tell me.

597
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,218
Jackie aprile.

598
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:47,721
- what?
- you heard me.

599
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:50,423
Larry told them j.a.
Was totally responsible

600
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,193
for e death of a certain
african-american person.

601
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:56,396
- he covered your
- congratulations, anthony!

602
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:58,832
Yeah, well...

603
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,500
You got to wonder
what's next, huh?

604
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,569
Yeah,
but for tonight, huh?

605
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:05,505
All right, thanks.

606
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,207
Talk to you later.

607
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,903
Ha-ha-ha!

608
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:45,712
We're off the hook
on this willie overall thing.

609
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,481
Oh! Thank god!
That's fucking beautiful.

610
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:50,417
Yeah.

611
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,624
Know what we ought to do?

612
00:40:57,691 --> 00:41:00,660
We ought to treat ourselves
before we leave.

613
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,830
I was thinking maybe we'd
do some sport fishing.

614
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,432
You serious?

615
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:06,733
Yeah?
What are you kidding,

616
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,635
the fucking marlin
they got out here?

617
00:41:08,702 --> 00:41:10,737
We'll rent a boat.

618
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,375
Yeah. Sure.

619
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:21,348
"what's that got to do with
chien farming?" he asks.

620
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:25,352
The whore says, "last year,
I raised over 5,000 cocks."

621
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:30,290
- where you going?
- the head. I gotta piss.

622
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:33,626
- one more?
- yeah. One more.

623
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,197
Two fags decide
they want a baby.

624
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:39,366
So they jack off
in a cup,

625
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:42,102
use the sperm to get a lady
friend of theirs pregnant.

626
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:44,371
Nine months later,
they go to the hospital.

627
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,606
They see all the babies
in the nursery.

628
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:48,942
"look," they say.
"our baby's the sweetest one.

629
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,544
He's not even
crying at all."

630
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:55,015
ah... God damn it,
what t fuck is it?

631
00:41:55,048 --> 00:41:56,883
"now he's not crying,"
the nurse says.

632
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,652
"just wait till we take the
pacifier out of his ass."

633
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,654
right, yeah.

634
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:09,396
Oh, fuck me!

635
00:42:10,797 --> 00:42:13,366
Accident! Accident!

636
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,903
God fucking damn it!

637
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:18,905
Corrado,
what happened?

638
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:21,474
Oh, jesus christ
on the cross.

639
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,076
It's all right.

640
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:24,844
Come on.

641
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,250
I'm an old man. It was an
accident, for christ's sake.

642
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:33,586
You're on ditropan specifically
to avoid incontinence.

643
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:37,524
Not to mention celexa, which should
be curtailing your aggressiveness.

644
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,426
I'm taking my medication.

645
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:41,361
Ask hormel,
you don't believe me.

646
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:43,697
Jameel.
He's been let go.

647
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:45,432
Mr. Soprano,
there's a mutual trust

648
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:48,735
among the staff and our
patients regarding treatment.

649
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,004
That means you
have a choice...

650
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,772
You can either
wear depends

651
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,108
while you await transfer
to another facility,

652
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,610
or you can take your
medication as prescribed.

653
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:09,055
Here, corrado.
Time for your medicine.

654
00:43:13,793 --> 00:43:15,729
Where the fuck
is my ipod?

655
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:17,831
Every day it's
your ipod, carter.

656
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:19,566
Just stop causing
a commotion!

657
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:38,318
What'd you do that for?

658
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:40,153
I should piss
myself again?

659
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:42,088
But I did the thing.

660
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:44,491
They're muscling me,
what do you want me to tell you?

661
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:47,327
I could have
gotten in trouble.

662
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:48,928
You don't even
give a shit.

663
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:56,136
Let's get
a card game together.

664
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:58,038
- they fired hormel.
- jameel?

665
00:43:58,104 --> 00:43:59,673
Fuck him! You got me.

666
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,876
Maybe tomorrow, kid.
Don't know. I'm tired.

667
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:26,566
Old ironsides!

668
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:30,770
Ho! You're supposed
to say "who, beansie?"

669
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:32,872
yeah.

670
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:38,071
Where you been?

671
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:40,273
You didn't come
to lunch.

672
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:44,511
I brought you
these...

673
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:47,814
From keith.
He owed me money.

674
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:50,216
"hootie
and the blowfish."

675
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:53,319
thanks.

676
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:58,825
That was a nice lett
you wrote to cheney.

677
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:00,794
But he don't
read 'em himself,

678
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,229
they got computers
that do it.

679
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,832
I asked lynch,
the professor.

680
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:08,234
What are you talking
to him for?

681
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:11,237
He says we'll have a better chance
if we write him at his outfit...

682
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:12,739
Halliburton.

683
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:16,976
My father
owned umman ock.

684
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,150
My grandpa said my dad
lackedharacter.

685
00:46:26,886 --> 00:46:29,055
Grandpa was a lion.

686
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:33,593
You're very smart,
anthony.

687
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:37,931
I'm sure you're very
good with spelling too.

688
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:26,546
Rigatoni a la paulie.
He-he!

689
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:30,216
But since you're eating it, maybe
it should be "rigatoni a la tony"?

690
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:31,685
Heh heh.

691
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,720
Ah!

692
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,221
Oh, madonn'!

693
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:42,162
What?
You're not hungry?

694
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:44,664
My fucking stomach.

695
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,907
You know, when you
went down below,

696
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:56,009
I thought I saw
a whale.

697
00:47:56,076 --> 00:47:58,411
- no shit.
- it made me think of ginny sack.

698
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:08,288
That joke ralph made about
her, that was some funny shit,

699
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:09,989
no matter what john said.

700
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,459
You got to have
a sense of humor, right?

701
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:14,761
Yeah.

702
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,569
I heard she took
an office job.

703
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:26,373
- chubb insurance.
- heh heh!

704
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:33,480
It was you
told him, right?

705
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:34,814
I mean, it's no big deal.

706
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:36,649
I could hardly resist.

707
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,718
Grapevine, ton'.
I don't know.

708
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,787
Yeah.

709
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:43,556
He was a funny prick,
that ralph.

710
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:46,459
His "gladiator" fixation,

711
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:49,162
the time he hit georgie
in the eye with the chain.

712
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,164
Heh heh heh!

713
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:55,301
I'd have loved to have seen john's
face when he heard that crack.

714
00:48:55,368 --> 00:48:58,838
Always fucking holier-than-thou
'cause he didn't fuck other women.

715
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:03,143
Mr. Broomstick-up-
his-ass.

716
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:05,245
Heh heh heh.

717
00:49:05,311 --> 00:49:07,814
You know,

718
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:11,985
no offense, but... You ever had
yourself checked for tourette's?

719
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,987
What?

720
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:15,321
Tourette's syndrome...

721
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:16,823
Seriously.

722
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,826
"heh heh." it's like you
got a tick or something.

723
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:23,430
I dunno. It's like some
people grind their teeth.

724
00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:26,066
When I'm nervous...
Tense or something.

725
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:37,610
Come on, you told
john about that joke, right?

726
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,023
- it wasn't me, ton'.
- no?

727
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,292
That's right.

728
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,903
You want a drink?

729
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,439
All right, stewarts.

730
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:44,344
- think fast!
- jesus! Ton'!

731
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:46,846
Fuck, that hurt.

732
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:15,769
What does it take
to get something to eat?

733
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:36,222
When my time comes,

734
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:39,893
tell me,
will I stand up?

735
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:03,550
Who was at the door?

736
00:53:03,616 --> 00:53:06,619
"williams-sonoma.
From paulie.

737
00:53:06,686 --> 00:53:11,324
The elektra semiautomatic
chrome espresso machine."

738
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,326
4a>od2- so?
- my god, tony.

739
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:15,528
This is, like, $2,000.

740
00:53:15,595 --> 00:53:17,731
I mean, what is
wrong with that man?

741
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:20,633
What's wrong with him?
Nothing.

742
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,403
It's guys like him that allows
our whole lifestyle here.

743
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:37,050
Take me over
to jeanette's house.

744
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:49,029
Ah!

745
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:17,624
In an apparent escalation
of a mafia power struggle...

746
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:19,793
What year? Let me see,

747
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,595
'72, '73, back in
the feech lamanna days.

748
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:26,066
I'm on a roll. I mean, I haven't
lost a bet in fucking months.

749
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,435
...after a brazen
ambush by...

750
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:30,003
Hey, ton',
you see this shit?

751
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,805
Skip.

752
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:33,373
Hey.

753
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,476
Looks like phil's the main
guinea over there now, huh?

754
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,244
Anyway, we're at
maxwell's plum,

755
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:40,647
the saturday night
before the game.

756
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:43,750
Who walks in
but fucking namath?

757
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:46,920
Three sheets to the wind, fuckin'
staggering like aailor.

758
00:54:46,986 --> 00:54:49,656
So I know the game is
going into the toilet.

759
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:51,157
I said to
my brother jerry...

760
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:52,759
He was just
a kid at the time...

761
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:55,795
"take this money down
to old caruso on the corner

762
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:57,964
and put it all
against the jets."

763
00:54:58,031 --> 00:55:01,801
my brother was just recovering
from rheumatic fever...
