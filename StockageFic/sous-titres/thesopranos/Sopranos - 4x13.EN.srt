1
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,068
I told you, you didn't have to come.

2
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,806
Yeah, let you drive yourself
when you look this bad?

3
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,278
Yeah?

4
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,652
He's out.

5
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,147
He looks good.

6
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,527
- Talk to him. Get a sense.
- Okay.

7
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,614
Your cousin's out of rehab. Looks good.

8
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,644
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

9
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,785
Lyme titers, sed rate...

10
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:41,885
inconclusive.

11
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,155
Score one for the Italians.

12
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,266
- You don't have lupus.
- Thank God for that.

13
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,102
Think we might be looking
at a viral syndrome...

14
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,970
maybe mono.

15
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,343
- Oh, God.
- How's your emotional level?

16
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,980
Stress off the charts lately? Like all of us?

17
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,109
- What do you mean?
- Death, major change of any kind?

18
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,049
No, just the usual.
One day runs into the next.

19
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,755
Stay on the Advil.
Your temperature goes up, you call me.

20
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,460
You know, it's amazing.

21
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,328
I got a relative who's got a heroin problem.

22
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,794
The people that need drugs,
all they can get is shit like Advil.

23
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,469
Thank you for coming.

24
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,310
That was Grove Street.

25
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,815
I gotta make a stop down in Sea Bright.

26
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,819
- I don't feel well.
- You get some sea air.

27
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,515
- We'll go to Barr's. You won't have to cook.
- Goddamn it.

28
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,717
Yeah, I really want lobster.

29
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,520
The student loan people called.

30
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,086
We're late
with Allegra's nursing school payment.

31
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,295
- Where you going?
- Nordstrom's. They're having a sale.

32
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,673
Sallie Mae calls, and your response to that
is to go shopping?

33
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,868
It's a sale, John. I need clothes for Italy.

34
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,140
- We're still going, aren't we?
- Might be time for a little belt- tightening.

35
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,514
The bottom line is I'll be losing money
if the Esplanade is shut down.

36
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,782
We should try to go.
I spoke to Nicole Lupertazzi.

37
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,916
When she and Little Carmine stayed
at the Hassler last year, he loved it.

38
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,720
That's good for Little Carmine, then.

39
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:26,697
His fucking wallet isn't tied
to the goddamned Esplanade, god damn it!

40
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,335
John, why are you yelling at me?

41
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,401
John, what'd I do?

42
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,819
Is that my father's truck?

43
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,391
What the hell's going on?

44
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,591
Me to know, you to find out.

45
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,299
So, what do you think, Mel?
Don't see no dry rot.

46
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,741
Mrs. Soprano, Virginia Lupo,
RE/MAX Community Realty.

47
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,867
Hi.

48
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,780
That's right. It's even got a name.

49
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,652
- Where did this come from?
- That's if we can get it.

50
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,914
This is a huge amount of money.

51
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,025
And your construction project shut down....

52
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,120
That can't last forever. It's for the family.

53
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,125
As the kids get older,
it gets harder to keep us all together...

54
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,003
but this is a draw.

55
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,865
Bring friends down,
have big cookouts, jet ski.

56
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,743
And for us, too, though.

57
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,578
When we were piss poor...

58
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,844
this was the biggest caviar wish
we could come up with.

59
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,019
Kind of reminds you
of the Kennedy compound, don't it?

60
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,867
Can I ask you why they're selling?
My husband said,"lf we can get it."

61
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,268
Well, there is a buyer already.

62
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,769
In fact, the house is sold.

63
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,340
But there's a chance that these buyers
won't qualify for financing.

64
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,778
And I know the owner, Alan.

65
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,915
He lives just next door, here.
He's an attorney.

66
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,511
If you're offering cash,
I thought you should at least see the place.

67
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,484
So, it's not really for sale.

68
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,517
It's just as well,
because we couldn't swing this.

69
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,187
There's Al!

70
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,108
The jury has claimed they are deadlocked.

71
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:53,270
However, I'm inclined to agree
with prosecution.

72
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,511
I'm going to give them additional time
to reach a verdict.

73
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,010
We should've had a hung jury mistrial.
Object, for Christ's sake!

74
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,783
Allen charge. It has to play out.

75
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,456
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've communicated that you feel...

76
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,696
that you're unable to come
to a unanimous verdict in this case.

77
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,728
Now, I know that you've been at it
for a while, and it can be frustrating.

78
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,906
But we've all spent a lot of time on this trial.

79
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,412
And being as I have no reason to believe
that another jury...

80
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,882
with the same evidence
would be better able to reach a verdict...

81
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,081
I'm going to ask you to go back in there
and reason with each other...

82
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,257
and apply the law...

83
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,815
and come back in here with a verdict.

84
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,023
If not, I wanna move on.

85
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,223
Here.

86
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,066
Did somebody check the order,
make sure we got everything this time?

87
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,128
Yes.

88
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,600
Well, keep me posted.

89
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,512
Dinner's served!

90
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,256
- Get any sleep?
- Couldn't.

91
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,586
We have absolutely no business
getting into something like that house...

92
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,858
with A. J. two years away from college.

93
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,231
That was Virginia Lupo on the phone.
She hasn't heard from the owner.

94
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,566
I guess that deal's gonna go through.

95
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,230
I wonder who they are.

96
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,501
Motherfucking, goddamn orange- peel beef!

97
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,379
Call them up.

98
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,539
You got me plain soup, right?

99
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,141
We'll be finished eating the rest
before he gets back.

100
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,652
Go through the order while they're still here.

101
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,122
What good does that do?
He's still gotta get it and come back again.

102
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,955
- What happened?
- They left out part of the order.

103
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,052
- Call them up.
- Sit down and eat.

104
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,694
I guess some things
just weren't meant to be.

105
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,432
What are we talking about?

106
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,474
I was thinking of buying your mother
a house down on the shore.

107
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,339
Un- fucking- believable!

108
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,979
- Would we have a gym?
- It's the shore.

109
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,171
Wouldn't you want to be outdoors?

110
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,774
Forget that. You're fined $3 for the F- word.

111
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,821
I heard Dad say "mother- F"
when I was coming down the stairs.

112
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,755
He's fined, too.
We're gonna make this policy work.

113
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,554
It's too late.

114
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,734
What's going on?

115
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,980
You know, it does seem like a good value,
even at that price.

116
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,542
Waterfront property, in that area.

117
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,215
We probably wouldn't get hurt,
as an investment.

118
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,621
You're the one that took real estate classes.

119
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,965
Didn't you say that a person shouldn't look
at a house as an investment?

120
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,860
I know you.
If you don't get the place, you'll sulk.

121
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,666
- And I'll be the wet blanket.
- I'll sulk?

122
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,363
I was sleeping.

123
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,077
If you want me to sign off....

124
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,281
We probably wouldn't lose money.

125
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,991
But if you don't want to go through with it,
believe me, that's fine, too.

126
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,441
But if you did, Virginia Lupo's
phone number is on the bureau.

127
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,138
And, you know...

128
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,740
better to act quickly if, you know....

129
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:55,347
More is lost by indecision than
by wrong decision, that's all I'm saying.

130
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,388
Hey, Jack Lemmon.

131
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,155
How's Lee Remick?

132
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,826
So, how the fuck are you?

133
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,463
- That place help you?
- Yeah.

134
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,101
I found out about strengths I have
I didn't even know I had.

135
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,467
- You look fucking great.
- Thank you.

136
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,168
Thank everybody
for forcing me to deal with it.

137
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,538
- Especially Adriana.
- You're not shooting junk, right?

138
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,581
Fuck, no. I'm completely clean and sober.

139
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,546
Which one of the 12 steps you on now?

140
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,581
The only one I haven't done is go around
to all the people I fucked over...

141
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,684
while I was using, and apologize.

142
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,426
Maybe you shouldn't do that one.

143
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,095
- You know, let sleeping dogs lie.
- That's what I was thinking.

144
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,604
Maybe in a couple of cases,
I'll send flowers, or cash in some cases.

145
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,551
- Where's Carmine at?
- No change whatsoever.

146
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,023
Where are you at?

147
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,318
I think a movement from below
is not palatable to the other bosses.

148
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,387
It's what they fear most.

149
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,193
A movement from outside,
it's more forgivable...

150
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,199
and more understandable,
given the facts, here.

151
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,569
I mean, you've been reasonable.

152
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,475
If I do it, what do you do for me?

153
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,147
I take a sad song and make it better...

154
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,844
with the other families, as regards you.

155
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,046
You're smart to have reservations...

156
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,055
but there's differences
between this and Castellano.

157
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,192
Yes, you still got the four other families
who could raise a stink...

158
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,924
but Andy's my brother- in- law.
I have their ear.

159
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,897
I'm gonna pass.

160
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,439
- Fuck are you talking about?
- I'm taking the risk.

161
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,998
Fuck what were you talking
about last time then?

162
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,304
What would it take?

163
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,575
Fuck even one percentage point.

164
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,919
All claims to my HUD business are irrigated.

165
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,347
All right.

166
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,188
All future construction projects,
60- 40 in my favor.

167
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,333
What I'm gonna tell you
is for your ears only, and Sil's.

168
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,777
We're gonna take out Carmine Lupertazzi.

169
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,618
Johnny Sack's gonna go to war.

170
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,588
No, he's not.

171
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,584
That's right.

172
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,153
See, Carmine's got major income
besides construction, Johnny don't.

173
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,325
Only other person hurting worse
than either of the pricks is me.

174
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,029
Whacking the boss
of one of the five families?

175
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,335
- Johnny's a snaky fuck.
- That's something to be considered.

176
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,310
But remember, also, how deeply hurt
fucking Johnny felt over Carmine...

177
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,943
not backing him
on those slurs against Ginny.

178
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,174
Life's funny.

179
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,683
Carmine never made that right with John.

180
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,147
I knew back then that was a mistake.

181
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,512
Gonna hit Carmine soon?

182
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,822
If I'm gonna buy this house,
I need the Esplanade scratch.

183
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,498
It shouldn't look like what it is.

184
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,967
Home invasion, carjacking,
fucking ingrown toenail....

185
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,033
I know these black guys from Irvington.

186
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,972
That's the right idea.

187
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,541
It can never get out
who whacked the old fuck.

188
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,175
- Are they trustworthy, these guys?
- Yeah.

189
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,782
Make sure.

190
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,661
Help you?

191
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,695
Hi, how you doing? I'm Tony Soprano.

192
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,933
I was here with my wife the other day
with Virginia Lupo.

193
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,767
- Right. Alan Sapinsly.
- How are you?

194
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,304
So, what do you think?

195
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,406
She says those other people
are gonna go through with it.

196
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,112
I was gonna go talk to you, frankly,
after I took another look at the place.

197
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:25,247
This is galling because I don't think
they're going to qualify for financing...

198
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,782
and we gave them this God- awful
90- day escrow. My wife's doing.

199
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,452
She liked Mrs. Kim.

200
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,696
I can do 15 days. Shortest allowable by law.

201
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,902
Never tire of painting this.

202
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,902
- You'd be coming in with cash, right?
- Yeah.

203
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,080
Fuck this.

204
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,082
Dr. Kim, hey, Alan Sapinsly.

205
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,086
It's not?

206
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,455
Well, we've got serious problems.

207
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,891
On the house. Sure.

208
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,792
He's going into surgery,
doesn't want to talk there in the prep room.

209
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,198
Yes, I'm here.

210
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,371
What does your lender say?

211
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,638
Jesus, Doctor.

212
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,576
I take almost no comfort from those words.

213
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,908
And were I you, I wouldn't either.

214
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,915
I'm aware we have a contract in place.
Doctor, please, I'm an attorney.

215
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,283
Look, Cho- Sun. Wait, you're not listening.

216
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,051
Simply stated, I want the chance to sell
to a more qualified buyer...

217
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,916
if I can find one at this late date.

218
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,152
Actually, it's very....

219
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,163
Wait, do you want to do all the talking
and I'll just stand here?

220
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,325
Thank you.

221
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:46,268
You call Virginia Lupo, she calls the bank,
you get your deposit back.

222
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,840
Your wife's a grown woman, she'll adjust.

223
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,644
Dr. Kim, I spent 10 years as a litigator.

224
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:58,376
Buy this property, I'll make your life
a misery. I can tort you into the poorhouse.

225
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,643
I've got an overseas call.
Think it over. You have Virginia's number.

226
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,419
Who knows? We'll see.

227
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,188
I wouldn't want to be the patient
he's gonna operate on.

228
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,024
Let's hold a good thought?

229
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:23,663
Hello.

230
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,711
Virginia, sure, hi.

231
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,975
We did?

232
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,124
All right.

233
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,991
Picture the fishing off that dock.

234
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,735
God, it really is beautiful, isn't it?

235
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,331
First time I felt good signing papers.

236
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,035
Dad, blue crabs!

237
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,372
Oh, my God, this is nice.

238
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,086
You'll inherit this.

239
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,851
Dad, what a thing to say.

240
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,369
Anthony Soprano...

241
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,637
you are full of surprises.

242
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,982
It's good to see a smile on your face.

243
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,964
Praise the Lord for sobriety.

244
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,698
The higher power.

245
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,299
- That 12- step shit doing for you?
- Yeah.

246
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,071
Thanks for asking.

247
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,805
We sold you "H" when that was your thing.

248
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,313
Still we here
when it's wop- whacking time in Brooklyn.

249
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,547
- It should look like a carjacking.
- See?

250
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,153
That's why you came to us.
That's some stereotyping shit.

251
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,745
He goes mall- walking inside King's Plaza.

252
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,656
7:00 a. m. Tuesdays and Thursdays. Regular.

253
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,894
Macy's entrance, Avenue U and Flatbush.

254
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,825
You get the down payment?

255
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,132
Next sound you hear....

256
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,393
Home of the burger, what's your beef?

257
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,564
I'm sorry. I have wrong number.

258
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,096
This is the Soprano residence.

259
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,560
Tony?

260
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,631
No, this is Anthony.

261
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,267
Yes. The handsome boy.

262
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,635
Who is this?

263
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,535
Is your mother there?

264
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,570
Ma, telephone!

265
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,782
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

266
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,249
Is this Mrs. Soprano?

267
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,058
Yes, it is.

268
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,063
I used to fuck your husband.

269
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,644
A. J. , I've got it!

270
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,815
Tony loves me, you know.

271
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,588
If it wasn't for his kids,
you'd be out on the street.

272
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,788
What do you want?

273
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,355
I thought you might want to know
we have some sadness in common.

274
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,062
He has been sleeping
with my cousin, Svetlana.

275
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,237
That's right.

276
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,740
While she was taking care of his uncle.

277
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,444
You piece of shit.

278
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,311
Yes, I'm a piece of shit.

279
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,251
I'm a piece of shit which the world,
every morning, strains...

280
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,981
and pushes out of its butt!

281
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,190
If you can,
imagine where you are on the pecking order.

282
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,626
You call my house again...

283
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,094
you ever speak...

284
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,302
to one of my children again,
I will track you down, and I will kill you.

285
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,964
We have got guns here.

286
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,700
I mean it.

287
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,670
You remember my cousin?

288
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,912
She was also his mama's caregiver,
with the one leg.

289
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,745
It is so absurd, why would I make it up?

290
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,247
What the fuck?

291
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,331
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You fucking shitbag!

292
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,201
Don't come up here!
Get the fuck out of this house!

293
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,445
What's the matter?

294
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,925
Carm, what did I do now?

295
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,620
What did I do?

296
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,968
Your mother told you what I said
to your father about her psoriasis?

297
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,439
I was just trying to be honest with him.

298
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:37,439
You have made a fool of me for years
with these whores.

299
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,942
Now it's come into our home?

300
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,082
- What are you talking about?
- The Russian called.

301
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,418
Your son answered the telephone.

302
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,655
Oh, Jesus.

303
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,428
She's insane. She's fucking certifiable.

304
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,465
I told you, you can't believe
nothing she says, whatever it is.

305
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,728
We haven't seen each other like that.

306
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,134
I swear to Christ. I told you!

307
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,499
- What about her cousin?
- What?

308
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,765
No.

309
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,902
The nurse who took care of your mother,
who I liked?

310
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,176
Who I talked to on the telephone
about your mother's alopecia...

311
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,807
and her bowel movements?

312
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,079
Who you told me came from an agency?

313
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,452
Who I shared vodka with
the night your mother died?

314
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,852
You've been fucking her?

315
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,087
There is not a shred of truth in that.

316
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,721
Why'd the cousin make it up?
Because she's jealous!

317
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,162
Why you, fuck....

318
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,557
Let go of me!

319
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,258
Just get out, Tony.

320
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,492
Don't even say anything.

321
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,028
I'm not going anywhere, and you know it.

322
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,625
So, let's just lie down, we'll calm down--

323
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,430
Get your hands off of me!

324
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,468
Don't you touch me ever again.

325
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,437
Where's A. J.?

326
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,574
So, you've had a one- legged one now?
That's nice.

327
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,141
You've had quite a time on my watch.

328
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,054
The pre- school assistant...

329
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,886
- the weightlifter--
- At least I never stole from you.

330
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,790
Who stole, Tony? Who, me?

331
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,796
My own wife, $40, 000. From the birdfeeder.

332
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,459
The birdfeeder.
Listen to yourself, you sound demented.

333
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,471
What, you want to hit me, Tony? Go ahead.

334
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,407
Just go away, please,
I can't stand it anymore.

335
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,973
- I didn't do it.
- I found her fingernail, Tony!

336
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,451
You saw it that day, on your night table.

337
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,822
I found it, and I put it there.
I know you saw it.

338
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,118
That....

339
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,292
What? That what?

340
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,419
Nothing.

341
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,800
What?

342
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,313
You know what I don't understand, Tony?

343
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,115
What does she have that I don't have?

344
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,693
I did not carry on an affair with the cousin...

345
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,598
and I will take a goddamn polygraph
to that effect.

346
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,362
I want you to leave this house, Tony.

347
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,202
Please. I want you to leave me alone.

348
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,677
What about the kids?

349
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,913
Yeah, it's horrible. God help them.

350
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,121
Open the fucking door, or I'll kick it in!

351
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,594
She's not there.

352
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,228
Probably she hides in Brighton Beach.

353
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,358
She blames you for Ronnie Zellman.

354
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,162
You beat him with belt.

355
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,267
He felt weak in front of her.

356
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,464
She told me he couldn't perform.

357
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,812
They broke up not so long after.

358
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,280
Oh, fuck that!

359
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,519
Who told her about us? Not you, please.

360
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:18,056
It was what's- her- name, right?
The one who walked in on us.

361
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,528
We had bad argument over
FICA and federal withholding.

362
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,295
I take from her paycheck.

363
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,363
Jesus fucking Christ.
FICA and federal withholding?

364
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:43,184
I gotta go home tomorrow,
and I gotta tell my kids we're separating.

365
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,418
It's going to rip them up.

366
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,985
Divorce is very hard for kids.

367
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,829
After this, they don't trust.

368
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,222
I'm child of divorce.

369
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,703
I shouldn't have been drinking
in the afternoon.

370
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,244
How about a little sympathy here?
You got ice in your veins?

371
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,748
I had ice in my veins on your uncle couch?

372
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,841
Most expensive piece of ass I ever had.

373
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,682
Right. I know what you are thinking, too.

374
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,423
Take care, Tony.
You're a strong guy, you'll be all right.

375
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,603
What's up?

376
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,174
So, how's it going with Christopher home?

377
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,537
Good. That place was a godsend.

378
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,641
So, the wedding's back on?

379
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,879
We haven't talked about it.

380
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,213
Except....

381
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,617
Except what?

382
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,396
He says he isn't sure anymore
he'd be a good father...

383
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,357
after killing my dog.

384
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,703
You have kids?

385
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,334
So, how's Tony?
He's been house- hunting down the shore?

386
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,438
Beautiful place, too.

387
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,250
What about Ralph?

388
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,478
Cifaretto? Heard anything there?

389
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,418
Chrissy says
he has a pretty serious drug problem, too.

390
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,887
He may have hit bottom somewhere.

391
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,860
Chrissy says he wants to...

392
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,191
you know, help get him in recovery
when he resurfaces.

393
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,605
You know Ralph's
second- in- command, Vito?

394
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,974
Yeah, the fat guy.

395
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:56,174
When Christopher was away, I had
that asshole calling me every five minutes...

396
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,908
to see if I "needed anything."

397
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,974
No! Does Christopher know?

398
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,019
You kidding me? He'd kill him.

399
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,814
Not really, I mean....

400
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,353
You know, he'd be angry.

401
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,699
I'm supposed to meet my mom.

402
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,264
Go ahead.

403
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,341
Thank you.

404
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,338
I saw your car. Que pasa?

405
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,288
Things aren't very good at home...

406
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,881
so I came down to sleep on my boat.

407
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,657
And it was being refinished,
and the smell of the paint drove me out.

408
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,125
I'm sorry, I've been up to bat three times.

409
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:25,260
Yeah, I think she's thinking of separating.

410
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,774
What you wanna do,
go around and meet perfunctorily...

411
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,072
with all the top divorce attorneys
in your area.

412
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,443
That way, if the worst happens,
they can't take her on as a client.

413
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,038
Conflict of interest.

414
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,648
- That's pretty good.
- Just do it, fella.

415
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,989
But you must find a hotel
until you officially take possession.

416
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,150
Something happens to you, I'm liable.

417
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,887
Let me just clean up a little.

418
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,310
- Hi, I'm Tony.
- I know who you are. Come in, please.

419
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,647
Tony, what's up?

420
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,557
You know that thing we were talking about,
this thing with me and my wife?

421
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,328
Alan just told me.

422
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,797
The thing is, in light of it,
I was going over it in the shower...

423
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,735
and I realized that
as much as I want this place...

424
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,868
now is not the time for me
to be buying a house.

425
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,506
Sorry, I know it's a big disappointment.
You ought to see how I feel.

426
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,941
I want to get my deposit back,
and I'll get out of your life.

427
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,179
It's just not that clear to me
how your marital situation...

428
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,653
negates the purchase.

429
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,986
I mean, most of this was for my kids.

430
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,583
For my wife.

431
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,787
- That is so sad.
- Excuse me, honey.

432
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,092
We had that place on the market
a year and a half.

433
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,462
We had two offers: you and the Kims.

434
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,795
So, what about them?

435
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:08,100
The Kims? I can't go back to them.
I guess I could, but I'm not going to.

436
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,901
They'd hold my feet to the fire.

437
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,000
I don't want to be insensitive
with what you got on your plate...

438
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,704
but we had a signed contract.

439
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,110
- Alan.
- No! Baloney!

440
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,013
I dumped a buyer
'cause they seemed to love the place.

441
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:23,144
- It was the cash and the short escrow.
- Look, who knows what's going to happen?

442
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,451
You guys could be back together
in a month...

443
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,718
leaving A. S. , here, fucked in the ass.

444
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,426
Whatever.

445
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:38,999
What's the big deal?
Why don't you just let me out of this thing?

446
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,799
I can't, I have partners.

447
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,732
Excuse me.

448
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,502
I got to take this.

449
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,475
It was very nice to meet you.

450
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,884
But I'm not buying your house.

451
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,615
That guy's a mobster.

452
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,826
They buy houses from people,
they conduct business.

453
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,123
I dealt with them
on that Neapolitan copyright thing for Enya.

454
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,791
I'll probably let him walk...

455
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,030
but that's a negotiation,
which he knows full well.

456
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,935
You don't have any partners.

457
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,995
Thank you, Rabbi.

458
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,670
I just talked to Carmine.

459
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,041
He's ready to settle.

460
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,579
Are you kidding me?

461
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,513
Everything's in motion.

462
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,072
Welcome to my world.

463
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,152
Have a seat.

464
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm sorry to learn
about the marital situation, Tony.

465
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,240
Our thing is more than a livelihood.

466
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,469
One of us suffers a personal tragedy,
falls ill and whatnot...

467
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,540
we all feel it deeply...

468
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,346
no matter what kind of acrimony
is in the air.

469
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,683
What's in the air is
you're losing a lot of money.

470
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,222
We all agree
we want to get back to earning...

471
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,281
but I reiterate again...

472
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,552
Zellman had a hand in HUD,
so I can't, as a matter of principle...

473
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,353
relinquish my claim.

474
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,059
So?

475
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:21,264
I said 40, you said 5. 5,
which was ridiculous.

476
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:25,100
Let's split the difference. 20 percent.

477
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,446
All right, 15.

478
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,848
You know what?

479
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,917
In the interest of putting this shit to bed...

480
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,319
if that's what it's going to take...

481
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,049
15.

482
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,622
Good.

483
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,406
My son was a big help in all this.

484
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,738
I want you always to remember that...

485
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,299
even after I'm gone.

486
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,007
But I'm not going no place.

487
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,345
Healthy as a fucking rhino, this guy.

488
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,350
You stay that way.

489
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,557
Did you get any sleep?

490
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,566
A little, I think.

491
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,639
Maybe it would be better
if you went back to school.

492
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,871
Got your head into your schoolwork.
Be with your friends.

493
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,371
I'd just be thinking about
what's going on here all the time.

494
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,343
I just keep thinking...

495
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,120
I used to feel so superior...

496
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,522
because so many of my friends
had these fucked- up, divorced parents.

497
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,260
I guess I did, too.

498
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,357
And, like, Finn....

499
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,794
I'm not saying I want kids, but if we did....

500
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,468
I used to imagine...

501
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,633
we'd all be together
on the holidays, Christmas...

502
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,273
all around this big fire.

503
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,074
You will have a wonderful future, Meadow.

504
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,775
We had a lot of wonderful times as a family.

505
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,118
All predicated on bullshit.

506
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:23,787
I don't want to fight with you, Meadow.
That's not true. I think you know it.

507
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,230
It was'cause of Furio, wasn't it?

508
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,208
Who said anything about Furio?

509
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,507
I have never been unfaithful to your father.

510
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,609
Daddy was.

511
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,213
This is not something I want to talk about.
I'm sorry.

512
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,115
Not now, not ever.

513
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:01,493
Jesus, how could you eat shit from him
for all those years?

514
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,406
Fresh pepper?

515
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,944
Just a little.

516
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,178
About you and Carmela....

517
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,315
I'm sorry.

518
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,188
This is not al dente.

519
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,635
Hello?

520
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,077
Fucking amazing, huh?

521
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,307
Well, I guess that's that.

522
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,513
Things have a momentum of their own.

523
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,990
More is lost by indecision
than wrong decision.

524
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,322
That's a good point.

525
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,568
Okay, then. You'll hear from me.

526
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,841
That was J. S.

527
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,042
- We're not on for Tuesday no more, right?
- Wrong.

528
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,520
Johnny Sack.

529
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,783
I always worked very fucking hard
to make him think I liked him.

530
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,654
I'd try to feel him out about shit.

531
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,626
I think he and Ralphie were in bed
in some way.

532
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,427
It went bad with that joke shit.

533
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,638
We reached an agreement.

534
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:58,479
When Tony gave him his final number,
Carmine's Depends blew out.

535
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,312
Oh, my fucking back!

536
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,578
That cot at the pork store,
not really good for sleeping, T.

537
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,122
With all due love and respect to Carmela...

538
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,985
I'd put her shit out on the curb
and let it rain on her.

539
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,695
You can't disrupt the kids.
That shit traumatizes them for life.

540
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,823
It's his house as much as it is hers.

541
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,490
More. I paid for it.

542
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,401
That's right, T, I'm on your side on this.

543
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,714
She's the one who talked me into
buying it in the first place.

544
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,217
Now I'm out in the streets?
These fucking phones.

545
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,486
We were better off years ago.

546
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,619
What?

547
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,161
I hadn't heard from you.

548
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,290
My partners and I have decided
to let you out of your obligation.

549
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,493
I want my $200, 000 by the end of the week.

550
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,037
As to that, I'm not rescinding the deposit.

551
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,231
That's what they're for,
to hold parties to agreements.

552
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,866
If you want to make me an offer....

553
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,869
No, I think I'll buy the house.

554
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,780
My family has parties
till 4:00, 5:00 in the morning.

555
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:08,818
I can show damages.

556
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,753
I'm being generous in not bringing action
to enforce the sale.

557
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,050
Damages?

558
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,984
- They haven't started yet.
- Listen to me.

559
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,461
There's a paper trail to our dispute,
and Virginia Lupo's a witness.

560
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,988
A hair on my head gets mussed,
the authorities will know where to look.

561
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,695
Alan, you misread me entirely.

562
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,367
You must think I'm a fucking thug.

563
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,168
Just be forewarned.

564
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,935
You're not getting your deposit back!

565
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,386
Jesus, you scared me to death.

566
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,695
This is my house, Carmela,
and I'm not leaving.

567
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,136
Get out of here, Tony.
I asked you once, nicely.

568
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,540
All right, look.

569
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,270
I know what happened was wrong.

570
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,779
I was an asshole, and I apologize.

571
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,578
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

572
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,445
I said,"Get out."

573
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,348
Make me.

574
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:25,418
I have an appointment with a lawyer, Tony.
I will get a restraining order.

575
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,127
A lawyer? Go ahead.

576
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,265
You know what? Call him.

577
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,427
Here, use my phone.

578
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,497
Fine, stay.

579
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,005
Come here. You're not going anywhere.

580
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,939
Let go of me. Your son will be home.

581
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,173
- You want him to see you like this?
- You'd love that, wouldn't you?

582
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:46,774
- I'm not leaving here.
- I don't love you anymore!

583
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,308
I don't want you!
You are not sleeping in my bed, Tony!

584
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,716
The thought of it now makes me sick!

585
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,594
Jesus Christ Almighty,
I'm going fucking crazy!

586
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,038
Think Mom's going to let you stay out here?

587
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,346
Let? This is my house.

588
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,221
Ain't it better when I'm here?

589
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:26,919
Well, sure.

590
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,856
Come on. We'll bring them down
to the garage tomorrow.

591
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,996
What time is it?

592
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,460
- You just getting home?
- We were studying.

593
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:41,661
Oh, yeah?

594
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,640
From now on,
I'm going to take a bigger hand in this shit.

595
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,369
I'm going to be right out here.

596
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,970
I want you to be respectful to your mother.
She's having a hard time.

597
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,447
- Did she say something?
- I'm just saying.

598
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,447
All right. Go to bed. It's a school night.

599
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,269
The audiences have been given
an abundance of programming...

600
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,608
and they vote every hour,
every minute, every five minutes...

601
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,240
with their remotes.

602
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,283
Thanks, by the way,
for drinking wine in front of me.

603
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,825
- Hello?
- Call it off.

604
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,090
- The old guy.
- Yeah?

605
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,591
- Something don't make sense here.
- You think it's a setup?

606
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,761
Not necessarily, but...

607
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,296
our friend is very anxious
to pass the ball, the prick.

608
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,167
But nobody can know
this was ever considered.

609
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,970
I'll offer my guys
half of what they'd have got.

610
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,946
- That should do it.
- I just want you to make sure.

611
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,713
I told you that.

612
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,718
So it behooves us
to protect what we've earned.

613
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,179
It's all there.

614
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,147
If you get the taste
to chip a little "H" again...

615
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,016
- don't forget to call us.
- Like we said, you'll keep this quiet.

616
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,028
- I got the mouth on a statue, nigga.
- Word.

617
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,927
See you around.

618
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,241
He ain't quit. He's just freshening up.

619
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,474
Don't say jack shit to Kaesha about this...

620
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,381
or she be haunting my ass
for that child support--

621
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,807
What?

622
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:53,713
I was wondering when you would move
those theater seats down to the garage.

623
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,619
Seriously?

624
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,724
That's what you came out here
to talk to me about?

625
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,198
They are on the lawn. They'll ruin the grass.

626
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,394
Bad for the grass!

627
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:12,575
I can't put the sprinklers on over there
without the seats getting wet.

628
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,312
They're your seats.
I don't want to wreck them.

629
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,904
I'll get right on it.

630
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,979
Why do you have to make
even this little thing so difficult?

631
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,616
What possible reason could you have
for coming here...

632
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,456
to talk to me about theater seats
except to bust my balls?

633
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,689
I wanted to water while I was out.

634
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,225
Yeah, right.

635
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:40,792
Fuck you.

636
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,005
It's going to cost you $3.

637
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,346
You know what, Tony? What's done is done.

638
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,807
We are where we are, and it's for the best.

639
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,747
But just for the record,
or it might even interest you to know...

640
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:04,190
that I might actually have gone on
with your cheating and your bullshit...

641
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:09,159
if your attitude around here
had been even the least bit loving...

642
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,927
cooperative, interested.

643
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,736
Whose idea was Whitecaps?

644
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:23,510
It is just a bigger version of an emerald ring,
so you can keep on with your other life.

645
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,013
You don't know me at all.

646
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,210
I know you better than anybody, Tony.
Even your friends.

647
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,447
- Which is probably why you hate me.
- Hate you?

648
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,515
Don't worry, I'm going to hell when I die.

649
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,894
Nice thing to say to a person
heading into an MRI.

650
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,981
You know, Tony...

651
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,983
I have always been sorry I said that.

652
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,355
You were my guy.

653
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:13,928
You could be so sweet.
Nobody could make me laugh like you.

654
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,838
Who the fuck did you think I was
when you married me?

655
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:26,269
You knew my father. You grew up around
Dickie Moltisanti and your uncle Eddie.

656
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,641
Where do you get off
acting surprised and miffed...

657
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,805
when there are women on the side?

658
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,677
- You knew the deal.
- Deal?

659
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,246
Your mom talks all she wants...

660
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,649
about what's- his- name
and his chain of drugstores.

661
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,883
Both of us know the other boyfriend
you were debating marrying...

662
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:43,221
was Jerry Tufi,
with his father's snowplow business.

663
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,657
And we now know that
that wouldn't have suited you at all.

664
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,757
You really don't hear me, do you?

665
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:55,161
- You think, for me, it's all about things.
- No, I forced all this shit on you.

666
00:52:55,872 --> 00:53:00,036
What you really crave is a little Hyundai
and a simple gold heart on a chain.

667
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,803
You are so fucking hateful.

668
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,785
Can I tell you something, Tony?

669
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,980
Don't pretend like I got a choice.

670
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,654
The last year...

671
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:19,050
I have been dreaming, and fantasizing,
and in love with Furio.

672
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,199
Every morning,
when he'd come to pick you up...

673
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,501
I would look forward to it
all night long, in bed...

674
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,934
next to you.

675
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:35,067
Those nights when you were
actually in the bed.

676
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,204
And he would ring the doorbell...

677
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,807
I felt like my heart
would come out of my chest.

678
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,245
He would smile, and we'd talk.

679
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,349
And then you would come down the stairs.

680
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,951
And I felt probably like someone
who is terminally ill...

681
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,860
and, somehow,
they manage to forget it for a minute.

682
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,361
And then it all comes back.

683
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,703
- He'd talk to you! Poor you!
- He made me feel like I mattered!

684
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,178
You asked me the other day
what Irina's cousin has that you don't have.

685
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,115
And I thought about it,
because it is a pretty good question.

686
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:17,347
She is sexy, even with the one pin gone,
but that's not it.

687
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,321
I could converse with her,
because she had something to say!

688
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,484
I am here! I have things to say!

689
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,996
Besides "Bring the chairs down,"
and "Did you sign the living trust?"

690
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,554
She is a grown woman
who has been kicked around...

691
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,796
and she's been on her own,
and has had to fight and struggle.

692
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,461
Unlike me, is that it?

693
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,131
Who the fuck wanted it like this?

694
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,400
Who the fuck pissed and moaned
at just the idea...

695
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,445
of me with a real estate license?

696
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:46,345
Free to sit back for 20 fucking years
and fiddle with the air conditioning...

697
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:51,410
and fucking bitch and complain to me!

698
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,784
To your priest! Fuck it!

699
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:05,401
Who knew, all this time,
you wanted Tracy and Hepburn?

700
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:13,467
What about the thousand other pigs
you had your dick in over the years?

701
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,339
The strippers, the cocktail waitresses.

702
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,206
Were you best friends with all of them, too?

703
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,578
You fucking hypocrite.

704
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,805
The judge is calling you all
into the courtroom.

705
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,742
Okay, thanks.

706
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,771
The number you are calling was blocked...

707
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,216
and cannot be called back
using your last- call- return service.

708
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,729
"We are still hopelessly deadlocked.

709
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,667
"One juror refuses to deliberate,
and can't be reasoned with.

710
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,099
"What should we do now?"

711
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,073
Your Honor,
again, I must move for a mistrial.

712
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:56,676
Your Honor, the government asks
that you give them another Allen charge...

713
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,413
to go back and try again.

714
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,617
As much as I'd like to,
this jury's been at it a long time.

715
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,348
I don't see where one or two more days
is going to change anything.

716
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,289
Bring in the jury.

717
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:29,405
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I see that you are hopelessly deadlocked...

718
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:33,076
and I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

719
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,249
I know that you did the best you could.

720
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,519
You have performed a valuable service.

721
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,357
You may be excused.

722
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,768
Stay in touch.
Call me when your grandson is born.

723
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,540
I wouldn't want to think of you on that day.

724
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,610
Dad.

725
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:14,854
Battle of Tarawa.

726
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,987
Marines had no air cover.

727
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,294
It was a slaughter.

728
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,026
War? I don't know.

729
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,131
There's Coke in there.

730
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,640
Can I move in here?

731
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,469
- What's wrong with your room?
- I can't take it anymore.

732
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:40,438
Mom's just on my case all the time.
My dinner got cold.

733
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,780
So, I was on the phone with Devin.
We had to do an algebra problem.

734
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,395
Look, I told you
she's having a hard time right now.

735
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,693
- She goes to a lot of trouble to cook meals.
- I didn't ask her to.

736
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,962
And it's not fair.
Why do I have to get stuck with her?

737
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,638
Don't talk about your mother like that.

738
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,539
You don't have to put up
with her shit anymore.

739
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,010
I heard you tell her off out by the pool.

740
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,878
You're not staying in here.

741
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,111
- Get that out of your head right now.
- Why not?

742
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,951
It would hurt her feelings that you don't
want to be in her part of the house.

743
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,320
Your old amp's hooked back up.

744
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
Be careful with that speaker.
You banged the other one.

745
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,601
What are you gonna do
without your front speakers?

746
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,472
- I'll take them.
- They're just borrowing them.

747
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,340
I'll come back for the amp.

748
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:46,639
You can come here and watch TV with me,
but you can't stay here.

749
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:48,873
Fuck.

750
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,093
Go buy her one of those CDs she likes,
and some flowers.

751
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:02,563
Tell her you're sorry,
that you'll try to be more considerate.

752
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,252
We should call everybody, have a big party.

753
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:32,124
Call Volpe's and have them send over
a couple of pies, but that's it.

754
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,856
There's a hearty Burgundy still in the fridge.

755
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,895
I don't suppose Tony would come...

756
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,269
with what's going on up at that abattoir.

757
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,879
I don't think so, Uncle Jun'.

758
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,117
I want to get one large cheese and tomato,
and then one with alici.

759
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,887
Yeah, it's me.

760
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,624
I got you to hold my hand

761
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:16,830
Babe

762
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,636
I got you, babe

763
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,806
I got you, babe

764
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:29,184
Go down by the cellar door. See if
Murf left the envelope under the flagstone.

765
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,312
He wouldn't have been around today.
I'll go look later.

766
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,549
Do it now. Is that asking so much?

767
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,885
I just went through the trial of my life.

768
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,104
To wonderful friends...

769
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,163
to Alan's shark fin soup...

770
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,172
and to a wonderful day.

771
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,503
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

772
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,846
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Sands Hotel proudly presents...

773
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,546
the star of our show...

774
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,590
direct from the bar, Dean Martin!

775
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,088
What the hell?

776
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,199
It's that boat.

777
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,708
"Stugots"?

778
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,980
Fucking goombah trash.

779
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,217
This whole shoreline's turning
into the Gulf of Sorrento.

780
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,191
Buddy! Turn it down!

781
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,705
Been waiting long?

782
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:15,015
Sorry, I was interviewing divorce lawyers.

783
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,315
That's why I always ask myself,
"Is it worth it financially?"

784
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,949
You and Ginny are the old married couple.

785
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,856
Marriage can be very hard work
if both aren't pulling that load.

786
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:30,297
I was wondering, why the delay?

787
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,293
I was gonna call you.

788
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,765
You're not gonna be happy.

789
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,168
I'm out.

790
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,304
Whacking a boss is bad for business.

791
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,247
- And now that he's settled....
- We can weather it.

792
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,840
It's not just the internal upheaval.

793
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:53,711
Mr. and Mrs. John Q. America,
by and large, they sit still for our shit.

794
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,622
So, people get ripped off,
they figure it's not them.

795
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,388
But if it's the fucking O. K. Corral out there...

796
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,189
the Feds take heat.

797
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,493
- This is very disappointing.
- I know.

798
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,530
But he's an old man.
You're gonna get your chance soon enough.

799
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,700
Don't go into coaching, Tony.
It's not your long suit.

800
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:17,178
- What I was gonna say--
- Tomorrow, I go in to work.

801
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,216
"Creeps on this petty pace."

802
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,410
And I take orders from him again?

803
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:27,814
Or that disgusting, fucking,
cocksucker idiot son of his?

804
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:34,489
- I shouldn't be hearing that.
- Really?

805
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,459
What I was gonna say was...

806
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,132
it's a major step...

807
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:48,168
but if you wanna do it,
without me as a partner...

808
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,769
you do what you gotta do.

809
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:54,340
I will never, ever reveal any conversation
we ever had.

810
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:58,751
The thing is, we had those conversations.
Your mouth was moving along with mine.

811
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,985
We just go back about our business
at the Esplanade, like it never happened?

812
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,357
- That would be the healthy choice.
- Healthy for who?

813
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:11,332
Why the fuck would I ever trust somebody
who'd leave me holding my cock like this?

814
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,665
- I shouldn't have heard that either.
- There you go.

815
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,435
There's the fucking problem.

816
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,307
I still consider you a dear friend.

817
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:13,918
They're actually moored about two and
a half centimeters away from the fire.

818
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:17,693
So, they are finally making
a little bit of an impact with their buckets.

819
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,299
I didn't know you were in the house.

820
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,302
- Just stopped by to pick up a few things.
- Fine.

821
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,277
The geeks are really making
some progress now!

822
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,357
Turn that off and come here.

823
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,992
Got something to say to your mom.

824
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,052
I might as well tell you at the same time.

825
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:50,121
- It's almost over.
- Now.

826
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,312
I've been thinking about things,
me living out there.

827
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,841
I've decided it's probably not a good idea.

828
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,357
What's going on?

829
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,033
I was just telling everybody...

830
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,837
it's probably better
if I don't live here anymore.

831
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,113
Because I wanted to stay in there with you?
I won't ask.

832
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,343
- I just got pissed off.
- He asked to live with you?

833
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,359
No, A. J. Come here.

834
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,728
That's not why.

835
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,833
- Where are you gonna go?
- Don't worry about it.

836
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,072
You should go back to counseling.

837
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,450
It's better this way.

838
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,784
He's making the right decision.

839
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:25,486
He'll get a place, you will go and visit.
It'll be better, you'll see.

840
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:28,792
You guys could still get
back together maybe. Right?

841
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,227
Yeah, sure.

842
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,596
We're still close.

843
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,153
God, is there nothing to eat in this house?

844
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,491
Be careful.

845
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,020
I'll be at the Plaza.

846
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:47,766
Well, I don't drink anymore.
I freeze it now and I eat it like a Popsicle.

847
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:53,608
A drink never hurt nobody. You remember
the great words of Joe E. Lewis.

848
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:57,237
He says,"You're not drunk if you can lay
on the floor without holding on."

849
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,941
Fucking gangster asshole!

850
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,882
I'll call the police.

851
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:09,651
He'll just turn it down again
when the police boat comes.

852
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:16,530
The coast guard.

853
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:20,364
He can keep paying
those $200 fines forever, Alan!

854
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,970
You've gotta let it go, Alan!

855
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:26,030
Give him his money! God!
