1
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,128
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:45,570
Corrado Soprano is not
some harmless old man...

3
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,740
being persecuted by the government...

4
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:53,174
but a ruthless and calculating mob boss...

5
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,579
who controls a vast criminal enterprise.

6
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:01,717
Over the past few months,
you've heard from FBI agents...

7
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:07,057
who have documented
clandestine meetings at his doctor's offices.

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,987
Tales of bid rigging, sweetheart deals...

9
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,999
secret payoffs, and even murder.

10
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:20,929
No, Corrado Soprano
is not some harmless old man...

11
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,633
but a killer who orders up murder...

12
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,344
like you and I order up coffee.

13
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,019
All right. So, I rewrote it.

14
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,155
"The entire point of Melville's Billy Budd...

15
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,996
"it seems to me, is to show
how mean humans can be to each other.

16
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,435
"Especially when living
in cramped conditions."

17
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,097
Hold that thought.

18
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,477
Come on in.

19
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,856
So, how is your mother's
apartment coming?

20
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,085
Artie's Uncle Zio finished the framing...

21
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,889
but now the Sheetrock,
it's wet on the bottom.

22
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,055
There's a leak, maybe in the foundation.

23
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,031
My father is a contractor.

24
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,263
If you want, I can have him take a look at it.
He is free, I think, tomorrow afternoon.

25
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,464
That would be a huge relief.

26
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,399
What smells in this house?
Marone, it's like the smell of heaven.

27
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,968
Homemade scones. My son loves them.

28
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,642
Here, try one. They are just out of the oven.

29
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,207
Thank you, no.

30
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,121
That's all there is for breakfast,
is fat and carbs?

31
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,489
Excuse me, we have a guest.
You want to say hello?

32
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,719
Anyway.

33
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,830
"When Mr. Claggart gets mad at Billy,
it is a surprise...

34
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,059
"because he is always saying
how handsome Billy is.

35
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,069
"This does not seem realistic...

36
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,903
"because why would an officer care
if a sailor was handsome or not?"

37
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,658
A. J. , your father's leaving.
I'll come up in a minute. Go over it.

38
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,134
What is this?

39
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,603
"Ocean Club at Paradise Island."

40
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,773
We leave tomorrow for three beautiful days.

41
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,505
Tomorrow?

42
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,172
I know it's short notice,
but the deal came through.

43
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,376
We got a view suite, first- class plane tickets.

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,516
Guy owes me a favor.

45
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,286
- What?
- I don't know...

46
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,722
- A. J.? School?
- He's old enough to spoil himself now.

47
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,489
You were jealous when I left for Florida--

48
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,297
My mother with the skin condition.
Just the time it's gonna take to pack.

49
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,598
To pack.

50
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,733
I'll wait outside.

51
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,002
With all the shit that's been going on,
the horse and all....

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,049
Now, I know you need a break. Deep down...

53
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,382
that's probably the reason
you got your hair cut.

54
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,249
You believe that in there? The tickets?

55
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,987
For two years,
she's complained that we never get away.

56
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,689
So I make it happen.
Top shelf across the board.

57
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:35,257
All of a sudden, her mother's psoriasis
is like the bubonic fucking plague.

58
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,432
You know what, va fungule.
I don't know why I bother.

59
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,166
- She's probably worried for her mother.
- Fuck that.

60
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,472
They got her on the cortisone.

61
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,814
I know she's my wife
and the mother of my children and all...

62
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,340
but let me tell you something,
she can be a moody bitch.

63
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,619
There he is. Live from Miami Beach.

64
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,058
- Where's your pop?
- Clubhouse.

65
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,966
Forgot to put his Desenex.

66
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,169
- This shit with Tony?
- Total debacle.

67
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,682
And Pop with his testa dura,
he's not doing anybody any good.

68
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,242
Anything you could do
to change your father's mind?

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,153
I'm gonna try, John.
I came all the way up here for that.

70
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,884
You put your sun block on?

71
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,898
As you know, Dad,
Tony Soprano came to visit me recently.

72
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,631
I bought him dinner, we talked.

73
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,036
I'm not sure I like that he did that end run.

74
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,974
He's an old- fashioned guy, Pop.
Very allegorical.

75
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,103
I don't think it was his intention
to insult anybody.

76
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,382
You're distracting me. I'm taking a mulligan.

77
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:03,755
The problem is, I'm afraid that you backed
yourself into a corner, this HUD thing.

78
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,622
Your insistence on the 40 percent.

79
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,389
Remember, even from the beginning
I felt 40 was a tad steep.

80
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,863
A real hardhead, this Soprano kid.

81
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,299
And the ego.

82
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,733
I tell you, though, when I first met him,
decisive as he is...

83
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,441
I would've been proud
to call him my own son.

84
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,474
Maybe there's a compromise here, then.

85
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,809
There's always a compromise.

86
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,511
He's a bit of a poseur, if you ask me.

87
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,818
Tony. He likes to talk the talk, I don't know.

88
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,226
- What did he say?
- His turf, his appraiser.

89
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,988
Son of a bitch.

90
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,501
- What, did they resod that green?
- No, you got to give him some slack.

91
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,732
He hasn't really been boss of a family
very long.

92
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,731
Family? I told you, they're a glorified crew.

93
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,840
Whatever they are, Carmine,
the Sopranos bring in a lot of cash.

94
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,247
I've been close with Tony for a lot of years.

95
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,809
On reflection, John,
maybe that's the sticking post.

96
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,720
Tony feels like you're friends
and not business associates.

97
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,920
See, what am I always saying?
I hate this fucking shit.

98
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:29,603
It's a small space, but I guess
that makes it a decorating challenge.

99
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,803
The man in the store says to put mirrors...

100
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,645
but Mama thinks it's nose- in- the- air
when people look at themselves.

101
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:42,520
How about, let's see, something like this?

102
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,526
That's beautiful.
She'll fall in love with that place.

103
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,085
It's so cozy with the pillows....Romantic.

104
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,994
Not that your mother....

105
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,568
I never thanked you for helping me.

106
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,806
That's okay.

107
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,377
You're a very special woman.

108
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,975
Have you thought about flooring yet?

109
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,047
Not really, no.

110
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,754
Speak English, for Christ's sake.

111
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,818
If she doesn't go for mirrors...

112
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,093
we should pick
a light- colored ceramic tile maybe.

113
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,264
All the houses back home have tile floors.

114
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,099
Then we should go to Colortile.
They have everything.

115
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,973
- I would love to go with you there.
- Great, then it's a date.

116
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,608
Good. It's a date.

117
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,315
The handicaps are all taken.

118
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,654
What beautiful affairs they were,
those Knights of Columbus dinners.

119
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,058
Julius La Rosa would sing
with that voice of his.

120
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,493
Top dollar, they paid.

121
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,861
Now, that's a nice- looking man.

122
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,171
There's a handicap by the door.
Quick, Minn.

123
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,676
I remember him
from Arthur Godfrey's program.

124
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,770
He was so mean to him, that man.

125
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,716
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

126
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,186
I'm bleeding. Oh, my god.

127
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,824
Jesus Christ, lady, didn't you see me?

128
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,266
Guy checks into one of the guest rooms...

129
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,666
calls down and says,
"l got a leak in the sink."

130
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,570
I said,"Go ahead,
the customer's always right."

131
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,505
Any results from Little Carmine yet?

132
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,478
Johnny Sack wants a sit- down
tomorrow night.

133
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,772
Sweetheart, another drink.

134
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,483
What do you say, Ton'?
Maybe we should take off soon?

135
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,456
What's your hurry? Hang out awhile.

136
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,183
- Stay, I'll get you home.
- No, we should go.

137
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,727
All right, you two want to go?
I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,891
Come on, I'll walk you out.

139
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,129
Perfect.

140
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,269
Got my drink, a little dancing....

141
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,245
You want to go upstairs?

142
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,080
That's okay.

143
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,859
Paulie, Marone.

144
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,234
For Pete's sake, Nucci,
you were fine for the last two hours.

145
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,739
All right, let me see.

146
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,606
She's just a little shaken up.
We gave her some Tylenol.

147
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,408
It was such a crash, though.
Cookie's in the x- ray with three stitches.

148
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,881
When was the last time
you had your eyes examined?

149
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,851
- My eyesight is fine.
- Listen to the doc.

150
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,718
You shouldn't be behind the wheel
at your age.

151
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:08,283
- I've been driving since I was a young girl.
- Horse and buggies don't count.

152
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,022
- Paulie, be nice.
- Relax, Ma.

153
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,857
She ain't driving you no more.

154
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,924
Maybe if your mother
wasn't talking in my ear.

155
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,268
We were all chatting.

156
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,238
Everyone in the neighborhood
says you're moving into the home.

157
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,674
- What do you need a car for?
- I like my independence.

158
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:29,010
- And it's none of your goddamn business.
- This is my Ma we're talking about.

159
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,515
But we have tickets to The Producers.

160
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,852
Don't worry about it. I'll drive you girls.

161
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,517
Hello?

162
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,816
Colin, hi.

163
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,861
Hey, Mrs. Soprano.
Meadow's on campus, she'll be right back.

164
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,565
- I'm Ellen McDermott, Colin's mother.
- Hi.

165
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,467
I'm gonna get my shoes.

166
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,063
You've seen the apartment before?

167
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,406
I teach school out in Akron
and I couldn't get here till now.

168
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,537
We figured she's only a sophomore,
why does she need an apartment?

169
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,175
But with those seniors moving out midterm,
we said a Hail Mary.

170
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,517
No, I have to tell you.
Your daughter is really something.

171
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:13,149
- His old roommate--
- Thank you. Colin is very sweet also.

172
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,318
Thank you. But she's going places, that girl.

173
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:22,291
Poised, mature. Cooks for these other two.
Plus she volunteers at that law center.

174
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,599
I think that's extraordinary. Congratulations.

175
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,862
Speak of the devil.

176
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,843
- Mom, remember Alex?
- Of course, hi.

177
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,141
Excuse me.

178
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,547
- The place is really shaping up.
- I guess.

179
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:51,224
What's the matter? Finn? I thought
things were going well with you two.

180
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,629
They are. I don't know.

181
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,127
I keep waiting for him to say he loves me
and he hasn't.

182
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,808
Some men have to move
at their own pace, Mead'.

183
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,411
It's amazing, isn't it?

184
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,620
Whoa, Nelly.

185
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,520
He'll be all right.

186
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,188
So, what do you say? You boys hungry?

187
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,689
- No, we got to go.
- The limo's on its way up from Norwalk.

188
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,257
Marty, why don't you chopper them out?

189
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,136
Chopper? That's fucking awesome.

190
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,334
I'll call Doug. See if it's available.

191
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,650
I got Tony Soprano here.

192
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,250
He was asking if the chopper's available.

193
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,451
I know.

194
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,353
This new fucking girl told him.

195
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,257
I know.

196
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,491
About $15, 000 between the five of them.

197
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,466
I know.

198
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,369
Righty- o.

199
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,010
Good news, gentlemen.

200
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,325
Sorry about the mess.

201
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,228
Mr. Soprano? Greg Erwitt.
You got any luggage?

202
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,129
- Just him.
- He's drunk.

203
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,996
He was just with the girls.

204
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,204
- So, Caldwell Airport, right?
- Fuck that, how about Maui?

205
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,472
Just climb on in and buckle up.

206
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,075
Oh, Jesus! Old Faithful.

207
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,445
Better here than at 2, 000 feet.

208
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,341
I got to take a piss.

209
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,624
Oh, yeah!

210
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,760
Hasta la vista!

211
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,149
What the fuck you doing?

212
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,311
You're standing too close.

213
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,449
- Furio come by?
- He's already 40 minutes late.

214
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,818
He's probably worse off than me.

215
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,588
What, did you two go out?

216
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,784
Can I get a cup of coffee?

217
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,664
- Where the fuck is he?
- Was he out with somebody last night?

218
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,138
He's a single guy. How should I know?

219
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,641
Anyway, my memory's a little hazy.

220
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,746
I'm going back to bed.

221
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,184
When he gets here, don't wake me.

222
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,565
I'm not home now, leave a message.

223
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,560
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

224
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,990
Meadow, hi.

225
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,464
You all right?
You don't sound happy to hear from me.

226
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,201
- Of course I am. What's up?
- Nothing.

227
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,670
I was calling to invite you over
for dinner Sunday...

228
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,037
so Dad can see the place and meet the crew.

229
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,202
- How nice, what brought that on?
- I figure before break.

230
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,803
Finn invited me
to go ski in Canada next week.

231
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,942
- You want me to make anything?
- Nothing, I'm doing everything myself.

232
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,717
Maybe wine.

233
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,714
We only drink good wine
when parents come.

234
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,121
- Anyway, I got to go.
- Okay, bye.

235
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,962
- Nice place.
- Yeah, we open in a few weeks.

236
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,437
Carmine got the chef from Fontanella.
Killer wine list.

237
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,503
Look at this, it used to hang
in Fiorello LaGuardia's office.

238
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,408
Who's that, Carmine in that boat?

239
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,503
Gin and I are going over next month.

240
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,673
Salute.

241
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,579
Listen, Tony.

242
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,715
It's very important to Carmine
that we work something out.

243
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,817
If it's so important, where is he?

244
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,159
His son's leaving tomorrow.
He had family obligations.

245
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,360
So what is it, what's the offer?

246
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,425
Forty percent of the HUD take
across the board, starting now.

247
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,560
Forty?

248
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,470
I thought Little Carmine said
he was gonna take care of this.

249
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,668
He did, that's why the concession.

250
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,370
We were at 40 a week ago.

251
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,380
Whatever is done already is done.
You keep that for yourself.

252
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,042
The 40 percent only applies to future deals.

253
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,382
Let's go.

254
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,366
- Darlene, hi, how are you?
- Great. You know, I wanted to thank you.

255
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,498
Your husband's friend came by the office.
We got the listing.

256
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,272
- Which friend, who?
- Furio Gunther, is that how you say it?

257
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,404
His house just went on the market.

258
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,211
Hi, Penny. How are you?

259
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,451
All right, I'll talk to you later.

260
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,680
Who was that?

261
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,950
Silvio.

262
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,594
Listen to this...

263
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,925
Furio called,
the stupid fucking zip moved back to Italy.

264
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,727
Asshole left a message on the
answering machine at the Bing at 4:30 a. m.

265
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,263
Here, carry this.

266
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,714
- Flower delivery.
- Come on in, I'll be right there.

267
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,250
- Hi, Mrs. Soprano.
- Hi, Finn.

268
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,419
Mr. Soprano, Finn Detrolio.

269
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,726
Finn the dentist, right?

270
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,493
Someday. I'm still waiting
to hear from dental school.

271
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,730
Remind me to talk to you
about this loose filling later.

272
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,374
These are beautiful. Thank you.

273
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,779
- So, what smells so good in there?
- Mom's recipe for chicken cacciatore.

274
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,883
You see, I should've known.

275
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,457
- You always leave your door open like that?
- I'm cooking, it's hot.

276
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,326
I'll protect her, don't worry.

277
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,429
You hear that? Anybody bothers her,
he'll knock their teeth out.

278
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,937
Then he can put them back in, too.

279
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,971
These are my roommates, Colin and Alex.

280
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,107
So, you're her roommate, too?

281
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,842
Colin McDermott.
I've heard so much about you.

282
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,477
- So he lives here and you don't?
- Dad.

283
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,779
- I have a place on 1 18th Street.
- Good.

284
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,284
I'll show you around later.

285
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,563
So, Finn. Where you from?

286
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,070
My dad was in the Navy.

287
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:04,006
I was born in Japan, spent my first 10 years
on a base near the Azores.

288
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,837
- So, your dad was a sailor?
- Surgeon, actually.

289
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,041
- So, you've been all over the world.
- Yeah, pretty much.

290
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,582
- Would you like a mushroom?
- No, I don't think so.

291
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,451
- Have one, they're good.
- Maybe later.

292
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,360
I got to tell you, Mrs. Soprano...

293
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,991
your daughter absolutely keeps us alive
with her cooking.

294
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,762
Didn't you make macaroni and cheese once?

295
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,702
Well, I didn't want to brag.

296
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,957
Yo, guys, come here, look at this.

297
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,170
So, Finn, Meadow tells me
that you're going skiing.

298
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,038
For four days next week,
a whole bunch of us.

299
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:17,103
A friend of my dad has a house
in the Laurentians, near Montreal.

300
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,583
You can ski right onto the trails.

301
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,151
I saw pictures.
There's this humongous stone fireplace.

302
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,715
Just be careful,
with all those accidents you read about.

303
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,918
Sonny Bono.

304
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,792
- How about you, Alex? You ski?
- I used to.

305
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,057
- My family had a retreat near the Pyrenees.
- Pyrenees?

306
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,566
Alex is descended from Spanish royalty.

307
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,230
- Seriously?
- She's our little princess.

308
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,205
My great- great- grandmother was a countess.

309
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,044
- Which makes you....
- Technically I'm an Infanta de gracia.

310
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,979
But that wouldn't fit on her driver's license.

311
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,176
You might have told me
you were living with royalty.

312
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,549
My daughter's an Italian princess.
Does that count?

313
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,984
My wife, too, for that matter.

314
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,621
- There's more chicken if anyone wants.
- Yeah, I'll take a little more.

315
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,095
- So, A. J. , what are you, a junior?
- Next year.

316
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,833
- Did you look at any schools yet?
- Not really.

317
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,337
I'll go to Rutgers, I guess.

318
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,508
Are you passing everything?

319
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,876
- I got a "C" on a paper I did on Billy Budd.
- A "C"?

320
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,315
He usually gets "D's" and "F's."
What's with you today, you okay?

321
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,911
- He worked so hard on it, why only a "C"?
- I don't know.

322
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
- Did you like Billy Budd?
- It was okay.

323
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,985
- My teacher says it's a gay book.
- Mr. Weggler?

324
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,728
That is ridiculous.

325
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,764
I've heard that before.

326
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:46,366
- That was written when, in the 19th century?
- I didn't even know they had fags back then.

327
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,929
- No offense.
- I'm not gay.

328
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,766
- You're not?
- No.

329
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,510
I read where they found
gay cave drawings in Africa.

330
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,343
Really? Shut up.

331
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,454
This stuff is pervading
our educational system...

332
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,081
not to mention movies, TV shows.

333
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,552
- What stuff?
- This gay nonsense they're teaching.

334
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,358
I am sorry,
but Billy Budd is not a homosexual book.

335
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,125
Actually, it is, Mother.

336
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,292
I saw the movie, Meadow,
with Terence Stamp.

337
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,098
Terence Stamp was in
Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert.

338
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,762
I don't know about that.

339
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,603
But Billy Budd
is a story of an innocent sailor...

340
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,666
being picked on by an evil boss.

341
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,905
Who is picking on him out of self- loathing...

342
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,244
caused by homosexual feelings
in a military context.

343
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,149
- Oh, please.
- Okay.

344
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,386
Actually, Mrs. Soprano...

345
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,044
there is a passage in the book...

346
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,718
where Melville compares Billy
to a nude statue of Adam before the Fall.

347
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,852
- Really?
- I thought you read it.

348
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,328
So, it's a biblical reference,
does that make it gay?

349
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,162
- What's the difference?
- I'm just saying it's ridiculous...

350
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,634
how everything is being sold
as homosexual nowadays.

351
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,332
Must be a gay book.
Billy Budd's the ship's florist, right?

352
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,143
Leslie Fiedler has written extensively
on gay themes in literature...

353
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,807
since the early'60s, Billy Budd in particular.

354
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,044
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

355
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,145
She's a "he," Mother, and he's lectured
at Columbia, as a matter of fact.

356
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,881
Well, maybe he's gay,
you ever thought of that?

357
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,461
They broke the urn.

358
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,305
He sent Little Paulie
to trash Carmine's restaurant?

359
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,708
He works for me.

360
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,343
What do I know?

361
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,108
A lot more than me, that's for sure.

362
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,375
Everybody does.

363
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,685
We've been friends a long time, Paulie.
I'm gonna go off the record here.

364
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,597
You know, I probably shouldn't be telling
you this, but since you ask....

365
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:59,300
I think certain people
are starting to wonder where your heart is.

366
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,205
People who? Tony?
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

367
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,875
Right there. Your attitude lately.

368
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,909
Four months inside,
I'm supposed to skip down the street?

369
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,539
You're only as good as your last envelope.
You know that.

370
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:18,177
You have any idea what Albert
kicked up last week?

371
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,983
Fuck that fucking parakeet.

372
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,192
I got a relationship with Tony
Albert'll never have.

373
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,058
No matter how far he sticks his tongue
up Tony's ass.

374
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,100
All right, fuck this.

375
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,395
Every friendship has its peaks and valleys.

376
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,842
Right now, me and Tony are in the valley.

377
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,175
The cycle comes around, it'll be different.

378
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,909
I'm past worrying I gotta be the top earner
every fucking second.

379
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,679
So there you go then.

380
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,214
Don't give me that smart- alecky shit.

381
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,822
Don't forget,
I go back in this family to Johnny.

382
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,726
Before you even.

383
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,259
It's your fault anyway.

384
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,930
All this shit started with that Russian prick
when I had to go pick up your $5, 000.

385
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,064
You know,
things might be a little different, Paulie...

386
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,376
if you'd accept
some responsibility for a change.

387
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,371
You're a wormy cocksucker, you know that?

388
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,272
I'm just telling you
how you're being fucking perceived!

389
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,682
Just worry
about how you're fucking perceived!

390
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,520
Nobody knows what the future holds,
my friend.

391
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,511
You heard what he did
to the fucking restaurant?

392
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,572
So how do you want to respond?

393
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,446
We got to break this guy's back.

394
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,356
I haven't wanted to do this.

395
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,649
But it's gotta be.

396
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,155
Call the union.

397
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,592
His mother was coming.

398
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,566
He was so excited, Ro.

399
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,662
We had a date to go to Colortile.

400
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:17,036
- A date?
- To look at tile for his mother's apartment.

401
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,436
No phone call, no note.

402
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,047
- I know I sound foolish.
- No, you don't, honey.

403
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,846
When I ran into Darlene at church...

404
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,687
I felt like somebody punched me
in the stomach.

405
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,654
I almost threw up the sacrament.

406
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,523
- What am I gonna do, Ro?
- What's there to do?

407
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,087
A couple of months,
you'll forget all about him.

408
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,599
I don't know if I can.

409
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,169
You don't think Tony
said something to him, do you?

410
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,816
I didn't see what all the fuss was,
particularly for what it cost.

411
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,521
Remember we saw Man of La Mancha
that time?

412
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:09,683
Richard Kiley stared at Ma the whole time
he was singing The Impossible Dream.

413
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,692
- How I cried.
- Give me Sondheim any day.

414
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:17,423
When Salvatore was alive,
Minn went to the theater every week.

415
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,402
He did well, Salvatore.

416
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,199
- Barber scissors, right?
- Precision cutlery, 46 years.

417
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,538
There you are, sir.

418
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,041
Finally, the doggy bags.

419
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,713
I give these to my son.

420
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,661
Here's for Ma and me.
Parking and gas, I'll take care of.

421
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,458
I have $100 I need to break.

422
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,931
Come on, Ma.

423
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,069
Shoot, I forgot to cash my check.

424
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,040
- Don't you have direct deposit?
- She doesn't even have a savings account.

425
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:02,307
- I like to have the money right in my hands.
- Still keep it under the mattress?

426
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,372
Never you mind where I keep it.
I need change.

427
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,852
Where's my rolls?

428
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,748
- I don't know, Ma.
- Waiter?

429
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,157
These Parker House rolls,
they belong to my ma.

430
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,631
They do not. They were for the table.

431
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,639
Wrap these up, will you? Cellophane.

432
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,639
Come on, Ma.

433
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,267
What the fuck is this now?

434
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,240
Can I have your attention, please?

435
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,216
I repeat, can I have your attention, please?

436
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,680
Whoa. What's going on?

437
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,448
You the foreman? Dave Fusco.

438
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,122
I'm the business agent
for Local 87, Laborers.

439
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,592
It's come to our attention
this site is employing...

440
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:27,495
a substantial number of non- union laborers
in violation of our master contract.

441
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,964
Come on, what the fuck?

442
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:33,367
- Frankly, sir, I'm shocked and appalled.
- Yeah, right. What are you, fucking kidding?

443
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,635
This site is shut down until further notice.

444
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,215
Hey, how you doing?

445
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:54,222
We just want you to know how glad
we are a guy like you is on the jury.

446
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,252
That mob thing, that Junior Soprano trial.

447
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,131
- I got that.
- $14. 20.

448
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,234
Hey, what are you doing?

449
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,835
It's a privilege.

450
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,602
Hard- working guy.

451
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,800
Wife and two kids.

452
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,275
Performing a civic duty
we should all take part in.

453
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,771
We know you'll do the right thing.

454
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,777
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me, what are you doing?

455
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,012
Nothing, just reading. You all right?

456
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,647
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

457
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,355
Did I do something to piss you off?

458
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,082
What are you talking about?

459
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,721
I know you were kinda mad at me
the other night.

460
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,128
- Why would I be mad?
- I don't know.

461
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,625
Anyway, the reason I called.

462
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:16,532
It's kind of near my birthday
and I was thinking we'd do our tradition.

463
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,968
Go to the Plaza for tea
under Eloise's picture.

464
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,713
Really? That's so wonderful.

465
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,210
Are you crying?

466
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,318
I'm just happy, that's so thoughtful.

467
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,116
I was thinking tomorrow. It's the only day
I have before we go to Canada.

468
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,691
Well, I have my nails in the morning,
but I could...

469
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,331
drive in and meet you after that.

470
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,368
Actually, I'll be on the West Side,
maybe you can pick me up?

471
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,835
Sure. I'll take
the George Washington Bridge.

472
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,168
Why take the bridge
if you're going to midtown?

473
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,176
- I know how to get to the city, Meadow.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

474
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,646
- How's 1:00?
- That's fine.

475
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,976
On second thought, I'll just meet you there.

476
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,244
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

477
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,819
Well, it happened.

478
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,722
Stubborn old fuck shut down the Esplanade.

479
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,356
This business agent
he owns was there from the union.

480
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,423
Put on an Emmy- caliber performance.

481
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:21,163
Let him run this 40 percent bullshit by
the other bosses, see if they put up with it!

482
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,231
If you want,
we could torch a few of his cement trucks.

483
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,443
No. No retaliation, counter- retaliation.

484
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,612
- We just sit tight.
- It's gonna cost us, T.

485
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,685
- That's why Carmine did it.
- It's gonna cost him, too.

486
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,066
- I brought these!
- Sorry.

487
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:54,295
I am not wearing the gloves.
Soprano family tradition, notwithstanding.

488
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,039
I didn't think so.

489
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,801
But I'm wearing mine.

490
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,167
Where'd you park?

491
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,475
There's a lot over on 57th Street.

492
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,606
Is that okay or would you like
to lecture me on parking, too?

493
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,083
What are you talking about?

494
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,383
I figure since you're also an authority
on driving directions.

495
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,855
- Very funny.
- Not to mention literature.

496
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,086
So it's the Billy Budd thing.

497
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,925
I was merely pointing out to you...

498
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,829
what serious literary critics
have to say about the book.

499
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,966
These look delicious.

500
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,647
So, how is Finn?
When are you leaving for Montreal?

501
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:40,408
Wednesday morning. He'll pick me up
at home, I have my ski clothes there...

502
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,510
so I'm gonna stay over the night before
and do some laundry.

503
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,453
- Is that a problem?
- No, of course not.

504
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,726
As long as he stays in the guest room.

505
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,557
He's not staying, Mother.

506
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,363
Well, the way you two hang on each other....

507
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,266
Well, excuse me, Mrs. Danvers.
What do you have against love?

508
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,005
- Nothing.
- Why are you not happy for me?

509
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:08,136
What, are you jealous?
Just'cause you and Dad are middle- aged?

510
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,009
Watch it, young lady.

511
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,911
- What, am I a child?
- Actually, yes.

512
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,781
Your apartment
in Manhattan, notwithstanding.

513
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,877
What?

514
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,787
I'm sure your friend the princess
found us quite amusing.

515
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,724
You're the one who wanted me
to go to an Ivy League school.

516
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,626
These are the type who go there.
There are also people...

517
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,393
who grew up without indoor plumbing
but you would know even less about them.

518
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,161
Would you rather I transfer
to Montclair State?

519
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,636
Then maybe I can drop out like you did.

520
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,570
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:46,377
I invited you here to have a nice time,
not to belittle me.

522
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,218
Maybe you'll be happier
if I didn't come around.

523
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,653
Except that won't happen.
'Cause you'll need money in about a week.

524
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,287
You know what?
To hell with not coming around...

525
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,159
I'll just transfer to Northwestern
so I can be near Finn when he goes.

526
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,831
Yeah, sure.

527
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,644
Carmine, hey, what are you doing here?

528
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:55,048
- I'm a guest. My housekeeper's daughter.
- Small world.

529
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,749
The groom's dad is my third cousin.

530
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,517
Beautiful ceremony.

531
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,060
So, listen,
about all this stuff that's going on.

532
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,728
- Tony and all.
- What's your name again?

533
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,197
Paulie Gualtieri. Jersey?

534
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,130
Your father was run over by a trolley, right?

535
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,732
Johnny talked to you about me, right?

536
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,737
Johnny who? Sack?

537
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,670
Talk to me about what?

538
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,468
- Anything good?
- Just bills.

539
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,075
- So, you never told me about your lunch.
- It was horrible, since you ask.

540
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,242
She's threatening to transfer
to Northwestern.

541
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,281
- What brought that on?
- Boyfriend probably, Finn.

542
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,689
Maybe she wants to put some space
between us, I don't know.

543
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:48,262
- Why would she wanna do that?
- You know, frankly, I don't care.

544
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,766
The way I feel now, if I never see her again,
that would be just fine.

545
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,297
- How could you say that?
- Look, Tony, I don't feel well.

546
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:00,069
My joints ache, my stomach is all queasy.

547
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,076
You asked, I told.

548
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,108
Just making conversation.

549
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,480
If you don't care what the answer is,
don't ask!

550
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,348
All right, calm down!

551
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,381
I don't have enough on my plate?

552
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,984
One of my key guys disappeared
to Naples for Christ's sakes!

553
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,781
Have you seen my Nordica goggles?

554
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,677
Yeah, they're in the basement.

555
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,082
I had to solder something in my computer.

556
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,053
- What're you reading?
- Death in Venice.

557
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,989
Mr. Weggler assigned it.

558
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,449
Where's Mom?

559
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,959
Bed, I guess.

560
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,122
- She seem weird to you lately?
- How?

561
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,692
- Angry, sad?
- I guess she's been crying a lot.

562
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,937
- Since when?
- Last week.

563
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,308
- I think she's upset about Furio's dad.
- Why, what do you mean?

564
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,536
Well, he died.

565
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,204
And I think Furio went back
to Italy or something.

566
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,747
- She was going over there a lot.
- To Furio's?

567
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,251
She was helping him decorate.
And she made me go, too.

568
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,810
It was really a pain in the ass.

569
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,181
She took you there? More than once?

570
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,758
I don't know, a couple, three times.

571
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,054
Oh, dude.

572
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,726
- Meeting's over.
- Jesus!

573
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,131
Who's there?

574
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,906
What're you doing?

575
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,806
Minn! Your door was open.

576
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,314
I brought you something from my ma.

577
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,347
What are you doing in my house?

578
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,684
Take it easy. I didn't know you were home.

579
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,452
- Your car was gone.
- It's being repaired.

580
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,026
- What are you doing?
- Calling your mother.

581
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,165
I know you.

582
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,271
You got any coffee?

583
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,040
My kitchen's all wiped off for the night.

584
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,634
Well, this week then, I'll bring my ma...

585
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,544
the three of us,
we'll go have lunch over at Pal's Cabin.

586
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,314
You're here to rob me.

587
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,078
No, what are you crazy?
Just calm down, okay?

588
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,143
You're a disgrace to your mother!

589
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,019
Don't set that thing off!
You think I'm here to hurt you?

590
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,389
- You've known me since I'm a kid.
- Help!

591
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,421
What are you doing?

592
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,190
Fuck!

593
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,738
Minn, wait!

594
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,037
You were always a little bastard!

595
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,976
Shut up with that fucking mouth!

596
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,875
Help!

597
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,027
Oh, no.

598
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,652
- There's the skip.
- Hey.

599
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,731
For you.

600
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,634
I know things have been slow lately.

601
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,908
That ought to bring us up to date.

602
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,172
- What'd you do, rob a bank?
- Back in business, T.

603
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,641
- What, are you going to track?
- Thinking about it.

604
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,911
Ton'! Johnny Sack for you.

605
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,653
- What's that prick want?
- I don't know.

606
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,061
Let me take this.

607
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,605
Hello?

608
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,673
Thought we did.

609
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,141
All right, I'll meet you.

610
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,726
Did you say goodbye to your mother?

611
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,520
She went to the market
while I was in the shower.

612
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,397
She loves you, Meadow.

613
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,434
You know that, don't you?

614
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,770
- I know.
- Come here.

615
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,725
Cut her some slack, will you?

616
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,818
You gotta understand,
she's going through a rough time right now.

617
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,363
- How come?
- Change of life, maybe.

618
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,129
Her kids are growing up.

619
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,366
We talked about this in counseling,
me and her.

620
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,206
You guys went to counseling?

621
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,937
Yeah, it's part of the therapy
for the panic attacks and all.

622
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,239
- You were in therapy?
- You knew that, didn't you?

623
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,047
Oh, my God.

624
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,979
On some level she may feel...

625
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,688
unfulfilled.

626
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,617
Switch on Rosie O'Donnell,
that's all these women bitch about.

627
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,593
A little of that's probably my fault anyway.

628
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,737
It's an epidemic, right?

629
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,435
- You really think that's it?
- Yeah.

630
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,949
It's probably the beginning of menopause,
like you said.

631
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,080
All right, you go have a good time.

632
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,090
Thanks.

633
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,531
Well, here I am, what is it?

634
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,760
We go back a long way, Tony.

635
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,961
We've come way too far
to let it all go to shit.

636
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:46,132
With all due respect, you wanna go
down memory lane, put it in second gear.

637
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,271
The Esplanade now.

638
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,081
I wish for Carmine's own sake he'd ease off.

639
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,381
Why don't you tell him that?

640
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,948
He's so easily upset these days.

641
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,214
His teeth.

642
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,657
I'll tell you, that restaurant thing didn't help.

643
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,994
He hurt my appraiser.
What was I supposed to do?

644
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,390
It's on page four
of the boss manual, John. Jesus!

645
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,192
You're preaching to the choir, Tony.

646
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,100
You don't even wanna hear
how many of his decisions...

647
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,199
end up lightening my pockets.

648
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,909
Why you telling me all this, John?

649
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,783
Because at heart,
I know you're a pragmatist.

650
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:32,879
As I am.

651
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,358
I'm telling you now...

652
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,917
Carmine won't bend.

653
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,230
And I just told you, I won't.

654
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,563
If Carmine's health were bad...

655
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,730
if something were to happen to him,
God forbid...

656
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,066
all of this unpleasantness would just....

657
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,070
John, Carmine's fine.

658
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,049
Yes. He's very healthy.

659
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,407
Thank God.

660
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,577
Call me.

661
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,123
Holy shit.

662
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,962
As soon as we get off this barge,
I never wanna see you again.

663
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,505
- Yes?
- Tonight?

664
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,406
No.

665
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,522
You're home early.

666
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,556
What are you watching?

667
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,488
How to Marry a Millionaire.

668
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,599
Do I have a fever?

669
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,300
Maybe. A little.

670
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,111
- You want some Advil?
- I took some.

671
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,514
I talked to Meadow this morning.

672
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,678
She left for her ski trip.

673
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,550
She's a good kid, Carm.

674
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:19,585
She hates my guts, Tony.

675
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,593
She doesn't hate you.

676
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,390
She's gonna call you.

677
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,161
Come on, you know how that works.

678
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,699
Finn will go.

679
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,770
She'll forget all about him
in a couple of weeks.

680
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:39,371
In a few years she'll find somebody else,
settle down.

681
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,486
Maybe she won't, who knows.

682
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,983
She can do whatever she wants.

683
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,422
She's becoming a wonderful woman, Carm.

684
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,833
Smart, beautiful...

685
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,801
independent woman that you created.

686
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,202
Isn't that what you dreamed about?

687
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,436
Yes.
