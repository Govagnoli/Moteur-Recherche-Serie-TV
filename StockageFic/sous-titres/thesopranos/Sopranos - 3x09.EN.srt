1
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,618
Anybody home?

2
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:44,621
Hello?

3
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,633
What's this?

4
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,134
What's this?

5
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:12,148
Oh, my god,
tony...

6
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:15,151
here, allow me.

7
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,660
Happy birthday.

8
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,669
Oohhh...

9
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:36,673
oops.

10
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,178
What?

11
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:44,681
Look at the ring
your father gave me.

12
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,182
I already saw it.

13
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:48,184
I was gonna
wrap it, but,

14
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,687
it's wasteful
to the environment.

15
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,689
Thank you,
young man.

16
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,695
"The matrix".

17
00:02:58,695 --> 00:02:59,696
I haven't
seen it yet.

18
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,700
Hello?

19
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,702
Happy birthday,
mama.

20
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:07,203
What are you
doing here?

21
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:08,705
Don't you have
an exam tomorrow?

22
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,206
Nice to see you, too.

23
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:11,207
I'm sorry, honey.

24
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm just surprised
to see you.

25
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,712
See what your
father got me?

26
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:16,713
Mmm.

27
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:19,716
Big ring.

28
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:23,720
Happy birthday.

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,723
Oh, my god,
so many gifts.

30
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,725
"A day of beauty
and pampering

31
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:31,227
at the belladonna
day spa."

32
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,730
It's in soho,
my friend batshe
va says it's awesome.

33
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,732
Massage,
mud treatment,
everything.

34
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,735
I got myself one,
so we can go together.

35
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,737
I put it on
your credit card.

36
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,742
12 years, i took
this club from nothin'!

37
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,243
Give him
a drink.

38
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,745
What do you
drink, rocco?

39
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,246
Johnny black.

40
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,749
This place was
a shit hole when
i took it over.

41
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,250
You could use
a little help,

42
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,753
make this place in
the 21st century.

43
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,756
Yeah, it's like
permanently 1987 in here.

44
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,758
Goddamn vikings!

45
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:04,260
Nobody misse
s the extra point.

46
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,263
That's all they had to
do, one little kick,
and now i'm ruined!

47
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,268
Don't bitch to me!

48
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:15,271
Bet with your head,
not over it!

49
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,274
You still a partner.

50
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,276
You got a problem
with us?

51
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,779
One, two, three!

52
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:27,784
I'll get it.

53
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,787
Did you invite some
stray dog up here?

54
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,788
You short
of food?

55
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,791
Sorry i'm late.

56
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,794
We didn't even know
you were comin'.

57
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,796
Meadow told me it was
carmela's birthday.

58
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:41,798
It is so nice
of you to join us.

59
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,300
Hi, mr. And
mrs. Deangelis.

60
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,802
Jackie.

61
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,303
Hey.

62
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,304
Have you heard
the good news?

63
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,306
We met thanksgiving?

64
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,812
Happy birthday,
carm'.

65
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,313
Oh, jackie,
you didn't have to.

66
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,815
I'll put it on ice
in a minute.

67
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:00,316
Thank you, sir.

68
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,318
Alright, come
on, let's go,

69
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,820
the wax is
melting here.

70
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,844
I heard you got made
defensive captain.

71
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,846
Yeah, five and
a half sacks

72
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,347
and two
recovered fumbles,

73
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,849
almost sco
red a touchdown
on one of'em.

74
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,350
Excellent, man.

75
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,852
You know i played
linebacker for boonton?

76
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,353
Senior year,
i was all- county.

77
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:38,354
Wow.

78
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:39,856
Maybe we could work
out a little together.

79
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,358
Sure, you should come
to the blessed sac
game on tuesday.

80
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,360
It's the last game
of the season.

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,361
We were supposed to
play last month,

82
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:46,863
but, the r
efs were on strike.

83
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:47,864
I'll be there.

84
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:49,866
I wanna come to.

85
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,868
My little brother's
football game.

86
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,370
No champagne,
the good lord

87
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:55,872
doesn't want us
to drink alcohol.

88
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,373
Didn't jesus
drink wine?

89
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,876
He was jesus, ton',
we can't make comparisons.

90
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,383
Who invented
these things?

91
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:08,885
You people are all
out of your minds.

92
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,887
Mom, is it alright
if i sleep at egon's

93
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,388
if i promise to
be in bed by one?

94
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:13,890
I ordered one for
you so you don't disappear

95
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,892
when i send you
to the market.

96
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,894
Lights out by one,
in bed by 12.

97
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,914
Be careful.

98
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,920
I smell fish.

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,421
We're near
the ocean.

100
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,429
Now i smell piss.

101
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,442
What?

102
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:07,944
It's yours.

103
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:09,445
What is?

104
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,447
This is the lollipop
in long branch.

105
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:12,949
This is your club.

106
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,453
I'm a partner here
now, me and furio.

107
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:18,955
But, we're gonna
be silent.

108
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,957
You're gonna be
the owner- manager.

109
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,960
You book the bands,
you find the talent,

110
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,461
whatever
you wanna do.

111
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,462
It's yours.

112
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:30,967
Oh, my god!

113
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,970
I can't
believe it!

114
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,975
You're gonna
turn this place

115
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,476
into the biggest
jersey club

116
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:41,978
since "the stone pony".

117
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,982
Thank you,
christopher!

118
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,483
I'm so excited.

119
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,489
Can we change
the name?

120
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,992
Whatever y
ou want, baby.

121
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:59,495
This is rocc
o, he works for you.

122
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,012
The ring looks
beautiful on you.

123
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:19,015
It is gorgeous.

124
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,019
Tony, is there anything
you need to tell me?

125
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,020
About the ring?

126
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,022
I don't know.

127
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:29,025
You didn't buy that little
car you were talking about.

128
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,526
The mercedes?

129
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:33,529
I'd look like a douchebag
in one of those.

130
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,531
Jean cusamano calls
those sports cars

131
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:37,033
mid- life crisis
mobiles.

132
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,035
What the fuck
does she know?

133
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,543
Is this 17- 26
pearl ave.?

134
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:49,045
No.

135
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:52,548
Is there a pearl a
ve. In this neighborhood?

136
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,553
Hello?

137
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,056
Hey, ro.

138
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,558
No, jackie took
meadow to the movies.

139
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,562
They said,
"not late".

140
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,564
Alright.

141
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,066
Bye.

142
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,077
What?

143
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,079
I don't know.

144
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,580
I'm not thrilled
about this thing

145
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,582
with jackie and meadow.

146
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:29,085
I think she came home
and he came over,

147
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,586
so that they could
go out tonight.

148
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:32,588
So, what?
He's a good kid.

149
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,590
He comes from
good stock.

150
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,092
He's been on his
best behavior lately,

151
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,593
i can't deny that.

152
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,595
I just never pictured meadow
with someone like him.

153
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:43,099
"Someone like him"?
He's one of us.

154
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,602
Don't tell me you
were happier when she
was going with that

155
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,605
jamal ginsberg,
the hasidic homeboy.

156
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:53,609
We scraped through that
by the skin of our ass.

157
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,612
I just don't want her
to miss the opportunities

158
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,614
that are
available to her.

159
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,617
She should be at
the museum of modern
art in her free time,

160
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:05,121
not watching t
v at rosalie aprile's.

161
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,123
You'd rather have her
looking at pictures
of soup cans,

162
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,125
instead of being
close to home?

163
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,127
I don't know.

164
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,129
You talk to her,

165
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,131
and i'll talk
to jackie jr.

166
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,635
Here's your edgar
allen poe paper.

167
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,637
You did it
already?

168
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,139
No problem.

169
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,141
Thanks.

170
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,143
I would have
done it myself,

171
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,145
i was gonna do it,

172
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,148
i just couldn't ge
t through the books.

173
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:35,151
I never should've took
literature of obsession.

174
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,154
I owe you big time.

175
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,655
Thanks.

176
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:49,665
How can i
repay you?

177
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:51,667
I don't know.

178
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,170
Why don't you
surprise me?

179
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,174
On your ma
rk, get set, go!

180
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,686
I kicked
your asses!

181
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:11,687
You cheat!

182
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,189
Ow, my eyes...

183
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,694
there's too
much chlorine.

184
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,696
I think i swallowed
some water.

185
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:21,697
You girls see me
out there?

186
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,699
Yeah, it looked
like you were
cheating.

187
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:26,202
Hey, guys!

188
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:27,703
We got
mr. Goodwi
n's office open!

189
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,205
Check it out.

190
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,214
Let's go for it.

191
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:52,728
Hey, everybody!

192
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,732
Boo- ya!

193
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:07,243
C'mon, let's
go, c'mon!

194
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,245
Don't cut
your feet!

195
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,750
Hey, it's sunday morni
ng and you're listening...

196
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,252
good morning.

197
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,753
Hello.
'Morning.

198
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:20,256
Did jackie call?

199
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,758
Vince lombardi's out
back with your brother.

200
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,779
So, i've been
thinking about a car.

201
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,282
I knew i was gonna
get hit up

202
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,783
for someth
ing on this trip.

203
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,285
What, you can spend
thousands on sapphires

204
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:51,787
but, a hardworking
student has to take
the bus everywhere?

205
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,289
You live a block
from the school.

206
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,790
What do you need
a car for?

207
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,292
It'd be nice to hop
in a car after class

208
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,294
and come have
dinner with you
guys once in a while.

209
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:02,298
They steal cars
left and right
in new york,

210
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:04,300
parking is
impossible.

211
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,302
Besides, the bus
gets you here
in 45 minutes.

212
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:07,803
I'm not asking
for anything fancy,

213
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:09,305
just something
to get me around.

214
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,807
You could've had
a car last year,

215
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,808
but you spurne
d your nose at it.

216
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,310
Eric's car? Is
that a sick joke?

217
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,812
It may interest you to
know that his father's

218
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,814
now in a mental health
facility in nevada.

219
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,817
Why don't you just
wait and see how
this semester goes?

220
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,819
You were just complaining
about how much work
you had to do!

221
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,321
Don't you think you should
concentrate on that?

222
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,323
I am concentrating
on that!

223
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:28,824
What do you
think i am?

224
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,326
Jesus christ, you're
like a broken record!

225
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,328
Take it down a notch! Hey!

226
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:33,829
God.

227
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,831
We just want to make sur
e that you take advantage

228
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,333
of all the city
has to offer you.

229
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,837
Culturally, socially,
educationally.

230
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,844
Right before the
snap, the ball
isn't doing anything.

231
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,847
But the qb's eyes
can tell you whether

232
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,350
he's gonna drop back
to pass or hand it off.

233
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,852
It happens in
a split second,

234
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,354
but, over the course
of the game,

235
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,855
you can learn
what his habits are,

236
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:01,857
and once you know
these habits,

237
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:03,359
he's fucked.

238
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,361
Hey.

239
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,363
Good morning.

240
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,365
Okay, a. J. , tr
y what i told you.

241
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,867
I will,
thanks, jackie.

242
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,882
The wall
of pride...

243
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:29,385
what kind
of animals?

244
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:30,886
I don't think
they stole anything.

245
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,390
They just did a number
on the place.

246
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,392
They left this.

247
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,912
You make
this pizza?

248
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,915
Who make
this pizza?

249
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:00,916
We're asking you.

250
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,918
This your
store logo, sir?

251
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,921
That's my box.

252
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,923
This pie was found
at a crime scene.

253
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:09,425
My pizza never
hurt nobody.

254
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,426
Come again, sir?

255
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,927
You no find any
bacteria in here.

256
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:13,929
Some kids broke into
verbum dei high school,

257
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,431
broke things,
they left this there.

258
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:16,932
You tell me
their names,

259
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,434
i'll go put my foo
t up their ass!

260
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,436
I got it, pop.

261
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:22,438
That's a custom job.

262
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:23,939
How's that, sir?

263
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,441
Double meatball,
pepperoni, sausage,

264
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,444
peppers, onions,
extra mozzarella.

265
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,445
This pie
fit a pattern?

266
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:30,946
Come again,
officer?

267
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:32,448
Any customers
order this combo
on a regular basis?

268
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:33,949
Only one i know.
Who's that?

269
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,451
I'd rather
not say.

270
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,953
Tell me right now,
i find these bastards!

271
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,456
Pop, go in the back,
make meatballs, go ahead.

272
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:41,957
Sir.
Yes, officer?

273
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,459
Word to the wi
what's that? Se.

274
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,961
Technically, you're an
accessory after the fact.

275
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,464
I cannot believe this!

276
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,466
Do you know how
serious this is?

277
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,968
Do you?

278
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,972
Answer me, right now.

279
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:57,973
Yes.

280
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:58,974
Yes, what?

281
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,476
I know
it's serious.

282
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:01,977
So, why did
you do it?

283
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,479
I don't know.

284
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,980
Why did you do it?

285
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,982
Do you hate
the school?

286
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,485
Do you have a problem
with someone there
or something?

287
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,486
Then, why? No.

288
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,988
It just happened.

289
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,990
We went in,
swimming as a goof.

290
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,493
Someone threw
something in the pool.

291
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,995
A couple of guys
started throwing stuff in.

292
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,998
We just did it.

293
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,000
And if they were jumping off
the george washington bridge,

294
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,503
would you just
do that, too?

295
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:28,504
No.

296
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,509
What are you
doing here?

297
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,512
Answer
your father.

298
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,013
I got
sent home.

299
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:39,515
Why?

300
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,519
Why?

301
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,522
I got in trouble.

302
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,524
Your son, broke into
his school friday night

303
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,526
and vandalized
the swimming pool.

304
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,528
How do you vandali
ze the swimming pool?

305
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,029
They threw a bunch
of stuff in it,

306
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,531
they broke things.

307
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,032
What'd you d
o that for?

308
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:58,534
Screwin' around?

309
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,035
On your mother's
birthday!

310
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:03,539
It wasn't...it
was after midnight.

311
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,541
What, are you
fuckin' stupid, huh?

312
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,543
So, what now,
you're suspended?

313
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,044
I don't know.

314
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,546
Tony, do you know
how serious this is?

315
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,547
He may be expelled.

316
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:12,548
What'd they say?

317
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:13,549
Nothing.

318
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:15,050
They just
sent me home,

319
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,052
and said to bring
you guys into the
principal's office.

320
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,554
On your mother's
birthday.

321
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,058
They're gonna
call you.

322
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,561
Just when everythi
ng was going good, huh?

323
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:28,063
You're gonna
miss the big game.

324
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,566
You're screwin
' everything up.

325
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,068
Your football career,
down the drain!

326
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:42,578
There it is.

327
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,079
What a
beautiful ring.

328
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,080
I know.

329
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:49,084
I want you ladies
to try this.

330
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,586
Mozzarella a
nd string beans?

331
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,088
I was gonna get
the hot antipast'.

332
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,090
It's not mozzarella,
this is called buratta.

333
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,592
I had it flown in
this morning,

334
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,093
by fed ex,
from italy.

335
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:00,596
It's a lot more
subtle and smooth
than mozzarella,

336
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,097
with an almost,
nut- like flavor.

337
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,098
Thank you,
artie.

338
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,099
I'm not that
big on nuts.

339
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,101
A little pepper?

340
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,102
No pepper.

341
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,605
'Carm, on your half?
It's all about the contrast.

342
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,608
The crispness of the beans,
the smoothness of the cheese.

343
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,109
Uh, no, i'm fine.

344
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:16,111
Buon appetito.

345
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,117
Tastes like mozzarella
and string beans.

346
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:26,622
You have it, 'carm,
i want the hot antipast'.

347
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,625
I'd like to
make a toast.

348
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,629
To the blossoming friendship
between our two children.

349
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,631
I'm very happy
to see my son

350
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:38,133
spending time with
someone like meadow,

351
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:41,136
she'll be a very
good influence on him.

352
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:44,139
You did a great job,
she's a wonderful girl.

353
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,642
Thank you,
salut.

354
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:52,648
It's nice to see
our families united.

355
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:55,651
Like with ralphie,
he goes on and on

356
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,653
about tony and
the promotion.

357
00:18:57,653 --> 00:18:59,655
He's very happy to
be getting closer to him.

358
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,156
Well, ralph is a
real find, ro,

359
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,658
you hang on to him.

360
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,159
You know, it was
tough at first.

361
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,663
I was afraid everyone
was gonna think i rushed,

362
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,665
that i didn't
mourn jack enough.

363
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,667
Oh, artie!

364
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,171
I think he's under
a lot of stress.

365
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,173
I hear charmaine
hired a lawyer.

366
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,175
Divorce?

367
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,680
It's funny, but,
you'd think,

368
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,183
you know, the men in
our lives have been,

369
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:31,186
you know what, and
we've stayed together,

370
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,188
and here's artie,
a regular guy,

371
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,692
hardworking,
and his marriage
is in the pisciadood.

372
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,194
You can push a
man only so far.

373
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:41,196
True, very true.

374
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:50,706
You know what?

375
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,708
If you wait
inside for me

376
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,210
i'll be in there in
just a second, okay?

377
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,217
Hello.

378
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,719
Who's the
douchebag?

379
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,722
That douchebag buys
a new 600 from me
every year.

380
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,724
This was last year.

381
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,725
Nice.

382
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,231
Been shopping?

383
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,735
It's for you.

384
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,247
It's very
beautiful.

385
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,249
So are you.

386
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,252
What are my chances
of kidnapping you

387
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,254
for the rest of
the afternoon?

388
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:42,257
I'm closing
on a car.

389
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,259
Come on.

390
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,762
Let hans and franz
do the paperwork.

391
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:49,264
I'm goin' nuts
thinking about you.

392
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,267
I've gotta work.

393
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:01,276
Trabajar?

394
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,278
Come on, come on!

395
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:04,780
I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.

396
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,782
The pierre, the
sherry netherlands,

397
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:09,785
you pick it, come on,
anywhere you wanna go.

398
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,790
Wanna go to the zoo?

399
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,292
The zoo?

400
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,796
Yeah, i try to g
et there once a year.

401
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,298
Alright, we'll go.

402
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,801
I'll call you.

403
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,476
Amazing thing
about snakes

404
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,979
is that they reproduce
spontaneously.

405
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,981
Whaddaya mean?

406
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:42,484
They have both male
and female sex organs.

407
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,486
That's why somebody
you don't trust,

408
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,038
you call a snake.

409
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,990
How can you trust a guy
who can literally

410
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,492
go fuck themselves?

411
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,995
Don't you think
that expression

412
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,497
would come from the
adam and eve story?

413
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:58,500
When the snake tempted
eve to bite the apple?

414
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,502
Hey, snakes we
re fuckin' themselves

415
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:03,005
long before adam and
eve showed up, t.

416
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:13,015
...been studying these
snakes for over 15 years...

417
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,518
hey, how ya
doin', kid?

418
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:17,519
Alright.

Have a seat.

423
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:25,527
Want something
to drink?

424
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,528
What are you
having?

425
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:28,030
A litt
le red wine.

426
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,031
Okay.

427
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,532
I'm goin' to get
a couple of slices.

428
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:31,533
You want
anything, t?

429
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,035
Yeah, get me

430
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,538
Jackie, you
want somethin'?

431
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,040
No, thanks.

432
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,544
So...

433
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,547

n' meadow out tonight.

434
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,549
Yeah.

Where?

436
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,553
A place in the city
called "chez josephine".

437
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:53,555
The food's
supposed to be good,

438
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,057
and they have
live piano music.

439
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,558
Harry connick jr.
Used to play there

440
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,060
before he became famous.

441
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,562
A friend of mine's brother
is the bartender there.

442
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:02,564
Don't you two
got class tomorrow?

443
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,566
She's got a 2:00
and i'm off.

444
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,568
How many days off
they give you at rutgers?

445
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,573
I got class
three days a week.

446
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:16,578
Listen, i think
you're a good kid.

447
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:19,081
You show respect
at my house,

448
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,083
and you come fro
m a good family.

449
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,584
Thanks.

450
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,586
As far as my
daughter goes,

451
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,589
and you know i only
want the best for her,

452
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,592
i'm gonna be ver
y protective over her.

453
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,095
You can understand
that, right?

454
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,096
Of course.

455
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,098
So, if you want to
spend time with her,

456
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:37,599
i want the best from you.

457
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,101
If you're in school,

458
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,602

t everything you got.

459
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:41,603

462
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,611
but, now
it's different.

463
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:52,614
You understand what
i'm saying to you?

464
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,616
I just got an "a"
on my lit. Paper.

465
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,118
You did?

466
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,120
Edgar allen poe.

467
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,123
Good writer, what
a fuckin' nut job.

468
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,625
He's the guy
who did all the,

469
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,627
the vincent price
shit, right?

470
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,630
The guy smoked opium
and married his cousin.

471
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,132
He was from the bronx,
you believe that?

472
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,134
So, you got an "a", huh?

473
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,136
I'm doing
good, tony.

474
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:15,637
Let's keep it
that way.

475
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,140
Keep your
father in mind.

476
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,642
I will.

477
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,649
Listen...

478
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:30,152

Have some
dessert on me.

480
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:34,656
No, that's okay.

481
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:37,159
Take it, just don't
keep her out too late.

482
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,162
I won't,
thanks, tony.

483
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:52,674
Welcome, everybody,

484
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,176
to opening night
at "crazy horse".

485
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:59,181
I'm very excited
to have, from u- dub,

486
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,683
our very first band.

487

Please welcome

488
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,234

489
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,235
What?

490
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:54,736
What do you thin
k of this place?

491
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:58,240
I can't hear a
word you're saying.

492
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:12,754
How do you
like the band?

493
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,763
Matush, you don't got
those maserati's any more?

494
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:24,266
Only versace
, you try it yet?

495
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,268
No, i like the
maserati, though.

496
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:29,771
Try the versace,
you won't be sorry.

497
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,774
Hey, hey!
What's up?

498
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,276
What's up?

499
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:35,777
Come on,
let's go, out!

500
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,281
I got friends
here, man!

501
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,783
Let me call
my man carlo!

502
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:45,287
I see you again, i'm
gonna crack your head!

503
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,789
Call carlo!

504
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,302
You have to wonder
what they're thinking.

505
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,804
They're thinking,
"madonn',

506
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,306
"you guys ever
smell yourselves?

507
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,308
'Cause you're
killing us over here!"

508
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,810
You're probably
right, huh?

509
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,812
'Cept for you.

510
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:13,815
What you got on,
even a baboon
would love.

511
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,819
The eyes are innocent.

512
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:21,823
Like a baby's.

513
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:24,826
Yeah, he could innocently
maul you into 10 pieces.

514
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:29,331
Usually, they just engage
what's called threat behavior.

515
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,833
That's'cause they did
all their mauling.

516
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,835
Now all they gotta do
is give you the look.

517
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,341
You know h
ow the primates,

518
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,843
they groom
each other?

519
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:44,846
That i like.

520
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:47,349
What's this?

521
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:51,853
It's a tibetan talisman,
for protection.

522
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:55,857
I knew it, i
knew there had
to be something.

523
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,360
What?

524
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,363
What is wrong with that
? it's a buddhist symbol.

525
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:04,866
My sister
was a buddhist,
she's a whackjob.

526
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:07,369
Ah, i see, so i gott
a be a whackjob too?

527
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,871
Well, it is a
little wacky.

528
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,874
What's wrong with
fuckin' catholicism?

529
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:15,377
Oh, which you
fuckin' practi
ce every fuckin' day,

530
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,878
i'm sure.

531
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:18,880
So, i pray
a little bit,

532
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,382
and i meditate
in the morning.

533
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,885
It clears my mind and
my heart for the day.

534
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,392
A buddhist selling
$150, 000 cars.

535
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:33,895
The first
noble truth is

536
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:36,398
life is suffering,

537
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,401
but, the buddha preached
"joyful participation

538
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,903
in the sorrows
of the world".

539
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:44,406
So, you make a sal
e, you don't make a sale,

540
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:45,907
it's a tiny
little thing.

541
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,922
What's so funny?

542
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:01,923
You came
here today.

543
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:02,924
What, the zoo?

544
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,426
I said,"zoo",
and you came.

545
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,928
This is a fuckin'
head trip now?

546
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:08,430
Huh? Nice!

547
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,432
Sorta.

548
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,434
I don't like that.

549
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,935
You're very sweet.

550
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,439
You came.

551
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,943
I'm crazy
about you.

552
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,946
You know that,
don't you?

553
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:27,449
I've never met
anybody like you.

554
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,957
Okay, class, come
on, come this way.

555
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,959
Stay together,
kids, come on.

556
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,461
We're gonna see
some tigers.

557
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,463
You all remember
yesterday...

558
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,967
you take your ki
ds to the bronx zoo?

559
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:46,968
Yeah.

560
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,471
And, now
we're here.

561
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:51,973
See ya later.

562
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,975
Who was that?

563
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,477
Oh, that was
my hard- on.

564
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,481
Oh...

565
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:03,985
between the buddhism
and talk about the family,

566
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,987
poor you.

567
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,495
Let me see if
it's really gone.

568
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,497
You lie.

569
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:29,511
You know snakes can
fuck themselves?

570
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:31,012
Give me your hand.

571
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,020
Oh, jesus christ.

572
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,046
Don't move.

573
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:06,548
What?

574
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,550
See...

575
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,552
...if you...

576
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,554
...cannot...

577
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,072
so, what happened?

578
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,074
He was at "the
crazy horse",

579
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,076
and some zip, he
told my man here

580
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,579
"new management,
new rules".

581
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,582
So, i asked around,
heard about some guy,

582
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:42,584
multi- something,

583
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:44,586
some made guy in
the soprano family

584
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,588
was runnin
g things now.

585
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:48,089
I go,"whoa!"

586
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:49,090
Chris moltisanti.

587
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,592
Yeah, that's
the name.

588
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,093
I know chris.

589
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,097
What's you
r name again?

590
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,599
Matush.

591
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:03,104
Normally, i woul
d never get involved
with a stranger,

592
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:06,608
but, if carlo, here,
is vouching for you,

593
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:09,110
i'm willing to
make an exception,

594
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,111
and take
care of it.

595
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,613
Thank you.

596
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,115
What'd i tell you
about my man, jackie?

597
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,117
You know who
my father was?

598
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:20,622
The golfer?
U. S. Open?

599
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:24,125
Chris and me
are associates.

600
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,127
You got nothin
g to worry about.

601
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:29,130
I'll call carlo in
a couple of days.

602
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,135
Meeting over.

603
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,638
Verbum dei has a strict,
zero- tolerance policy

604
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,139
in cases of vandalism.

605
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:40,642
It is a policy
that demands the
immediate expulsion

606
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,644
of the offending
student.

607
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:43,645
I told him.

608
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,647
You see?

609
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,149
Having said that,
in this case,

610
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,652
after much deliberation
and assessment,

611
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:53,154
we have decided upon
a suspended sentence.

612
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:56,157
This consideration has
only been arrived at

613
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,159
based upon anthony's
academic performance

614
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,162
and his involvement in
extracurricular sport.

615
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,163
His academic
performance?

616
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:04,666
He's brought his
gpa up to a "c- ".

617
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,668
So, what is
the punishment?

618
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:08,169
We suggest,
and hope,

619
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,172
that anthony's punishm
ent be meted out parentally.

620
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,174
So, it's not exactly
zero tolerance.

621
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:15,176
Each child is special.

622
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:17,679
That's a guiding principle
of this school, too.

623
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,682
Well, what
about detention?

624
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,183
A lawsuit a
few years back

625
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,686
forced us to eliminate
our detention program.

626
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:27,188
Well, he's off the
football team, right?

627
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,189
No.

628
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:31,693
Studies done at
harvard, and elsewhere,

629
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,195
have shown that boys
have greater success

630
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:36,197
in avoiding
the pitfalls
of adolescence

631
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:37,699
when they remain
committed to,

632
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,201
and involved
in, sport.

633
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,704
You better wipe that
smile off your face.

634
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,209
Look, i told him he wa
s gonna be off the team.

635
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:50,211
Now, i mean,
you're kind of...

636
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:51,713
undermining--

637
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:54,215
it's not only skill
that anthony has shown

638
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:55,717
on the football field,

639
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:57,218
it's leadership
qualities as well.

640
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,221
We feel that it would be
against his best interests,

641
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,724
and the team's,

642
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,726
to sever his relationship
with the squad.

643
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:07,729
Well, if you think
that's best...

644
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:11,232
however, and i can't
say this strongly enough,

645
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:14,736
if there is but one more
infraction of our code,

646
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:17,238
the sentence will
immediately go into effect

647
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:19,240
and anthony
will be expelled.

648
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:23,244
Do you understand
this, anthony?

649
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,747
Yes.

650
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:27,749
You completely
sold us out in there.

651
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:28,750
What'd i do?

652
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,252
They are not punishing
him at all, tony,

653
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:33,254
and you went
right along with it.

654
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:34,756
I suggeste
d detention.

655
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:36,758
That whole thing was
a disgusting charade

656
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,259
so that the fucking
freshman football team

657
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,761
can win the big game.

658
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:41,763
We've been waiting
for years for him
to get off the couch,

659
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:42,764
this is good for him.

660
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:44,265
Oh, please!

661
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,266
We should keep thi
s in the family,

662
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:46,768
punish him at home.

663
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,269
He ain't getti
ng off that easy!

664
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:52,273
Overall, it's been
a good two weeks.

665
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,275
What about
the nightmares?

666
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,777
None.

667
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,782
I had a wonderful dream

668
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,785
where i lit the big
torch at the olympics.

669
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:05,787
What do you think
that represented?

670
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:08,790
Well, work
has been good.

671
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,293
My sales are way up.

672
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:16,297
And my performance
has been commended

673
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:19,300
by mercedes benz u. S. A. ,
with a little plaque.

674
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:22,804
What's going on with
your social life?

675
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:23,805
Nothing...

676
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,309
...right now.

677
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,813
But, it's okay.

678
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:37,318
What i'm going to say
is a little delicate,

679
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:39,320
but, i think
it's important.

680
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:42,824
When you called me
last week to cancel,

681
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,826
i heard a man's voice.

682
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:49,831
My car broke down.

683
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:55,336
It could've
been the mechanic.

684
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:56,838
I see.

685
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:07,348
I'm a little offended th
at you put it to me that way.

686
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:09,851
Offended, why?

687
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:12,854
Well, i don't
pay you to be under
your surveillance.

688
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,358
How dare you?

689
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,861
You came to me after
attempting suicide

690
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,363
over the break
up with barry.

691
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:25,867
I ask you because
you're under my care.

692
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:28,870
I think it's very
unprofessional ofyou

693
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,872
to confront me this way.

694
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:34,375
Suicide is something
i take very seriously.

695
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,877
Well, the doctor
in the e. R. Said

696
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:38,379
it was only
suicidal ideation.

697
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,882
Is he trained to give
those diagnoses?

698
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:42,884
My car broke down.

699
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,385
Fine.

700
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,388
I'll believe you.

701
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:48,890
Thank you.

702
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:55,897
To "the crazy horse",
buona fortuna.

703
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,398
Salut.

704
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,402
The club business
ain't easy,

705
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:02,904
i'll t
ell you that.

706
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:04,405
With "the bing",

707
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:07,408
everybody only
sees the glitz
and glamour.

708
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:09,911
Nobody really know
s what goes into it.

709
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,913
There's a lot
to deal with.

710
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:13,414
I know.

711
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:15,416
See, it's one
thing to have
a bar and sell drinks,

712
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,919
but, when you're
dealing with performers,

713
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,421
i don't care

714
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,423
if it's music,
tits,

715
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,426
fire- eaters, it's a
whole other game,

716
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,428
'cause ultimately,

717
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,931
you're relying on them
to get the customers in,

718
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:31,933
and spend money.

719
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:36,938
Alright,
i'll take it
upstairs.

720
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:44,445
How you doin'?

721
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,947
Alright.

722
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:52,954
How you doin'?

723
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:54,956
Somebody's
sitting there.

724
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,965
I'll t
ake a 7 &7.

725
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:04,966
And whatever my
friend here wants.

726
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:06,467
I'm good.

727
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:07,969
Just 7 & 7.

728
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,472
Congrats
on the club.

729
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,474
I only have admiration
for your progress

730
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:14,976
ever since you got
your button.

731
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:15,977
Thanks.

732
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:16,978
Thanks.

733
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,479
Sure.

734
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,481
I wanted to
have a little
sit- down withyou

735
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:23,484
about a friend of mi
ne who was doing some
business at your club.

736
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:24,986
And when did you
want to do this?

737
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:25,987
Now, if it's okay.

738
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:27,989
Now's okay for a chat,
not a sit- down.

739
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,491
Okay, this friend of mine
was movin' a little x

740
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,993
at the club before
you took over,

741
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:34,495
and the other night
he got thrown out
on his ass.

742
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,997
And?

743
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:39,000
No, i wanted to ask
you, as a favor to me,

744
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,003
to let him keep a little
action goin' on.

745
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,007
You'll get a piece
of whatever he does.

746
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,508
X is federal
territory now.

747
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,011
They got task forces
with dogs and shit,

748
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,512
i don't want
it in my club.

749
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:53,014
It would m
ean a lot to me.

750
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:58,019
You got a lotta balls.
Did you hear what i said?

751
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,020
Yeah.

752
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,022
What'd i say?

753
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:04,025
No.

754
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,026
End of chat.

755
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:06,527
Okay, thanks.

756
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:31,552
It's all
taken care of.

757
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:33,054
Thanks, man.

758
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:35,056
You just can't
do it in the club.

759
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:37,058
Have your customers
meet you outside.

760
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:39,560
Outside where?

761
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,063
Near the club,
use your car,

762
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,565
or their cars,

763
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:45,566
find an alley...

764
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,568
i gotta fuckin' th
ink it all out for you?

765
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,071
That's gonna make things
a lot harder on me.

766
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,573
This all happens for
good reason right now.

767
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:55,576
Reasons beyond anythin
g you could possibly know.

768
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,581
In time, everything
will be revealed to you.

769
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:04,085
Couple of weeks you'll b
e back inside, don't worry.

770
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:08,089
If that's the way it is,
that's the way it is.

771
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:09,590
I'll see you.

772
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,092
Are you
forgetting
something?

773
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,094
What?

774
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:16,097
I'm looking out
for you here.

775
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,099
I gotta eat
too, right?

776
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,103
Yeah, sure, i'll
take care of you.

777
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:23,604
I'll be by
every sunday.

778
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:25,106
Cool.

779
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:39,120
Your father an
d i have discussed
your punishment.

780
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,122
You're grounded
for a month.

781
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:44,625
That means no nintendo,
no dvds, no skateboards.

782
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:46,627
And no computer.

783
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,129
I use the computer
for school.

784
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,131
Get the typewriter
out of the basement.

785
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,132
Dad threw it out.

786
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,134
Then use a pen,

787
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:55,136
it worked for einstein,
it can work for you.

788
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:57,138
And, on top of that,
you're gonna work

789
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:58,139
your little ass
off around here,

790
00:40:58,139 --> 00:40:59,640
which you should've
been doin' anyway.

791
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,641
Okay.

792
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,643
Okay or not,
you got no choice.

793
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:04,145
Number one, you
go to the garage,
you clean it out,

794
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:05,646
you make it neat
and organized.

795
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:08,149
Jackie jr. Did tha
t the other day.

796
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,651
See what i'm sayin'
about him?

797
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:13,654
You oughta take
a few lessons from
jackie aprile, okay?

798
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,156
Get your act
together.

799
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:16,657
The kid's pre- med
at rutgers,

800
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:19,160
he finds time to come
down here and help out.

801
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,163
And, you are going
to clean the gutters.

802
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,164
What gutters?

803
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,665
On the roof.

804
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,167
Where?

805
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,668
On the edge, the things
that collect the water?

806
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:28,669
I don't know
what you mean.

807
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:29,670
Don't get smart
with me!

808
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,671
I don't know.

809
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:32,673
The drainpip
es for the rain?

810
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,176
C'mere.

811
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,181
Very good.

812
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,183
Obviously a lady
of discerning taste.

813
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:43,684
Come on!

814
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:44,685
I told you once.

815
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:46,187
My man
jackie said--

816
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:49,190
don't fuck
in' name drop me!

817
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,192
We're gonn
a take a walk.

818
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:57,198
Well, right arm's
still good, no?

819
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,201
You think that's funny?

820
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:02,203
Sorry.

821
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,207
Tell me
what happened.

822
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,210
I did like you said,
i stayed outside.

823
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,212
You musta disrespected
them or something.

824
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,214
Ugh! I--

825
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:15,216
i didn't do fuck!

826
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:16,217
Did you mention
my name,

827
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,719
that i sat down
with chris?

828
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,721
They didn'
t give a shit.

829
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:24,225
I don't think
they like you.

830
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,229
I gotta pee.

831
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,233
Can you give me
the thing?

832
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,238
You should get the
nurse to help you.

833
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:39,740
That's what they
get paid for.

834
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,743
Maybe she'll be fine and
give you a cheap thrill.

835
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:53,254
Hello...kelli?
Hiya, hon.

836
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,256
It's your
sister.

837
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:57,758
Now, this is t
he most crucial part.

838
00:42:57,758 --> 00:43:01,262
You put the pa
sta back in the pot,

839
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,264
you add
a little gravy...

840
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:05,766
and a little butter,

841
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:07,768
then,

842
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:10,771
you put the
fire back on,

843
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:16,777
for 45 seconds,
stir it up, real nice.

844
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:18,279
45 seconds?

845
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:21,782
Yeah, that
way the macaroni
absorbs the gravy

846
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:24,285
instead of
just coats it.

847
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:25,786
This is for flavor.

848
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:28,289
I need a favor.

849
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:29,790
What?

850
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,792
I need a piece.

851
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:34,295
I mean, i don't
need one, but,

852
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:35,296
you know.

853
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:44,805
Anything you
wanna tell me?

854
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,308
No, it's just i
think it's time, i...

855
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,310
you know.

856
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,312
What are you
lookin' to get?

857
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:53,814
I don't know,
what do you suggest?

858
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:56,817
Me, i like to know
the motherfucker's
gonna work.

859
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,321
And a. 38...

860
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,327
it'll never
jam on you,

861
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,329
plus, it's small.

862
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,331
But, if you're lookin'
to make a point,

863
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:12,333
you might wanna go
with something bigger.

864
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:14,335
Nah, it's not really
for intimidation.

865
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:16,337
It's just in case.

866
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:18,339
I'd go with
the. 38.

867
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,342
You can have
this one.

868
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,843
I got another one
under the bed.

869
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:29,350
How much i owe
you for it?

870
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,853
Get outta here,
your money's no good.

871
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:35,356
Macaroni's
ready!

872
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:00,881
I just wanna
tell you,

873
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:04,385
that i don't expec
t anything from you.

874
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:08,889
Well, kindness,
but, that's it.

875
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:13,394
Okay.

876
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:16,897
God!

877
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:20,901
You really are in
love with yourself,

878
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,903
aren't you?

879
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:29,410
What do you mean,
conceited?

880
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:33,414
Self- centered.

881
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:36,417
Okay, there's a bunch
of alternates

882
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,419
you could've said.

883
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:43,924
You deprive
yourself of nothing.

884
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,938
You th
ink i'm vain?

885
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,940
I think
you're wonderful.

886
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:25,966
"And her name
is "g".

887
00:46:43,984 --> 00:46:45,486
A- ha.

888
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:48,489
Some of my accounts
are in bad neighborhoods.

889
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:50,991
I know why you lie...

890
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:54,995
but, you don't
have to.

891
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,502
Can i hold it?

892
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:16,517
It's heavy.

893
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:18,519
Is it loaded?

894
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:21,021
Nothing's more useless
than an unloaded gun.

895
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:24,525
Here you go.

896
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:30,030
Mr. Waste management.

897
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,032
Come here.

898
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:45,045
I mean we're
paying the school,

899
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,548
we're buying
a service.

900
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:51,051
And if it's their opinio
n that he shouldn't get
treated too harshly...

901
00:47:52,553 --> 00:47:55,055
you gotta listen to
the experts, right?

902
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:00,561
What else
is going on?

903
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,063
How was the rest
of your week?

904
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,566
To be honest
, very good.

905
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:07,067
Why is that?

906
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,570
Well, that's h
ow life is, i guess.

907
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,573
Sometimes it's goo
d, sometimes it's bad.

908
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:14,575
Things com
e, things go.

909
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:17,077
How are things between
you and carmela?

910
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:19,079
She was moody for
a little while,

911
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,581
but, now she's
her old self.

912
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,584
Maybe it was
coming here.

913
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:25,586
Possibly.

914
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:29,590
Well, you do look
happy, i must say.

915
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,591
Yeah.

916
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,095
I went to the zoo
the other day.

917
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:36,597
The zoo?

918
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:37,598
Yeah.

919
00:48:38,098 --> 00:48:41,101
Sometimes you gott
a get away, and,

920
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:43,604
stop and smell
the gorilla shit.

921
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:46,607
It was good to
be in nature though.

922
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:48,609
And the zoo
made you happy.

923
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:49,610
Yeah.

924
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:56,617
I think a lot of it'
s'cause of you, too.

925
00:48:56,617 --> 00:48:58,619
You put a lo
t of time into me,

926
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,623
and, now,
it's payin' off.

927
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,625
The progress
that you make

928
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,126
is entirely
up to you,

929
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,128
and how willing you are

930
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,130
to be honest with
yourself and with me.

931
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:12,132
Well, i am improving.

932
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:14,635
You have to
joyfully participate

933
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:16,637
in the suffering
of the world.

934
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:22,643
Your thoughts
have a,

935
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:24,144
kind of eastern
flavor to them.

936
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,647
Well, i've lived in
jersey my whole life.

937
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:29,650
I mean eastern
in terms of asian.

938
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,653
Like buddhist
or taoist.

939
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:35,155
Sun tzu...

940
00:49:35,155 --> 00:49:37,658
i told you about him.

941
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:43,664
We have to
stop now.

942
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:45,666
Alright.

943
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:51,672
This is the co- pay

944
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:55,175
i owe you
from last month.

945
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:57,177
You gave me
too much.

946
00:49:58,178 --> 00:49:59,179
Well, i gave y
ou a little extra

947
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,682
for the good results
this week.

948
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:04,184
I can't
accept it.

949
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,186
Give it to your
favorite charity.

950
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:07,187
You better
get your phone.

951
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,189
I'll see y
a next week.

952
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:15,195
Hello.

953
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:16,196
Hi, mom.

954
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,197
Hi, jason.

955
00:50:17,197 --> 00:50:18,699
How are you?

956
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:19,700
I hate all of them!

957
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:20,701
Who?

958
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,703
My patients,
all of them!

959
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,204
Lying to my face,
full of shit,

960
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:26,707
with no concern
for what i do

961
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:28,709
or the positio
n that they put me in.

962
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,210
I just hate them.

963
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,212
Fuck'em,
quit.

964
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:36,216
Right now, that doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

965
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:38,719
I'm sorry.

966
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:41,221
How are you?

967
00:50:41,221 --> 00:50:42,723
I'm okay.

968
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:46,727
I need to buy a couple
of expensive books.

969
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:04,745
Como sta.

970
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:07,247
Hey ton'.
How's it goin'?

971
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,768
Hope you're
doin' alright.

972
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:29,269
Excuse me.

973
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:40,280
I don't want
no teammates.

974
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:41,782
Tony!

975
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:42,783
How ya doin'?

976
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:44,284
You up?

977
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:45,285
No.

978
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:46,787
Take a hit.

979
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:48,789
Hit me.

980
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,792
You shouldn't
have listened to me,

981
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,293
it's your hand.

982
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:54,795
I would've
hit anyway.

983
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:57,297
C'mere, i wanna
talk to you a minute.

984
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:59,299
What the fuck are
you doing here?

985
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:00,300
You're here.

986
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:01,802
What?

987
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:03,804
I was at a bachelor party,
i got dragged here...

988
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:06,306
this is exactly what
the fuck we talked
about the other day.

989
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,809
Now get your money, and
get the fuck out of here!

990
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:09,810
Sorry, tony.

991
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,311
I never wanna
see you here again.

992
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:12,312
You won't.

993
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:14,314
Smarten up.

994
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:28,829
Good morning.

995
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:32,833
New earrings.

996
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,835
I went out and
treated myself.

997
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:36,336
They match.

998
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:38,839
I almost bought the necklace
that goes along with them,

999
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:40,841
but...some restraint.

1000
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:42,843
Although christmas
is coming, so...

1001
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:44,344
maybe.

1002
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:48,849
Any cannolis l
eft from yesterday?

1003
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:51,852
I think you can answer
that question yourself.

1004
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:55,355
Meadow still here?

1005
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:58,859
Jackie jr. Took her
to the city to see "aida".

1006
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,360
"I eat her"?

1007
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,863
It's the elton john
musical on broadway.

1008
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:03,864
Oh.

1009
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:07,868
I have to say, you
were right, tony.

1010
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:10,370
Jackie jr. Has
really surprised me.

1011
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,873
He's been a
perfect gentleman,

1012
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:15,375
he takes her to the city
for a little culture,

1013
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,877
he's great with a. J.

1014
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:18,879
So long as she does
good in school,

1015
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:20,881
things could be
a lot worse.
