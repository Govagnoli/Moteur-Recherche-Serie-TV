1
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,493
Meadow, do you
have a tampon?

2
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,496
I'm spotting and the
dispenser in the
ladies room is out.

3
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,498
You had an
examination?

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,002
I don't know
what's happening.

5
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,005
This is the middle of
the month, this never
happens to me.

6
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:03,506
Here.

7
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,528
Imagine having
your portrait in a
museum like this.

8
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,031
She's just the
wife of some rich
merchant, mom.

9
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,033
That's how rubens
made his money.

10
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,035
You sure talk the talk
,"miss art history".

11
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:35,538
I have never seen grades
like this from you.

12
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:38,041
Well, you take
intro to semiotics.

13
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,043
If you spent more
time in your books

14
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:42,545
and less in
jackie's car...

15
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,047
please...

16
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,049
that is so over.

17
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,552
Just like that?
What happened?

18
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,584
Are you crying?

19
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,587
What's the matter?

20
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,090
I don't know,
just look at it.

21
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,601
Jusepe de ribera.

22
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,104
"The mystical marriage
of st. Catherine."

23
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,605
That's the baby jesus.

24
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:45,608
She's marrying a
baby? Good luck.

25
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,110
We all do.

26
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,611
What?

27
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,613
I shouldn't
be sarcastic.

28
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,619
Just look at her

29
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,622
with the little baby's
hand against her cheek.

30
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,127
She's so at peace.

31
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,631
That beautiful,
innocent,

32
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,634
gorgeous little baby.

33
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,647
C'mon, let's
go eat.

34
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,160
Tony?

35
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,164
Oh, tony, c'mon.

36
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:44,167
I'm sorry about wh
at happened, you won't
return my phone calls.

37
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,168
Go fuck yourself!

38
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,670
Tony...

39
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,673
we have something
too special to just--

40
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,175
over one argument.

41
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:53,176
One argument?

42
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,678
You threw
a fuckin' dinner
at my head, gloria.

43
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,680
If you were a guy,

44
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,183
i don't have to tell you
where you'd be right now.

45
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:02,185
You were late!

46
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,187
You kept me waiting
three hours--

47
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,688
what about
the present?

48
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,190
You take a
nice thought,
a nice present,

49
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,192
you throw it out the window
in the fuckin' barnegat bay.

50
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:09,692
Alright...

51
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,697
i'm having a reall
y bad couple of weeks.

52
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,700
Shit with my family
and other crap...

53
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,204
i was trying t
o act all in control
and not dwell on it.

54
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,206
It's no
excuse, but...

55
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,209
so, what, you can't
talk to me about
your problems?

56
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,211
I didn't want to
bother you with it.

57
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,215
Well, i had a
lot on my plate.

58
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,218
Can i see
you later?

59
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,220
I'm late for my
appointment.

60
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,727
Me and this broad,

61
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,730
we're like
leather and lace,

62
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,233
a burn
ing ring of fire.

63
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,234
Whatever the fuck.

64
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,735
Amour fou...

65
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:55,738
as the french call it.

66
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:58,241
Crazy love,
all consuming.

67
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,742
That's it.

68
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,744
I tell ya, we push
each other's buttons.

69
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,747
Most people don't
push your buttons.

70
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,249
That's not true.

71
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,253
I know you think
i'm like a hard, cold,

72
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,255
captain of
industry- type.

73
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,257
That's not
all there is.

74
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,761
I don't know.

75
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:25,268
She gets freaky.

76
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,769
What do you think?

77
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,272
Is she a full blown
looptiloo or what?

78
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,773
As you well know,
i cannot--

79
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,775
discuss
another patient.

80
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,777
What if i duck you
an extra five?

81
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,779
I'm not charging you
at all this month

82
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,781
because last month
you overpaid.

83
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:40,783
You gave me a lot of
good tips that session.

84
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,286
I won't have it,
don't offer it again.

85
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,787
Alright, alright,
jesus.

86
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,289
Let's get back
to gloria.

87
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,291
She never wants
any money neither.

88
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,792
And you like
this about her?

89
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,295
She's, you know ve
ry independent- minded.

90
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,797
That i do like.

91
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:57,300
You see her as
independent, strong.

92
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,301
Why? She's not?

93
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,803
We're talking about
your perceptions.

94
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,806
She made her own
way in the world.

95
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,809
Irina was such a
helpless fuckin' baby.

96
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,812
And gloria
knows a lot,

97
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,814
about a lot of shit.

98
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,817
Buddhism,
and the movies.

99
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,822
She went to morocco
all by herself.

100
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,329
And those eyes...

101
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,833
those dark,
black eyes.

102
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,837
When she stares at
you it's like...

103
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:37,840
like a spanish princess
in one of those paintings,

104
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,841
a goyim.

105
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,845
Those eyes are deep.

106
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,347
Complicated.

107
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,348
I said deep, you
said complicated.

108
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:46,849
You said dark.

109
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:47,850
Spit it out.

110
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,353
Whenever i bring her u
p you get this weird puss.

111
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,855
And then you ask me,
"does she seem happy?"

112
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:53,856
Like maybe she's not.

113
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,858
Or,"does she remind
you of somebody?"

114
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:56,859
With that
weird puss on.

115
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,362
Like you don't like
it, our mo- fo,

116
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,863
or whatever the fuck
you call our relationship!

117
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,866
You've told me what
you see in gloria.

118
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,868
What do you think
she sees in you?

119
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,370
Oh, please, huh?

120
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,872
What does
she see in me?

121
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,374
I don't know,

122
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,377
with all the fuckin' faggo
and crybabies running around,

123
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,379
whatever else
i am, i'm not...

124
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,884
i'm more of a...

125
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,886
you know
, like i said,

126
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,389
a captain of
industry- type.

127
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,890
You're a tough guy.

128
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,392
Ah, c'mon.

129
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:30,893
It's okay,
you can say it.

130
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:32,395
C'mon, you embarrass m
e with that shit now.

131
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:35,398
Does gloria know what
you do for a living?

132
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,900
You mentioned fire.

133
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,902
Can we say that there are
certain kinds of people

134
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,405
that are
drawn to fire?

135
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,408
Looking for an
inevitable result?

136
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,909
Like a moth
to a flame?

137
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,911
And this is gloria?

138
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,914
And i'm the flame?

139
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,917
Why would anybody hit
you, of all people,

140
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,419
with a side of beef?

141
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,421
She's complicated.

142
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,423
I said complicated.

143
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:01,924
Dark, you said.

144
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,427
I said her
eyes are dark.

145
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,930
Nice.

146
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,932
Not bad.

147
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,937
Since we're
kicking up,

148
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:17,440
we were hoping you
could, you know,

149
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,443
watch our back?

150
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,948
350 buys you
a hello.

151
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,950
Watching
your back,

152
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,453
that's
gonna
require

153
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:33,956
a little more
initiative on
your part.

154
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,959
Oh, look at the face.

155
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,963
What's he got to
be frowning about?

156
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,966
Tell me, romeo,

157
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,969
now that you
moved back home,

158
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,971
are you gonna
be humpin'

159
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,973
tony soprano's
little girl
on our couch?

160
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:52,475
Fuck her.

161
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,977
Tony too, with
his "stay in
school" bullshit.

162
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:56,979
He could've reached ou
t to somebody at rutgers.

163
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,481
He should break
the dean's legs

164
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,983
'cause you're too lazy
to read a fuckin' book.

165
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:04,487
Now go ahead,
i gotta make
some calls.

166
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,489
You did good.

167
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,991
Keep coming by...

168
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,994
go, go!

169
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,007
I knew a moroccan
guy once.

170
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,510
Hit and ran me,
i tracked him down.

171
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,012
I never
forget a fez.

172
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,516
Jesus christ.

173
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:36,018
That's the oldes
t joke in the book.

174
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,021
Jesus christ.

175
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,523
Hello?

176
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:43,526
No, you have
the wrong number.

177
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:47,530
What?

178
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,534
I thought it
might be my sister.

179
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,036
That family shit you
were telling me about?

180
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,538
Yeah.

181
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,541
It's okay if you don
't want to talk about it.

182
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,544
Really.

183
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,547
She said i can never see
my niece and nephew again.

184
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,551
Right before
christmas.

185
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:11,554
We had a new santa claus
at our christmas party
in the neighborhood.

186
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,556
He wasn't very good.

187
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:16,058
I love those two
children so much.

188
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,562
She said i was turning
them against their
father, which i wasn't.

189
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,064
Not that he doesn't
deserve it,

190
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:24,066
fucking crackhead
sack of shit.

191
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,070
Hannah and seamus
go to this

192
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,574
like, alternative
private elementary school

193
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,075
in santa monica.

194
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:36,078
Where it's all about the
childrens' self esteem.

195
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,079
I hate that shit.

196
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,582
So, i happened to ask hannah,
she's in the third grade,

197
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:42,084
"are you gonna be in
the christmas play?"

198
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:44,086
And she says,
"we don't call it
the christmas play,

199
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,589
we call it the
winter festival."

200
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,092
So i go,"whatever,"
i don't say anything.

201
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,095
And then seamus says,

202
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:54,597
"we're not allowed
to say christmas,

203
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:57,099
we call christmas
"the c word."

204
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,101
And i fuckin'
flipped out.

205
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:04,106
What did seamus say?

206
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:06,108
The fuck does he
know, he's 10.

207
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,110
So my sister gets
all pissed off

208
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,112
because her husband,
their father,

209
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,614
teaches at the school.

210
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,617
Except for he's on
medical leave for
substance abuse treatment.

211
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:16,619
And one thing
led to another

212
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:21,123
and she said i always
had it in for john.

213
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,626
And she forbid me to
ever see them again.

214
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,629
He smokes crack,
this fuck?

215
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,132
Without those
two kids...

216
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,140
maybe we'll
all get lucky.

217
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,643
The way these trucks
go by out here,

218
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,646
maybe i'll
get plastered
onto a grill.

219
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,147
Hey, what the fuck?

220
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:47,650
I'm just kidding
, it never rains.

221
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,653
I think they're go
nna fire me over at globe.

222
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,156
Fucking arnie mills
sexually harasses me

223
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,158
and then
dares me to sue.

224
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:57,660
Mm- hmm.

225
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,662
Anyway,

226
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,163
fuck'em.

227
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,166
You like this song?

228
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,168
It's okay.

229
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:09,672
I love this song.

230
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,712
Guys, if you're gonna
smoke, take it outside.

231
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,723
Fuck's the
matter, you don't
speak english?

232
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,725
Who the fuck
are you?

233
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,226
The owner's a dear
friend of ours.

234
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:06,228
That should be
enough for you.

235
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,229
Fuck him, too.

236
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,732
What'd you
fuckin' say?

237
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,233
Chill, chill,
relax!

238
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,234
Jackie,

239
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,736
what are
you doin'?

240
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,237
It's alright,
it's under control.

241
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:18,240
Go find a fuckin' taco bell
before i cap your asses.

242
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,743
Get the fuck
outta here.

243
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,749
Oh, shit, here,
take this.

244
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:28,751
Fuck no, bro
, he's a made guy.

245
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,753
He's gonna
flip when he
sees this shit.

246
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,255
Roy's his
aunt's cousin.

247
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,258
What's up?

248
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,760
Hey, chris.

249
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,261
The fuck happened?

250
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,763
Ask your
buddy here.

251
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,265
These spics came in, you know,
disrespecting the place.

252
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,267
So, i had to
straighten them out.

253
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,269
You had to
straighten the
m out, how many?

254
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,271
Three.

255
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,273
Goddamn fuckin
' craziness.

256
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,274
You alright, roy?

257
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,777
20 years, i'm collecting
these things.

258
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,779
What the fuck,
it's only glass.

259
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,782
Have a seat.

260
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,791
So, how's business
, you making money?

261
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,293
We're doing alright,
why, you got something?

262
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,295
My favorite,
a truck.

263
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,296
Cigarettes.

264
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:15,297
Sounds good.

265
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,800
But we're kinda
with ralphie now.

266
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,803
Besides, wouldn't tony
go fuckin' ballistic
if i was in on it?

267
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,805
Hey, unless they're
paying your nut,

268
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,807
nobody has a right
to tell anybody else

269
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,809
how to earn a
fuckin' living.

270
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,310
Finally,
thank you.

271
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,312
Ralphie, huh?

272
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:32,314
Well, if you
ever think about
jumpin' ship,

273
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:34,817
you know
my number.

274
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,827
I need the paperwork
on the preowned c- five.

275
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,829
Mrs. Soprano?

276
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,330
Yes.

277
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,332
The courtesy van's
stuck in traffic.

278
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,335
It should only be
maybe 20 minutes.

279
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,837
Oh, well,

280
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,839
maybe i'll just
call a cab.

281
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,841
That's okay, jerry,
i'll give her a lift.

282
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,342
I'm going
out anyway.

283
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,844
Gloria trillo.

284
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,846
Carmela soprano,
you're sure you
don't mind?

285
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:06,348
Gimme a minute, let
me just grab a demo.

286
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,351
This is very
sweet of you.

287
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,853
Don't believeit.

288
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,856
Everybody's
a potential sale.

289
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:16,859
So, what do you do?

290
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,360
I'm a homemaker.

291
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,362
Oh.

292
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:23,365
You must mak
e a very nice home
to drive a benz.

293
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,869
So, you're married.

294
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:27,870
Yes.

295
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:30,372
Kids?

296
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:31,373
Two.

297
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:32,374
You?

298
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,877
No, to both.

299
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:37,880
Boys, girls?

300
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,882
One boy, one girl.

301
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:41,383
The boy's still
in high school

302
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,385
and my daughter's
in college.

303
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,393
She's not too
far away though.

304
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:54,396
She's in
new york city.

305
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:00,903
She's at columbia,
actually.

306
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,404
School of broadcasting?

307
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:03,906
No, no,
the university.

308
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,908
It's in the ivy league,
it's one of the top schools.

309
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:08,410
I know, i was
just kidding.

310
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,411
Oh.

311
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,413
Right.

312
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:14,917
These kids today...

313
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,920
they got the world
by the you know what.

314
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,421
Yeah, tell
me about it.

315
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:22,925
At least your daughter
doesn't have to latch on
to a man for success.

316
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,427
Thank god.

317
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,431
That's a beautiful ring.

318
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,934
Thank you.

319
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,936
What does your
husband do?

320
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,438
Well, he's involved
in a few businesses.

321
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,440
Sounds mysterious.

322
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,442
No, no, it's
not really.

323
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,444
My daughter calls
us bourgeois.

324
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,960
Well, thank you
so much, really.

325
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,461
Oh, it was
no problem.

326
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:01,463
It was very nice
to meet you.

327
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:02,464
You too.

328
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,967
Nice house.

329
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:05,968
Thank you.

330
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,480
I'll tell you,

331
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,983
the thing i like
about moltisanti?

332
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:23,485
He'll even tell
tony soprano to
go fuck himself.

333
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,488
The guy's fearless.

334
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,490
Who's fearless?

335
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,492
Nobody, chris
moltisanti.

336
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:31,994
Where's my mother?

337
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,996
She's an
early riser.

338
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,999
What about
moltisanti?

339
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,501
Nothing, we were
just saying he's
young to be made,

340
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,003
that kinda shit.

341
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,504
He wanted it,

342
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,507
so he stepped up
and took it.

343
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:48,010
It's like your old man
and tony soprano.

344
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,512
How do you think they got
their name on the marquee?

345
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:51,513
How?

346
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,515
We got any
marshmallows?

347
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:55,517
C'mon, what about
my father?

348
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,525
When we was kids we
had our own little crew,

349
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:06,528
me, your dad,
buon anima,

350
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,031
tony, silvio dante.

351
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,033
We'd do mickey
mouse scores,

352
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,535
moving pot...

353
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:17,539
swag, bullshit stuff.

354
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,542
We thought we were like
the sixth family.

355
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:24,046
But who the fuck knew
we was even alive, right?

356
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,548
Till one fuckin' night,

357
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,551
and i gotta give your
father credit for this.

358
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,553
He had balls

359
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,056
as big as an irish
broad's ass.

360
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,559
There was this old...

361
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,062
old mustache named...

362
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,565
feech lamanna.

363
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:46,068
Now, what the hell "feech"
meant who the fuck knows,

364
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:49,571
but, he was made
on the other side,

365
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:52,074
so you know, he
was an original.

366
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,575
He was an o. G.

367
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,079
Whatever.

368
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,082
He had this saturday
night card game.

369
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:03,085
Your father sees this
as our big chance

370
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:05,087
to step up to
the "a" league.

371
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,088
Connected or not,

372
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:10,592
him, me, and tony
were gonna rob it.

373
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,095
We thought your father
lost a marble,

374
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:16,098
but he said,
"fuck it".

375
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:17,099
Balls.

376
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,100
What happened?

377
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,102
They took it down,

378
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,104
they walked away
with like 20 large.

379
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,605
Jesus christ.

380
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,107
What do you
mean "they"?

381
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,108
You didn't go?

382
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,609
Please...

383
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,112
i'm still
sick over it.

384
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:33,615
I caught the clap from some
hippie broad i was fuckin'.

385
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:37,119
My dick was dripping
like a busted pipe.

386
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,123
Anyways, the
rest is history.

387
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:44,626
Your father and tony was on
the fast track to being made

388
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,128
and i

389
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:49,131
was still a little shit
heel like the two of you.

390
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:52,134
Then of course,
i, whatever,

391
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,636
but that was a
few years later.

392
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,638
Did they get
away with it?

393
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:58,640
What could feech do?

394
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,142
There was a sit- down

395
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:03,645
and the right people got
some of their money back...

396
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,648
but, the point
was made.

397
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:09,651
Your father and tony
were rising stars
that had to be respected.

398
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,656
Cocksuckers.

399
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,660
Alright, kiddies,
that's enough
for tonight.

400
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,165
Oh, jackie,

401
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,668
make sure you rinse those
plates before you put them
in the dishwasher.

402
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:28,170
It clogs.

403
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,679
We can't help but be amazed

404
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,682
at the instincts
they possess...

405
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,685
to protect all
manner of livestock,

406
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,687
to be protective of us.

407
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,195
What can we do
to protect them?

408
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:55,697
Nurture the defenses
they were born with

409
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:59,201
using the natural body
defense system in pedigree.

410
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,703
What is wrong
with me?

411
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,705
Pedigree...

412
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,208
hi, there.

413
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,713
Are you drunk?

414
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,720
How'bou
t right here?

415
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,723
You would,
wouldn't you, huh?

416
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,726
Does my car
look slanted?

417
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,730
Oh, shit.

418
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,733
If i have a flat.

419
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,237
Oh, my god.

420
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:37,739
Jesus christ.

421
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,743
So creepy.

422
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,245
Why?

423
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,746
I don't know.

424
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:48,750
What?

425
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,252
What?

426
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,256
You know
who did this,
don't you?

427
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:55,757
The fuck you
talking about?

428
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,259
I saw that look.

429
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,261
The least you coul
d do is not lie to me.

430
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,762
What do i know about
your friggin' tires?

431
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:01,763
Fine.

432
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,266
Thanks for
your help.

433
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:05,767
Alright.

434
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,769
One time,

435
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:10,772
my ex- girlfriend
, she, you know,

436
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,775
got a little jealous
and she slashed my tires.

437
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:16,778
And that thought went throug
my mind briefly just then.

438
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,280
But it couldn'
t have been her.

439
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,281
Who, the cunt that
called the boat?

440
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:20,782
Stata zit'
with that.

441
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,284
Stata zit', my
car is fucked!

442
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:23,285
You work for
a dealership.

443
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:25,287
What do you think,
i get new free
fucking tires?

444
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,289
So, i'll pay
for it, what's the
big fuckin' deal?

445
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,291
Alright, now, why would
you offer to pay for them

446
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,293
if you didn't
have a guilty
fuckin' conscience?

447
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:32,794
About what?

448
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:34,796
Well, i don't know,
you tell me.

449
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:36,798
This is fucking
bullshit.

450
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm going home.

451
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,801
Oh, yeah? Who
else would do it?

452
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:40,802
Who knows,
kids maybe.

453
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,804
Ruin a great
fuckin' evenin
g over this shit!

454
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:44,306
Kids?

455
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:46,308
I don't know,
maybe your fucking
brother- in- law.

456
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,310
Maybe mr. Globe
down at globe motors,

457
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,312
since you're america's
fuckin' sweetheart
this week.

458
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:53,315
Oh, where the fuck
do you get off?

459
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,817
This immigrant,
alcoholic,

460
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:58,820
fuckin' probably
hiv- laden slut...!

461
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,822
Slashes my tires

462
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:02,324
and you have
the fuckin' nerve

463
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:03,825
to call my life
into question?

464
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,327
She wouldn't do it!

465
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,329
I slapped the piss
out of her last time!

466
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,331
Oh...

467
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,333
did you?

468
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,835
Did you really
hit her?

469
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,842
Alright, look...

470
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:23,345
she's a poor,
confused kid

471
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:25,847
from an
underdeveloped
country,

472
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,849
even if she
did do this...

473
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,851
i'll make
a couple of calls,

474
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:32,354
i'll have two brand new
michelins here in an hour.

475
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:34,856
What are these,

476
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:38,360
85 r- 16s,
what?

477
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:41,363
Jesus christ.

478
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,366
17s!

479
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,372
Gene pontecorvo's
got a card game,

480
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,874
we can take it
down right now.

481
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:55,377
What are you
fuckin' crazy?
He's with ralph.

482
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:57,379
So, for all
intents and purposes,
that's ralph's game.

483
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,880
That's even better.

484
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:00,882
Fuck him and
his "rinse your
dishes" bullshit.

485
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:02,384
You know what?

486
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:03,885
I think he's a
fuckin' secret fag.

487
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:05,387
I don't know, jackie.

488
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:07,889
Maybe we take carlo too,
he's got a shotgun.

489
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:09,891
We wear masks,
we go in,

490
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,394
we're out in like
two minutes.

491
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,396
What if they find
out that it's us?

492
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:15,897
We want them to.

493
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,400
Not right away, but,
you know, like ralph said.

494
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,403
And even when they do, you
know it's gonna get squashed.

495
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:23,905
My old man was
jackie aprile.

496
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,909
The worse that'll happen,
we have to give
some of it back.

497
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:31,913
We pull this off,
we're like free agents.

498
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:34,416
We dictate the
terms, not them.

499
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,919
'Cause we
show balls.

500
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,921
Go on,
call carlo.

501
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,929
Fuck.

502
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,931
There's no signal.

503
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:52,934
I'd have to be pretty stup
to write a book about killing

504
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,936
and then kill somebo
dy the way i described...

505
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,438
use that phone.

506
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,941
Oh yeah,
this one.

507
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,943
C'mon, hurry up,
call carlo.

508
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:04,946
They show
my favorite
part yet?

509
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:06,448
No, i thin
k it's coming up.

510
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:08,450
The answer's no.

511
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,952
I didn't kill him.

512
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:14,956
C'mon, move over
, gimme me some room.

513
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,958
Fuck you,
it's my house.

514
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,463
Here it comes.

515
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,465
Yeah!

516
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:25,967
Would you like a
cigarette, nick?

517
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:34,476
You two know
each other?

518
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,977
No.

519
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:36,978
No.

520
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,483
I went to see a
psychiatrist, father.

521
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:44,986
The that's why father
intintola suggested
i talk to you.

522
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,488
He said that
you were getting

523
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:48,990
a doctorate in
psychiatry fro
m seton hall.

524
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,492
Psychology.

525
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,994
The psychiatrist told me
that my whole life is a lie

526
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,996
and he's right.

527
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:58,500
And now i thin
k i'm sick...

528
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:04,005
and if i die, i will never
be with god in eternity.

529
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:05,507
You're ill?

530
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:08,009
I'm pretty sure
i have ovarian cancer.

531
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,011
What does your
doctor say?

532
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,514
I haven't seen one.

533
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,516
I'm afraid.

534
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:16,518
Why do you think
you're ill?

535
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm spotting,

536
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,022
and lower back pain.

537
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:23,024
My hormones ar
e all over the place.

538
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:25,527
My cousin kathy
died from it.

539
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:28,029
God doesn't
punish people

540
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:30,031
for mistakes
they've made.

541
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,534
He loves you more
than you know.

542
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,539
Have you thought that
with your symptoms

543
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,541
you might be
carrying a child?

544
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,543
I know,
that's another--

545
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:43,545
would you be
more comfortable

546
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:46,548
if we set the sacrament
aside for a moment

547
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:49,551
and stepped
into my office?

548
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:09,571
The psychiatrist said th
at i should leave my husband.

549
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:13,074
May god forgive me
, when he said tha
t it seemed so right.

550
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,076
You made a sacred vow.

551
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,579
Divorce is out
of the question.

552
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,080
Unless...

553
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,583
is he abusive,
your husband?

554
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,086
Not to me, but
he is unfaithful.

555
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:29,090
He's a good man
basically, but...

556
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,593
i talked to father intintola
about all this years ago

557
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:33,595
and here
i still am.

558
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,096
Do you love
your husband?

559
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:36,598
I do.

560
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:39,601
I love my husband
and i love god.

561
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:44,606
But, my life i
s financed by crime...

562
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:48,610
his crime.

563
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,613
$50, 000 to my
daughter's college.

564
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:55,617
The psychiatrist say
s it's all blood money.

565
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:59,621
And now to maybe bring
another child into this?

566
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,623
God understands

567
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:04,125
that we all live in
the middle of tensions.

568
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:08,129
You say your husband
has good in him.

569
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:11,633
What you have to do

570
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,135
is learn to live on
what the good part earns.

571
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,137
The what?

572
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:22,143
There's a point
inside yourself,

573
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,646
an inner boundary

574
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:27,649
beyond which
you feel culpable.

575
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,151
You've got to come
to an awareness

576
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:31,653
of where that line is

577
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:35,156
and forego those things
which lay without it.

578
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:38,159
The church has
changed so much.

579
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,161
It's a complex world.

580
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:44,165
Learn to live on
the good part.

581
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,669
Forego those things
that lay without it.

582
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,675
I think i can
do that, father.

583
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,177
I'll try.

584
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:59,681
And go see
an ob- gyn.

585
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,689
This mad cow disease.

586
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:11,693
I think it's terrible
the english government
didn't tell people sooner.

587
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:14,195
Maybe they didn't want
to create a stampede.

588
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,700
Oh, by the way,

589
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,202
guess which former
medical student

590
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:23,705
is no longer datin
g the queen of mean?

591
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,207
You're kidding.

592
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,210
Jackie jr. And meadow
are finished?

593
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,713
Frankly, i
am delighted.

594
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:34,716
Angie bonpensiero said
that kevin told her

595
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:37,218
that jackie wa
s smoking marijuana

596
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,221
and he was caught cheating
on an exam at rutgers.

597
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,223
Gee, that bad?

598
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,225
She would've been better
off with that black kid.

599
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,227
He's got a 4. 0

600
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:48,229
and he's moving
to india for the u. N.

601
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,231
I told you.

602
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,736
She wasted three months
with jackie jr.

603
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:56,738
Hello.

604
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,239
Mrs. Soprano?

605
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,742
Gloria trillo,
globe motors.

606
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,744
Oh, hi, of course,
how are you?

607
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,245
I hope i'm not calling
you at a bad time.

608
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,747
But the new e- 320
just came in

609
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,249
and i thought you might
want to take a look at it.

610
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:10,752
Oh, no, i don't th
ink so, thank you though.

611
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,254
I still have
another year
on my lease.

612
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,256
Run it by your husband,
maybe he'll wanna treat you.

613
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:16,758
Okay, maybe i will.

614
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:18,259
Thank yo
u for calling.

615
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,260
Okay, bye.

616
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:20,762
Hope to see ya.

617
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:21,763
Buh- bye.

618
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:26,267
What a nice woman.

619
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:27,769
Who?

620
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:31,272
Just some saleswom
an from globe motors.

621
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,779
What?

622
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:40,281
She wants me to test drive
the new e- series wagon.

623
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:41,783
And i'm not
interested,

624
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:43,785
but she was awfully
nice to me the other day.

625
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:46,788
She gave me a
ride home while th
ey serviced the wagon.

626
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:49,791
But i really should
hold onto it for anoth
er year, don't you think?

627
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:53,294
Another year...

628
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:55,296
yeah.

629
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,309
I was just wondering
if we could
switch days off.

630
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,311
Just give me a minute,
could you, martin?

631
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:12,313
I just thought--

632
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:14,315
yeah, yeah, sure,
i just got a custo
mer coming in, alright?

633
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:15,316
Tony.

634
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:23,324
Don't you fuckin'
"tony" me.

635
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:25,326
Are you out of your fucking
mind talking to my wife?

636
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,829
I was upset about your
ex- girlfriend, alright?

637
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:28,830
"Poor, confused kid",

638
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,331
i thought you should
see my version.

639
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:35,837
I'm sorry,
alright?

640
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,338
You drove her home.

641
00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:38,840
What the fuck?

642
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,342
Then you look right
into my eyes and
you don't tell me?

643
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:45,346
Alright, it's
just normal

644
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,849
to be curious abou
t someone that you love's

645
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,350
significant others.

646
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,853
No, it's not, it's
fuckin' twisted.

647
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:52,854
No, it is not.

648
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,355
Look, i don't wa
nt to argue with you.

649
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,857
You're upset
, and i understand

650
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:57,859
it's on the margin
s for someone like you

651
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,362
and i'm sorry and it'll
never happen again, ever.

652
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:02,864
No shit.

653
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:07,869
Now you can tell
your shrink you ruined
eight relationships.

654
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,371
What do you mean?

655
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,373
It's fucking over.

656
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:14,876
Tony!

657
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:17,879
You see, tuesday
i can take my
kid to hear raffi.

658
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,383
Left ovary....

659
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,391
right ovary.

660
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,895
Just tell me right
out, dr. Rotelli.

661
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:35,396
Don't mince words.

662
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:37,398
I really did not
feel comfortable

663
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:38,900
with everybody
knowing my personal life.

664
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,401
Where's this
asshole now?

665
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,402
What'd he have,
like one song?

666
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:43,905
What are you doing?

667
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,907
We should be out
doing what we gotta do.

668
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:47,408
Call carlo, tell him
to bring his shit.

669
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:49,410
Who the fuck was
feech lamanna anyways?

670
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,912
You know what?
Don't come.

671
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:53,915
You want to spend
the rest of your life
with your head up your ass,

672
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,917
be my guest.

673
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,421
How's your
calimar' salad?

674
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,424
I don't think he's using
the right olive oil.

675
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,928
You haven't said
two words, carmela.

676
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:08,429
I'm sorry.

677
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,433
I just came from
dr. Rotelli's.

678
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,435
Oh, my god, is
everything alright?

679
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:15,937
Apparently i've
never been better.

680
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,939
Just a lit
tle thyroid thing.

681
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:18,940
Thank god.

682
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,441
I thought i
was pregnant.

683
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,943
Bite your tongue!

684
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:22,944
At our age?

685
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,445
I don't know,

686
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:26,447
with the kids
growing up
and everything.

687
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,449
What i'd give to
have a grandchild.

688
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,952
Terry and her husband
are trying again, but...

689
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,453
speaking of grandkids

690
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,455
i am just sick about
jackie and meadow.

691
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,957
I asked him
what happened,

692
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,458
he tells me to mind
my own business.

693
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,460
So does she in
so many words.

694
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,962
They broke up?

695
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:42,964
Is meadow okay?

696
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:45,466
Oh, please, that
girl is so differe
nt than i was at her age.

697
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:46,968
It just rolls
off her back.

698
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,970
There's no weight loss,
no sleepless nights.

699
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,472
Not like the grief we go
through with our husbands.

700
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:53,474
That's'cause we married
these walyos.

701
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:54,976
It's not just us.

702
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,979
The president
of the united states,
for crying out loud.

703
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,981
Look what his wife
had to put up with,

704
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:01,983
with the blow jobs
and the stained dress.

705
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:02,984
Hillary clinton?

706
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,986
I can't stand
that woman.

707
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,487
I don't know.

708
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,989
Maybe we could
all take a page
from her book.

709
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:09,490
What, to be
humiliated in public

710
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,492
and then walk around
smiling all the time?

711
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:12,994
That is so false.

712
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:14,996
I would dig a hole,
i would climb into it

713
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:16,497
and i would
not come out.

714
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,499
All i know is,
she stuck by him

715
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:19,500
and put up with
the bullshit,

716
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,003
and in the end,
what did she do?

717
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,005
She set up her
own little thing.

718
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,506
She did.

719
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,508
She took all that
negative shit he gaveher

720
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,010
and spun it
into gold.

721
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,511
You gotta
give her credit.

722
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:33,514
That's true,
isn't it?

723
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:37,518
She's a role model
for all of us.

724
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,826
The case is
still pending.

725
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:47,328
They could try me on a
simple mail and wire fraud

726
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:48,830
but they're holding out,

727
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,332
they'd rather fold i
t into a major rico.

728
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:53,835
Tony,
line two.

729
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,837
Who is it?

730
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:57,338
I don't know,
it's a woman.

731
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,841
I think
she's crying.

732
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:04,846
Let me get
back to you.

733
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:12,854
Hello?

734
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,356
Tony?

735
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,368
I don't know...

736
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,370
i don't know...

737
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,872
i can't understand you.

738
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:32,373
I don't know what
you're trying to say.

739
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:35,376
I can't take
it anymore.

740
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,880
...stay...

741
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,883
i don't know why...

742
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:48,890
tony...

743
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,891
tony.

744
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,407
Thanks for coming.

745
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:07,909
Alright.

746
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,913
You want
something to drink?

747
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:12,914
No.

748
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:18,920
I'm sorry.

749
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,922
There's no one else
i can talk to.

750
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:24,425
What about him?

751
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,928
Laugh if you want,
he does help.

752
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:28,930
Yeah, he's a regular
captain marvel.

753
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:36,437
I just want it to
be the way it was.

754
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:39,440
I love you.

755
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,942
Stop it,
gloria.

756
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,443
I'm sorry,
i'm sorry.

757
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:44,445
Quit fuckin' crying,
i can't stand it.

758
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,947
I want to be
with you.

759
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,448
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

760
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,451
I know.

761
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:54,455
I know.

762
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:56,958
My life's a
trip to nowhere.

763
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,961
You bring it
on yourself.

764
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,965
You're a beautiful,

765
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,967
talented woman...

766
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:09,470
but...

767
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,472
you push a man away.

768
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:13,474
It's not gonna
happen again.

769
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:14,976
The other night
with the tires,

770
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:16,477
i'm a grown man.

771
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,479
I've had other women.

772
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,982
You think i
lived in a freezer
before i met you?

773
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:21,983
Fine.

774
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,484
I'll sit back
like a mute

775
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:25,486
while you screw
every woman out there.

776
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,989
See, there's
that tone again.

777
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,993
Look...

778
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:34,996
it's over.

779
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,999
We had our

780
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:40,001
amour fou
or whatever.

781
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,004
And it was great.

782
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:48,509
And now it's t
ime to put it to bed.

783
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,513
What'd you think

784
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:55,516
that you could treat me
like some stupid fucking

785
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,018
goombah housewife?

786
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:00,021
You think i'm gonna
let some fucker
shit all over me

787
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,522
just'cause he buys me

788
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,025
some ridiculous
gaudy fucking ring?

789
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,528
Where the fuck
do you get off?

790
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:09,030
You don't care.

791
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,032
You think you're the
only one with problems?

792
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:13,034
You think my life's
a fuckin' picnic?

793
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:15,536
Oh, poor you.

794
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,044
You got a fuckin' dream
life compared to mine.

795
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,047
Nobody cares if
i'm alive or dead!

796
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:30,051
I didn't
just meet you.

797
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:34,055
I've known you my
whole fuckin' life.

798
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:35,556
That's right.

799
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:38,059
Take a dump wherever
you please and then
just walk away.

800
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,062
My mother was
just like you.

801
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,564
Bottomless
black hole.

802
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,067
Oh, the mother now.

803
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,069
I surrender.

804
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,571
Burn me at
the stake.

805
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:52,573
You know what?

806
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:56,577
You're fuckin' crazy.

807
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:59,080
All i ever asked
for was kindness.

808
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,082
C'mere, c'mere.

809
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:04,085
You listen to me and
you listen to me good.

810
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,087
No more call
s, no more nothing.

811
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,588
You see me, you
cross the street.

812
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,090
'Cause you'r
e a dangerous fuck

813
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,592
and i don't want
you in my life.

814
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,094
Don't go,
don't go!

815
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:15,096
I'll call your wife!

816
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:19,100
What'd you say?

817
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,103
I'll go to columbia,

818
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,605
i'll tell your
daughter about us.

819
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:29,110
C'mon!

820
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,116
C'mere, c'mere.

821
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,127
Now, you
listen to me...

822
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:48,629
you go near my
wife or my family

823
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,132
and i'll fuckin' kill
you, you understand me?

824
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,633
I'll fuckin'
kill you.

825
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,135
Go ahead,
kill me.

826
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,636
Kill me.

827
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:58,139
Kill me.

828
00:40:58,139 --> 00:40:59,640
You fucking bitch!

829
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,142
Kill me.

830
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:03,144
Kill me,
kill me.

831
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,145
Kill me.

832
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:09,150
Kill me, kill me
, kill me, kill me...

833
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,652
kill me.

834
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:13,654
Kill me.

835
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,678
Alright,
this is it.

836
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:41,182
I don't care if god comes by,
you don't move this car.

837
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:43,184
When we go in,
you do the talking.

838
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:44,185
Me?

839
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:46,187
I know eugene, he'll
recognize my voice.

840
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:48,189
Don't worry
about it.

841
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:50,691
When they see this
motherfucker, nobody'l
l have to say a word.

842
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,693
What's the matter?

843
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,197
I don't know.

844
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,201
You sure you
wanna do this?

845
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,202
Why?

846
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:02,703
Don't you?

847
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:07,208
Fuck it, let's go
down the shore.

848
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:15,716
Let's do it
before the crank
wears off.

849
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,722
Ace,
high flush.

850
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:22,723
Flush talks.

851
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:25,226
Anybody
want a drink?

852
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:29,230
Nobody fuckin' move!

853
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,734
Just take it
easy, alright?

854
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:34,735
Shit.

855
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:36,237
Shut the fuck up!

856
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:38,239
Empty your pockets,
all of you!

857
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,241
C'mon!

858
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:42,743
Very bad, boys,
very bad.

859
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:44,245
This is a
low- level game, guys.

860
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,247
The only thing you're gonn
a get around here is practice.

861
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:48,249
You heard what he said,
shut the fuck up!

862
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:49,750
Take it ea
sy, take it easy!

863
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,253
You guys know who
you're robbin'?

864
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,255
Gimme your watch.

865
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:55,756
Remember the
old adage son.

866
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:57,258
Leave'em while
you're looking good.

867
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:58,759
Just give it to
him, sunshine.

868
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:01,262
Victory has
a hundred fathers

869
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,264
but defeat
is an orphan.

870
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:04,265
Shut up, shut up!

871
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:06,267
Stop fucking
looking at me!

872
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,768
Come on, hurry up!

873
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:09,270
Let's get the
fuck outta here!

874
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,781
If you can keep your head
while those around you can't--

875
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,760
where the
fuck is he?

876
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,261
Shit.

877
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,263
Shit, c'mon!

878
00:43:58,268 --> 00:43:59,770
Get the fuck out!

879
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,772
Oh, my god!

880
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,280
Jackie!

881
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,783
Jackie,
jackie!

882
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,786
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

883
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,788
Hey, cocksucker.

884
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,294
Chris, please,

885
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,296
we didn't kn
ow you were in there.

886
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,298
We're with ralphie.

887
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,800
Please?

888
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,822
If you're one of
the thousands of men

889
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,824
who suffer from
erectile dysfunction,

890
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,326
you already know that
it's no laughing matter.

891
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,328
What you probably
don't know, however,

892
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,831
is that treatment is covered
by most medical plans--

893
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,332
dr. Frei
d, i'm sorry,

894
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,835
your service s
aid it was an emergency.

895
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:07,838
Hello?

896
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,341
Jesus christ.

897
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,343
Not again, tony.

898
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,345
I can't keep
doing this.

899
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,848
I'm in the middle of--

900
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,350
can't he go to
the emergency room?

901
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,353
I thought he
had a green card.

902
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,857
Manadgia la
putana fragita!

903
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,859
Will you s
hut the fuck up?

904
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,360
You're gonna m
ake him hit an artery.

905
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,863
Just try and relax, let
the sedative do its job.

906
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,365
You should thank
god they didn't
hit nothing important.

907
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,368
This fucking prick
is really a doctor?

908
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,870
Close, i'm a
prick doctor.

909
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,371
Get it?

910
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,373
While you're here
maybe he can give
you a bulge.

911
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,876
Doc, see if you
can remove this
ladies underwear.

912
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,377
Ah!

913
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,880
You're gon
na be alright.

914
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,889
That little
motherfucker.

915
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,891
He's goin', tony,
he's goin' big time.

916
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,392
You sure i
t was jackie jr.?

917
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,894
I find him, i'm
doing him tonight.

918
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,895
No, you're not.

919
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:05,896
Why not?

920
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:06,897
'Cause i saidso.

921
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,398
Why?

922
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,900
I don't gotta explain
anything to you.

923
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,902
Because he's
jackie aprile's kid?

924
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,404
You're not gonna
let this go, you
can't do that!

925
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,407
He took a shot at me,
he tried to kill furio!

926
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,408
We're made!

927
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,410
Every person you whack
, you risk exposure.

928
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,413
Major murder,
that's what the fe
ds ask for christmas.

929
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,416
Bullshit, you're a
fuckin' hypocrite.

930
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,418
What the f
uck did you say?

931
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,420
You preach all
this wiseguy shit

932
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,423
and meanwhile
the only ones who gotta
play by the rules are us!

933
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,926
I loved you!

934
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,428
What happens i
decide, not you.

935
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,931
You don't love me anymore,
well, that breaks my heart.

936
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,433
But it's too fuckin' bad
, 'cause don't gotta love me.

937
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,936
But you wi
ll respect me.

938
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,459
Ralph cifaretto's here.

939
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,462
What'd we say?

940
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:25,976
Ton'.

941
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,477
How you doing?

942
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,480
It's terrible, huh?

943
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,482
Ro's going nut
s over this.

944
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,485
She knows he hangs around
with this punk dino
and the other one.

945
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,987
Any word
from her son?

946
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,488
No.

947
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,491
Alright, c'mon.

948
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,498
This kid...

949
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,502
he did a
terrible thing.

950
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,503
Terrible.

951
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,007
Your fucking
card game.

952
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,509
I know how close
you are to the family.

953
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,011
I feel for you.

954
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,513
You're living
under the same roof.

955
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,515
And it was
my card game.

956
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,519
But, what
happened to sunshine,

957
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,521
it's a disgrace.

958
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,028
But, tell you
the truth, tony...

959
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,033
i wanna give
the kid a pass.

960
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,036
Yeah?

961
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,537
That's just me, though.

962
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,541
I know you got bigger
concerns, you're the boss.

963
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,544
I'll make sure
your orders are done,

964
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,546
whatever they maybe.

965
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,549
I think you should go with
your instincts on this, ralph.

966
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,552
You do?

967
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:47,057
But furio took a
hit and chris.

968
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,059
These are made men.

969
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,562
I'll make sure they
respect your decision.

970
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,065
'Cause i'm sure you're
gonna do the right thing.

971
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,069
That's why
i made you captain.

972
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,074
This is
rosalie's kid.

973
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,580
That's why i'll understand
if you wanna give him a pass

974
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,083
and i'm sure everybody
else will too.

975
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,086
And who cares
about shit they say

976
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,588
they don't have the balls
to say to your face?

977
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,095
The kid
disrespected you.

978
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,600
But they don't have to live
with your commitments.

979
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,607
And hey, your decision
goes the other way,

980
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,610
the one thing you
cannot do, ralph,

981
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,612
you cannot do,

982
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,615
is blame yourself.

983
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,118
You took this kid
under your wing.

984
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,621
You schooled him
as best you could.

985
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,624
Didn't you?

986
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,132
Jack spoiled him.

987
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,635
I think
this is yours.

988
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,640
Stupid kid was carrying it
around during the holidays.

989
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,181
She wanted me to
fucking kill her.

990
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,184
Like suicide by cop.

991
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,186
So, she
set me up?

992
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,688
From the beginning
gloria saw me

993
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,690
as only a
fuckin' hammer?

994
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,192
She loved you.

995
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:06,696
She looked so good, too,
that day in your office.

996
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,202
Just another irina
with a college degree.

997
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,204
Ask yourself.

998
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,207
How did you
recognize in gloria,

999
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,210
underneath all her
layers of sophistication,

1000
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,713
this deeply wounded,
angry being

1001
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,716
that would let you
replicate once again

1002
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:29,219
your relationship
with your mother.

1003
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,221
I don't want t
o fuck my mother.

1004
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,223
I don't give a shit
what you say.

1005
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,224
You're never
gonna convince me.

1006
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:35,725
Not fuck.

1007
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,727
Try to please her,

1008
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,729
try to win
her love.

1009
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,731
I'm 40 fuckin'
years old.

1010
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,234
We need to repeat
what's familiar

1011
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,236
even if it's
bad for us.

1012
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:49,239
Gloria's need
for drama,

1013
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,741
the selfishness,

1014
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,245
the incessant
self regard.

1015
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:58,248
At one time, in
your mother's hands,

1016
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,750
it passed for love.

1017
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,253
Alright, look,
you're her doctor,

1018
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,754
you tell me,

1019
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,257
do i gotta wor
ry about this broad?

1020
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:10,260
She says she's gon
na tell carmela about us.

1021
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,263
I honestly
can't predict.

1022
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,267
But i think we
should deal with

1023
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,269
why are you
so attracted

1024
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,771
to dangerous
relationships?

1025
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,774
Why do you put
your marriage in
such danger?

1026
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,277
Maybe i'm lookin
g for a way out.

1027
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,279
You ever
think of that?

1028
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,780
Anthony,

1029
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,782
you'll never
leave your wife.

1030
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:33,783
Bullshit.

1031
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,285
There's a limit
to how much shit--

1032
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,786
she might leave you,

1033
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,289
but you'll
never leave her.

1034
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,791
Despite your mothering,

1035
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,795
you made one good
decision in your life

1036
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,297
vis- a- vis women,

1037
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,300
you're not gonna
throw that over.

1038
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,803
Your own selfishness is
too strong to let that happen.

1039
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,806
Alright,
alright.

1040
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:57,807
Actually,

1041
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,809
in spite of everything,

1042
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,811
you're a very
conventional man.

1043
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,314
I said alright.

1044
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,816
We have to
stop now.

1045
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,831
Got pep, i'll
give it that.

1046
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,334
Zero to 60, in under
seven seconds.

1047
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,347
What's the matter,
you don't like me?

1048
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,354
Look, i'm not back
in 10 minutes,
they call the cops.

1049
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,356
Standard
operating procedure.

1050
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,858
Here's some standard
operating procedure.

1051
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,361
Stay the fuck aw
ay from tony soprano.

1052
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,364
Shut the fuck
up and listen.

1053
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,366
It's over, capisce?

1054
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,368
Over and done.

1055
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:02,372
You call or go anywher
e near him or his family

1056
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,874
and they'll be
scraping your nipples

1057
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,377
off these fi
ne leather seats.

1058
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,879
And here's the
point to remember,

1059
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,882
my face is the last
one you'll see,

1060
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,885
not tony's.

1061
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,887
We understan
d each other?

1062
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,890
It won't be
cinematic.

1063
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,415
Any word,
anything?

1064
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,418
He probably went
down to florida.

1065
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,421
Ro, i'm sure
he's fine.

1066
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,424
Ro, c'mon.

1067
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,928
Sit down.

1068
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,440
Look, um...

1069
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,443
this is gonna be
hard for you to hear.

1070
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,445
Oh, jesus christ!

1071
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,448
It's okay,
it's just...

1072
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,453
he's has a
very serious
drug problem.

1073
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,454
What?

1074
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,457
It's coke.

1075
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,460
He may owe some
money to dealers,

1076
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,961
something.

1077
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,963
Oh, my god.

1078
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,965
I didn't want to
tell you this.

1079
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,967
Look, we're doing
everything we can.

1080
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,975
Look, we're gonna
find him,

1081
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,977
we'll get him help.

1082
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,979
We'll get him
into rehab.

1083
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,985
Let's just hope
he's not too far gone.

1084
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,513
It smells good.

1085
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,517
Lemon snaps for the
bake sale at church.

1086
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,530
You look good.

1087
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,534
I went to
step today.

1088
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,036
Is that why you don't have any
of these looney- tune moods?

1089
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,038
Exercise?

1090
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,043
Where's your ring?

1091
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,551
I had to bring it in
to get it sized,
it's a little big.

1092
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,575
Hi, it's me.

1093
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:29,078
I'll be home in
about 20 minutes.

1094
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:33,082
Yeah, i picked u
p the stuffed shells.

1095
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:36,085
No, the celantano's,
you just gotta heat'em up.
