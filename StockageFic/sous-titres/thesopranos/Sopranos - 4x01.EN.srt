1
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,426
"Italy was relieved today upon learning...

2
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,962
"that the country's high court had ruled
that influence peddling is not a crime.

3
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,378
"Said Franco Ferrarotti,
an Italian sociologist:

4
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,815
"'Essentially, the judges are saying
what everybody believes. '

5
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,544
"He was referring to raccomendazione...

6
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,881
"the Italian custom of seeking
special treatment from people in power.

7
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,959
"'This is our version of the Protestant ethic, '
Mr. Ferrarotti said.

8
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,597
"The case concerned a clerk of a civil court
in Potenza...

9
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,066
"who was jailed for promising
to speed up someone's trial.

10
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,296
"Evidence showed that
he received 88 pounds of fish...

11
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,602
"in return for his assistance."

12
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,300
Hello.

13
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah, she's here.

14
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,078
She's on duty today.

15
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,614
The same, undercover.

16
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,446
Yeah, let me have her call you back.

17
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,456
Deb, it was your mom.

18
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,807
You're complaining about
your paper on ethnicity.

19
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,370
Here's some interesting stuff
from your own background.

20
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,882
We're from Potenza?

21
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,411
I thought we were
Napoli- Daboli or whatever.

22
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,421
Neapolitan. But this
is about Italy as a whole.

23
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,693
Did the squirrels eat the bread I put out
for the ducks, or somebody sweep it up?

24
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,128
I do know that Meadow stepped
in some soggy bread with her bare feet.

25
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,927
You should've heard it.

26
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,233
What's that?

27
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,572
This is the New York Times that your friend
here has delivered to him at school...

28
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,575
for his Social Studies requirement,
then he doesn't read them.

29
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,840
- I find them piled in his room.
- Make a go of it at that new school.

30
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,244
You got no idea
what we did to get you in there.

31
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,443
There is no reason you shouldn't
be able to pass Social Studies.

32
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,418
You passing Social Studies?

33
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,050
You just revealed your own ignorance.

34
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,717
It's only been five days.
We didn't get grades yet.

35
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,887
I what? I revealed my own what?

36
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,737
Look at that.

37
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,071
Now, he's reading.

38
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,381
- Hey, everybody.
- Where's Furio?

39
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,857
How you doing, Ton'?

40
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,828
A. J. , finish getting dressed.

41
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,495
- You want some coffee?
- No.

42
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,933
- Has Furio got that bug again?
- Tony likes to mix it up, you know.

43
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,129
Different cars.

44
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,867
What, the Caprice?

45
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,273
No, he's turning off.

46
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,771
Take me to my uncle's doctor.

47
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,948
Furio called me.
He's going to the fucking track today.

48
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,446
- So what about it?
- I don't know.

49
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,184
I'm driving again, all of a sudden.

50
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,920
So what? I gotta explain
why I want you with me this week?

51
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,394
- God forbid you'd explain.
- That's right.

52
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,525
- Now you're gonna get fresh about it?
- I'm just saying, I mean, I'm glad to do it.

53
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,398
I'm glad you're glad.

54
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,603
You know, your father was
like a mentor to me.

55
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,477
- Right.
- A standup.

56
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,782
You ask anybody.
Your old man was a legend.

57
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,345
He single- handedly hunted down
that New England crew.

58
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,150
Brought the war home to them up there.

59
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,251
Another Chevy.

60
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,792
Nuns.

61
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,162
Might be undercover Feds, but I doubt it.

62
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,513
He must be colicky.

63
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,417
I think he likes your hair better that way.

64
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,491
Mr. Soprano.

65
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,397
There she is.

66
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,769
- You be good now, don't start.
- You ought to see my finish.

67
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,874
You get sued for talk like that nowadays.

68
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,378
Then cancel my appointment.
Let me die now.

69
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,415
If a man can't voice to a beautiful woman...

70
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,575
the zephyrs that are blowing
through his mind--

71
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,209
God, listen to him today.

72
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,050
Go in there now,
and strip down to your shorts.

73
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,653
You see now? I'm not gonna touch that line.
Too much class.

74
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,496
- But as for that lovely laugh line--
- Come on, handsome, we're busy.

75
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,896
Give me that cheek, right here.

76
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,195
- I surrender, do with me what you will.
- Okay.

77
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,466
The doctor will be with you both.

78
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,742
So, what'd you wanna see me about?

79
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,878
- My trial starts a week from Tuesday.
- You'll beat it.

80
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,387
- Melvoin's good.
- We have to change our arrangement.

81
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,065
Which arrangement is that?

82
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,498
These fucking lawyers
are taking my internal organs.

83
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,935
$1 million for this trial,
Melvoin and Hirshorn are charging.

84
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,006
And that was bad enough.

85
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,865
Now they put this Harvard kid on,
this lackey.

86
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,535
I don't know what the fuck he does.

87
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,207
And then they just decided
we needed audibility experts to testify...

88
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:40,412
you can't definitively state what people
are saying on the government tapes.

89
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,415
I could fucking tell them that.

90
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,252
Those guys,
they got sound graphs and shit.

91
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,656
$50, 000, the cocksuckers are charging.

92
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,458
Plus the minimization expert,
plus the fucking monthly expenses.

93
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,997
Fucking lexis fees, the Xeroxing.

94
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,697
An entire Northwest forest
must've given its life in Xerox paper...

95
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,169
for this one fucking trial.

96
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,729
I said to Mel,
"Can't we just at one fucking meeting...

97
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,367
"all read from the same sheet of paper,
pass it around?"

98
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,138
Our split stays the same.

99
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,113
You kept me in place as boss
to take the heat off you.

100
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,885
My legal problems have let you
go around like a gabavreche...

101
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,923
- two fucking years now.
- There you go.

102
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,979
Ten points.

103
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,123
I got medical bills, too, Anthony.

104
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,128
I got cash flow problems of my own.

105
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,393
A one- time hit, $50, 000, $75, 000
to cover the audibility expert.

106
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,365
I got two kids in private schools.

107
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,902
Goddamn it!

108
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,701
Get your shy running right.
That's what you should be focused on.

109
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:52,488
Would you like to try some kielbasa?
Kentshire farms. Nitrate- free.

110
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,499
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I like Versace's dinnerware...

111
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,866
but stamping your face
on every plate....The ego!

112
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,298
Look who's here.

113
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,039
My God, what are you doing home?

114
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,849
- I got to get this out to my car.
- Is that for us?

115
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,452
You're in a good mood.

116
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,381
Want me to fix you a plate?

117
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,350
Will you shut that pocket rat up?

118
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,054
- You wanna say hello to Danielle?
- Not really.

119
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,259
- I should go, anyhow.
- Enjoy your wine.

120
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,169
- Don't listen to his bullshit.
- I got to get up early tomorrow.

121
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,137
- No matter how much the john offers you?
- Pig.

122
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,236
This is beautiful.

123
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,975
- Where'd you get it?
- You said you were gonna go. Go.

124
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,916
- I got to get some sleep.
- I should go.

125
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,719
Froze to death in that mall today.
They go crazy with the air- conditioning.

126
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,161
- So, when am I gonna see you again?
- I'll call you.

127
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,758
Okay, sweetie.

128
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,997
Some of those bags look like Gucci.

129
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,231
Yeah, he gets that stuff all the time.
His cousin's a liquidator.

130
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,771
- Bye.
- See you.

131
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,636
- You are so fucking rude.
- I had a horrible goddamn day.

132
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,647
She's over here all the time lately.

133
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,611
Tony still acting all mean?

134
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,390
- Cosette, quiet.
- Fucking asshole.

135
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,791
Ever since I questioned his judgment
on some Ralphie/Jackie Junior problem.

136
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,627
Like he's fucking infallible.
Pope Tony XXIII or some shit.

137
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,102
And now, of course, he starts in with
my father so I can be compared all negative.

138
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,734
You never know, I could
be on the endangered species list.

139
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,069
Chrissy.

140
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,034
Gonna get high?

141
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,739
Maybe I'll just smoke some.

142
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,042
That's more addictive than shooting.

143
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,552
I don't do it every fucking day now,
like some people.

144
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,048
I'm just chipping, I got it under control.

145
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,223
Chrissy, Tony loves you.

146
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,727
Why would he have you made
if he didn't depend on you?

147
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,257
He can depend on me.

148
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,325
When the fuck have
I ever not been there 100 percent?

149
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,857
Want some?

150
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,859
Can I talk to you a minute?

151
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,833
Turn this off?

152
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,238
Turn it down.

153
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,772
I'm worried, Tony.

154
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,145
- About my weight?
- About money.

155
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,249
You're getting a little less allowance
than usual. I told you, it's temporary.

156
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,584
Super Bowl last year,
we didn't lay enough off.

157
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,146
No, it's not just that.

158
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,624
I'm worried about you, about the future...

159
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,059
about me and the kids,
if something happens to you.

160
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,393
- I don't provide for you?
- Now.

161
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,300
I saw Angie Bonpensiero today.

162
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,134
She was handing out
free Polish sausage at the supermarket.

163
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,197
Don't start. I supported her.
You're so worried about the money.

164
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,708
Who is gonna support
your children and me...

165
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,642
if, God forbid, something happens to you?

166
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,146
That's the point. Sil? Paulie?

167
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,617
- That is frightening.
- You'll be taken care of.

168
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,762
You're set in perpetuity.
There's money in overseas accounts.

169
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,302
I don't have the serial numbers.

170
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,100
You'll have them when the time comes.
Not now.

171
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,074
For your own benefit.
So you're not an accomplice.

172
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,273
Jesus Christ, I been busting
my pick all day long...

173
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,579
to bring home the money
you're so concerned about.

174
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,519
I thought maybe I could have a sundae
and zone out in front of the frigging TV.

175
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,024
Because, A: you're right,
my job is extremely stressful....

176
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:01,089
I am talking about some
simple estate planning, Tony, that's all.

177
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,870
My cousin, Brian Cammarata, has helped
lots of people set up trusts for their kids...

178
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,132
- begin asset allocation--
- I got to spell this out for you?

179
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,733
I can't declare X amount of my income.

180
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,540
Your consulting fees
from Barone Sanitation you do.

181
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,605
We file a tax return
to justify the house, the cars.

182
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,379
We could put aside some of that
to start a portfolio.

183
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,510
Stocks?

184
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,647
You gotta be high in the
corporate structure to make that work.

185
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,317
We don't have
those Enron- type connections.

186
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,949
Bonds, then.

187
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,758
There are these things called "RElTs"
Brian told me about.

188
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,661
Bonds, where's the capital for that?

189
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,292
In the Caymans or under the mattress...

190
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,393
or wherever you put it at zero growth.

191
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,938
The money stays put.
With what's going on globally....

192
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,839
- There's always some excuse.
- There's no cash in this house.

193
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,843
Not since our last bust.

194
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,344
Check the vents.

195
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,682
- And I provide for my children.
- Yes, Tony, you do.

196
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,713
But I don't know how you do it,
because you won't tell me.

197
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,950
Let me tell you something,
or you can watch the fucking news:

198
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,718
Everything comes to an end.

199
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,892
Good morning, Ton'.

200
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,833
- They over there?
- I was able to reach everybody.

201
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,770
What the fuck are you doing?

202
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,541
- What?
- You're wasting fucking ice.

203
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,481
- It's mostly melted.
- You're fucking arguing with me now?

204
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,540
No, Ton'.

205
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,213
You don't see the monthly statements.
We're hemorrhaging money out of here.

206
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,484
No, you're right, I don't.

207
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,324
- Think that shit grows on trees?
- Ice? No, I don't.

208
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,195
- Are you getting cute with me?
- No.

209
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,098
I think you are.
You're getting a fucking attitude on you.

210
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,362
I'm not.

211
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,875
- Ice, when it hangs around--
- Georgie, be quiet.

212
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,575
But it gets watery. It dilutes the drinks...

213
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,047
- especially Scotch.
- Jesus Christ.

214
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,508
Here, throw it all away.

215
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,555
Waste it all, fucking John D. Rockefeller!
Waste it all!

216
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,824
Conserve.

217
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,138
Where were you?

218
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,387
I wanna know why there's zero growth
in this family's receipts.

219
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,261
Where's the fucking money?

220
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,067
You're supposed to be earners.
That's why you got the top- tier positions.

221
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,538
So, everyone, go out to your people
on the street, crack some heads.

222
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,837
Create some fucking earners out there.

223
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,710
The guy....

224
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,241
We talked about this,
over at the other place with the guy.

225
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,421
The councilman.
What the fuck happened to that?

226
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,452
- It petered out.
- "It petered out."

227
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,993
- It died on the vine.
- "It died on the vine."

228
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,224
It died on the vine.
The guy, he moved or something.

229
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,926
Nobody knows
what the fuck I'm talking about!

230
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,637
We hear you.

231
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,244
My uncle...

232
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,278
the boss of this family...

233
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,374
is on trial for his life.

234
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,385
And what you people are
kicking up to him is a fucking disgrace.

235
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,722
You know how much lawyers cost?

236
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,259
A major RICO like his,
I'm the only one supporting him.

237
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,391
This thing is a pyramid,
since time immemorial.

238
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,133
Shit runs downhill, money goes up.
It's that simple.

239
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,971
I should not have to be coming here...

240
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,697
hat in my hand...

241
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,934
reminding you about your duty to that man.

242
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,716
And I don't wanna hear about
the fucking economy either!

243
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,944
Sil, break it down for them.

244
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,146
What two businesses have traditionally
been recession proof...

245
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,815
since time immemorial?

246
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,960
Certain aspects of show business,
and our thing.

247
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,429
Now, that's it, that's all I got to say.

248
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,796
Frankly, I'm depressed and ashamed.

249
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,408
Is that what your coach laid out for you
as a training breakfast?

250
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,353
The shelf in the garage is still loose.

251
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,729
You went down in the garage?
I'm gonna go check it out.

252
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,995
You said you'd wake up early,
come to church with me...

253
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,132
then go online and register for your classes.

254
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,040
I'll miss Grandma and Grandpa at dinner.

255
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,408
There's a back- to- school party for Hadley.

256
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,568
These boring Sunday dinners.

257
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,102
Can one of my new friends eat over?

258
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:18,074
Aunt Ro and Uncle Ralph will be here, too,
but I'm sure we can fit.

259
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,873
- You're not gonna lay out, Dad?
- It's too cold.

260
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,545
Ralphie and Ro are coming out here today?

261
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,480
I thought we got that straightened out
months ago.

262
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,179
And it's not "Uncle Ralph."

263
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,815
I asked you about inviting them
the other night, and you said....

264
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,086
I must've been focused on something else.

265
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,995
It's Ro's birthday, and she's very down.

266
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,834
Anthony.

267
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,768
I ever tell you about the time I had a Harley?

268
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,210
- Whoa, cool.
- '74 Shovelhead.

269
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,076
- I could blow off Porsches on that thing.
- Not my dad's Boxster.

270
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,675
- What's your name?
- Matt.

271
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,888
Matt, no offense, but your dad's
Boxster is a Porsche with panties.

272
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,783
He knows what I'm saying.

273
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,327
I mean, that's for the Hamptons, the Boxster.

274
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,522
I'm talking Turbo Carrera.

275
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,131
One time, I'm alongside this Turbo
with doctor plates.

276
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,237
We come off the line,
he's got this big Jew grin.

277
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,737
You're not Jewish are you?

278
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,036
- Half.
- Anyway, he knows it's all in fun.

279
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,702
At the Passaic Avenue
and New Dutch Lane intersection...

280
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,940
we're doing 1 10. Boom!
Right through the light.

281
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,047
He wasn't grinning then, boy.

282
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,880
I look back. He's white as false teeth.

283
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,549
Jason Mingelli's parents
let him get a YZ- 250.

284
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:42,524
You get on that bike, I will cut
your legs off before the bike does.

285
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:46,587
- I had the high handlebars, you know.
- Bruce Dern, don't you have to go?

286
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,997
I got to hit the little boy's room.

287
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,201
You guys need some help?

288
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,365
In my day, there was a motorcycle
called the Vincent Black Shadow.

289
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,871
- Boy, did that thing take off.
- The hoods all drove those.

290
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,072
They beat you up that time,
you remember, on City Island?

291
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,877
He'd just gotten out of the Navy.
I think he weighed 105 pounds.

292
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,643
Did you see any action
in World War II, Hugh?

293
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,746
A little bit. I was stationed in Nova Scotia.

294
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,959
But I caught diverticulitis.
It's the weight loss she's talking about.

295
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,188
Oh, my God, you're eating, I'm so sorry.

296
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,857
- Don't worry about it, come in.
- You want something?

297
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,365
No, my God, thank you.

298
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,926
I just came over to borrow the samovar
for my cousin's baby shower.

299
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:31,074
This is my friend, Danielle Ciccolella.
This is Christopher's cousin Tony.

300
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,701
- Tony.
- How you doing?

301
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,072
His cousin Carmela.

302
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,414
- This is a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

303
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,979
Where you from, Danielle?

304
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,046
- Whippany.
- Want some anisette?

305
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,556
No, thanks.

306
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,388
This thing needs polishing.

307
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,657
- There's a bathroom downstairs.
- It's me, Janice.

308
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,760
- There's a bathroom downstairs.
- I know.

309
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:06,966
What?

310
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,906
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

311
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,406
Come on.

312
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,882
I knew it.

313
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,181
Go ahead, you can do that.

314
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,392
How's Ro doing down there?

315
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,988
Very quiet, you know, it's to be expected.

316
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,129
They got her on medication.
I don't think it's helping.

317
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,467
"Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!"

318
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,033
Danielle, did you see the loggia?

319
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,869
That loggia was my daughter's idea.

320
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,777
Nice?

321
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,678
Danielle, come check this out.

322
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,116
Come on.

323
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,321
What are you doing to me here?

324
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,509
I was stationed in Nova Scotia.

325
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,210
Well, I told you that.

326
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,950
Anyway, there was nothing for them
to do in Nova Scotia.

327
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,012
Great seafood, but other than that....

328
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,973
That's a lot of cracked corn.

329
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,106
All the ducks,
they've flown south for the winter.

330
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,612
So? I'll be ready for next season.

331
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,043
Thanks.

332
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,111
Red Suburban. I'll be over at Italianissimo.

333
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,522
Good news about the Esplanade.

334
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,361
The legislature's voted to refund the
special Newark development district...

335
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,595
along Frelinghuysen Avenue,
north from the Museum of Trucking.

336
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:14,068
Because of the vote, Omni is gonna
put up a hotel with a galleria...

337
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,437
on the first floor.
Word came down yesterday.

338
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,839
A galleria?

339
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,803
Fifty stores selling
sneakers and turnip greens.

340
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,848
It's a demographic imperative.
Hoboken's maxed out.

341
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,440
Your Prada people are already
moving to Down Neck.

342
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,418
Where are they gonna go next?

343
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,486
My old man had a piece of
the garbage transfer station...

344
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,491
in Lower Manhattan, back in the'70s.

345
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,890
People told him:

346
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,555
"Start buying up
the abandoned buildings around here."

347
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,292
- But he couldn't see it.
- And now it's TriBeCa.

348
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,697
I tell you, Tony...

349
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,226
I'm borrowing money myself to grab up
parcels along Frelinghuysen Ave...

350
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,297
through a shell company.
And a private citizen like you?

351
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,674
Who's gonna quibble
with patriotic entrepreneurism?

352
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,075
My uncle has property
down on Frelinghuysen.

353
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,653
Mr. Soprano.

354
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,355
I remember you

355
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,992
You're the one that
made my dreams come true

356
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,718
a few kisses ago

357
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,784
Oh, boy.

358
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,258
I'm gonna be busy the next couple months.

359
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,395
But after that, what would you say...

360
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,128
me and you...

361
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,370
una bella giornata, to that
city called Atlantic?

362
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,812
I have many dear friends there.
I could show you quite a time.

363
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,872
- Thank you, but I don't gamble.
- With me, it's never a gamble.

364
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,918
You know, today is my last day.

365
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,283
- Where you going?
- Back to school.

366
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,287
Anyway, I'll come say goodbye
when you're done here.

367
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,050
Excuse me.

368
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,623
All the fucking luck.

369
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,663
So, what is it today?

370
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,429
It's becoming clear to me...

371
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,997
Murf can't run my operations
while I'm in court.

372
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,067
He's starting to forget things. His words....

373
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,340
Sometimes there's food on the
front of his shirt, the poor bastard.

374
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,785
I'm gonna move Bobby up.

375
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:12,052
- I think it's a good choice.
- I wasn't asking, I'm telling.

376
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,050
- So you know who to talk to.
- Bobby know yet?

377
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,958
I think we should bring him in here.
He's gonna be a very happy man.

378
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,906
- Thought you were at the beauty parlor.
- I'm going to get the last of the tomatoes.

379
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,486
- Yeah, they were good last night.
- A little late in the season for ducks, no?

380
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:21,155
Not necessarily. The ones from
upper Canada, this is the south to them.

381
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,612
- Speak.
- I have a collect call for Mr. Walters.

382
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,613
Okay, operator.

383
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,080
John?

384
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,749
Right on time.

385
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,321
That's all I got, pal, time.

386
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,727
What the fuck happened out there?

387
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,495
Didn't Tony tell you? Sil?

388
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,961
They mentioned in passing that you were
doing the county book in Youngstown.

389
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,529
Didn't have long to talk.

390
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,100
Hello?

391
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,344
Let me first say,
I can't tell you how touched I was...

392
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,179
when my nephew told me
you wanted me to call.

393
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,378
Anthony only talks to me
through middlemen.

394
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,189
- So, what did they pinch you for?
- Gun charge.

395
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,992
I drove out to visit Lenny Scotise.

396
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,617
Don't know if you know Lenny.

397
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,664
- Him and I used to have that little club--
- Doesn't matter.

398
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,699
Anyway, my first night here...

399
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,895
we drive out to visit
Dean Martin's birthplace in Steubenville.

400
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,734
Cops pull us over for no left blinker.

401
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,969
Long story short,
they find a piece under the seat.

402
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,476
Fucking. 38.

403
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,440
Turns out it was used in an unsolved
murder out here from eight years ago.

404
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,449
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

405
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,875
So what can I do to help?

406
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,545
You're too much. Nothing.

407
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,488
The lawyer said they'll keep us here
as long as they can...

408
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,253
till they make their case,
or unless somebody cops to it.

409
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,555
Keep your dick up.

410
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,621
Well, l....Leave that. Don't touch that,
my program's coming on.

411
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,400
John, love you, babe. Don't let me rot, now.

412
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,077
- Turns out I gotta work tonight.
- I see.

413
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,086
You see what?

414
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,249
You're so concerned about finances...

415
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,552
where do you think it comes from?

416
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,424
Be careful driving home.

417
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,334
There he is!

418
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,301
Here's to Newark's newest hotel.

419
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,641
Anything else with the Esplanade
I should know?

420
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:56,914
No.

421
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,415
It's the girls from Icelandic Air!

422
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,716
Come on in!

423
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,383
Hey, how are you?

424
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,221
All right, let me get the fuck out of here.

425
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,429
How's Junior?

426
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,863
- He's gonna be all right.
- Tell him he's in our prayers, etc.

427
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,164
I'll be sure to let him know.

428
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,668
One other thing, though.

429
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,297
John said he went to a cookout
at your house.

430
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,100
A don doesn't wear shorts.

431
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,272
All right, come on.

432
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,937
Elevator's here.

433
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,410
So where are you girls from?

434
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,476
Reykjavik.

435
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,682
You do and you'll clean it up.

436
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,132
- Christopher!
- Yeah!

437
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,507
Let's go!

438
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,612
What's up, T?

439
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,475
You have a good time tonight?

440
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,913
All right.

441
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,975
Learn anything?

442
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,784
Like what?

443
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,250
Anything.

444
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,247
You had a sit- down with two bosses.

445
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,657
You got a real hard- on for me,
that's all I know.

446
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,458
- You think so?
- It's fucking obvious.

447
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,829
Take the parkway.

448
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,802
You know, for all the things there are
to eat on this island...

449
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,100
breadfruit, mangoes, papayas,
not to mention the fish in the sea...

450
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,001
there's no question about us surviving.
We could go on here for years.

451
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,741
And I mean years.

452
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,078
Where are you going?

453
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,817
Get that.

454
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,952
Hello?

455
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,588
Who did?

456
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,129
They did?

457
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,728
I'll tell him.

458
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,372
Tell me what?

459
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,704
- That was Melvoin.
- So, it was Melvoin.

460
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,577
What the fuck is this, Mother May l?
Go ahead, tell me!

461
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,447
He just had a call from some source of his.

462
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,714
Dr. Schreck's office isn't safe to talk at.

463
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,951
The FBI had an undercover in there
since January.

464
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,623
Or D- day or something.

465
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:33,291
The agent's been pulled
to testify at your trial.

466
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,769
All right, pull up over there.

467
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,925
Who's that, Bobby Bacala?

468
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,555
See over there?

469
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,935
Guy in there killed your father.

470
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,965
What the fuck are you talking about?

471
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,245
Barry Haydu.

472
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,678
Detective Lieutenant
in the Clifton Police Force.

473
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,841
Retired today.

474
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,814
That's his retirement party.

475
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,932
Everybody always told me
it was a fucking cop.

476
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,865
I thought he was dead.

477
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,529
- My mother can't even talk about it.
- Did the hit for Jilly Ruffalo.

478
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,767
Him and your old man
were in the can together.

479
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,469
Jilly stabbed your old man's cellmate
to death.

480
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,945
So, when your old man got paroled,
he tracked down Jilly.

481
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:00,711
Took out his eye so bad,
he couldn't even put a glass one in.

482
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,648
Loyal, your old man.

483
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,952
That's what I heard.

484
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,250
Some guy's eye.

485
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,697
They hit my dad
right outside my house, right?

486
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,259
- He was bringing home a crib for me?
- Yeah.

487
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,571
Well, no....

488
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,568
He was outside the house,
but he wasn't carrying a crib.

489
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,736
He had a bunch of TV trays.

490
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,277
Could've been a crib just as easily.

491
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,881
That rat fuck was in uniform then.

492
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,420
Gambled like you wouldn't believe.

493
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,389
He did it on contract.

494
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,585
Made a lot of money over the years.

495
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,424
So, how come he's still fucking walking?

496
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,697
Because he's been useful.
But he's outlived it...

497
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,735
as of his cute little ceremony this afternoon.

498
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,235
Is that him?

499
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,602
With the sombrero on?

500
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,769
No, you can't tell from here.

501
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,774
Maybe....

502
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,137
Yeah, probably.

503
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:11,913
Here.

504
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,821
Nice house, apparently.

505
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,089
They say he paid cash for it.

506
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,561
Good luck.

507
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,233
Questions?

508
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,573
Kill the dome light.

509
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,683
Said,"Hey, Joe"

510
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,728
That's the lamest plan I ever heard.

511
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,898
It is not a lame plan,
we got it all worked out.

512
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,507
And we got the time to place everything.

513
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,875
It's lame.

514
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,912
Magnum, why are you being
so negative and hostile?

515
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,042
Higgins, he's one of the biggest
drug dealers in the Midwest...

516
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,848
and he's as dangerous as Quenneville....

517
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,319
What the fuck is this?

518
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,381
You're cleaned out.
Nothing to rob in this place.

519
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,021
Well, there's this.

520
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,052
Okay.

521
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,227
You know I'm a police officer.

522
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,030
Engraving on this watch
says you retired today.

523
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,846
Every little bit helps.

524
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,042
Rough divorce?

525
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,947
She must be a real vile twat.

526
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,758
Hope she didn't pass it on to your daughter.

527
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,319
Listen to me.

528
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,659
It's not too late to cut your losses.

529
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,496
Unlock me, give me the weapons.

530
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,006
I promise you I will do
whatever is in my power to help you.

531
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,371
Maybe. Let's come back to that.

532
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,346
You remember Dickie Moltisanti?

533
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,749
- No.
- No?

534
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,381
Is that what you said?

535
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,918
- Is he a friend of yours?
- He was my father.

536
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,020
Steak san, Newport fries?

537
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,766
Scrambled eggs, no oil, tomato slices.

538
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,272
So, are you...

539
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,616
mentally prepared for this promotion?

540
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:30,949
Yeah.

541
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,117
How's that steak?

542
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,592
It's okay.

543
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,528
Hon? Another steak san over here.

544
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,496
- Rare.
- Coming up.

545
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,603
You know, because it's....

546
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,834
It's a lot of added responsibility.

547
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,273
I think it should've happened sooner.

548
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,285
How's your family doing, you know...

549
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,754
since the tragedy with your dad?

550
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,386
Rough on my mother.

551
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,826
How old is she now?

552
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,194
She's 69.

553
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,106
Mom really went downhill
after the World Trade Center.

554
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,804
You know, Quasimodo predicted all this.

555
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,204
Who did what?

556
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,771
These problems.
The Middle East, the end of the world.

557
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,282
Nostradamus.

558
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,079
Quasimodo's the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

559
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,211
Right.

560
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,277
Notre Damus.

561
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:41,290
Nostradamus, and Notre Dame.

562
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,786
It's two different things completely.

563
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,496
It's interesting, though,
they'd be so similar, isn't it?

564
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,199
And I always thought,
"Okay, Hunchback of Notre Dame.

565
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,472
"You also got your quarterback
and halfback of Notre Dame."

566
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,010
One's a fucking cathedral.

567
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,273
Obviously. I know, I'm just saying.

568
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,315
It's interesting, the coincidence.

569
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,748
What, you gonna tell me
you never pondered that?

570
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,343
- The back thing with Notre Dame?
- No!

571
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:22,194
Look, I don't know who told you I had
anything to do with your father's death...

572
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,757
but their information is faulty...

573
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,895
or they are deliberately
not telling you the truth.

574
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,772
Are you inferring that
you didn't take cash from Jilly Ruffalo...

575
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:36,142
to whack my father while he was carrying
a TV tray for me to watch TV?

576
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,647
I don't know anybody named Ruffalo.

577
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,647
You're being set up!

578
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,747
He's lying to you, whoever he is.

579
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,758
It wouldn't make any difference.

580
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,091
What do you mean,
it wouldn't make any difference?

581
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,322
He wants you dead.

582
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,922
All right, look. I got a boat.

583
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,033
It's a Sea Ray 230. It's almost brand new.

584
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,105
I didn't kill your father, but you could....

585
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,999
You don't want a cop- kill on your head!

586
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,134
...and what if they won't pull over, T. C.?

587
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,009
I'm not gonna take on a limo in this car.

588
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,714
- No problem.
- I'm sorry!

589
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,450
- What are you gonna do?
- Honk the horn.

590
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,621
Pull over! Police!

591
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,296
Police, in a Ferrari?

592
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,509
Freeze! Don't move a muscle,
or I'll put a bullet through it.

593
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,178
Special Investigator Finaday,
you're under arrest.

594
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,348
What's the charge, Officer?

595
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,083
Speeding, reckless driving,
endangering another vehicle...

596
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,455
and impersonating an officer.

597
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:01,794
- How do you think it's going?
- Couldn't be better, you two are terrific.

598
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,898
Soon as they come through the door,
we're gonna nail them.

599
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,365
Freeze!

600
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,628
Shit.

601
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,971
I missed my game, again.

602
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,444
Fucking loser.

603
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,743
Now Reese'll have to lead
the guys to victory.

604
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,443
- Who's Reese?
- Kenneth Reese!

605
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,644
He was my back- up quarterback
at the academy...

606
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,382
and he's been waiting
for a chance like this since 1963.

607
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,787
Now he's got it because of you.

608
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,184
...more than 12 hours. Ted?

609
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,519
Amy, in Pennsylvania tonight,
two men were shot and killed...

610
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:36,430
in what was described as a brazen
but successful armored- car robbery.

611
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,162
Three accomplices escaped with $800, 000...

612
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,637
while one of the dead men,
Dennis Lynch of Freehold, New Jersey...

613
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:45,675
was said by police to have ties
to organized crime families...

614
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,643
both in that city and in New York.

615
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,645
The street where the robbery took place...

616
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,874
was littered with bills
of denominations from....

617
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,813
- You smell gas down here?
- It's always like that.

618
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,616
You had the pipes checked?

619
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,884
I thought I heard something.

620
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,726
Is he up? I need to talk to him.

621
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,457
I brought him a steak.
You can put it with eggs.

622
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,023
Actually, your wife's here.
She's making him something to eat.

623
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,092
Karen. Did something happen?

624
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,769
We got some bad news last night.

625
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,066
Are you just gonna stand there?

626
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:23,102
The Feds had an undercover agent
in Dr. Schreck's office.

627
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,787
Uncle Jun'.

628
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,955
- Hey, Karen.
- Fucking Grand Central Station?

629
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,754
Junior, my kids?

630
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,721
You're right. Sorry, dear.

631
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,765
I brought my bar of soap.

632
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,662
What time they call you?

633
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,500
We had a little scare.
Thought it was the shunt in his heart.

634
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,233
He passed some gas, and he seems better.

635
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,902
Why don't you go on Joe Franklin,
tell the whole tri- state area?

636
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,334
Dad.

637
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,177
Not now.

638
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,046
I heard what happened.

639
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,417
It's bad, but it's not worth
getting yourself sick over.

640
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,921
- I told you, just sit down.
- He doesn't have cable.

641
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,718
Actually, we're gonna go.

642
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,161
Okay, Jun', you got everything?

643
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,089
Thank you, dear, you've been wonderful.

644
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,464
Bye, Karen.

645
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,662
I'll see you. See you, kids.

646
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,396
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Be good.

647
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,374
Must've been that piece of tail.

648
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,212
Now, look, she....

649
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,678
She probably reported the meetings...

650
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,985
who was there, all that shit.

651
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,818
As far as conversations,
what could she hear?

652
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,556
You'd better hope nothing...

653
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,690
because you were involved
in every fucking one.

654
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,499
How could you fall for that flirty shit?
That's the point!

655
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:03,007
Get the hell outta here.
I wanna talk to my uncle.

656
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:11,681
Forget about that for a minute.
That shit about your legal expenses.

657
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,483
I been thinking, and okay.

658
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,528
Maybe I can give you some relief.

659
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,989
What?

660
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,563
You got that empty garage
over on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

661
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,332
You been trying to sell it.
I'll take it off your hands.

662
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,398
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know, I'm trying to help you out.

663
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:33,871
How much?

664
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,909
$100, 000.

665
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,474
Who gives a fuck anyway?

666
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,349
- Come on.
- I was led around by the nose, Anthony.

667
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:48,653
You're right. A young goose smiled at me,
and birds started chirping.

668
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,618
Time was, my instincts would've never
failed me like that.

669
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,994
So, what are you now, the Amazing Kreskin?

670
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,828
What did I tell her?

671
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,266
Did I say anything
could be used against me?

672
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,735
I don't know.

673
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,999
Bullshitting, singing.

674
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,367
Atlantic City, Jesus Christ.

675
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:10,135
I'll be sitting right across from her
in the courtroom.

676
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,750
All right, come on. Have something to eat.

677
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,429
I'm an old man, Anthony.

678
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,465
An old man that's going to trial.

679
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,170
Not much else to say about me.

680
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,217
I'm a little depressed.

681
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,293
You were on vacation.

682
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,593
Can you describe the feelings?

683
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,524
Things are good.

684
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,337
Especially with Carmela.

685
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,939
But then she starts ragging on me
about the future.

686
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,670
How she's worried.

687
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,574
And what's gonna happen to them
if I'm dead.

688
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,012
And "buy bonds" and all this shit.

689
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,707
A lot of people are feeling vulnerable.

690
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,276
On the other hand, she's right.

691
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,956
- Not that I'd ever tell her that.
- Why not?

692
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,723
'Cause then she'd wanna know
where's the money, how much.

693
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,093
Don't you want Carmela to be taken care of?

694
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,324
She is.

695
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,797
Anyway, she's right, that's the point.

696
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,598
Over the last few years,
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

697
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,659
And?

698
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,306
My uncle definitely snapped it into focus.

699
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,036
What's he, 72 years old? What's he got?

700
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,375
Fucking shitty house in Belleville,
and a bunch of legal bills...

701
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,348
that'd make you gargle Drano
if you had them.

702
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,177
I've analyzed it.

703
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,881
There's two endings for a guy like me.

704
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,582
High- profile guy.

705
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,921
Dead, or in the can.

706
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,959
- Big percent of the time.
- You've never talked this frankly.

707
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:09,624
Even with all this terrorism shit,
the government has resources up the ass.

708
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,065
- As far as legal bills are--
- Anthony!

709
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:14,194
- What?
- Why don't you give it up?

710
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,199
You didn't let me finish.

711
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,877
There's a third way to wrap it up.

712
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,881
You rely only on family.

713
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:29,018
Not many men could survive
without the love and support...

714
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,179
of their wife and children.

715
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,484
No, I'm talking about business.

716
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,388
You trust only blood.

717
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,125
A friend of mine...

718
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,324
guy whose name you wouldn't know...

719
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,265
stayed out of the can and in charge.

720
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:49,601
Lived in Florida till he was 81 years old.
He only gave orders through his son.

721
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,002
No other conversations
that could come back in testimony.

722
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,880
- His son?
- No, not A. J.

723
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,716
What I've been dealt is my nephew.

724
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,513
He's gotten his act together, the kid.

725
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,824
Over the last few months...

726
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:12,384
I started the process
of bonding him to me inseparably.

727
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,085
How?

728
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,292
That we can't get into.

729
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,300
Didn't your uncle do that with you?

730
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:22,134
You said his life is like a desert.

731
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,299
I'm 42, and I'm already more successful
than my uncle ever was.

732
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,036
You've seen my house.

733
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,374
Anthony, why are you telling me this?

734
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,123
I don't know.

735
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,392
Guess I trust you.

736
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,195
A little.

737
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:17,855
Hi, Mom.

738
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,860
What the hell are you doing here?
You scared me to death.

739
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,527
Just stopped by
to see how you're getting along.

740
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:29,299
You ever do anything like a normal person?
There is a bell.

741
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,308
How you been?

742
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:34,835
Fine.

743
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,407
How's Connie's kid?

744
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,812
He's huge.

745
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,044
Jesus!

746
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,220
That's Jason?

747
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,853
He has a weight problem already.
Eight years old.

748
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:53,418
She never had him baptized.
She thought she knew everything.

749
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:57,660
Actually, I was hoping you would make me
one of your fluffernutters.

750
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,771
It's fucking mouthwash.

751
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,637
Leave me the fuck alone.
You come over here with that shit.

752
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,877
What's that on the table,
Daddy's navy picture?

753
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,283
You ever miss him?

754
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,022
When he was in prison...

755
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,361
or since he's been dead?

756
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,764
I don't know.

757
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,128
Did I saddle you with a stepfather?

758
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:52,219
I don't have any peanut butter.
I haven't kept it since you left.

759
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,689
I can't make you a fluffernutter.

760
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,125
You want French toast?

761
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,061
I gotta go.

762
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,594
- Ade sends her love.
- Right, say hello.

763
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,067
You watch that Bailey's,
or I'll give you a shot in the head.

764
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,873
- Look who's talking.
- What?

765
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,537
Never mind what.
