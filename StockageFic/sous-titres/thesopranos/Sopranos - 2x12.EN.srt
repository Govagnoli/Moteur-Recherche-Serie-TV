1
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,596
Had some great
naps on this settee.

2
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,097
You okay over there?

3
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:14,100
Shades of starving students,
santa monica,

4
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,602
summer of'78.

5
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,103
You were a mover?

6
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,104
Yeah.

7
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,606
How many jobs you
have in this lifetime?

8
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,108
Enough to know
i don't want another one.

9
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,111
Jan, these floors
have wonderful glide.

10
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,613
You're
looking great, rick.

11
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:32,619
Beautiful juliet,
beautiful.

12
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,121
Richie's son is still
"flying down to rio"?

13
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,623
Dad, must be
proud as punch.

14
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,124
He is.

15
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,128
Those two were top ten
in the embassy ball
championships last year.

16
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,131
Ton',
hey, man.

17
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,635
Jackie,
how's your rash?

18
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,637
How you doin'?

19
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,137
You want
a beer, t?

20
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,140
No, no,
that's alright.

21
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,647
Go join your
wastrel friends.

22
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,149
What's the matter?

23
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,151
Jackie aprile was a man
who loved knowledge.

24
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,654
When he was dying of the cancer,
he was praying,

25
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,155
his son would go
to medical school.

26
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,659
If he knew he dropped out
of college, break his heart.

27
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,160
It didn't hurt
the beatles.

28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,662
Bill gates.

29
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:20,166
His uncle richie's
looking out for him.

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,668
Easier than dealing
with his own son.

31
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,670
Hey tony,
don't do that.

32
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,673
Do you know he's taking aj
to the dirt bike championships
at giant stadium?

33
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:27,674
Aj can't go.

34
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,175
He got a "c"
in algebra.

35
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,677
Does carmela
know about this?

36
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,679
Alright, you really
want to know?

37
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,682
I don't want him
around my kids.

38
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,683
Who, richie?

39
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,684
You heard me.

40
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,686
What the fuck
are you talking about?

41
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,187
Ask gia gaeta.

42
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,690
Richie told me
all about that.

43
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,693
The transmission
slipped out of gear.

44
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,195
Richie's lucky he didn't
get crushed by the car too.

45
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,697
And for your information,

46
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,700
beansie gaeta owed him
major dollars for ten years

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,702
and richie wasn't even
asking for the interest.

48
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,703
Why not?

49
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,706
And if we're so awful,

50
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,208
why are you throwing us
an engagement party?

51
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,210
'Cause you're my sister,
and i try to do what's right.

52
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,213
Anyway,
it's my wife's thing.

53
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,716
What's right include planking
that little russian girl

54
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,717
of yours on the side?

55
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,218
You know what,

56
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,721
be in denial, be a co- dependent
to a fucking shit- bag.

57
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,722
What the fuck
do i care?

58
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,224
Your can't stand
to see me happy, can you?

59
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,726
You motherfucker.

60
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,228
Take that settee
and shove it up your ass.

61
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,769
I love
my new pony boots, tony.

62
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,778
Yeah, nice.

63
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,281
Why don't you wear them
when you go on some
of your interviews?

64
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,789
You call
sy littman yet?

65
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:28,795
No, i'm doing it.

66
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,296
There's good money
in modeling.

67
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,298
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life

68
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,300
behind the perfume counter
in a department store, do you?

69
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,802
What do you care
what i do?

70
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:41,808
Don't start
with the moody shit.

71
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,309
What is that?

72
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,811
"Chicken soup for the soul".

73
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,312
You should read
"tomato sauce for your ass",

74
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,814
it's the italian version.

75
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,815
Ha ha.

76
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,328
Why, you jealous?

77
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,830
You fucking him?

78
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,832
I can't have
a conversation with you!

79
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,333
You're horrible.

80
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,835
It's a fucking question.

81
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:12,338
Maybe it's something
you ought to think about.

82
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,840
What?

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,842
Finding somebody who can
give you everything you want.

84
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,844
I told you
he drives a fucking limo.

85
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,847
Not talking about
those kind of things,

86
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:25,351
i'm talking about a family,
marriage, children.

87
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,354
I don't want
to find someone, i have you.

88
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,858
What, to take you
out to dinner,

89
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,359
and screw your
fucking brains out?

90
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,363
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

91
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,865
Tony, no don't go.

92
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,368
You know, you don't know
what the fuck you want.

93
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,870
Don't yell at me,
please.

94
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,371
You know this
is a bad time.

95
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,873
My new boss
is so mean to me.

96
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,374
It's always
a bad time with you.

97
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,376
With the cousins
and the landlords.

98
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:55,381
Tony,
no, please no!

99
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,883
Alright.

100
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,886
Rin', you know it hasn't
been good for a long time.

101
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,889
For either of us.

102
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,390
Now, i'm worn out here.

103
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,392
I'll die without you.

104
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,394
No you won't, you'll forget
about me in two weeks.

105
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,898
No, i'm telling you,
if you go i'll kill myself.

106
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,400
Don't you fucking
threaten me, irina.

107
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,404
This is over,
i can't do this anymore.

108
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,906
I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

109
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,409
You talk to that guy about
the modeling like i told you.

110
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,913
Take care of you
until you get on your feet.

111
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,915
But i'm not
doing this anymore.

112
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:34,921
You understand?

113
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,923
I hate you!

114
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:43,930
So that's it.

115
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,932
Albert splits nutley
with the d'alessio brothers,

116
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,434
and barone here keeps
everything north of paterson.

117
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,436
What else
we gotta talk about?

118
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,939
Fairfield township's
taking bids next week

119
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,440
what's there
to talk about?

120
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,441
Fairfield's mine.

121
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,442
Was yours.

122
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,444
I don't give bids
to the handicapped.

123
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,948
See obviously, richie,
you're fucking deaf,

124
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,950
i told you ten times,

125
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,452
then i find out
you're still dealing blow
on those garbage routes.

126
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,954
For that i'm losing
a fucking bid?

127
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,456
Next time you'll
find yourself in the back
of one of your trucks.

128
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,458
Those are my father's
garbage routes.

129
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,960
Shh, kid.

130
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,961
Actually fellas,

131
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,963
my cousin larry wants
the fairfield contract.

132
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,965
The hardship of
his family and whatnot,

133
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,967
while he's in jail
awaiting trial.

134
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,469
See, this is why we have
a fixed bid club.

135
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,971
'Cause everyone's
got a story

136
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,472
about why they should
go to head of line.

137
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,474
I've been in line
for ten fucking years.

138
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,977
My uncle is just asking
for what my father
would have given him,

139
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,979
if he was boss
when richie got out of prison.

140
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,480
It had nothing to do with
they were brothers.

141
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,983
You respected my father,
you should respect richie.

142
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,486
Those who want respect
give respect.

143
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:45,491
See, he just told you
to shut the fuck up.

144
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:54,000
And he told me
to go fuck myself.

145
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,002
This bill,
mel, jesus.

146
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,005
I wish this fucking trial
would happen already,

147
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,007
i'm hemorrhaging
sponduliks here.

148
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,511
The minimization process could
be very good for us, corrado.

149
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:10,516
We hire experts
to study the wiretap tapes.

150
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,518
Former bureau guys,
very thorough.

151
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,522
If they find abuses,
we take those findings
to the judge,

152
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:21,027
and possibly have all
the wiretap evidence thrown out.

153
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,029
That's fucking great.

154
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,531
I know the feds stay on
the phone longer than
the 20 seconds they're allowed

155
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,533
to see if
the call is relevant,

156
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,035
i hear a click.

157
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,536
I could be talking
about root beer,

158
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,040
and sometimes
they stay on 40, 50 seconds
before they hang up.

159
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,042
Pricks.

160
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,543
But it'll cost,
the study.

161
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,544
How much?

162
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,546
200- plus hours
of tapes to analyze,

163
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,549
and i want to bring on
specialized counsel,

164
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,551
to handle
the wiretap litigation.

165
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,553
Ballpark figure?

166
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,555
Yeah, wrigley fucking field,
for chrissake.

167
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:55,061
400 thousand.

168
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,563
Did my nephew say where
i'm allowed to move the coke?

169
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,066
He don't give a shit
about nobody but himself.

170
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,568
This country's going
through boom times,

171
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,070
there's more fucking garbage
than there ever was

172
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,072
and he won't
let me eat.

173
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,573
Now you wanna
cry money problems?

174
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,075
I'm facing 20 years,

175
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,576
i could die
in the fucking place.

176
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,078
You're gonna
beat it, skip.

177
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,582
You don't
fucking know that!

178
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,084
That coke
is my lifeline right now.

179
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,585
Break it down, jun'.

180
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,087
What choice
does he leave us?

181
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,089
You need allies to do
what your thinking about.

182
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,091
Albert barese didn't like
what he was hearing.

183
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,094
And by extension
larry barese,

184
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:33,099
biggest fucking crew
in the family.

185
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,600
That doesn't
surprise me.

186
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,104
Larry's had
as much time as me

187
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,605
to think about why
he's under indictment,

188
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,607
and some other
people ain't.

189
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,609
So, what do yo
u want me to do?

190
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,611
Go talk to alley boy,
feel him out.

191
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,114
But he's a slippery fuck.

192
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:55,121
Don't commit.

193
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,123
I'll see you.

194
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,630
He's got tremendous moxie
for his size.

195
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,633
Tell me about it.

196
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,969
He's a fighter.

197
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,151
What's this?

198
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,652
Open it.

199
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,653
I could see
it's jw gold.

200
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,655
But we can't
accept gifts, sal.

201
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,658
I'll pass it along to the guys
at the fireman's home.

202
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,660
See,
that right there,

203
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,163
you guys have a policy
and it's fucking stuck to.

204
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,164
You don't
get distracted.

205
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,166
Look what happened
with those egyptians,

206
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,668
those motherless
world trade center fucks.

207
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,671
Serial numbers
on an axle and you put
everyone of them behind bars.

208
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:50,676
What the fuck
is all this?

209
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,677
I owe you, skip.

210
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,180
The rest of my life,
i'll never forget,

211
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,682
you looked the other way
on that bevilaqua beef.

212
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,184
What?

213
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,186
The bureau would never turn
its head on a murder charge.

214
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,689
Alright, what else could
you say at this point, right?

215
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,191
What do you know
about scottsdale?

216
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,692
Arizona?

217
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,194
Yeah, i was thinking
i would pick there to live,

218
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,695
when this
assignment is over.

219
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,696
Assignment?

220
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,198
You know, when i'm
in witness protection.

221
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,201
They got more than
300 days of sunshine, golf,

222
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,702
giant's spring training,

223
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,206
naturally, i'm talking
about after i do
my two years in louisburg.

224
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,209
I been thinking about taking
courses while i'm in the can,

225
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,211
psychology, criminology,

226
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,214
and maybe go give lectures
at police departments on o. C.

227
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,718
That's an idea.

228
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,222
An airline ticket
from the scatino bust- out.

229
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,724
Tony made the guy
order blocks of these things,

230
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,226
through
the sporting goods store.

231
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,229
I'll put it on file.

232
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,232
You could use it
as probable cause
for a warrant, couldn't you?

233
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,734
Evidence of extortion,
intent to defraud,

234
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,236
those are rico
predicates, right?

235
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,739
First you have to tie
the ticket to tony.

236
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,242
And he's too smart
to use any of them himself.

237
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,744
He probably moved
them by now.

238
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:03,249
However, this engagement party
for the sister,

239
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,751
i'm gonna want
to wire you up.

240
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,253
I know you're sensitive.

241
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,754
Ah fuck that.

242
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,756
What the fuck was i,
his errand boy?

243
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,258
The saturn, yeah.

244
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,760
Running all over
looking for his kid's
science teacher's car.

245
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,762
What the fuck is that?

246
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,266
Any faith i had went out
the window that very day.

247
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,790
It's gorgeous.

248
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,292
I know.

249
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,793
Are you out of your mind
with all the arrangements?

250
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,295
My planner did
rick cerone's wedding.

251
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,796
So, all i do is,
i hand out money.

252
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,798
And i have his card
for your.

253
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:56,802
Your father's disappeared
and i ain't paying
for something like that.

254
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,304
Oh, carmela.

255
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,805
Carmela, i love
the new wallpaper.

256
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,807
Do you think
i should do my den?

257
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,809
Hey, do you have
that guy's number?

258
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,314
Hey t, you still got any
of those airline tickets

259
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,815
you got from
the scatino bust- out?

260
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,317
Fucking creep.

261
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,819
Who, rich?

262
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,820
What happened
to that man in the can?

263
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:21,827
Meadow, go help
your mother.

264
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,329
You're in a little bit
of denial there,

265
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,830
richie was always
a disturbed kid.

266
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:31,337
So janice, i really don't
have a shot anymore?

267
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,838
Having a good
fucking time?

268
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,340
Alright, what do you
want me to say?

269
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,341
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,343
I'm glad for you.

271
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,346
You should have seen m
a when we left the house.

272
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,848
She really
wanted to be here.

273
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,850
Could we go back to the part
where i was glad for you?

274
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,852
You don't give her
a chance, tony.

275
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,355
She's a completely
different person,

276
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,856
since the doctors
put her on prozac.

277
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,858
Put her on what?

278
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:53,859
Janice!

279
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,368
You're not gonna
believe this shit.

280
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,870
They got the old lady
on prozac.

281
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,872
She's changed, my ass.

282
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,874
She's just too senile
to remember who she hates.

283
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,877
What's wrong
with you today?

284
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:16,382
What do
you care?

285
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,887
Yo richie,
speech.

286
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,390
C'mon, speech.

287
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,394
Everybody...

288
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,397
i want to thank
my future in- laws
for making a great party.

289
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,400
And i want to than
k you all for coming,

290
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,404
and celebrating with u
s this historical union,

291
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,907
the apriles
and the sopranos.

292
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,911
They say
it's never too late.

293
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,414
They say all good comes
to those who wait.

294
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:58,424
They're right
on both counts.

295
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,426
You got anything to add,
little ricky?

296
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,927
Glad for you, dad.

297
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:02,928
Aw.

298
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,430
Stepmom.

299
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,431
Thanks, rick.

300
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,932
Umm...

301
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,435
okay, well i...

302
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,439
i just wanted
to share my happiness
with everybody here.

303
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,943
And i have been
looking for my soulmate
for all of my life.

304
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,946
Madonn,
have i looked, right?

305
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,950
I don't know what made me
think i was gonna find
anybody halfway decent

306
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,453
in some ashram
in pradesh.

307
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,457
But i found him,
right here...

308
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,460
at home.

309
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,966
And i just wanted to say
that you knock my socks off.

310
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,970
God bless,
salute.

311
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,501
Yeah.

312
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,502
It was
delicious agony.

313
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:22,508
Were you also pretending
when i kissed you?

314
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,509
I got to go out.

315
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,011
Oh you're wonderful.

316
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,014
I'm ashamed of myself.

317
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,017
Yes, you ought to be,
definitely.

318
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,019
Thank god, i'm home.

319
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,522
I'm in the shower,
i almost didn't hear the phone.

320
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,023
She is drunk,
she is crying.

321
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,025
She's took
20 sleeping pills.

322
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,527
What the fuck
is she thinking?

323
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,529
Aw, it's not her fault.

324
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,031
Please.

325
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,534
Look at you, you got one leg,
you don't behave like that.

326
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,537
Her parents, both of them
were alcoholics in petrozavodsk.

327
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,539
Horrible industrial city.

328
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,542
The father died
55 years old,

329
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,045
lung cancer,
cirrhosis of the liver.

330
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,048
Probably good thing anyway,
he was not working.

331
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,050
The factory
was closed down.

332
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,552
She had to go
to kazakhstan

333
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,556
to live with uncle,
crude, miserable man.

334
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,570
Jesus christ, rin'.

335
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,072
I don't care no more
what happen.

336
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,074
Don't say that shit.

337
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,576
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

338
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,577
So sorry, tony.

339
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:37,082
The ambulance, emergency room,
how she gonna pay?

340
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,084
You think they give
her medical insurance

341
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,086
at that department store
she works in?

342
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,588
I'll take care of it.

343
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,090
What kind of life is there
for me without you, tony?

344
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,094
To go back
to "bada bing"?

345
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,597
To be a dancer?

346
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,599
Be a prostitute
after that?

347
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,100
I don't want to.

348
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,102
I don't want to.

349
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,105
Alright,
shh shh shh.

350
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,108
Everything's
gonna be alright.

351
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,610
Okay?

352
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,114
It's gonna
be alright, shh.

353
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,115
Perfect.

354
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,117
Oh god.

355
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,619
Look at that cleavage.

356
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,622
Oh thank you, jesus.

357
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,625
You know, i'm only
doing this for the presents.

358
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,127
Well, i'm doin
g it for richie.

359
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,128
He says he'd rather
go to vegas,

360
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,131
but you gotta do
the ritual thing right?

361
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,634
This is such
a happy time.

362
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,637
All the flowers,
all the excitement.

363
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,139
I remember
how i felt.

364
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,142
Then there's honeymoon,
and the hope chest.

365
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,645
You're working
overtime here, carmela.

366
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,147
Remember how radiant i looked
walking down that aisle?

367
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,149
You're depressed,
aren't you?

368
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,152
Depressed?
No, i leave that to others.

369
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,655
I'm just
being realistic.

370
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,157
'Cause in a year tops,

371
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,159
you're gonna have
to accept a gumar.

372
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,161
Oh yeah?

373
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,663
Well, i'd like
to see a gumar,

374
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,165
that's gonna let him hold
a gun to her when they fuck.

375
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,668
You let him hold a gun
to your head during sex?

376
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,169
Yeah well,
if that gets him off.

377
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,672
It's not different
than garter belts
and nurse's uniforms.

378
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,173
Well, it's a gun.

379
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,175
I thought you
were a feminist.

380
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,177
Usually he takes
the clip out.

381
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,680
Well, jesus,
i hope so.

382
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,681
It's a ritual.

383
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:23,689
It's fetishistic,
that's all.

384
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,190
My 3- 0- 2s
from last week.

385
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,695
Sure, c'mon in.

386
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,196
Happy birthday chief.

387
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:31,697
Thanks.

388
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,200
From tony soprano.

389
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,203
Never misses
an occasion.

390
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,205
Christmas, columbus day.

391
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,207
Have something to eat,

392
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,209
before i send it
to st. Ambroseus shelter.

393
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,712
My cw on that just gave me
a bottle of johnny walker.

394
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,713
Cw 16?

395
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,714
Bonpensiero, yeah.

396
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,717
Fucking guy thinks
i'm his friend now.

397
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,218
I know we're not supposed
to accept gifts,

398
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,220
and i know poor people
are gonna get this,

399
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,723
but i can't resist
the lard bread.

400
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,224
He's turned some corner.

401
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,727
One minute he's talking about
how much he loves tony soprano.

402
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,729
And in the next breath
he's a junior g- man.

403
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,733
Talking about rico predicates
and probable cause.

404
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,735
All of a sudden
we're the good guys.

405
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,738
The worst case
of stockholm syndrome
i seen since patty hearst.

406
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,240
That was sad.

407
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,743
I tell you though,

408
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,747
i'm kind of worried
about sal with these
fantasies of law enforcement.

409
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,249
These things can work
two ways, skip.

410
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:32,758
You can find yourself
getting too close.

411
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,761
So, you getting married,

412
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,264
settling down, huh?

413
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,266
One door opens,
another door closes.

414
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:45,270
It's a fucking
expensive proposition though.

415
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,773
I didn't need that shit
that happened the other day.

416
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,275
You don't need that shit
that happened the other day.

417
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,778
You talk to the king
of dermabrasion about
what went down?

418
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,279
I'm talking to him,

419
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,281
and he's looking at
his reflection in the plexiglas.

420
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,284
Imagine getting
a facelift,

421
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,287
one week later
you're in jail.

422
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,789
Can you imagine that,

423
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,791
you get a facelift and
one week later you're in jail?

424
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,293
Anyway...

425
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,297
i had the feeling you didn't
like what you were hearing.

426
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,800
I already expected
to get fucked out of that bid.

427
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,803
Now that's
a sad commentary.

428
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,305
Richie, what's
larry gonna do?

429
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,307
The fucking guy's
a guest of the government.

430
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,309
While some people
are stuffing themselves.

431
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,311
Some people are out there
stuffing themselves.

432
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,313
Only larry's got
a trial coming up.

433
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,816
He's in no position to go
into the unknown not knowing.

434
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,817
How about you,
albert?

435
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,319
Weigh in anytime.

436
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,822
I'm with him.

437
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,324
All things
being equal?

438
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,326
No.

439
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,328
Make a move
against tony soprano?

440
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,830
No way.

441
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,833
I don't know
what to tell you.

442
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,350
Vic.

443
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,353
Carmela, hi.

444
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,355
Imagine running
into you here.

445
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,857
How are you?

446
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,358
I'm good,
i'm fine.

447
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,860
And how are you?

448
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,861
Good.

449
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,363
Just shopping
for a roller.

450
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,373
Look, vic,
truthfully.

451
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,375
I'm not just
running into you here.

452
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,878
I saw the name of the store
on your supplies,

453
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,379
i wanted
to talk to you.

454
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,381
Carmela, i'm sorry
i should've called you that day.

455
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,383
Please, you have nothing
to be sorry for.

456
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,885
I should have told you
i wasn't coming for lunch.

457
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,888
That's alright,
i got the message when
you didn't show up.

458
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,390
And that's why i wanted
to talk to you.

459
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,391
I wanted
to thank you.

460
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,393
For what?

461
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,897
Maybe someday
i will be free.

462
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,400
But if you had
come that day,

463
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,402
i might have
done something

464
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,404
that i would
be sorry for forever.

465
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,408
And so i wanted
to thank you for thinking
for the both of us.

466
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,412
For being strong
for the both of us.

467
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,415
Thank you.

468
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:15,921
Well, you're welcome.

469
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,923
So goodbye, vic.

470
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,927
And take care
of yourself.

471
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,440
Thank christ.

472
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,444
Jesus.

473
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:44,449
You know
who she's married to?

474
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,451
I need you to give me
the number of a good shrink.

475
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,953
Oh?

476
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,456
It's for a girl
i was seeing.

477
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,961
What?

478
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,462
"Was"?

479
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,464
Yeah, i broke up with her
and she tried to kill herself.

480
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,966
This was no
small cuttings.

481
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,468
20 halcyon and
a quart of vodka.

482
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,471
And the fucking ambulance,
they pumped her stomach.

483
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,473
Cost me three grand.

484
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,976
She should have been
seen by the psychiatrist
in the hospital.

485
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,978
He was a romanian,

486
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,980
and they have some beef
that goes back centuries

487
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,481
and she wouldn't
talk to him.

488
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,984
Do you feel responsible
for her suicide attempt?

489
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,986
I was banging her
for two years.

490
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,989
Was that
a hardship on her?

491
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,993
That's cute.

492
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,995
You know how many women
i've been through?

493
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,997
I don't know why
i just don't say
fuck it with this one.

494
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,498
Why do you think?

495
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,001
She's a sweet kid
underneath it all.

496
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,503
And i think she's
seriously depressed.

497
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:45,010
You feel for her?

498
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,512
I'm interested
in why you're ending it.

499
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,514
What do you mean, why?

500
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,017
Isn't that what
i'm supposed to do?

501
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,519
Aren't you telling me that
all the time in here?

502
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,521
I don't think
i've ever passed judgment,

503
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,023
on your sex life,

504
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,025
or any patient's
sex life.

505
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,028
Even if i'm 20 years older
than her and i'm married?

506
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,030
What's wrong with you?

507
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,033
Why now?

508
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,534
Why now?

509
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,536
Because, it's
not fun anymore.

510
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,539
Okay, are you gonna
recommend somebody or not?

511
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,546
He's eating lunch.

512
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:29,554
So?

513
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,056
Larry's out.

514
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,559
Aw shit, fuck.

515
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,562
I knew it,
i fucking knew it.

516
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,565
Here bobby,
take this, i can't.

517
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:44,569
Larry and albert
are not the problem.

518
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,073
It's tony that's
the fucking problem.

519
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,075
You take him out
of the picture,

520
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,077
and believe me,
everybody's gonna come along.

521
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,578
Where else
are they gonna go?

522
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,579
I'm sick.

523
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,581
And fucking
larry barese too.

524
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:01,086
I got friends
in federal holding that
would like nothing better

525
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,088
than to take
that weak fuck out.

526
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,091
He was a great friend
to my father,

527
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,093
but he doesn't car
e who he follows now.

528
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,095
I'd do him myself.

529
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,096
Who's that
speaking here?

530
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,098
Is somebody speaking?

531
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,601
Listen, richie,

532
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,103
let me think
about this awhile.

533
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,106
We can't be too fucked up
by this setback.

534
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:25,110
We gotta screw our
courage to the post.

535
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,118
You're a good boy, richie.

536
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,619
It's gonna be good.

537
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,123
Go on home
, we'll talk.

538
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,140
Fucking guy's fearless
for his size.

539
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,642
That's nice.

540
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,144
Then what?

541
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,646
He fucking dies,

542
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,148
i can't even
wear his shoes.

543
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,149
What the fuck
you talking about?

544
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,650
Fucking loser.

545
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,152
He couldn't sell it.

546
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,153
Richie?

547
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,155
Pay attention, you just
may learn something here.

548
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,158
Who am i
best off with?

549
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,661
We best off with?

550
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,170
Old man profaci knew
how to split his enemies.

551
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,674
He couldn't
fucking sell it.

552
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,178
He's not respected.

553
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:39,684
But tony, with
his impulsiveness
and selfishness,

554
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:44,689
he's locked up in that
fucking head of his.

555
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:54,699
I'm better off
with tony.

556
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,702
Definitely.

557
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:05,710
I wanna see anthony at
the doctor's office tomorrow.

558
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,711
What are you
looking at?

559
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:11,216
I'm in awe of you.

560
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,719
The dow jones industrial
average gave back all
of an earlier gain.

561
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,221
It rallied more than
100 points midday,

562
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,724
in the end it fell
two and a half to close
at 10, 675...

563
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,227
hard at work?

564
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,228
It's financial news.

565
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,230
What the fuck
you doing here?

566
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,232
The nasdac
is now in a...

567
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,734
i got a line on
a car for adrianna.

568
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,237
You want anything?
They got sodas, coffee.

569
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,739
I got a bottle
in the drawer.

570
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,741
Nah, i'm good.

571
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,243
How's it going?

572
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,744
This racket?

573
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,247
We dumped webistics
and whacked up the payoff.

574
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,249
Fucking license to steal.

575
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,750
Anything you can
get me into?

576
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,751
A pharmaceutical.

577
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,254
They got a roo
t from the amazon,

578
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,757
cures glaucoma,
it's all fucking bullshit.

579
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,259
I got a brochure.

580
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,262
Oh tonight, puss.

581
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,763
I got something hard edge.

582
00:29:58,763 --> 00:29:59,264
What?

583
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:00,765
Pokemon cards.

584
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,767
Me and tommy mac are
taking down a truckload.

585
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,768
Yeah, where?

586
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,270
Tommy knows, you in?

587
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,271
What, me?

588
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,772
Yeah, c'mon,
old times.

589
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,274
You don't want
a fat fuck like me around.

590
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,776
I can't find the brochure.

591
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,778
Anyway, what difference
does it make?

592
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,281
You come in for five, ten grand
on this drug company,

593
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,783
by the time we dump
the piece of shit

594
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,286
you'll be in
six figure territory.

595
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:22,287
Hey, puss?

596
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,788
Yeah.

597
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:24,789
The fucking car?

598
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:25,790
What car?

599
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,292
Oh, yeah, right.

600
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,293
For adriana.

601
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,296
It's an
m3 convertible, clean.

602
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,799
I'll keep you posted.

603
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,302
And not even
the big deal...

604
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:40,805
you're kidding,
excuse me.

605
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,807
Lipari.

606
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,808
This is fat man.

607
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:44,809
Who?

608
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,810
You know.

609
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,312
Sal?

610
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,814
I just heard about they're gonna
jack a load of pokemon cards.

611
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,317
Moltisanti
and another individual.

612
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,318
Good, where?

613
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:54,319
I don't know yet.

614
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:55,820
I should ascertain, right?

615
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,825
Excuse me, dear?

616
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,827
You're a
cooperating witness, sal.

617
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,330
You wear a wire,
that's what you do.

618
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,333
So ask around,
see what you can find out.

619
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,336
But i, in no way want you
going along in any hijack.

620
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,338
You hear me?

621
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:17,342
We let you earn,
but no violent crimes, right?

622
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:21,846
Okay.

623
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:26,351
Get out of here, i hate you,
you fucking bastard!

624
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:32,357
Fucking mood swings.

625
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,858
Was very
bad day for her.

626
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,360
Yeah, when isn't?

627
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,861
I went to modeling agency
like you told me.

628
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,864
I waited four hour
s to see mr. Littman.

629
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,365
So?

630
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,866
Wasn't good.

631
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:46,871
She didn't
get a job, big deal.

632
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,873
Well, you gotta
start somewhere.

633
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,876
I went in to see him,
and he told me i am too old.

634
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,379
Oh, jesus.

635
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,382
I'm sorry.

636
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,383
I go make the tea.

637
00:31:58,883 --> 00:31:59,384
I told you.

638
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,886
I told you,
it's all over for me.

639
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,389
No it's not,
you're gonna be fine.

640
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:23,908
Listen, i got the number o
f a guy i want you to talk to.

641
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:28,413
I don't want to go to
no more fucking interviews.

642
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,414
It's not--

643
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,417
it's not an interview,
it's a shrink.

644
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,918
A shrink.

645
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,920
Yeah, psychiatrist.

646
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,422
I know what is.

647
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,923
He comes highly
recommended,

648
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,925
you're gonna feel better
if you talk to him.

649
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,927
I am not going
to no shrink.

650
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,430
Yeah you are, 'cause
it's what i want you to do.

651
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,931
You're not
the boss of me.

652
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:47,932
Okay.

653
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,934
You know what?

654
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,436
Go fuck yourself then.

655
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,937
'Cause i'm trying
to be a nice guy,

656
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,440
went through a lot of
trouble to get that number.

657
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,442
So he can send me to hospital,
lock me up?

658
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,944
Psychiatrist is very
scary thing for russian,

659
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:03,448
means being sent to gulag,
political rehabilitation.

660
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,449
This is too
fucked up for me.

661
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:07,452
What?

662
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,454
Kiss off then.

663
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,964
Janice, how do you open
this advil?

664
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:25,470
Oh, nevermind...

665
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,972
dad, i'm gonna get started
on your gutters tomorrow.

666
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,474
That's great, kid.

667
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,476
Richie, you gotta
take a look at this.

668
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,478
I picked it up yesterday
at kuchensystems.

669
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,480
It's very bauhaus.

670
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,982
And it's not bad,
the basics cost 20 thousand.

671
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,985
Janice, maybe you should
slow down on the spending
for the time being.

672
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,487
Something wrong?

673
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,988
What happened?

674
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:44,989
I'm gonna take care of it.

675
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,492
But things could get
fucked up for a while.

676
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,993
Richie, if something's
happening to you,

677
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,995
then it's
happening to me.

678
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,997
Decision went against me,

679
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,000
which impacts me
a great deal financially.

680
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,503
Fuck!
Fuck i knew it!

681
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,505
This shit
with your brother.

682
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,006
It's been building
since i got out.

683
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,509
You give him a jacket
you treasure and gives it

684
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,010
to his fucking polack maid.

685
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,513
But we're still
going ahead with everything
at the house, right?

686
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,014
We'll see.

687
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,017
Richie, they'll tiling
the pool on friday.

688
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,520
And the atrium window,
i'm gonna lose the deposit.

689
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,021
I said i'm gonna
take care of it.

690
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,526
He just can't handle
that our house

691
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,529
is gonna be nicer
than his fucking house.

692
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,532
Fuck.

693
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,533
What's the matter
with you?

694
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,536
Nothing.

695
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,538
What?

696
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,539
Nothing.

697
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,544
It's just sad,
that's all.

698
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,545
What?

699
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,046
Aj didn't have the flu.

700
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,049
He didn't go with you because
tony wouldn't let him.

701
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:49,554
He doesn't want you
around his kids.

702
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,563
What happened?

5:16 a. M,. Subjects

707
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,163

709
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,666
May i ask

710
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,167
Just put him on.

711
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,669
Who is calling please?

712
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,673
What are you, that polish maid?
I want to talk to tony.

713
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,684
It's for you.

714
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:00,184
Hello.

715
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,185
Tony.

716
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,186
I miss you.

717
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,189
I love you.

718
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,691
You got the wrong
fucking number.

719
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,693
Don't call here again.

720
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,701
I'll wait out there.

721
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,203
Who was that, your little
russian girlfriend?

722
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,206
Listen, it's
over between us.

723
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,208
It has been
for a very long time.

724
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,209
Bullshit.

725
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:30,715
Why does your clothes
still stink of perfume?

726
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,718
Okay, i saw her, but
it's not what you think.

727
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,219
She tried
to commit suicide.

728
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,721
Oh fuck you.

729
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,223
I broke it off with her
and she tried to kill herself,

730
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,725
she said she didn't want
to go on without me.

731
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,226
The poor kid.

732
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,228
You're putting me
in a position,

733
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,231
where i'm feeling sorry
for a whore who fucks you?

734
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:57,241
You know what's stranger?
For a second i believed you.

735
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,743
Goddamn him.

736
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,244
They're all
the same, carm.

737
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,746
No, they're not.

738
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,748
That man who did
my wallpaper,

739
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,251
there was a male person
that you could respect--

740
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,253
victor musto?

741
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,255
Carmela, he didn't
show up that day,

742
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,757
because of
who your husband is.

743
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,759
Face it,
use your head.

744
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,260
He pissed his pants.

745
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,265
I don't want
to go to the gym.

746
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,273
Better be good.

747
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,775
I'm in the middle of
world war iii over there.

748
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,278
When you're lying
in the street in a pool
of your own blood,

749
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,280
don't say your uncle
didn't try to tell you.

750
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,281
What are you
talking about?

751
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,283
Richie aprile
is moving against you.

752
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,785
He doesn't
have the balls.

753
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,287
He's got a
legitimate beef with you.

754
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,789
You're fucking high- handed
with everybody.

755
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,290
Why don't you stick
to what you know,

756
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,292
and leave your opinions
wherever the fuck?

757
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,294
He approached
albert barese.

758
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,296
And albert said no.

759
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,799
Albert told you this?

760
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,302
No, i got it from richie himself
at my house yesterday.

761
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,306
He's gonna take you out
and larry barese,

762
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,808
and anybody else
who doesn't go along.

763
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,309
Alright, wait a minute.

764
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,311
Why the fuck is richie
telling you all this?

765
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,312
He thinks i'm with him.

766
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,314
Really?

767
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,817
What gave him that idea?

768
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,819
It's what i wanted
him to believe.

769
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,821
I've been
playing him.

770
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,322
I seen this
coming all along.

771
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,825
That's why i made
a big deal of that coke.

772
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,327
I raised a non- issue
and he fell for it.

773
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,830
So you're like a
double agent now, huh?

774
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,331
Fucking matt helm?

775
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:32,837
Fuck you.

776
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,839
How do i know
you're not playing me?

777
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,842
Believe what you want,
my little nephew.

778
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,845
If i didn't
come to you,

779
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,346
your fucking wife
would be a widow

780
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,347
and your children
wouldn't have no father.

781
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,851
So go fuck yourself.

782
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,863
Alright, stop.

783
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,365
I'm grateful to you.

784
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,867
I am.

785
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:07,371
I gave you five percent on
the action that was left to you.

786
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:10,875
Kick it up
to seven and a half.

787
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:15,379
But don't sell drugs
on those routes.

788
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,882
It's shortsighted.

789
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,898
You know that asshole's
marrying my sister?

790
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,400
You got to wonder
where she is in all of this.

791
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,903
My little niece.

792
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,411
What's up, t?

793
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,916
My future brother- in- law's
causing a serious problem.

794
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,918
How serious?

795
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,921
He's not satisfied wit
h the current leadership.

796
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,422
He wants
to have me popped.

797
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:02,426
That motherfucker.

798
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,930
So now i gotta decide
what to do about him.

799
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,446
I genuinely
don't think,

800
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:29,954
there's anything to gain
by keeping him around.

801
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,956
Get it done.

802
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,466
Oh, and the planner
checked the almanac

803
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:46,971
and he said there's
a 65* historical chance
of rain on the 12th.

804
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,472
So he wants to get
a tent for backup,

805
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:49,974
what do you think?

806
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,477
I can't decide
on shit like that.

807
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:54,979
Janice, c'mon.

808
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,481
Okay, but when
you start bitching

809
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,483
when you
see the bill, don't.

810
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:03,487
My kid hit me up for
five grand to go to england

811
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,990
for these dance contests.

812
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,492
Little ricky's still
coming to the wedding, right?

813
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,995
Rick,
rick.

814
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,496
Richard.

815
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,498
How many fucking times
i gotta tell you?

816
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,501
It was "little ricky"
when he was 12 years old.

817
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:23,007
Jesus, alright.

818
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,009
He's still
coming, right?

819
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,510
He wouldn't
miss an opportunity,

820
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,014
to fucking foxtrot and tango
in front of everybody.

821
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,516
Ballroom dancing
is a legitimate art form.

822
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,518
Carries my name, richard.

823
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,021
Fucking disgraziata.

824
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,523
My nephew jackie,

825
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,026
why couldn't
i have a son like that?

826
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:46,530
You know, you came home
with a fucking attitude today.

827
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,533
You know, i've been
in this house,

828
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,535
cooking your
fucking dinner

829
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:54,038
and taking care of that fucking
black hole upstairs all day.

830
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,540
Keep your fucking voice down,
she hears everything.

831
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,541
Not tonight.

832
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,043
I gave her
two nembutols,

833
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,545
i thought maybe
we'd want to have sex?

834
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,047
But not likely.

835
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,548
Put my fucking dinner
on the table,

836
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,050
and keep
your mouth shut.

837
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,551
No, you shut up.

838
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:11,555
Just because
he's a ballroom dancer
you think your son is gay.

839
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,058
What if he was gay,
what difference does it make?

840
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,059
Ow.

841
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,570
Fuck.

842
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:49,093
What are you
looking at?

843
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,595
You gonna cry now?

844
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,108
Get the fuck
out of here,

845
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,110
i'm in no mood
for your dramat--

846
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,138
where is everybody?

847
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,141
Aj is upstairs,
meadow's out.

848
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:43,647
You better get it.

849
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:50,154
Maybe she slit
the other wrist.

850
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:50,654
Hello.

851
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,655
Tony!

852
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,157
I need you!

853
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,658
I need you
to come over now!

854
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:55,659
Okay?

855
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,660
What's the matter?

856
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,162
Is it ma?

857
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,163
No, no.

858
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,664
Tell me what happened.

859
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,167
No i can't, say.

860
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,168
What do you mean
you can't say?

861
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,170
I can't say now.

862
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,172
Think,
think a minute, okay?

863
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:14,678
Just stay right there,
i'm gonna be right over.

864
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:15,679
It's janice.

865
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,680
Right.

866
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,182
I got to go.

867
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:51,715
Janice.

868
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,717
Ton'?

869
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,720
He hit me.

870
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,724
It was an accident.

871
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:09,733
Baby.

872
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:10,734
Where's ma?

873
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,237
She's upstairs.

874
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,241
Out, she took
two nembutols.

875
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:20,244
Ma?

876
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,246
I didn't mean it, tony.

877
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:28,252
I didn't mean it.

878
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,753
Where's the gun?

879
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:33,757
In the cabinet.

880
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,778
If anybody called this in
or there's any shit about this,

881
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,780
you don't got
to talk to anybody.

882
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,783
What are you doing?

883
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,285
Take a shower.

884
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,787
Give me the clothes
and shoes you got on.

885
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,789
Okay.

886
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,297
What the fuck?

887
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,298
They got away.

888
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,299
What did
i tell you, huh?

889
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,800
What did i tell you?

890
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,801
I didn't go with them,

891
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,303
i was following them
to the boost

892
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,804
and then i was
gonna call you.

893
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:21,805
What if they
would've spotted you?

894
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,308
The moltisanti kid
and his friend.

895
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,810
What was your
plan for that?

896
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,811
That was the beauty part.

897
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,813
I didn't even
use my own car.

898
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:30,814
I switched with my son.

899
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,316
You hit a
fucking 7- 11 clerk.

900
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,817
How is he?

901
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:34,818
In a coma.

902
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,320
Fuck.

903
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,821
They were gonna pinch you
for leaving the scene,

904
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,323
but i got you
out of it.

905
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,325
I owe you, again.

906
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:44,828
Sal, listen to me.

907
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,331
No, look at me.

908
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,832
Look up.

909
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:52,336
You are not
an fbi employee, sal.

910
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:57,341
Okay, that's
not gonna happen.

911
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,842
But i got
a lot to offer.

912
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,344
And i hate l. C. N.

913
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,347
I know i misspent
most of my life, i know that.

914
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,849
I know fucking a- well,
we live in a society of laws.

915
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,351
Sal.

916
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,354
You are gonna help us buil
d a case against tony soprano.

917
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,857
And then you're gonna do
your time for selling heroin.

918
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,860
And then you get out
and start a new life.

919
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,362
It's a good thing.

920
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:22,866
It's a lucky thing.

921
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,368
Sal.

922
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,370
Don't be that way.

923
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,372
I can show you
statistics.

924
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,898
Whoa.

925
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:55,899
I know.

926
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,401
We don't got time
for that now.

927
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:58,902
Get him out of here.

928
00:48:58,902 --> 00:48:59,903
Get rid of him.

929
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,906
Bring his car
to the salvage crusher.

930
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,408
Cadillac.

931
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,410
I'll get something.

932
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,418
Hello.

933
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,427
Where you goin' tony?

934
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,928
Tony, please.

935
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:25,929
Don't go.

936
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,432
I'll be
right back.

937
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,453
We got to
speed this up.

938
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,955
You know what time these
humps come in for work.

939
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,458
Fucking meat delivery
at five a. M.

940
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,959
We're almost done.

941
00:49:55,959 --> 00:50:04,468
It's gonna be a while
before i eat anything
from satriale's.

942
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,971
Uh, okay.

943
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:11,975
Get a hose,
start to wash the room.

944
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,479
Janice, is tha
t you down there?

945
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,982
What are you doing
up so early?

946
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,484
Ma, go back to bed.

947
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:24,988
I just don't know
what happened to me.

948
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:28,992
I had the strangest dreams
all night long.

949
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,994
People coming
and going.

950
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,496
Coming and going.

951
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:37,000
I couldn't get up
off the bed.

952
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,503
Tony,
tony.

953
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:43,507
Anthony, what
are you doing here?

954
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,510
C'mon janice,
let's go.

955
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,513
Richie didn't
come home last night,
she's worried about him.

956
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,015
Oh sure,
he probably jilted her.

957
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:59,022
That's the story
of her life.

958
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,024
What kind of a fucking
chance did she have,

959
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,026
with you as her mother?

960
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:06,029
You were always nagging her
about her weight.

961
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,031
She goes on a date,
she comes home,

962
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,032
you call her
a fucking tramp.

963
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,534
I'm gonna wait
out in the car.

964
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,537
I never said
anything of the kind.

965
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,538
I heard you.

966
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,039
You make things up.

967
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,041
You tell me,

968
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:22,546
you tell me when i ever
did anything to any of you.

969
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:29,052
You don't know,
do you?

970
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,054
You don't have
a fucking clue.

971
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,055
I wasn't always perfect,

972
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,558
but i always tried
to do the best i could.

973
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:40,063
And i know you didn't,
any of you, didn't like it

974
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,566
when i tried
to tell you what to do.

975
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:46,069
Babies are like animals.

976
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,071
They're no different
than dogs.

977
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:52,075
Somebody has to
teach'em right from wrong.

978
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:59,583
But i was your mother,
who else was gonna do it?

979
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,587
If you ask me, i did
a pretty damn good job.

980
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:13,096
That palace you live in,
up there on that hill.

981
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:17,100
I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

982
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:23,106
I suppose now
you're not gonna kiss me.

983
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,608
What?

984
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,109
You're cruel.

985
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:31,114
That's what you are.

986
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,616
Oh, fuck this.

987
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:38,622
Oh...

988
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,651
how you doing, hon?

989
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,652
Who send you, tony?

990
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,153
Yeah, he asked me
to bring you this.

991
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:11,655
What is it, money?

992
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,656
I don't want it.

993
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,157
Yes, you do.

994
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:18,662
75, 000 dollars
in here.

995
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:19,663
75?

996
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,666
Listen, irina
i know you're upset.

997
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,668
Let me give you
a little advice.

998
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,672
In my business
i see girls come and go.

999
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:29,673
So i know.

1000
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,175
Time is
the great enemy.

1001
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,178
You have
a very short window.

1002
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:39,182
It's not good
to get too hung up
on any one thing.

1003
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,684
On the other hand,

1004
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:43,186
something new
always comes along.

1005
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:47,691
I've seen it a million times,
it's called "passages".

1006
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,192
It's a book.

1007
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,694
He's right.

1008
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,196
He's very smart man.

1009
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,224
Thanks.

1010
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,728
You're welcome.

1011
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,230
I'm not gonna
forget this, tony.

1012
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:28,732
I owe you.

1013
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,734
God, do i owe you.

1014
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:35,238
All and all though, i'd sa
y it was a pretty good visit.

1015
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:38,742
What's wrong
with our family tony?

1016
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,745
I go to a shrink.

1017
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:48,752
She says that our mother
is a narcissistic personality.

1018
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,755
Why she turned out that way
who the fuck knows?

1019
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,758
Grandpa vito was
no prize as a father.

1020
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,259
That's not all
the shrink says.

1021
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,763
She says that ma
is a person

1022
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:03,266
who was incapable
of experiencing joy.

1023
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:06,770
And dad, all he di
d was experience joy.

1024
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,272
Richie told me you
were going to a shrink.

1025
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:13,276
I used to suggest it and
you'd blow your sack at me.

1026
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,778
Maybe you ought
to think about it.

1027
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,279
You know,
go back into therapy.

1028
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,782
What'd you do
with him?

1029
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,785
We buried him...

1030
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,787
on a hill

1031
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,789
overlooking
a little river,

1032
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,291
with pine cones
all around.

1033
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,292
You did?

1034
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,294
C'mon janice,
what the fuck?

1035
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,796
What do you care
what we did with him, huh?

1036
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,297
You want to know?

1037
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,799
I loved him so much.

1038
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,301
You're gonna miss your bus.

1039
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:41,805
I'm sorry.

1040
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,307
I'm sorry.

1041
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:47,811
Alright, go ahead.

1042
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,343
Meadow, you have a ups,
it's up in your room.

1043
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,345
What are you
doing in here?

1044
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,347
You've been gone
all night.

1045
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,348
Half the morning,

1046
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:30,854
what the hell
happened over there?

1047
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,865
Janice decided
to go back to seattle.

1048
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,367
You're kidding.

1049
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,370
Well, what about richie?
He must be devastated.

1050
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,872
Richie's gone.

1051
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,874
What do you mean, gone?

1052
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,876
Gone.

1053
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,878
Where?

1054
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:58,882
Carmela, after
18 years of marriage,

1055
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,384
don't make me make you
an accessory after the fact.

1056
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:06,389
An accessory
after the--

1057
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,892
holy shit!

1058
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,893
Stop asking.

1059
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:13,897
Oh, my god.

1060
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,398
Oh, my god.

1061
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,400
I took care of it.

1062
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,910
That...

1063
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,913
that was not a marriage
made in heaven.

1064
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,426
What's all this?

1065
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,936
After meadow's
graduation,

1066
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,438
me and rosalie aprile
are going to rome.

1067
00:57:55,438 --> 00:58:01,444
For three weeks.

1068
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,445
Excuse me?

1069
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:04,447
We're gonna stay
at the hassler,

1070
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:05,949
shop,

1071
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,952
and try and see
the holy father.

1072
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,454
What are people gonna say,
you take off for three weeks?

1073
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,958
You're gonna have
to chauffeur aj around
to his dentist and whatnot.

1074
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:18,461
And you've got
to find a tennis clinic,

1075
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,963
for meadow to join.

1076
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,465
Because if i have
to do it, tony,

1077
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:26,970
i just might
commit suicide.
