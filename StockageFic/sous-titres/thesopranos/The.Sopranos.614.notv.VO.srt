1
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,300
( Buzzing )

2
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,700
Frankie, where are you?

3
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,100
Welcome to the chop shop,
Cugine.

4
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,500
You can't kill
me twice, Sally boy.

5
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm already fucking
dead, remember?

6
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,100
I'm the boss, Michael.
What you had belongs to me.

7
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,000
Even the girl I loved?

8
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,600
What's mine is mine.
What's yours is mine.

9
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,900
( Grunts )

10
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Well...

11
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,400
This is mine too, Sally.

12
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,700
Now you can have it.

13
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
- Vaffancul'.
- ( screams )

14
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,400
Fuck Ben Kingsley.

15
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,200
Danny Baldwin took him
to fucking acting school.

16
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,200
Very well directed, Morgan.

17
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,900
I Think there's potentially
more money in this than in
the porn we've done.

18
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
So what do we think?
We need the extra scene or not?

19
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,900
I like it the way it is.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,500
I don't know, Rissy, 
these audiences today love blood.

21
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,200
I tend to agree with Carlo.

22
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm thinking
one more sexy kill.

23
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,900
When Michael follows
Centrella to the strip club,

24
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,200
What if he chops up one
of the women?

25
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,200
Carmine: who as fate
would have it,

26
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,600
Was at one time
Sally boy's mistress.

27
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,600
Two extra shoot days,
at a minimum.

28
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,800
- Kid, if it buys us a bullshit
theatrical release--
- ( cell phone buzzing )

29
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,400
I'm gonna have to get
more money from Tony.

30
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
I want this fucking thing
out there.

31
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
Yeah, T, what's up?

32
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
You talked to the guy
with the air mattresses?

33
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm in editing. We just
saw the cut of "cleaver."

34
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,000
- And?
- Awesome as is.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,700
The lawyer called, though.
We might have to change
the title.

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
The Eldridge Cleaver estate,
they with an injunction.

37
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,900
Listen, if you wanna see
some of it, we're finishing
the ADR after lunch.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
- What's that again?
- Sound dubbing.

39
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,700
Just call this dispatcher.
It's a holiday weekend.

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Thousands of people will
be out at the beach.

41
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm on it.

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
- He coming down?
- Please.

43
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,700
He don't give two shits
about production.

44
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,200
It's a little boring,
I gotta say.

45
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
I mean, that was
surising to me.

46
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,400
Mr. Sacrimoni,
how are you today?

47
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Isn't that for you
to tell me?

48
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,800
I wish I had
better news.

49
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
Based on the latest pictures,

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
The cancer has continued to 
metastasize from the lungs.

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,600
We now show masses
in the mediastinal
lymph nodes,

52
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,400
Both kidneys
and the brain.

53
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,800
The headaches.

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
So the...

55
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,300
Lobectomy, radiation,

56
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
The goddamn chemo,

57
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,800
What was all that?
( Coughs ) for kicks?

58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,300
Those were our options
at the time.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
And now what are
our options?

60
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,200
Limited to the extent
that I wouldn't
recommend any.

61
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,500
At this point, we're looking
at stage four small cell
carcinoma of the lungs.

62
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
- And there's no stage five.
- That's correct.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How long?

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Difficult to say.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
- I have seen miracles
over the years.
- Forget the miracles.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Three months.

67
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,000
Give or take.

68
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,400
Thank you
for your candor.

69
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
We have a plane
back to Springfield.

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,500
How you doing, John?

71
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
It's funny--
ironic-- whichever.

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,700
I got here.

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,700
I quit smoking
after 38 years,

74
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,900
Exercised, ate right.

75
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,100
And for what?

76
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Even still,

77
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
It was the right move.

78
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,300
( Man on television
speaks indistinctly )

79
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,100
( Men shouting )

80
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,600
Oh, there she is, my girl.

81
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,900
How are you, sweetie?

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
- Hey, dad.
- Hi.

83
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
What did Rosen say?

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,300
- How's the hotel?
You all settled in?
- It's fine.

85
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,700
- How are you, angel?
You look beautiful.
- I'm good.

86
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,800
- Eric sends his love.
- That's nice.

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
John, what about Rosen?

88
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know. I...

89
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,400
I don't know, sweetie.

90
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
- I'm very very sick.
- Oh my god.

91
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,000
( Crying )

92
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,000
All right, don't cry.

93
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't cry. You don't
have to make it any harder
than it is, all right?

94
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,100
No physical contact,
please.

95
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,400
- I Love you, John.
- I Love you, too.

96
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,700
- Daddy.
- I Know. I Know.

97
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Ladies, no contact.

98
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,100
All right.

99
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,500
You come back,
you see me again tomorrow.

100
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,900
We have more time, huh?

101
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,400
Could I bum one of those?

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
It's casual, though, right?

103
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
It's your cousin's movie
premiere. We should
dress accordingly.

104
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
It's what they call
a cast-and-crew screening.

105
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,800
It's in the city, Tony,

106
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,000
With an after-party
at some rooftop bar

107
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,700
In the meat-packing district.
That place is very chic now.

108
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,100
Meat packers?
I'm a happily married man.

109
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
Meadow: I'm telling you
it's not dress up.

110
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Carmela:
speaking of dress up,
Christopher told me

111
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,100
Kelli is having her wedding
dress made into an outfit

112
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,900
- For the baby
to be christened in.
- Oh, sweet.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
( Burps )

114
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,100
You all right?

115
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,000
Are you taking a date
to the screening?

116
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
If I can meet
a normal guy, maybe.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,900
I heard that

118
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,600
What, Finn wasn't normal?

119
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,100
I don't intend
to discuss Finn.

120
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,700
What about that guy
in your mcat review?

121
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,900
Please, he's completely
fixated his O-Chem final.

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,700
He wants to be a doctor.
Tell him it's educational.

123
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
There's body parts
all over this movie.

124
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,500
Hey, screw the movie.
I Just wanna hang
with celebs.

125
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Why, you think you're
gonna get to sleep
with Paris Hilton?

126
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
What? No.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Stop fidgeting
and eat your noodles.

128
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
- I don't want them.
- Where are you going?

129
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
The bathroom.
Jesus.

130
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,800
- Meow.
- You two have a fight?

131
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
I don't know.

132
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,400
Keep an eye on his temp, and
we'll finish out the week
on the ceftin.

133
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,900
You rest now.
I'll see you
in the morning.

134
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,900
- He should be on heparin.
- Excuse me.

135
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,800
Listen to him.
Check his ABG.

136
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm gonna have to ask you
again to not interfere,
Warren.

137
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,700
I'm gonna change your sheets.

138
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,300
So what are you,
The world's smartest orderly?

139
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,300
These days I am.

140
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
22 years a
practicing oncologist,

141
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,600
Specializing
in cancers of the liver.

142
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,600
Roll to your right,
please.

143
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,700
Let me spare us
the awkwardness.

144
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I killed my wife.

145
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,400
Not that it's
any justification,

146
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I had reason to suspect

147
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,200
She was cheating on me
with her chiropractor.

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,900
- Jesus.
- Granted, I was abusing
cocaine at the time,

149
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,500
And alcohol. 
But I came home one day

150
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,900
Shot her four times--
twice in the head.

151
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,500
I killed her aunt, too.

152
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,500
I didn't know she was there.
Roll over, please.

153
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,600
And the mailman.

154
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
At that point,
I had to fully commit.

155
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,700
Why are you here exactly?

156
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,700
I'Ve been accused
of being part

157
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,700
Of a certain
italian-american subculture.

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,500
( Laughs )
hey, I know who you are.

159
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,500
I meant,
what's wrong with you?

160
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Oh.

161
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,000
- Lungs.
- I'Ve been wanting
to meet you, actually.

162
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,500
I saw you on Bill Curtis.

163
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,600
- Warren Feldman.
- John sacrimoni.

164
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,100
Good to know you.

165
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
- I take it you done chemo, huh?
- Twice.

166
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Mind if I take a look
at your chart?

167
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
What about Gunga Din?

168
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Gupte? Fuck him.

169
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Oh, you're seeing Rosen.

170
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,500
They let me fly
to cleveland, my expense.

171
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
- You know him?
- I saw him speak once

172
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,200
At an ASCO conference
in Georgia.

173
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,600
- Good man.
- But...

174
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,300
Actually, very few
people know this,

175
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
But he really can't walk
on water.

176
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,500
What was his prognosis?

177
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Three months.

178
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,400
- With the treatment you've had?
- What do you mean?

179
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,700
You got a window
of one to three years.

180
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
What about the metastases?

181
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,000
Two rounds of paraplatin,

182
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,800
Docetaxel and platinol

183
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Concurrent with radiation?

184
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,100
Come on, any cancer
inside you has slowed
to a crawl.

185
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,200
Why is he so
fucking negative?

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,100
We tell the patient three
months. He lives a year.
Who looks like a hero?

187
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,100
I'll see you around, John.
You take it easy.
Hang in there.

188
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,100
Fuck me.

189
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,200
Tony, morning.

190
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,300
You got a sec?

191
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
As I told you,
my partner and I are

192
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
With the joint terror
task force now.

193
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,400
You're around Port Newark
often enough.

194
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,700
We're concerned about
what might come through
there from the middle east.

195
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
Yeah, and...

196
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,500
Let's talk terror funding.

197
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Most of it comes about
through illegal enterprise.

198
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,200
Our pitch is this,
and it's the same we gave
Christopher Moltisanti--

199
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,900
If he never
mentioned it:

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,200
If you or any
of your people ever heard
of anything going down,

201
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Middle easterners,
pakistanis,

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,200
You'd be helping us a lot
if you let us know.

203
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,000
I Think there's
a word for that.

204
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Your daughter takes
pre-med classes
in New York.

205
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
She use the tunnels?

206
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Just something
to keep in mind.

207
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,300
That's the last time
I'm going down
for the paper.

208
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,700
You tell that
fucking polack
to get here earlier

209
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
And bring up the paper with her

210
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Or she can go clean
somebody else's
fucking toilets.

211
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
What happened?

212
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,100
It's too dangerous.
Has been for years.

213
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,700
May I have your 
attention, please?

214
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,800
Welcome to the premiere
of "cleaver,"

215
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,700
The story of a young man
who goes to pieces

216
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,500
Then manages
to find himself again.

217
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
( Scattered laughter )

218
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,800
In all seriousness, however,

219
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,200
I'd like to say a few words.

220
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Much like a child,
a film has many parents,

221
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,500
That is to say
many individuals

222
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Who act like parents,

223
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Or that by aversion,

224
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,700
The film is their baby.

225
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,800
I, as an executive producer,

226
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Am one of those individuals.

227
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,300
Two more examples
are here with me tonight.

228
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,900
Ladies and gentlemen, 
my Co-E.P.
Christopher Moltisanti

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,300
And our director
Morgan Yam.

230
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Yeah, hey!

231
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
I Know you're all psyched
to see the movie,

232
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
So I'm not gonna give
a big speech here.

233
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I Just wanna give a shout out

234
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,000
To the man who without him

235
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,000
This whole thing would be 
impossible. Where is he?

236
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Anthony Soprano, everybody.

237
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,300
- Man: hey!
- Man #2: all right, Ton'!

238
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,700
Christopher: once he came
on board, the whole thing
fell together.

239
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,400
And all the other
investors, too.

240
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,700
Plus my wife Kelli
and our new baby.
I Love you guys.

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Okay, then. Cell phones off

242
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
And hope you
like the movie.

243
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,000
( Eerie music playing )

244
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,200
You don't know what?
He's a fucking rat!

245
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,000
- But we can't really prove it.
- You're gonna argue with me?

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,500
Frankie: no, it's just,
I mean, he's practically
like your own son.

247
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,700
I'm sorry, Sally.
I think we oughta
give him a pass.

248
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,500
I didn't ask you
what you fucking think.

249
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,600
Motherfucking
son of a...

250
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,800
- That's you.
- No.

251
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,900
- It is.
- You find where
this pezzonovante is

252
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,900
And you bring him
to the butcher shop.

253
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They're gonna find pieces
of this kid all over
fucking canarsie.

254
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,800
( Cell phone rings )

255
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,600
- Yeah.
- I'm sure he's fine, sweetie.
You gotta relax.

256
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,800
But for Michael not to have called
and the wedding's in two days.

257
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Who, the guatemalan?

258
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,100
Paulie:
what time is he
gonna be there?

259
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,100
I hate to say this,
but the truth is he ain't
good enough for you.

260
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,100
I mean, he's a good kid.

261
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,600
What you need is a man.

262
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Paulie:
tell him to put it
in the trunk

263
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,800
Woman: shh!

264
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,700
You know how long
I've been waiting
to do that?

265
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,100
( Dominique moaning )

266
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,300
Dad, that was neat
at the end, the creepy
figurine and the crucifix.

267
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,100
I'm glad you caught that,
Alexandra. Very observant.

268
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,000
The sacred and the propane.

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's a ton of people
wearing t-shirts here.
I told you.

270
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,700
Is it so horrible
you look nice?

271
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm starving.
I need to eat
something already.

272
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,300
I asked if you wanted popcorn.

273
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,100
- You want me
to make you a plate?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
- What?
- What? I'll give you what.

275
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,900
Come here.
The fucking boss
down in the cellar,

276
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,600
White bathrobe--
where'd you get that?

277
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,200
I don't know.
Artistic choice.

278
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,500
Seriously though,
I'm very proud.

279
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,900
Whatever else happens,
you made a movie, Christopher.

280
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Nobody could
take that away.

281
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,300
A hundred years from now,
we're dead and gone,

282
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
People will be watching
this fucking thing.

283
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
You know how much 
Imperia vodka
I scored just

284
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
From this
party alone?

285
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,000
I had a couple of cases
put down in your car, too.

286
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,500
Look at this--
the family of early man.

287
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,900
Great, thank you.

288
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,600
Carmine: hey, Danny,
come here.

289
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,500
Take a picture
with us. Phil Leotardo.

290
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Larry and I hung out
at the set. I don't
know if you know this,

291
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,400
But the actors,
they don't make up
what they say.

292
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,300
- It's true. Even De Niro, 
the girl told me.
- The script girl.

293
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,600
- Lorenzo Barese.
- Hey, how you doing, my friend?

294
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You getting enough to eat?

295
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Bryan Rawley,
u.s. Marshal's service.

296
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,400
Terms of your bail confine
you to your home, sir.

297
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,300
- Say hello to Danny?
- Yeah.

298
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,900
- Larry's wife: Larry!
- call the fucking lawyer!

299
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
- Larry!
- Rawley: excuse us, excuse us.

300
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
- Excuse us, excuse us.
- Leave him alone, you bastard!

301
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Jesus Christ.

302
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,700
There's Danny's manager.
I Better go talk to him.

303
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,700
There he is.

304
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,700
So how was Florida?

305
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,900
Hot and sticky,
like my balls.

306
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,500
I spoke to Ginny.
She's a wreck.

307
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
John's in the cancer ward.

308
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,500
She's down the road
in some fucking motel.

309
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,500
Poor prick.

310
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,500
Prison's not bad enough,
fucking lung cancer to boot.

311
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,500
Tell me about it--
quintuple bypass,

312
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Then the infection,

313
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Seven months
of physical thery.

314
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm just now starting
to get back to myself again.

315
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,600
Sausage, cioppino,
anything spicy

316
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Put me back in 
the emergency room,
I'm not careful.

317
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,900
( Sighs )

318
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,700
All in all,
we're lucky fucks.

319
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,600
I tell myself that
every day.

320
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,800
So now you're back.
How about you straighten
that family out?

321
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Not for me, Anthony.

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Obviously, healthwise,
being a boss is a young
man's game.

323
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Between the joint fitters
and the carpenters,

324
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,800
Those envelopes are light
er 10% each week.

325
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
I feel it, too.

326
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, word on the street
is Gerry's the favorite
to take over.

327
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,400
He's my protege.
I don't stand in his way.

328
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,300
There's a ringing endorsement.

329
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,900
- Hey, Tony.
- Doc, Doc.

330
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
- You know Danny, huh?
- How you doing, Mr. Soprano?

331
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,800
Doc: got a ticket
on the Jersey turnpike.

332
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,200
Broken windshield wiper.
I said he should talk to you.

333
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,700
- I'll take care of it.
- That's not necessary.

334
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
- Let's take a picture here.
- All right, chill out, Doc.

335
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,900
Man:
if you're Phil Leotardo
you cannot be happy

336
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,500
With the state of affairs,
despite appearances.

337
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,800
We're joined now via satellite
from Bainbridge Island,
Washington,

338
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,100
By Jerry's fellow
mob expert Manny Safier,

339
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,600
The author of the new book 
"The Wise Guide to Wiseguys."

340
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,100
Manny, welcome to the program.
How goes the book tour?

341
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,500
Thank you, Geraldo.
Excellent.

342
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
- Jerry, how are you?
- Manny.

343
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,900
So we're discussing the
apparent mob power vacuum
here in New York city.

344
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,400
Are you shocked that
there's still no successor
to John Sacrimoni?

345
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Not really.

346
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,800
I Mean, the last 10, 12 years,

347
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,600
That's been
a dysfunctional family.

348
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,200
And as Jerry said earlier,
there are several viable
candidates.

349
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,500
Well, viable,
I don't know.

350
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,900
You had Phil Leotardo
as the logical successor.

351
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,400
You also have 
Gerardo "Gerry" Torciano,

352
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,200
Also Faustino "Doc"
Santoro, who I believe
is the frontrunner.

353
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm surprised you
haven't mentioned
Carmine Lupertazzi, jr.

354
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,900
I Was about to, Manny,
before you interrupted.

355
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Manny:
in fact, if you take a look
at my book in chapter 14...

356
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,500
This Santoro thing,
I called it a year ago.

357
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,200
Hey.

358
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,900
Thank you for coming, Anthony.

359
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,700
I Know it's a long trip.

360
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,700
What, and miss a chance
to see Missouri?

361
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,900
So how's Jenny today?

362
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,100
She went with Allegra
to buy some stuff
for the kitchenette.

363
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, good,
clear her mind.

364
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,900
Reason I asked
you here today,

365
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,500
She's a bright kid,
your sister.

366
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,700
But business...

367
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
My life insurance,

368
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,700
I Want to put her
on a monthly stipend.

369
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,500
Probably a good idea.

370
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,900
Not all the doctors agree,

371
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,100
But if I do only
have a few months,

372
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,000
I Wanna take care
of all this now.

373
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Wait a second.
Which doctor doesn't agree?

374
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,300
Feldman, the guy
I told you about.

375
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,900
- The wife murderer?
- He's still a doctor, Anthony.

376
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,300
He was a highly-respected 
oncologist.

377
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,800
I Know, but, John--

378
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,500
He reviewed my case.

379
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,200
He says I could
hang on for years.

380
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,900
You're right.
He still has
the knowledge.

381
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,900
I mean, O.J. is no less
of a running back, right?

382
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,600
Let me ask you
something, Anthony:

383
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,400
How will I be remembered?

384
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,100
A wonderful husband.

385
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,700
A loving father.

386
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,000
On the street,
though, I mean.

387
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,600
From what I know,
you were well-liked, John.

388
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,700
Respected across
the board, despite
the allocution even.

389
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,200
God knows, guys have
actually named names

390
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,400
For a hell of a lot less than 
what you were looking at.

391
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,800
The only nega--

392
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,600
What?

393
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,700
When Carmine died
and you took over,

394
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,900
People felt you changed,

395
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,300
Became a little
trigger-happy, maybe--

396
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,600
A hothead.

397
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,700
God forbid

398
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Any of them
would find themselves

399
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,000
In that position.

400
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,100
It's a thankless job.

401
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,300
- What are you, hungover?
- What? I had two glasses of wine.

402
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,400
Why are you so pissy?

403
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,200
- The portrayal of that guy
in the movie.
- What guy?

404
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,600
- The boss, Tony.
- What about him?

405
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,300
It was based on you.

406
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,300
Yeah, I know,
you said the yelling.

407
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,900
It wasn't just the yelling.

408
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,700
Imitation's a form of flattery.

409
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,700
- You think that was flattering?
- It was okay.

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,400
He's a tough prick, that Baldwin.

411
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,300
What about the girlfriend?

412
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,200
- What girlfriend?
- The cleaver guy.

413
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
The lead character.
His entire motive for revenge.

414
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,900
I don't know.
You lost me, Carm.

415
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,900
Sally boy, the boss,
he fucked the guy's fiancee.

416
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,100
The thing with Adriana?

417
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
I told you it never
fucking happened.

418
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,400
Well, apparently,
your nephew feels otherwise.

419
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,600
Ro pointed it out to me,
but if she saw it, that
means other people did.

420
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
It's a movie.
It's fictional.

421
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,100
It's a revenge fantasy, Tony,

422
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,700
Which ends with the boss's
head split open
by a meat cleaver.

423
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,500
( Dance music playing )

424
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,600
Oh, there he is.
Good time last night?

425
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,800
Yeah, it was all right.
How about you?

426
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,300
Gab had fucking nightmares.

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
- Club soda, hon.
- Woman: sure.

428
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,300
So what did you think
of the movie?

429
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,500
Chrissy's the last person
I would have confused
with Marty,

430
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,500
But I gotta say,
it wasn't bad.

431
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,200
- Is he around?
- Chrissy? Nah.

432
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,200
He don't come around here
no more, you know that.

433
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,400
That Baldwin was
pretty good, huh?

434
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,200
He was a mean fuck.
I'll give him that.

435
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
And that girl that played
the fiancee, she was hot,

436
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,600
The one he was fucking.

437
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,400
It's weird how it works,
the creative process.

438
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,400
I'm watching that movie
"Edward Scissorhands,"

439
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,600
When boom, all of a sudden,
it hits me.

440
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,300
What if instead of a pair
of scissors, it's a meat
cleaver instead?

441
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,500
A couple years later,
you got a movie.

442
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,000
Originally, I thought
a ball-peen hammer,
but a cleaver's better.

443
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,300
I tell ya, man, it's like
I'm living somebody else's life.

444
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,400
You're just not comfortable
with success yet.

445
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
I Know. It's scary.

446
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,000
Feel the fear and do it anyway.

447
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,100
- Without chemicals, either.
- ( Cups clink )

448
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
So Kelli, the baby.

449
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,000
Good, fucking great.

450
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,500
She's a doll.
She cries a lot, though.

451
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,500
The baby, not Kelli.

452
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,900
I Hope you're taking the time

453
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,600
To reflect on all this.
Savor the good stuff.

454
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,500
Yeah-- no, I am.

455
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,700
There's my other sober buddy.

456
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,700
- Is that an FBI guy?
- Your tax dollars at work.

457
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,900
Does he follow you
around all the time?

458
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,300
They drop in and out.
It's fun.

459
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,100
Look, seriously,
think where you were
just three months ago.

460
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,000
You came into that meeting.
yo were so fucked up
you could barely talk.

461
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,900
And that woman friend
was even worse.

462
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,000
I'Ve been trying
to do what you said--

463
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,800
Hold back a little,
steer clear of old
habits, same people.

464
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,600
Must be hard, though,
given your lifestyle.

465
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,600
They already misinterpret,
I don't wanna hang around
so much.

466
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,200
Fucking Paulie especially

467
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Have you explained how hard
it is to be around alcohol?

468
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,700
- How familiar surroundings
set it off?
- They don't give a fuck.

469
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,300
"But he's fucking 
my wife, Carmine.
I want him dead,"

470
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,600
Jimmy says.

471
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,900
"He will be," he said,
"but not just right now.

472
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,200
He earns too much."

473
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,100
Eight years later,
Jimmy gets a call one day.

474
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
"Remember that guy who
we were talking about

475
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,900
Who's fucking your wife?
He can go."

476
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
The guy wasn't making 
him money no more.

477
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,700
And that was
Carmine Lupertazzi.

478
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,100
- Holy fucking shit.
- Yeah.

479
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,700
There you are.
We went--

480
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,400
John, what the hell
are you doing?

481
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,300
- What?
- You're smoking.

482
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
- So?
- Daddy, you're on oxygen.

483
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,700
Warren, pardon me, I'm sorry.

484
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,000
Just calm down, all right?

485
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,000
Calm down?
I don't fucking believe you.

486
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,500
( Sighs )
what do I got to lose, Gin?

487
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,200
What's the difference?

488
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,000
You told me dr. Feldman
doesn't agree with the others.

489
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,100
- Yeah, well.
- Miracles do happen, John.

490
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,900
Not to this family
they don't.

491
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,400
It's that kind of attitude
that probably brought this
on in the first place.

492
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
You're gonna start
with that again?

493
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,500
What about all these
six-year-olds with leukemia?

494
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,000
What's that from,
all their negative thinking?

495
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,600
( Coughing )

496
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,700
All due respect,
he's a great guy, Doc,

497
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,200
But boss material?

498
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,800
Important thing's
we all work together,

499
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,700
Whoever winds up
in the driver's seat.

500
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,900
Phil, though,
I'll never get it.

501
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,500
The man was my mentor.
It was right there
for the taking.

502
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,900
His heart, Gerry.
What was he gonna do?

503
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's my point, though,
what you just said.

504
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,800
Johnny goes away.
It's Phil's turn
in the driver's seat,

505
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,900
And his heart gives out.

506
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,100
- Right.
- his heart.

507
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,500
I Know, what?

508
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,400
It's a metaphor.
He lost his balls
is what I'm saying.

509
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Just say it then.
Walt fucking Whitman over here.

510
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,000
- Ladies.
- Hey.

511
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,900
- How you doing?
- Should we get some more wine?

512
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
This fucking waiter,
on sabbatical?

513
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,700
What's the name
of that sangiovese
we had at Quattro Gatti?

514
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,000
- The night your--
- ( sound drops out )

515
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,300
( Screaming )

516
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,000
Come on!

517
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,700
Let's go.

518
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,700
Yeah, give me
five dimes a piece

519
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,000
On st. Louis,

520
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,300
Minnesota and Baltimore.

521
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,800
I Would have invited you
to play, but we already
had our fourth.

522
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,400
You're not happy.

523
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
Let's order.

524
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,500
- What can I get you?
- Seared ahi, mixed greens

525
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,100
And an iced tea,
please.

526
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Philly cheesesteak.

527
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,000
You know what?
Give me an Arnold Palmer
instead of the iced tea.

528
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,000
- Okay.
- I Always enjoy those,

529
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,900
- But it never occurs to me
to order one.
- What the fuck, Carmine?

530
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
This family of yours.

531
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,500
Fucking senile Doc Santoro
uses one of my guys
as a diversion?

532
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,400
Sil could have got hurt.

533
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,900
Doc showed a lack of respect.

534
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,300
This fucking leadership, boy.

535
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,100
Step up, Carmine.

536
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,000
Get your hands around
this thing. You know
you got the support.

537
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
You never thought you'd
mutter those words, did you?

538
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,000
What do you want me to say?

539
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,700
I hear you, Tony,
and I'm flattered.

540
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,300
But boss--
I don't think so,

541
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,300
Especially now that Doc
has cemented his position.

542
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
Phil was bad enough
in the top spot,

543
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,300
But him I could
have lived with.

544
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,900
Here you go.

545
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,400
There was a time
I was obsessed
with being in charge.

546
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
- You remember?
- So do it.

547
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,100
One night around then
I had this dream.

548
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,600
It's my pop's 100th birthday,
even though he'd been dead
for years.

549
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,200
The whole family's there--
grandkids, everybody.

550
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,900
He's wearing one of these
gold paper crowns,

551
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,500
Like at Burger King.
Anyway, I give him his present

552
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,400
This mellifluous box--
ribbons,

553
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
He opens it up
then looks at me.

554
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,900
This gaze of absolute
disappointment.

555
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,300
There's nothing in the box.

556
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,300
So he hands it back to me.

557
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
"Go fill it up," he says.

558
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,300
"Come back when I'm 200."

559
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,800
So go for it, Carmine.

560
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,300
Fulfill that part of yourself.

561
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,700
We have this ritual
at my house for years.

562
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
Our kids are
in boarding school.

563
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,300
Every night I come home
from work, I strip down,
jump naked in the pool.

564
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,000
Nicole brings me
a scotch and water.

565
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,400
We sit, 
relax a little talk.

566
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I go up to bed,
the air conditioning.

567
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,700
She brings me a light
dinner on a tray.

568
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,300
One night during
all that fighting with John,

569
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,000
I Come home,
I'm exhausted.

570
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,800
So tired, so tense,
I skip the pool.

571
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,000
I go right upstairs,
flop on the bed.

572
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,100
Nicole comes up with a drink.

573
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,300
She says, "darling,

574
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,000
I think it's time
you took a rest."

575
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,000
I say, "I'm gonna.
We're gonna take a vacation."

576
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,300
She says,
"that's not what I meant.

577
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,400
I don't wanna be
the wealthiest widow
on Long Island.

578
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,200
I Want you to quit now."

579
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,200
I'm not ashamed to say
that she made me cry.

580
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,100
That wonderful loving woman.

581
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,800
That dream with my father,
the empty box--

582
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,100
It wasn't about being boss.

583
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,400
It was about being happy.

584
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
Warren, hi.

585
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,600
Hi, hon.
How's he doing?

586
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,500
Listen, I've been
meaning to talk to you
about the smoking.

587
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,000
John shared with me
how upset you were.

588
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,900
Psychologically,
when a person's
told they're dying,

589
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,900
It's the ultimate
loss of control.

590
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,900
To hear him wheeze 
like that...

591
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,200
I Know. 
It doesn't make any sense.

592
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,500
I do know he's a leader.

593
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,000
I suspect his smoking
on some level

594
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,100
Is an attempt
to die as he lived--

595
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,400
In total control.

596
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,600
Years ago, I asked him
to stop for me and the kids.

597
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,800
I lost 27 lbs.
He couldn't quit smoking?

598
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,200
I gotta go.

599
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,700
Goodbye, Caitlin.
I'll see you soon, muffin.

600
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh my god.
I love these little hands.

601
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,000
Thanks so much
for watching her.

602
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,300
You'd think we're planning
a coronation instead
of a christening.

603
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,600
- We all set?
- You know what?
I'd better pee.

604
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,000
Goody, I get
to keep holding you.

605
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,500
So how you doing?
Tony said you got an offer
on the house you built.

606
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,900
Two, actually, yes.

607
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,300
Ivana Trump.

608
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,200
I gotta be honest.
I am very disappointed
at what you did.

609
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,400
- What are you talking about?
- Your movie.

610
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,800
The boss sleeping with the 
other guy's fiancee?

611
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,400
- What?
- Please, like that wasn't
based on Tony and Ade.

612
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
What? No.

613
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,800
Carmela, I didn't
even write it.

614
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,000
Story by
Christopher Moltisanti.

615
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Isn't that what it said
up there on the screen?

616
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,800
Yeah, but that's just
for the Writers Guild
health insurance.

617
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,800
- Oh, really?
- Come on,
you can't be serious.

618
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,300
She's an oriental,
for Christ sake.

619
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,300
Have you heard
from Ade lately?

620
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,200
No, why would I hear from her?

621
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,800
Would it be so surprising?

622
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,900
She left me for some other guy.

623
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Is it any wonder?

624
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,300
Her poor mother is so upset, 
she's practically delusional.

625
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,600
She's convinced herself
that Ade is dead.

626
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,800
Her mother's an alky.
You know that.

627
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,400
Regardless, Christopher.

628
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,100
You're my cousin,
and I love you, Carmela,

629
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,000
But I don't like what
you're inferring here,

630
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,500
Either with the movie
or how I treated Adriana.

631
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,900
Kelli comes out,
tell her I went to smoke.

632
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,600
There's my pal.
How you doing?

633
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,500
"Billy Bathgate."
they had it in the library.

634
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
I thought of you.

635
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,100
I don't know if you heard,
but Gerry Torciano,

636
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,900
He was hit last week
in Brooklyn.

637
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,500
- Who?
- Gerry Torciano.

638
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
It was all over the news.

639
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,900
They whacked him
in some restaurant.

640
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Did you know him?

641
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,500
Yeah.

642
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I don't know.
Good guy.

643
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,500
It's hard to breathe.

644
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,900
I'll talk to Gupte,

645
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,600
See if I can get him
to up the beclovent.

646
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,300
I'm dying, aren't I?

647
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,000
It's not good.

648
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I Won't lie to you.

649
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,800
The aggressiveness
surprises me.

650
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,700
I gotta concur with Rosen.

651
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,900
I Appreciate everything
you've done, Warren.

652
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,000
- ( Doorbell ringing )
- ( knocking on door )

653
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,600
- Who is it?
- Christopher: you don't
answer your phone?

654
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I shut the ringer.
It's the middle of the night.

655
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,500
Woman:
honey, what's wrong?

656
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,000
Nothing, sweetie, it's
fine. Go back to sleep.

657
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,800
It ain't fine.
We got a problem.

658
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,300
That whole sequence with 
Sally boy banging the fiancee,

659
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,900
You gotta tell Tony
that was your idea.

660
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,900
It wasn't my idea.

661
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,500
What, are you fucking stupid
he probably thinks I put it
in there to embarrass him.

662
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,100
- Why did you put it in there?
- It was an idea.

663
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,800
I don't know.
Who knows where
they fucking come from?

664
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Isaac Newton invented gravity
'cause some asshole hit him
with an apple.

665
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,400
It's bad enough that I don't
get credit for my own ideas.

666
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,600
Now I'm supposed to take
responsibility for some shit
that's gonna get me in trouble?

667
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Fuck that, man.

668
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,100
Humanitas Award.
What's that?

669
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,300
Humanitas.
From the Paulist Brothers,

670
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,300
For writing themes
of socially redeeming--

671
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,600
Ow!

672
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Look out the window.
You see a fucking
Hollywood sign out there?

673
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Maybe you talk
to your agent like that,

674
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,100
But don't ever get fucking
snippy on me again.

675
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,900
The fucking scary thing was
I didn't know what happened

676
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,700
Till after the shot was fired.

677
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,800
Fucking weird.

678
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,800
- Tony, hey. Gentlemen.
- Hey, how are you?

679
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
T.J. Hooker.

680
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,800
J.T., actually, but uhm

681
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm looking for Chris.

682
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,700
I'm supposed to meet him.

683
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
What, here?

684
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,100
The thing is
he left me a message,

685
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,100
But this fucking verizon--

686
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,500
- Mind if I wait?
- Yeah, sit down.

687
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,700
- Diet coke, please.
- Woman: you got it.

688
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,500
So what did you think
of "cleaver"?

689
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,700
It's good, you know.

690
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
Congratulations.

691
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,000
I hope we're gonna see
some money soon.

692
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,600
Yeah.

693
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
As a writer,
you can never tell,
you know?

694
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,200
You come up with an idea.
You don't know how the audience
is gonna respond.

695
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,200
I mean, just 'cause I like 
something, I think of

696
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
Doesn't mean
anyone else will.

697
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,100
That's the challenge.

698
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,200
It is challenging sometimes,

699
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,700
Inventing characters,
how they interact.

700
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,000
The boss Sally boy
for example,

701
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,500
His whole persona--

702
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,700
I stole that from Broderick
Crawford in "Born Yesterday."

703
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,300
What's that?

704
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,900
Garson Kanin, 1950.
It's terrific.

705
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,800
William Holden falls in love
with Crawford's girlfiend,
played by Judy Holiday

706
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,100
The black girl,
the singer.

707
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
No, that's Billie Holiday.

708
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,600
Although Judy's character
in the movie

709
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,200
Is named Billie too, 
so I can see
why you're confused.

710
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,400
I've never seen it.
Why would I be confused?

711
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,100
Anyway, the Sally boy character

712
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,800
Is based on Crawford--
sort of a big, burly guy.

713
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,400
The love triangle,
the cuckolding of Michael,
sleeping with the fiancee,

714
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,600
Very similar to
the Holden-Holliday dynamic.

715
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
- So the whole thing was your idea.
- Apologies to Garcon Kanin.

716
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
- What happened to your head?
- What?

717
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,400
Oh. Cabinet.

718
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,000
Duh.

719
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,100
If I see Chrissy,
I'll tell him you were
looking for him.

720
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Now listen to me, you two heels.
I mean business.

721
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,200
I got too much at stake down here. 
You got somthing that belongs to me.

722
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,400
If you wanna get out of here alive, 
you better give it back.

723
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,300
Now I'm no blowhard.
Tell him.

724
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,900
He's no blowhard.
He's had people killed before.

725
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,600
- About six years ago,
there was this guy--
- shut up!

726
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,800
You ain't gonna be telling 
nobody nothing pretty soon.

727
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,800
This is the image of me
he leaves to the world.

728
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,000
I remember when he was born, 
I would hold him in my arms.

729
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,200
He was an adorable kid, too.

730
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,700
Big eyes.

731
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,300
You always talk about him

732
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,900
More like a son.

733
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,200
In some ways he was,

734
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
Especially after his dad died.

735
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,800
When he was little,
I used to give him rides.

736
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,100
I'd put him in the basket
of the butcher bike,

737
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,400
Pedal him around,

738
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,300
Back when Satriale's
made deliveries.

739
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,900
I reminded him
of that recently.

740
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,900
- He didn't remember.
- But you do.

741
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
We had fun.

742
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,900
All those memories,
and for what?

743
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
All I am to him
is some asshole bully.

744
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,900
You're hurt.

745
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,500
His dad Dickie was

746
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,000
Like my me to him.

747
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,400
A mentor.

748
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,300
Yeah, but more than that,

749
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
A friend,

750
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
A fucking guy
you could look up to.

751
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,500
And the hope is that
you pass that shit down,

752
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,000
The respect and the love.

753
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,000
And all I did
for this fucking kid

754
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,100
And he fucking hates me
so much.

755
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm sure on some level
he loves you, too.

756
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,800
Yeah?

757
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,800
Take that home.
Judge for yourself.

758
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,100
Last five minutes should 
answer that question.

759
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,900
I'm not going to do that.

760
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,900
- Not a horror fan?
- It's what you think
that matters.

761
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,800
I think he fucking despises me.
It's pretty obvious.

762
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,400
Wants to see me dead.

763
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,100
Without invalidating
your feelings,

764
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,900
Is it possible that
on some level

765
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,100
You're reading into all this?

766
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,400
I'Ve been coming here for years.

767
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,100
I know too much about 
the subconscious now.

768
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,500
Look, sweetie,

769
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,300
They're nice and clean
like you like them.

770
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,200
Mommy, he can't really hear you.

771
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,200
They're right here by the bed.

772
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,300
- Johnny: my...
- what, baby, your what?

773
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,200
Want more morphine, daddy?

774
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,100
Mo-- mother.

775
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,900
Grandma? What, daddy?

776
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Is he hallucinating?

777
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,200
Allegra:
I don't know. He could be.

778
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,800
Sometimes they see
people who've passed.

779
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,400
John, look at me, baby.

780
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,700
You want a cigarette, baby? 
John?

781
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,400
You can't do that when 
you're on my fucking team?

782
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Hey, Ton',
Anthony Infante to see you

783
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,100
Send him in.

784
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,200
There he is.
X-ray specs.

785
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,200
- How's John?
- That's why I'm here, Tony.

786
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,900
John passed away
late this morning.

787
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,400
Oh, fuck,
you're kidding me.

788
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,200
I only wish.

789
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,300
He was a great guy, John.
Sorry for your loss.

790
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,000
Thanks.
Honestly, though,
it was for the best.

791
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,000
What are you gonna do?

792
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,300
"I beat cancer,
but it took him out."

793
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,800
"Ride the painted pony.
Let the spinning wheel fly."

794
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,400
Huh?

795
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,500
John Sacrimoni,
a buon' anima.

796
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,800
All: a buon' anima.

797
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,900
Phil: we're here to celebrate
what would have been
my brother's--

798
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,500
Your uncle's--
47th birthday.

799
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,300
- Blow it out for him.
- ( Blowing )

800
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,100
( Cheering )

801
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,300
Right here at this bar,
this seat

802
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,800
Was uncle Billy's favorite 
place in the whole world.

803
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,700
More than Shea stadium?

804
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,300
More than Shea stadium.

805
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,500
He'd sit with his friends and 
tell stories about his family,

806
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,900
Who he loved more than anything
and was so very proud of.

807
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,000
From now on, his ashes
will be right here

808
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,100
So when his friends come 
to visit, he can see them.

809
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,000
- Can he see us now?
- Patty: yeah.

810
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,500
- Who knows who is
Leonardo Da Vinci?
- I do.

811
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,200
- Matty.
- Yeah, he wrote
"The Da Vinci Code."

812
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,000
Another man wrote that,
but it's a hideous
sacrilegious book.

813
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,400
- Annabella.
- He was a painter,

814
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,100
Of the "Mona Lisa."

815
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,600
Very good.
He was not only a painter,
he did medical drawings,

816
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,500
- And he designed a tank
for the army.
- Boy: wow.

817
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,500
Leonardo was a great italian,

818
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,700
And that was our name
originally, Leonardo.

819
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,100
But many years ago, when my 
grandpa came over from Sicily,

820
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,200
They changed it at 
Ellis Island to Leotardo.

821
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,800
What did they do that for?

822
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,200
Because they're stupid,
that's why, and jealous.

823
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,100
They disrespected
a proud italian heritage

824
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,900
And named us
after a ballet costume.

825
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,200
- Marissa.
- That's for modern.
In ballet, you wear tutus.

826
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
It doesn't make a difference.

827
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,700
- That's right, it doesn't.
- Can we have cake now?

828
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,200
How you doing, Phil?

829
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,400
You okay?

830
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,100
47--
He was a fucking kid.

831
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,000
Me, I'm an old man.

832
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,000
I'd like to do it over, boy. 
Let me tell you.

833
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
I fucking compromised
everything.

834
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,700
Nah, what are you
talking about?

835
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,500
20 years inside,

836
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,300
Not a fucking peep.

837
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,500
For what?
To protect the likes

838
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,900
Of Rusty fucking Millio,
Doc Santoro?

839
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,600
You were a man, Phil.
That's saying a lot nowadays.

840
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,900
That cocksucking piece of shit
Tony Soprano's cousin--

841
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,600
I can't even
say his name--

842
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,700
Murdered Billie.
And what did I do about it?

843
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,100
My weakness.

844
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,000
Sometimes I think
it's in my DNA.

845
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,100
My family took shit
from the Medigans

846
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,500
The minute we got

847
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,800
Come on, what the fuck

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
That's my fucking legacy.

850
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,200

851
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,400
No more of this.
