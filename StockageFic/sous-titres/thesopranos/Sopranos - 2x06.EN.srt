1
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,534
Our undergrad
student body at brown

2
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,037
only numbers
about 6, 000 people.

3
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,039
That's from every state
in this country

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,042
and from over 60 countries
in the world.

5
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,044
Admission is
extremely selective.

6
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
So, again, get all
of your academic

7
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,549
and extracurricular
ducks in a row.

8
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,551
Leave nothing to chance.

9
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,061
Hey, buddy.

10
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,562
Davie.

11
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,564
Saw your wife
out there alone.

12
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,066
I figured you
for the trotters.

13
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,067
Not tonight.

14
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,069
Had a customer
i couldn't shake.

15
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,571
Guy spends a half hour
deciding between

16
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,573
a $20 soccer ball
and a $22 soccer ball.

17
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,077
So, who do you like?

18
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,578
I don't know.

19
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,580
That guy from bowdoin seems to
be making some sense, i guess.

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,083
No, i mean
the game tonight.

21
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,584
Whoa!

22
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,087
You guys want
to be alone?

23
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,089
I saw that refreshment
table out there.

24
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,091
I knew you'd be lurkin
g around here somewhere.

25
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,093
I don't know how i always
get roped into this shit.

26
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,594
Charmaine's no fool.

27
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,096
She's knows one of your
shfooyadell in the right mouth

28
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,597
and her daughter can go
anywhere she wants to go.

29
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,599
So far, the janitor's
the only one going near them.

30
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,602
Well, that's a nice
career path for a young lady.

31
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,104
Fuck you.

32
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,106
I want to go get one
of them belly bombs.

33
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,109
Have i said
"fuck you" yet?

34
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,615
Freakin' delicious, artie.

35
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,117
Glad i didn't
eat tonight.

36
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,118
Thanks, davie.

37
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,120
It's nice to be appreciated
by your friends.

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,122
Oh, the sensitive chef.

39
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,623
Hey, eric,
they all done?

40
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,125
Yeah, i guess.

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,626
Um, dad,
can i have 20 bucks?

42
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,128
Are you like this?

43
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,629
What, did you think
he was coming over to say,

44
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,131
"gee, dad, thanks for
taking the time

45
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,133
to come to
this important event."

46
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,134
Ha, ha.

47
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,635
How you doing, eric?

48
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,636
Pretty good,
mr. Soprano.

49
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,138
You guys want
something to eat?

50
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,140
Ah, no, we're going
to starbucks.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,642
I hear you're thinking
of going to brown, right?

52
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,644
Yeah, it's a good school.

53
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,146
Lot of star fucking,
though.

54
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,647
Hey, latrine lip...

55
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,149
he's right.

56
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,650
This jamoke'll go
wherever his mother tells him.

57
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,151
No different than
his old man.

58
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,152
You, too?

59
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,653
You know, in high school,

60
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,155
these guys were like
joe namath and y. A. Tittle.

61
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,656
Yeah, i've heard.

62
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:52,165
And now, they're like
phil donahue and alan alda.

63
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,166
Listen, uh...

64
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,667
i heard through
the grapevine

65
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,169
that you're taking over
your uncle's game.

66
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,171
You know,
the big one.

67
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,173
Grapevine.

68
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,174
Yeah.

69
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,176
You know, if you listen
close to that song,

70
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,178
it says believe none of
what you hear and a
half of what you see.

71
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,180
No, it's just,
you know me...

72
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,181
i like to play a little.

73
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,182
A little.

74
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,683
Forget it.

75
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,185
This game'
s not for you.

76
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,188
No, it's just, you know, i was
thinking it would be a kick.

77
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,190
David.

78
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,692
You're a nice guy,
i like you, okay.

79
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,694
But trust me,
this game's not for you.

80
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,696
I don't want to
see you get hurt.

81
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,698
These guys,
they play deep.

82
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,702
You know how many jockstraps
i sold last week.

83
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,704
Not enough for
this game, okay.

84
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,705
Forget it.

85
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,707
C'mon.

86
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:42,215
Let's go see what the wayo
from bucknell's got to say.

87
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,217
Do you want to tell me
what you're thinking?

88
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,720
Believe me, you don't
want to know.

89
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,229
You want to know
what i'm thinking?

90
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,730
Seriously?

91
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,233
I'm thinking i'd like
to take a brick

92
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,235
and smash your fucking face
into fucking hamburger.

93
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,738
Okay.

94
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,242
I'm not--

95
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,744
don't worry.

96
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:18,751
I know i broke your
coffee table and it's
not gonna happen again.

97
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,753
You asked, i told.

98
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,755
But you'd like to
smash my face.

99
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,257
Not really.

100
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,759
It's just the way of
describing how i'm feeling.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,262
Do you think making
hamburger out of me

102
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,263
would make you
feel better?

103
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,764
Mother of christ,
is this a woman thing?

104
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,266
You asked me
how i'm feeling.

105
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,268
I tell you
how i'm feeling.

106
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,270
And now, you're gonna
torture me with it.

107
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,272
I don't know who
the fuck i'm angry at.

108
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:46,279
I'm just angry, okay.

109
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,280
Why the fuck
am i here?

110
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,782
I even asked
to come back.

111
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,284
I got the world
by the balls

112
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,286
and i can't stop feeling
like i'm a fucking loser.

113
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,788
Who makes you feel like
a loser, your mother?

114
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,291
Oh, please, we wasted
enough oxygen on that one.

115
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,294
It's everythin
g and everybody.

116
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,797
I see some guy walking
down the street,

117
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,798
you know,
with a clear head.

118
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,800
You know the type.

119
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,802
He's always fucking
whistling like the
happy fucking wanderer.

120
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,304
I just want to
go up to him

121
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,805
and i just want to
rip his throat open.

122
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,807
I want to fucking
grab him and pummel him

123
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,310
right there for
no reason.

124
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,313
Why should i give a shit
if a guy's got a clear head?

125
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,315
I should say "a salut",
good for you.

126
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,818
Let's get back to
smashing my face.

127
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,320
Jesus christ.

128
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,821
Oh!

129
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:35,828
No, i think it
all ties in.

130
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,330
Alright.

131
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,832
Sometimes i resent you
making me a victim,

132
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,334
that's all.

133
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,336
I make you feel
like a victim.

134
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,337
Yeah.

135
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:45,838
Remember the first
time i came here?

136
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,342
I said the kind of man
i admire is gary cooper,

137
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,843
the strong, silent type.

138
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,845
And how all americans,

139
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,348
all they're doing is crying
and confessing and complaining.

140
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,849
A bunch of
fucking pussies.

141
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,351
Fuck'em!

142
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,353
And now, i'm one of them,
a patient.

143
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,356
Your parents made it impossible
for you to experience joy.

144
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,857
Yeah, see,
there you go again.

145
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,360
You said yourself you're
not the happy wanderer.

146
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,362
Well, i'm more like
one of those assholes

147
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,364
than i am the fucking
jerkoffs and douchebags

148
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,867
i see leaving this office.

149
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,370
Stop with the faces already,
what do you got?

150
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,372
Three eights full.

151
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,373
Santa maria, yes!

152
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,874
Santa maria.

153
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,876
More like fucking
santa claus.

154
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,877
Did you cut the pot?

155
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,878
Twice.

156
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,380
Here.

157
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,382
Make sure you spend it in
my restaurant, you prick.

158
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,383
One chip.

159
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,385
Ah, va'napola.

160
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,886
He can't even buy
mcdonalds with that.

161
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,887
No, no, that's it,
i got to go.

162
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,389
Oh, c'mon, artie,
another hour.

163
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,890
I can't.

164
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,392
Charmaine'll have my balls
on the menu tomorrow.

165
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,393
Cash me out.

166
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,894
Look at all the money.

167
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,396
Hey, rich,
can i get another dime?

168
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,897
We only got
three players left.

169
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,399
So, what,
vito's up for it, right?

170
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,401
Where the fuck
do i got to be?

171
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,402
Only...

172
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,903
let's up the ante.

173
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,905
Are you sure?

174
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,407
You're into me for
seven g's already.

175
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,908
Is that all?

176
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:56,909
I'll make that back
from vito in an hour.

177
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,916
Count this chooch
out another dime.

178
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,449
Well...

179
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:37,950
we have our work
cut out for us.

180
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,952
Gudren?

181
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,472
Meadow.

182
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,974
I'd like to talk to
you for a second.

183
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,977
It's really sounding
pretty good.

184
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,979
I know you're
disappointed, but...

185
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,481
it's just when you try
out for cabaret night,

186
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,982
the form asked,
what you want to do,

187
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,484
and i checked off solo.

188
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,485
You're seniors.

189
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,487
This is your last
chance at cabaret.

190
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,489
Gudren hasn't had
a solo in four years here.

191
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,990
I'd like to give
everybody a shot.

192
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,494
Mrs. Gaetano, i was a sophomore
when i did "spider woman".

193
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:28,000
Now, it's important
because of college and all.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,001
You okay with this?

195
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,503
Do i have a choice?

196
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,504
Yeah, you got a choice.

197
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,005
You can continue
to run the game.

198
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,509
You know i'm under fucking
house arrest, you cute fuck.

199
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,511
Then take the bite
i give you and be happy.

200
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,514
Either way, i'm having
the executive game.

201
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,516
You know, your father and me
started that game

202
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,017
over 30 years ago.

203
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,520
We were talking one day about
how the credit card companies,

204
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,522
you know,
they work their angle.

205
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,023
They didn't care
what the fuck you bought

206
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,025
as long as you didn't
pay all at once.

207
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,527
They juice you to death.

208
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,529
And you thank them for letting
you have a card.

209
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,531
You'd rather be juiced
then pay all at once.

210
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,033
That's a certain
kind of player.

211
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,036
That's why we call it
the executive game.

212
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,539
My brother, johnny,
was one keen motherfucker.

213
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,543
Oh, yeah, that's why he
left us with chi- chi beans.

214
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,545
You don't know what
you're talking about.

215
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,548
Your father left livia
with a fuckin' package

216
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,550
that could choke
a fucking elephant.

217
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,552
I got to tell you?

218
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,555
She's like a woman with
a virginia ham under her arm,

219
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,057
crying the blues
'cause she has no bread.

220
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,058
Please...

221
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,561
they don't make'em
like johnny.

222
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,563
And keep in mind that
he paid the freight

223
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,564
for your uncle eckley.

224
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,066
That was a major
fucking nut.

225
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,067
Who?

226
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,569
Who the fuck is eckle?

227
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,570
Forget it.

228
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,071
Keep thinking
you know everything.

229
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,073
Some people are so far
behind in the race

230
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,075
that they actually
believe they're leading.

231
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,076
Yeah, that's cute.

232
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,578
Who the fuck is eckle?

233
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,579
Eckley, eckley.

234
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,080
Let's talk about
something else.

235
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,582
No, you opened this clam,
my friend.

236
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,583
Who is he?

237
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,584
You don't know him.

238
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,085
It's water
under the bridge.

239
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,588
Just know that me and your
father looked out for him.

240
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,089
He wanted
for nothing.

241
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,090
Fuck you, fuck eckle.

242
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,592
I don't got time
for this shit.

243
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,093
He was my younger brother.

244
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,595
He was between me
and your father in age.

245
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:03,596
His name was eckley.

246
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,600
Actually, ercoli-- hercules.

247
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,605
Named after
my grandfather.

248
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,106
What are you saying?

249
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,609
I got another uncle?

250
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,110
Sharp as a fucking
cue ball.

251
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,112
Yeah, i'm saying.

252
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,614
Your father and
me had a brother you
didn't know about.

253
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:27,119
'Cause he was...

254
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,121
it was different
in those days.

255
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,624
Mother and father didn't
even speak the language.

256
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,626
They couldn't take
care of a kid like that.

257
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,129
God bless your grandmother.

258
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,133
She went to every charity home
in this fucking state

259
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,136
till she found one
that she felt would
take good care of him.

260
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,638
What are you saying,
he was retarded?

261
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,640
Why don't you
go fuck yourself.

262
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,642
He was slow.

263
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,645
He was strong
as a fucking bull,
handsome like george raft.

264
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,148
If it was today, they migh
t have trained him to be a...

265
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,651
whatever or something.

266
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,152
Get him a job.

267
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,656
They didn't understand
these things back then.

268
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,158
Jesus.

269
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,661
What were we thinking?

270
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,663
Un- fucking- believable.

271
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,165
I remember my mother
and my father arguing about--

272
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,667
something, i don't know.

273
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,168
And, uh...

274
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:20,172
she kept talking about my
father's feeble- minded brother,

275
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,677
but i always thought
she meant you.

276
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,180
What a kick
in the balls.

277
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,182
When did he die?

278
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,684
Not long before
your father.

279
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,187
Past is the past,
this is the present.

280
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,189
Let's talk about
this game.

281
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,691
What's my end?

282
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,193
I don't know.

283
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,194
Ten percent.

284
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,696
20.

285
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,198
15.

286
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,200
Call your friends.

287
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,704
Let them know
the game's happening.

288
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,217
Can i help you
with something, sir?

289
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah, i want to buy
a boat with three propellers.

290
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,722
What?

291
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,224
Kid, you see m
e here every week.

292
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,226
When are you
gonna stop asking?

293
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,728
Ho, rich.

294
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,230
There a problem?

295
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,233
No, i'm just breaking
your kid's balls.

296
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,243
Like the pimp says to his'hos,
"keep'em coming."

297
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,244
Hey, rich.

298
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,246
That envelope's
two c shy.

299
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,748
I'll catch up on
it next week.

300
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,249
It's no problem.

301
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,251
I just got caught a little
off guard this month.

302
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,252
You know, i took
a second on the house,

303
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,254
didn't calculate
into my budget.

304
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,255
No biggie.

305
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,256
No good, davie.

306
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,257
It's just a stutter step.

307
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,759
Like i said,
it's no biggie.

308
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,260
The difference gets
tacked onto the principle.

309
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,262
And you know that.

310
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,764
Yeah, i understand.

311
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,266
Don't take
this personally.

312
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,770
But i don't want to see
your face at any of my games

313
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,772
until you're caught up.

314
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,273
C'mon, rich,
that's not necessary.

315
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,777
Kid, you think i started
this life ten minutes ago?

316
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,279
A guy hands you
a light envelope,

317
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,283
it's just the beginning,
nothing personal.

318
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,285
Yeah, i know,
but it's just this week--

319
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,286
i know.

320
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,288
It's just a stutter step.

321
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,798
What kind is that?

322
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,799
Brazilian snapper.

323
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,300
Is it fishy?

324
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,301
It's fish.

325
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,803
You know what i mean.

326
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,303
It's for pizziola.

327
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,809
Let me smell it.

328
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,310
You want something
or what?

329
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,813
Yeah, give me some of that,
enough for 15 people,

330
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,314
10 pounds of shrimp.

331
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,823
It's gonna be some
serious money there.

332
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,325
This is no
nickel- and- dime shit.

333
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,829
These motherfuckers
can play for two
days straight sometimes.

334
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,330
Now, once you start work,

335
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,833
you don't go till
the game breaks up

336
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,836
and that fucking place looks
like an operating room.

337
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:08,340
You mean, we're like
cleaning guys.

338
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,342
Oh, what the fuck
are you doing?

339
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:11,844
Something ain't right.

340
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,345
Fucking "a".

341
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,847
I just saw you put
your finger on the scale.

342
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,848
No, i didn't.

343
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:16,849
You pull that shit with
the old ladies, not with me,

344
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,350
you fucking hump.

345
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,351
I didn't put my finger
on the scale.

346
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,353
I don't believe this shit.

347
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,855
Where are you going?

348
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:23,856
Wrap that up.

349
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,357
I got to weigh it.

350
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:25,858
You got to what?

351
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:33,365
You got to rob me.

352
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,869
Yeah, you serve some booze,
empty the ashtrays.

353
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,871
Oh, oh, that reminds me.

354
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,374
Whatever you do, don't engage
silvio in conversation.

355
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,877
He can be a sick fuck
when he's gambling.

356
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,879
One night, he was
down like 50 large.

357
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,883
At some point he sneezes,
fritzi says "salut".

358
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,384
Fritzi neste
from hoboken?

359
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,385
Yeah, you know him?

360
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,887
No--

361
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,388
then shut the fuck up
and let me finish, alright.

362
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,890
Anyway, fritzi says,"salut",

363
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,892
silvio thinks he says
something else,

364
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,893
forget it.

365
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,894
For the rest of the night,

366
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,396
silvio's blaming fritz
i for his losing streak,

367
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,397
the fucking nut.

368
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,398
What do you
think he said?

369
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,900
Are you listening
to me or what?

370
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,905
He's a fucking nut,
who knows?

371
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,406
Here.

372
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,409
But i didn't put my finger
on no fucking scale.

373
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,913
Put that shit in the trunk
so it don't stink up the car.

374
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:25,918
Pay for the fish.

375
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,419
This guy for real
or what?

376
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,921
What, are we
fucking piss boys?

377
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,423
C'mon, let's get
the fuck out of here.

378
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,444
We want the room with
the stove and the refrigerator.

379
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,447
The efficiencies have been
booked to paying customers.

380
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,449
Muovono.

381
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,951
And the two rooms
on the sides.

382
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,452
We may be here
for some days.

383
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,954
You people are ruining
this place.

384
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,455
That's your father fault.

385
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,957
He made it
a business deal.

386
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,459
We want a lot
of clean towels

387
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,962
and the bathroom's
fresh- smelling.

388
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,466
I should work
for nothing?

389
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:18,971
Guernica.

390
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,974
You ever
suck his dick?

391
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:27,980
I make that beanie spi
n when i work his thing.

392
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,485
Am i right?

393
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,991
Don't bitch to me.

394
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,014
What do you hear?
What do you say?

395
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,517
License and registration.

396
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,519
How about if i give you
one of these instead.

397
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm wearing a vest.

398
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,022
Oh, yeah?

399
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,024
If i shoot,
it's going in your brajol.

400
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,526
You're a real sick fuck,
you know that?

401
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,529
Danny boy.

402
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,531
How's your family?

403
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,033
Not bad, paulie.

404
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,535
We had to move my father
to another old folks' home--

405
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,538
hey, i got my own
fucking problems.

406
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,041
You're a fucking hard- on,
you know that?

407
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,043
How many times am
i gonna fall for that?

408
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,544
Here.

409
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,047
Hey, listen,
do me a favor, alright.

410
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,049
Your friends,
players or no,

411
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,052
they don't fuck
with the tourists

412
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,053
and the hotel guests,

413
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,554
keep the noise down
and no gunshots

414
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,056
or we got to
take the call.

415
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,057
Yeah, yeah.

416
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,060
Go play cops
and robbers.

417
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,061
Make it four.

418
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,062
Change coming.

419
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,065
To you.

420
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,566
Mike.

421
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,567
Hey, mike!

422
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,568
Matt.

423
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,571
Tony wants you.

424
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,572
Yeah, t.

425
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,574
Tony.

426
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,575
You got the macanudos?

427
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,576
Yeah, you want one?

428
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,578
Yeah, give one to me
and one to dr. Fried.

429
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,579
Alright.

430
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,086
Alright, gentlemen, frank.

431
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,087
Yeah, i'm in.

432
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,091
Me, too.

433
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,092
Thanks.

434
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,094
$400 to you, sil.

435
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,096
What's in the pot?

436
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,600
About $2400.

437
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,102
Too early to chase
an inside straight.

438
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,103
Doc.

439
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:35,107
Call'em.

440
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,608
Macanudos,
you want one?

441
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,110
Go ahead,
take a walk.

442
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,111
Don't let him scare you.

443
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,113
He's not really
a nasty fuck.

444
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,115
He's an incredibly
nasty fuck.

445
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,616
Hey, chair boy
of the board,

446
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,618
read your
fucking cards.

447
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,120
$400 to you, john.

448
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,622
Shakespeare
straightening out.

449
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,624
Paulie doesn't
have shit as usual.

450
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,628
And the prick doctor
may be flushing.

451
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,630
Put the tv trays out,
one between two players.

452
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,632
And put some of
this shit on them.

453
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,635
Don't give anybody booze unless
they ask for it, alright?

454
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:09,641
Okay.

455
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,142
Yeah.

456
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,143
I heard tony was here.

457
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,144
Soprano.

458
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,145
I'm a friend of his.

459
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:13,645
Do i know you?

460
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,147
Yeah, you know me.

461
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,651
I own "ramsey's sports
and outdoor".

462
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,652
Doc.

463
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,155
And you, sir.

464
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:34,666
Davie.

465
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,667
What the hell
you doing here?

466
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,668
Hey, i was just driving by,

467
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,171
i thought i'd stop
and say hello.

468
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,672
Some place
you got here.

469
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,674
Yeah, regular taj mahal.

470
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,676
So, have you heard
the kids, not bad?

471
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,178
Bad enough carmela
dragged me to that play.

472
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,180
If i never hear
that song again,
it'll be too soon.

473
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,182
The only area eric's light
in is the arts.

474
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,184
This performance stuff's gonna
put him over the goal line.

475
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:56,688
Most schools
he's applying to.

476
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,690
So, what's the game?

477
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,192
7 card.

478
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,693
Was that frank sinatra, jr.
In there?

479
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,694
Yeah.

480
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,196
He's a friend
of my uncle's.

481
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,197
He flies in.

482
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
Wow, this really i
s an executive game.

483
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,202
So, what do you think?

484
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,703
There's a resemblance.

485
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,205
No, no, no,
i mean the game.

486
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,706
You think i can take
these guys or what?

487
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,707
Davie.

488
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,209
This isn't
a game for you.

489
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,710
Oh, c'mon.

490
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,711
What are the chances of me
getting close to a game

491
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,712
like this again?

492
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,214
C'mon, anthony,
let me sit in just once.

493
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,715
I don't do business
with outside friends,

494
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,217
you understand.

495
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,219
Hey, do i have to show
your high school prom picture

496
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,220
to these guys?

497
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,721
All kidding aside,

498
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,224
i appreciate your position, but
c'mon, tony, i'm a big boy.

499
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,725
What are you holding?

500
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,227
I didn't really
expect to gamble tonight.

501
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,728
You need five g's
just to sit in this game.

502
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,230
Oh, c'mon,
can't you float me?

503
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,731
You know, short term.

504
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,234
Davie, don't say short
if you don't mean short.

505
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,236
All kidding aside.

506
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,238
You understand
what i'm sayin' to you?

507
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,739
Yeah, of course.

508
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,742
Hey, you don't have to
explain business to me.

509
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,751
I got no business
in this game.

510
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,755
$800.

511
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,257
Christopher.

512
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,259
Say hello to
davie scatino.

513
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,260
How you doing?

514
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,761
Give him five
boxes of ziti.

515
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,265
Good luck.

516
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,766
Okay, fella's,
make room.

517
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,270
New blood coming in.

518
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,279
So, there's a lot of money
in sporting goods, huh.

519
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,780
Yeah, frank,
but i tell you, you know,

520
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,783
nike has its stores,
the nba has its own stores.

521
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,784
It cuts in.

522
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,286
It's just
temporary though.

523
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,289
I got some ideas
for next year.

524
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,791
Hey, davie, ask the do
c what his specialty is.

525
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,793
Hard- ons.

526
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,295
I wanted him to ask.

527
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,796
Really?

528
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,797
Penile implants.

529
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,798
Hey, doc.

530
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,300
Please, i've heard
all the jokes.

531
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,301
Pot's right.

532
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,303
Sixth street,
here we come.

533
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,305
No help.

534
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,307
Mysteries abound.

535
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,309
Shut the fuck up
and deal, will you.

536
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,311
Nine of spades,
thank you.

537
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,313
Six clubs.

538
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,815
Get a broom and sweep up some
of that shit over there,

539
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,817
especially under
silvio, alright?

540
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,319
Pair of kings.

541
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,820
What's the bet?

542
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,322
$800.

543
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,824
What the fuck could
you possibly have?

544
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,326
Incredible luck.

545
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,328
You're telling me,
you miserable fuck.

546
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,330
Bet or check.

547
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,331
Don't rush me, sunshine.

548
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,333
You've been rushing me
all fucking night!

549
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,334
He didn't study this
hard in school.

550
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,336
John, please,
the bet's not to you.

551
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,337
Good.

552
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,838
Dealer controls
the game.

553
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:27,839
Thank you.

554
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,841
Do you fucking mind?

555
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,343
Jesus, do you ever
shut the fuck up?

556
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:36,848
And blow that fucking
smoke somewhere else!

557
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:37,849
What the fuck
are you doing?

558
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,351
Sil, take it easy.

559
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,852
I'm losing
my balls over here!

560
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,354
This fucking moron's
playing hazel.

561
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,356
Get the fuck
out of here!

562
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,857
I was just trying to
sweep the cheese away--

563
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:46,858
why?

564
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,859
Why now?

565
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,361
Leave it there.

566
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,362
I don't know,
i was just--

567
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:51,863
what?

568
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,865
Where do you get
these fuckin' idiots, huh?

569
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,367
Where do you get them?

570
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,369
He's sweeping the cheese,
i'm trying to get--

571
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,371
leave the fucking cheese
there, alright!

572
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,373
I love fucking cheese
at my feet!

573
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,375
I stick motherfuckin'
provolone in my socks at night,

574
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,378
so they smell
like your sister's
crotch in the morning.

575
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,879
Alright?

576
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,882
Leave the fucking
cock- sucking cheese
where it is!

577
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,884
Here, here, here.

578
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:13,885
Go ahead.

579
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:20,392
Have a good time.

580
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:20,892
$800.

581
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,394
Call.

582
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,395
Hey, why don't you go
fix a fucking dick

583
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,397
or whatever the fuck
it is you do.

584
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,899
Hey, dr. Fried, you know
about that viagra shit?

585
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,401
He won't quit,
this fucking guy.

586
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,403
Go ahead.

587
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,404
I heard they were
sinking a crate of it

588
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,406
down to the titani
c to try and raise it.

589
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,907
Very good, very good.

590
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,909
Alright, down and dirty.

591
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,913
Last card,
automatic $1200 bump.

592
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,915
Kings rule the realm.

593
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:48,420
Kings talk.

594
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,421
Check.

595
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,424
Door's wide open,
dr. Fried.

596
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,925
Check.

597
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,427
David.

598
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,431
He checks.

599
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,433
Bet $1200.

600
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,435
I'm gonna call.

601
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,937
Because you ain't
got dick.

602
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,439
Can i steal
this fucking hand?

603
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,441
I think i can.

604
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,942
I'll raise 12.

605
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,944
See, you should
have checked.

606
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:13,945
You got shit.

607
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,449
Now it's gonna cost
you another bet.

608
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,451
Call'em.

609
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,955
Oh, fuck.

610
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,458
Let's see'em, boys.

611
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,959
Trips.

612
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,460
Three deuces.

613
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,961
Cry me a river.

614
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,464
Three beautiful kings.

615
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,466
Flush.

616
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,468
You motherfucker.

617
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,470
You slow rolled me.

618
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,971
What the fuck were
you doing in that hand?

619
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,473
His money's good.

620
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,475
He wants to sail,
it's his business.

621
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,976
Fuck you, too.

622
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,978
I should have stayed
with my goomah tonight.

623
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:50,482
Hey, cheese fuck,
get me some food.

624
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,003
I'm so pissed.

625
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,004
Good morning.

626
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,506
Hunter just called me

627
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,509
and told me rachel weiss got an
early acceptance to wesleyan.

628
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,010
And you didn't
expect it?

629
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,512
No.

630
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,513
Think about it.

631
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,014
Did you ever
see her mom?

632
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,016
Please, i'm blacker
than her mother.

633
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,518
Well.

634
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,521
Should have mentioned
that on your application.

635
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,543
What time is it?

636
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,544
It's almost nine.

637
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,546
How we doing?

638
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,548
Slowing down.

639
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:04,055
Alright, see if they want
to close the lights.

640
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:10,562
Thanks.

641
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,064
Anybody want
more coffee?

642
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,566
Yeah, please, tony.

643
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:19,070
Put a little'buca in it
for me, would you?

644
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,071
Anyone want to
close the lights?

645
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,573
Is that a game?

646
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,575
He's a pisser, this kid,
is it a game?

647
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,577
Closing the lights means--

648
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,079
it means, do you want to admit
that you lost and pack it in.

649
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,080
Me?

650
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,081
No.

651
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,082
Alright, cut please.

652
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,083
Here you go.

653
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,585
Thank you, francis.

654
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,586
Coming out.

655
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:39,591
To sil, to the doctor,
how about a winner this time?

656
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,093
How much is he
into us for?

657
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,596
About 45 boxes of ziti.

658
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,097
What?

659
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,599
He grabbed another ten
while you were asleep.

660
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,601
He said you okayed it.

661
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,104
Go get that.

662
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:10,622
Look at this
fuckin' line up.

663
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,123
Ho, johnny sack.

664
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,126
Must've had free
tokens at the tunnel.

665
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:19,631
How'd you expect to make a dim
with this fuckin' stonewaller.

666
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,639
How did you
get in here?

667
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,140
Same as you.

668
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,142
Through the front door.

669
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,644
Hi, rich.

670
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,645
Hi, rich?

671
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,647
You want some lox.

672
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,148
I got some nice,
fresh lox.

673
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,150
You got some fucking balls,
you know that?

674
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,652
What'd i do?

675
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:45,156
I should stab you in
the fucking eye.

676
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,157
Hey, c'mon, rich.

677
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:46,658
Get your hand off of me.

678
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,660
I'll put one in your head.

679
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,161
Hey, don't fucking
threaten me, richie.

680
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,663
Don't threaten you?

681
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,665
I got a hard- on
for you already.

682
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:58,670
Give me a reason.

683
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,171
Don't let me fucking
embarrass you.

684
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:05,677
Outside now,
i want to talk!

685
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,679
Christopher,
get everybody a drink,

686
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,180
i'll be right back.

687
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,682
That's it, cash me out.

688
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,684
No, c'mon, frank, doc.

689
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,185
Sit down.

690
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,687
You know,
it's a misunderstanding,

691
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,688
right, richie?

692
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,689
No, no, tony, i'm wiped.

693
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,190
I'll settle up
with you next game.

694
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,192
Give my regard
s to your uncle.

695
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,694
Let me get you a little
breakfast, c'mon.

696
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,195
Nah, no really.

697
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,698
I got tickets for
the rueles- harris
fight tonight.

698
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,199
Oh, yeah.

699
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,201
Matt, thanks a lot.

700
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,202
Here's one
for your pal.

701
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,704
Cash me out,
will ya, sunshine?

702
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,706
Thank you,
mr. Sinatra, jr. , sir.

703
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,208
I shut him
the fuck down.

704
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,211
He comes here
and he sticks it up my ass!

705
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,213
What's that got to do with you
disrespecting my game?

706
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,215
Like you wouldn't do
anything different?

707
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,217
You're fucking right.

708
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,721
You know, tony,
i'm getting sick of this
"holier than thou" act.

709
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,222
And i'm not the only one.

710
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,223
Oh, really.

711
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,225
If anybody wants
to make a move...

712
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,727
c'mon, tony.

713
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,228
Don't get so
fucking dramatic.

714
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,730
All i'm saying
is sometimes you act

715
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,231
like you're in
a different business.

716
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,233
Now, send that
little prick out, so
i can talk to him.

717
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,735
No.

718
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:07,238
Do you realize
this motherless fuck

719
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,241
is into me for
over eight large?

720
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,743
He's got money
to play here?

721
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,746
Let him pay me my money.

722
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,247
Send him out.

723
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,749
You go home, richie.

724
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,251
This ain't gonna happen
to one of my players.

725
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,769
Everything alright?

726
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,276
He was pissed.

727
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,779
I'm gonna let
you sleep one day.

728
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,781
Then you're gonna
get the fuck up

729
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,783
and you're gonna
go get my $45, 000.

730
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,785
Hey, no problem.

731
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,787
Jesus, how about the luck
on that silvio, huh?

732
00:30:56,287 --> 00:31:00,792
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?

733
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,794
I could use a schvitz.

734
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,797
You want to
go for a schvitz?

735
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:10,301
If after one day,
you don't give me every penny,

736
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,803
i'm gonna send somebody
down to your joint

737
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,806
every saturday for
five percent interest.

738
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,307
If you don't have it,

739
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,809
it gets tacked onto
the principle.

740
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,310
Do you understand?

741
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,815
Listen, tony, i had a good
run there for a while.

742
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:30,822
I should have quit
then though, huh.

743
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,324
So, you never told me how
your kid made out at bowdoin.

744
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:38,830
How my what?

745
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,836
How your daughter
made out at bowdoin.

746
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,338
Would you like
anything else?

747
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,342
No.

748
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,847
Tony, did i do
something to insult you?

749
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,350
Two days.

750
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,877
How'd we do?

751
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,379
Not finished countin',
but it's up there.

752
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,382
At least 80 boxes of zitis
after expenses.

753
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,384
Two boxes came
out of my pocket.

754
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,886
Fellas.

755
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,888
Salut.

756
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:37,889
Salut.

757
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:43,895
Salut.

758
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,396
You fuckin
g believe it?

759
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,398
We now run
the executive game.

760
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,399
Oh, yeah.

761
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,901
Sil, you remember
when me and you

762
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,403
used to look through that
crack in that painted door

763
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,906
while my old man and
uncle junior had it?

764
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,407
Yeah, i remember.

765
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:57,909
Junior was a fucking prick
even then.

766
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,413
He'd come out and
he'd chase us down the street.

767
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:06,918
Executive game.

768
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:48,960
Do you mind?

769
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,461
God.

770
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,963
Trying to get some sleep,
i've been working all night.

771
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,966
How you doing, eric?

772
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,467
Pretty good.

773
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,969
Sounds good.

774
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:58,970
Thanks.

775
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,972
Are you awake now?

776
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,973
Yeah.

777
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:02,473
Good.

778
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:03,474
Close the door.

779
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:04,976
Hey.

780
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:05,977
Where's your mother?

781
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,480
The store.

782
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,982
Oh, aunt barb called.

783
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,984
Uncle tom'
s father died.

784
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,986
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

785
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,489
Tom, sr.?

786
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,490
When?

787
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,992
I don't know.

788
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:21,993
What the hell happened?

789
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,494
I don't know.

790
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,497
The guy's here almost every
christmas eve, you don't ask?

791
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:30,001
Somebody says,
"joe blow died,"
normal people ask,

792
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:35,006
"how? What happened?"

793
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:39,010
Jesus.

794
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,512
This gust of wind comes,
knocks him off the roof.

795
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,515
All for a satellite dish.

796
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,017
That's very sad.

797
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,518
Yeah.

798
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,520
How old?

799
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,022
65.

800
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,523
Guy works his whole life,
takes care of his family,

801
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:53,524
does the right thing.

802
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,026
One day after he retires.

803
00:34:55,526 --> 00:35:01,032
One day.

804
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,033
It's freaky.

805
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,535
Carlos casteneda said,

806
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:09,540
"live every moment
as if it were your
last dance on earth."

807
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,541
Who the fuck listens
to prize fighters?

808
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,543
Ali, maybe.

809
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,545
He had a little wisdom.

810
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:19,050
Well, at least tom, sr. Isn't
the happy wanderer anymore.

811
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,052
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

812
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,053
He got his.

813
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,555
You don't have
to pummel his ass.

814
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,058
He's joined the ranks
of the unlucky.

815
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:31,562
Maybe you know what you're
talking about, but i don't.

816
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,070
Found out i ha
d another uncle.

817
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,571
A retarded uncle.

818
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,574
My father's brother,
that nobody told me about.

819
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,576
You believe this shit.

820
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:50,581
Was he seriously
developmentally disabled?

821
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:59,090
Serious, no, he had everybody
in stitches back then.

822
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,593
Now that you found
out that you have a
retarded family member,

823
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,096
do you feel better
about coming here?

824
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,097
What?

825
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,099
Is it permissible now?

826
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,601
Is it enough of
a sad tragedy

827
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:14,105
that you can join
the rest of the douchebags?

828
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,615
I was just talking to him
a couple days ago.

829
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,617
Yes, he was
a wonderful man.

830
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,620
We're here
for you, barbara.

831
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,630
Va f'ancula tu.

832
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,133
You knew we were bound to
see them at some function.

833
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:46,637
Just relax.

834
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:51,142
Oh.

835
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,144
Fuckin' betty davis
back there.

836
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:57,148
No scenes.

837
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,651
Oh.

838
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,153
C'mon, get up,
we're leaving.

839
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,155
Thank you, god.

840
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,656
I will fucking
kill you!

841
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,158
We paid our respects,
now, we're leaving.

842
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,659
This may come as
a surprise to you,

843
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,660
but these people
are not here

844
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,662
to see the sopranos
kill each other.

845
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,664
Now, show respect
for tom's father,
will you, please?

846
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,166
Hi, carm.

847
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,168
Hi, richie.

848
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,670
Do i give the boost
to your sister?

849
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,174
C'mon, i gotta
give mine too.

850
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,175
How you doing?

851
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,676
I'm sorry.

852
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,179
Appreciate it.

853
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:50,201
How many rooms
this place got?

854
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,703
It's a big joint.

855
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:57,708
Pretty good racket.

856
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,211
I don't think you
can smoke in here.

857
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,213
Who's gonna complain, huh?

858
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,714
Him?

859
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,216
Hey.

860
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,717
You mind?

861
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:12,723
He don't mind.

862
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:17,728
Listen, anthony, i'm sorry
about blowing up in your game.

863
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,235
You were out of line.

864
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,237
What am i supposed
to do with you?

865
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,738
What?

866
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,741
Back off and respect the title,
you fucking jerkoff.

867
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,243
It's your ball.

868
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,744
You make the rules.

869
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,246
No, no.

870
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,248
I don't make'em,
they've always been there.

871
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,750
Now, you get this.

872
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,252
David scatino doesn't
pay you a fuckin' penny

873
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,753
until i get mine first.

874
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,256
That's the tax you get for
raising your hands in my game.

875
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,758
I get mine first,
then you get yours.

876
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,260
That's the way
it's gonna be.

877
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,763
I don't do something,
how's it gonna look?

878
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,770
If everyone could please
take their seats,

879
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,774
we are about to begin.

880
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,776
In the name of the father
and of the son

881
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:12,283
and of the holy ghost, amen.

882
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,286
Since it has pleased all mighty
god to call back our brother

883
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,288
from this life to himself,

884
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,290
we commit his body
to the earth,

885
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,292
that it may return to that
from which it was made.

886
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:28,299
Christ was the first to
rise from the dead...

887
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,800
i'm just saying,

888
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,302
i don't think you should
take any shit from him.

889
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,303
I heard you
the first time.

890
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,804
Let's drop the subject.

891
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:41,812
Alright.

892
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,315
Tony put me back
in action.

893
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,317
He gave me 50 g's
to put out on the street.

894
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,319
What is that, nothing?

895
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,321
Please, i know
how things work.

896
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:55,326
Don't forget, i wa
s daddy's little girl.

897
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,827
What the fuck are
you talking about?

898
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,329
You're his responsibility.

899
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,831
He didn't do you
any favor.

900
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,334
When my father was
in tony's position,

901
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,338
he gave romeo martin $50, 000
when he got out of jail.

902
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,341
I'm talking about
30 years ago.

903
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,344
30 years ago.

904
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,346
Today, that's half
a million dollars.

905
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,350
$50, 000, hmm...

906
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,852
mailmen make
more than that.

907
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,371
So, what's this fucking
doctor's appointment you had

908
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,373
all of a sudden when
my friend comes
to see you, huh.

909
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,874
What do you think?

910
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,376
I'm still the kid
on the school bus.

911
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,378
Please, tony,
i'm doing my best here.

912
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,380
I fucked up, okay.

913
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,882
I'm gonna make it all work
out somehow, i swear.

914
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,384
What do yo
u got for me?

915
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,385
I'm tapped.

916
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:55,886
Stand up.

917
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:56,887
Why?

918
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,389
'Cause i just said so.

919
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,890
Get up.

920
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,892
Get up or i'm gonna ri
p your fucking head off.

921
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,394
Get up.

922
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,396
C'mon.

923
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,900
I'm sorry, tony, i wouldn't
do anything to insult you.

924
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,903
Our kids go to the same
school together.

925
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,907
Ah!

926
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,411
Tony, i'm sorry, i'm sorry,
i'm just having some bad luck!

927
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,914
Yeah, it just
got worse.

928
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,416
I'm gonna come back.

929
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,919
My luck's gonna change.

930
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:29,920
Tomorrow.

931
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,423
I want something tomorrow,
you understand me?

932
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,440
Whoa, david.

933
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,941
Hey.

934
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,443
Where's the wife?

935
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,944
She's home.

936
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,946
Can i talk to you?

937
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,448
You alright?

938
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,450
Sit down.

939
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,951
Sit down.

940
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,461
Talk to me.

941
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,963
I got myself
in a little bind.

942
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,967
Jesus, i feel ashamed.

943
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,969
What's going on?

944
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:19,970
What happened?

945
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,974
I'm in a jam,
artie, a bad one.

946
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,977
This could cost me big,
my marriage, my business.

947
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,479
Alright, alright, relax.

948
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,480
I'm sure there's
something we can do.

949
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,482
What kind of jam?

950
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,484
Oh, jeez, you didn't
knock up that tae- bo broad

951
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,485
you had working,
did you?

952
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,987
God, no, artie.

953
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,989
Talk to me,
i'm your friend.

954
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,492
I need money.

955
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,495
Money, artie.

956
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,497
Not much, just...

957
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,999
i swear on my kid,

958
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,001
i'll get it back to yo
u before you even miss it.

959
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,503
How much money
we talkin'?

960
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,505
Not much, just enough...

961
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,006
to give me
some breathing room

962
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,510
till i can get
the rest together.

963
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,515
It's $20, 000.

964
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,518
Davie.

965
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,020
Shit.

966
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,021
Bad timing.

967
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,023
Man.

968
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,024
You're not gonna
believe this.

969
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,027
I got to put a new roof
on this place.

970
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,033
God forgive me
for sayin' this,

971
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,035
but did you consider
chapter 11?

972
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,037
I don't think tony
soprano's gonna buy that.

973
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,039
Tony.

974
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,042
Oh, jeez, davie.

975
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,044
Jesus christ.

976
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,086
Eric, give me
your keys.

977
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,087
Why?

978
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,088
There's mud al
l over the tires.

979
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,590
Dave, what's wrong?

980
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,091
Say good- bye
to your truck.

981
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,092
What?

982
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,093
Dave.

983
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,595
This is bullshit.

984
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,096
Eric, eric,
get back in the house.

985
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,598
I warned you.

986
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,099
No off- roading,
i gave you enough chances.

987
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,601
Dave, this is
not the place.

988
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,102
Dad, i didn't
do anything.

989
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,604
Eric, accountability
is everything.

990
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,605
Off- roading!

991
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,106
I drove it onto
the field at school

992
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,608
to bring some girls to
cheerleading practice.

993
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,109
There's mud al
l over the doors!

994
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,111
I warned you
and warned you, eric.

995
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,613
I didn't do anything!

996
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,114
I didn't do
anything, mom.

997
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,616
Eric, get in the house!

998
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,117
I fucking hate
all of you!

999
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,119
You apologize right now.

1000
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,623
Jesus.

1001
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,124
Open'em.

1002
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,627
I knew it was a car.

1003
00:44:56,627 --> 00:45:03,133
It's a sports
utility vehicle.

1004
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,638
You like it?

1005
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,140
This is eric's jeep.

1006
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,642
Oh, my god.

1007
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,644
Is this eric scatino's jeep?

1008
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,145
Yeah, but it's
yours now.

1009
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,147
His dad sold
it to you?

1010
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,148
Yeah, you know.

1011
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,150
Something like that.

1012
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,653
What do you mean,
something like that?

1013
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,155
You know.

1014
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,164
Jesus, tony.

1015
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,666
She don't want it, fine!

1016
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,167
Don't take it!

1017
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,669
But i'll eat it
before i give it back.

1018
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,170
What am i, a sucker?

1019
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,672
What does eric have to do
with his asshole father?

1020
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,173
He didn't do
anything to you.

1021
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,175
The guy owed me money,
and he did the right thing.

1022
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,677
He offered that car up
as partial payment.

1023
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,678
Yeah, right.

1024
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:48,679
You see this?

1025
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,680
You see,
this is you talking.

1026
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,181
I just hope you know

1027
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,683
his wife is very close
to the brother- in- law

1028
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,184
of a provost at georgetown.

1029
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,185
The who?

1030
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,186
Oh, great.

1031
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:57,688
Go ahead, you want to act
"holier than thou"?

1032
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,189
You go right ahead,
but i'm not giving it back.

1033
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,691
I'm gonna take that car
and sell it to pussy

1034
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,193
and i'm gonna buy clothes
and food and shoes

1035
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,195
and cd players and all
the rest of the shit

1036
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,698
that i've been buying since
the day you were born.

1037
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,701
Everything this family has
comes from the work i do.

1038
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,202
Alright, tony,
that's enough.

1039
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,205
A grown man made a wager.

1040
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,707
He lost.

1041
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,208
He made another one.

1042
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:18,709
He lost again.

1043
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,210
End of story.

1044
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,712
So, take that
high moral ground

1045
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,214
and go sleep in the fucking
bus station if you want!

1046
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:09,760
Oh, jesus.

1047
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,261
Where?

1048
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:18,268
A few rows back.

1049
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,770
Tony...

1050
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,272
almost didn't make it.

1051
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,774
Where's janice?

1052
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,275
Didn't i see those at
the wake the other day?

1053
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,777
That's funny.

1054
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,779
They're behind.

1055
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,281
I'll see you
after the show.

1056
00:47:56,306 --> 00:48:01,311
Just keep
thinking "meadow."

1057
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,313
Eric, c'mon,
let's talk.

1058
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,815
You're gonna
leave me here.

1059
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,316
I thought you
were my friend.

1060
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,317
I am.

1061
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,319
I can't stop my dad
from selling it.

1062
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,821
Yeah, well,
your dad's a fucking asshole.

1063
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,322
You know that?

1064
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,324
He's a real low- life
fucking asshole!

1065
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,826
And i suppose yours is
innocent in all this.

1066
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,327
For your information,

1067
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,829
he gave it to my dad.

1068
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,830
It's not like
my dad stole it!

1069
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,832
You know what, meadow?

1070
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:25,836
Fuck you, fuck your gangster
father and fuck this!

1071
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,848
Welcome, everyone, to verbum dei
high school's "cabaret night."

1072
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,850
As we are recording
tonight's performance,

1073
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,852
we'd like to
remind everyone,

1074
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:45,355
please, no talking,
no pictures or videotaping.

1075
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,859
And please remember to turn off
those pagers and cell phones.

1076
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,860
If you're worried
about coughing

1077
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,862
and feel a nice
lozenge might help,

1078
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,365
may we suggest that now would
be the time to unwrap it

1079
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,367
as opposed to
during the performance.

1080
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,370
A program note:

1081
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,872
In the second act,
"sun and moon"

1082
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,375
to performed by eric scatino
and meadow soprano

1083
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,878
has been canceled.

1084
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,881
Regretfully, mr. Scatino will
not be performing tonight.

1085
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,384
Instead miss soprano
will perform a solo, singing,

1086
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,386
"my heart will go on",

1087
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,388
the theme song from "titanic".

1088
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,390
Enjoy the show.

1089
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,892
Well, that's a lucky break.

1090
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,894
I wonder what happened.
