1
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,300
- i'm laying out. you coming?
- the u.v. index is 10.

2
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,600
jesus, we don't do
anything. we don't eat.

3
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,001
we don't go out. god knows
we don't do anything else.

4
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,934
is that all you
ever think about, sex?

5
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:09,600
all i ever think about? you
haven't fucked me in over a year.

6
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:13,134
blood sugar, i told you,
the weight loss.

7
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:19,200
good, fine.
skin cancer.

8
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:28,001
what's up?

9
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,534
thing we talked
about at the wedding.

10
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,734
rusty.

11
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,367
you made the call
to italy.

12
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:37,901
our friend over there's
gonna fit him for a suit.

13
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,134
she's sending over
two of her best tailors.

14
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,267
so i should meet 'em
at the airport?

15
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,801
no, they're gonna call
you when they arrive.

16
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,734
now you hook 'em up
with a third party, huh?

17
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,101
get 'em some scissors.

18
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,101
this is smart, ton',
the more i think about it.

19
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,667
glad you approve.

20
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,567
anybody taking a look, there's
nothing linking us to it.

21
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,567
- hey, good seeing you.
- hey, there he is.

22
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:03,267
- how you doing?
- what's up?

23
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,300
how are you?

24
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:10,267
listen,
come here a minute.

25
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,367
about the other day...

26
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,367
i'm fine.
a couple of stitches.

27
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:18,034
yeah? my fucking
temper, you know?

28
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,134
no no noo,
it's okay, really.

29
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,500
take it.

30
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,434
thanks.

31
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,867
look, ton',

32
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,267
i don't remember slamming
the refrigerator door,

33
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,634
but carlo told me
and my dad,

34
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:35,801
i never should have raised
my hands to you. i'm sorry.

35
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,567
as long as
you realize.

36
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:41,200
huh?

37
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:44,101
<i>it basically became
the same thing every day.</i>

38
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,467
coffee,
couple lines of meth,

39
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,901
smooth that out
with a shot of jameson.

40
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:53,168
and that was just to
drive the kids to school.

41
00:04:55,333 --> 00:05:00,200
<i>then one day i fell asleep at work
and forgot about gracie's recital.</i>

42
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:08,534
human frailty, it makes
me sick sometimes.

43
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:17,834
- chris, right?
- should i know you?

44
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,434
kevin mucci, yonkers.

45
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,300
- we met at the trotters. sal iacuzzo's cousin.
- right.

46
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,734
- hey.
- hey.

47
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,367
yonkers,
what are you, lost?

48
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,168
my ex's birthday over
at the red robin in clifton.

49
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:33,200
- i figured i'd need a meeting to make it through that shit.
- i hear that.

50
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,267
so i saw my cousin
this week.

51
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,300
it turns out he ran into a friend
of yours, the big guy, vito.

52
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,734
and...

53
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,600
he was in a fag bar,
dancing with a guy.

54
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:48,600
get the fuck out!

55
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,534
<i>right, joey,
use your head.</i>

56
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,634
you are not gonna
fucking believe this.

57
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,934
vito spatafore's
an ass-muncher.

58
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,701
- oh! what?
- what did you just say?

59
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,400
i'm sorry, it's true.

60
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:17,834
we ran into this kid. vito was
spotted in a fag bar in new york.

61
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,767
by who?

62
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:23,068
the kid's cousin.
allegedly.

63
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,767
probably bullshit.

64
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,367
<i>- he's a married man.
- with a goomar.</i>

65
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,467
all right,
back up a second.

66
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,467
what did the kid
say exactly?

67
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:35,367
- the kid's cousin sal iacuzzo--
- from yonkers, i know him.

68
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:39,434
sal was at this place in the
city, supposedly on business,

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,300
he saw vito holding hands
with a guy in nipple rings.

70
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,467
you're leaving out
the best part.

71
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,667
he was wearing
a motorcycle outfit,

72
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:51,200
like the guy in the village
people with the leather hat

73
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:54,233
- and the vest.
- chaps too.

74
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,834
i don't know.
fucking slander, ask me.

75
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:04,734
all right, let's take this
in the back.

76
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,434
- yeah, that's what vito did.
- you can go.

77
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,834
tell you one thing, if it was me
this kid was spreading rumors about,

78
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,767
he'd have something up
his own ass.

79
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,567
and it wouldn't be
no cock, either.

80
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,901
that's the point,
though.

81
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,101
this guy sal,
i know him.

82
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:27,134
- he's a friend of ours.
- i fucking called it, long time ago.

83
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,267
<i>you knew vito
was a recchion'?</i>

84
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,034
- yes.
- when?

85
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,967
i never said it,
but i knew.

86
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,034
get the fuck out. enough
of this rush to judgment.

87
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,168
for all we know, this fucking
sal guy's got a hard-on for vito.

88
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:41,600
- oh, you think
this is funny, huh?

89
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,801
there's a man's reputation
at stake here.

90
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,467
a married man,
with kids.

91
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,801
nah, that don't mean shit.
elton john was married.

92
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,300
yeah, rock hudson too.
i think.

93
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:55,367
so what do we gotta do, ton',
actually see him take it in the ass?

94
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,734
get vito on the phone.

95
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,901
you know, he called me
the other night.

96
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,068
<i>3:00 in the morning,
after the wedding.</i>

97
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,767
and?

98
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:12,233
honestly, it was weird. he
wanted to know what was going on.

99
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,068
he was fucking fishing,
see if we heard.

100
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,200
straight to voice mail.

101
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,467
ton', i mean,
he represents us.

102
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,467
i'm not gonna condemn
the man off the word

103
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,500
of some fucking douchebag
from yonkers.

104
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:29,767
- i could care less, basically.
- yeah? maybe you're a flambe.

105
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,867
<i>fucking nauseating.</i>

106
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:35,001
it was up to me, i'd drag vito
behind my fucking car right now.

107
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:38,400
will you take it easy over
there, fucking judge roy bean?

108
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,701
<i>one of my bar girls
knows his goomar.</i>

109
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:44,267
we'll check with her. maybe she's
seen him and knows where he is.

110
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,801
loren.

111
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,801
think about it,
though, ton'--

112
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,600
sudden weight loss.

113
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,734
- aids?
- nobody's got aids.

114
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:03,434
i don't wanna hear
that word in here again!

115
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,567
the federal prosecutor's office won't
tell you why your son's being held?

116
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:12,168
or where. it has been four days
now since he's been arrested,

117
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,400
and we have no money
to hire a lawyer.

118
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,967
- how did you hear about the law center?
- you will write the...

119
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,200
habeas corpus?
i'm not an attorney yet.

120
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,267
i'm a volunteer assistant. one of
our attorneys will file the writ.

121
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,068
<i>- he is a good boy.
- the fbi went to his school</i>

122
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:28,634
and took him like a
criminal. this is america?

123
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,400
it's not easy
to be muslim now.

124
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,600
they wouldn't let afaf skate
at the local rink

125
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:37,034
- unless she removed her head scarf.
- you're kidding me, why?

126
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,034
they said it was
for insurance.

127
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:41,267
it might fall off
and someone could trip.

128
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,300
if she had been wearing a yarmulke,
it would have been a different story.

129
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,367
you can bet.

130
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,233
they're these poor,
hardworking people.

131
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
<i>- finn, you're not eating?
- coffee's good.</i>

132
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,134
the government is just completely
fucking this family over.

133
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,534
when did it stt she could
use that kind of language

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,434
in this house
with immunity?

135
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,233
i'm telling mom about these
people that came in yesterday.

136
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,667
let me guess, was it a crack
whore trying to get her kids back

137
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,701
for the welfare money?

138
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,068
actually, it was a family from
afghanistan who fled the taliban

139
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,001
and sweated out
visa lotteries

140
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,500
- in a refugee camp,
and hold down three jobs.

141
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:19,101
you think it's funny? the fbi
snatched their son off the street

142
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,367
<i>like we're some
third world dictatorship.</i>

143
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:24,667
- pretty scary.
- there must have been some reason, meadow.

144
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:26,901
- like he's a terrorist,
maybe. - 9-11, 9-11.

145
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,333
bush is using it as an excuse to
erode our constitutional protections,

146
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,701
- and you're falling for it.
- well, i voted for him.

147
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:38,068
right, well, you don't relate
to black people clinging to logs.

148
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,734
you oughta chill out
about some of this.

149
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:53,101
hey.

150
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,834
let me
ask you something,

151
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,934
those two arabs,

152
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,434
with the credit cards, fazool
and whatever his name is--

153
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,267
- yeah?
- you think there's a chance they could be...

154
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,001
i don't know, al-qaedas,
something like that?

155
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:19,801
hmm.

156
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:23,867
you know at one point
it did cross my mind.

157
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,701
yeah, and?

158
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:28,034
i don't think so.

159
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,600
they're gun nuts
but the smaller guy ahmed,

160
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,767
when those danish cartoons
got published,

161
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,734
he was very upset,
but at the protestors.

162
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,701
<i>he said he hated
the cartoons</i>

163
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:40,200
but that the rioting shit would just
bring bad attention to all muslims.

164
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:44,034
and the other guy mohammed, his brother's
a government interrogator in lebanon

165
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,367
<i>or syria.</i>

166
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:49,001
plus mohammed and his
girlfriend have a dog,

167
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:51,168
a springer spaniel.

168

<i>people went to see him. he was
down the shore with his goomar.</i>

201
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,801
so it's bullshit then.

202
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,767
as soon as he saw 'em, took
off like a bat on a hill.

203
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,634
fuck.

204
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:43,634
you didn't hear it
from me.

205
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,667
it could be
a mid-life thing.

206
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:49,134
sucking a cock?

207
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,834

i don't have anybody down
for a reservation.

214
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,834
the sign said "vacancy."

we accept that too.

221
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,233
but you can take care
of it in the morning.

222
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,534
i'm just beat,
that's all.

223
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,434
my car broke down.

224
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,967

225
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,068

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,467
have a good night.

232
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,534
franklin pierce room. up the
stairs, first door to the right.

233
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,801
i was just over at the
house. everything is gone.

234
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:40,667
- which house are you referring to?
- the spec house.

235
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:43,801
the pvc,
the shake roof shingles,

236
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,467
even that expensive lock
on the shed is missing.

237
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:48,500
that's awful, mel.

238
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,400
you don't know
anything about this?

239
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:54,233
you left it there
to rot.

240
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,600
i don't believe this.

241
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,434
- with my husband on his death bed...
- oh, sarah bernhardt.

242
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,867
...you went over there and you picked
through the place like a vulture!

243
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,434
you said you'd straighten out the
permits with the building department

244
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,300
- and you never did.
- that is beside the point!

245
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,200
carmela, what happened
to my bundt pan?

246
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:14,101
it was your fault the permits
were denied in the first place.

247
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:17,333
you're a broken record, for
god's sake. that's what you are.

248
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,101
carmela, wait.

249
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:23,701

275
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:16,134
we thought we were gonna have to
talk to each other or read a book.

276
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,134

00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,200
i had these sales reps
in my office.

325
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,667
we're just going over the
list for the silent auction.

326
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:49,534
- we're already up to about 7500 bucks.

327
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,534

00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:11,233
jesus christ.
he's always interrupting.

335
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,400
people enjoy
the silent auction.

336
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,534
i thought our goal
was to raise money.

337
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,134
i say we get 'em liquored up, let
'em tear each other's throats out.

338
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,934
- well...
- it's just an idea.

339
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:26,834
anyhow, put me down for $2,000
worth of body work and/or paint.

340
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,034
2,000? madonn', ange.

341
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:33,233
so, did you hear about
vito and marie? separated.

342
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,834
<i>oh, sorry, i gotta take this.</i>

343
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:40,534
- hello?
- they were just at the wedding. they seemed fine.

344
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,068
what'd i tell you? is that
a beautiful fish or what?

345
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:45,267
oh, for god's sake,
all right!

346
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:48,200
can i just get some
prosciutto melon to go?

347
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,400
i'm sorry, guys.
i gotta get back.

348
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:55,400
no, the quarter panel
from the lesabre, i said.

349
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,834
oh shit.

350
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,767
you didn't know
he was gay?

351
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,467
actually i had him pegged
the whole time, but...

352
00:28:09,734 --> 00:28:11,233
he a close friend?

353
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,467
not only that, he's one
of my most valuable guys.

354
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,967
he's ambitious,
he's focused.

355
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,034
when i was in
the hospital,

356
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,901
he helped carmela tremendously
when we were strapped.

357
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:26,134
you've implied you have
millions of dollars.

358
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,500
your hospital stay
was actually that costly?

359
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:32,967
well no, but, uh...

360
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,600
huh?

361
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,001
is that the issue?

362
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:41,801
you tell me.
what is the issue?

363
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,634
he's a fa-ag!

364
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,434
<i>and?</i>

365
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,101
now what am i
supposed to do?

366
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:50,134
about what?

367
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,168
i know what. they're
born that way, right?

368
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:55,034
it's not their fault.

369
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,101
frankly i think they go
about in pity for themselves.

370
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:01,434
i don't think they
see it as a fault.

371
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,801
in your circle i'm sure
you got all kinds

372
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,168
of gays
and trans-whatevers

373
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,834
of all stripes.

374
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,967
but not where
i come from.

375
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:15,467
you personally--

376
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:18,567
how do you feel
about homosexuality?

377
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,934
i find it disgusting.

378
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:25,068
men kissing men, holding
hands in the street.

379
00:29:25,134 --> 00:29:30,068
every fuckin' tv show now,
they rub your nose on it.

380
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,667
although, that--

381
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:36,434
the lesbian thing
with the, uh...

382
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,801
jennifer beals,

383
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:41,034
it's not bad.

384
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:44,701
she a dyke in real life?

385
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,934
i don't give
too much of a shit

386
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,767
what people do
behind closed doors

387
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:52,901
with the consenting
adults.

388
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:57,001
although don't forget:
i'm a strict catholic.

389
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:00,168
i agree with that
senator sanitorium,

390
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,734
who says if we let
this stuff go too far,

391
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,101
pretty soon we'll
be fucking dogs.

392
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:07,034
i hear a lot
of ambivalence.

393
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,434
this guy that
got outed, look,

394
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,901
the guys that work for me
are asking for head.

395
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:20,001
his head.
what the fuck?

396
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,801
you know, him and me, we're
in the construction business.

397
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:28,068
now some of these union
old-timers, the contractors,

398
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:30,867
they're not gonna want
to be seen with him.

399
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:34,101
and i'm talking huge deals,
major fucking dollars.

400
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,134
a lot of your circle
must have done jail time.

401
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,901
they can't be strangers
to male-male sexual contact.

402
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,267
you get a pass for that.

403
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,801
well, that's nice.

404
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,001
well, what are
you gonna do?

405
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,333
there's no women there.

406
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,168
you're there
five, 10 years.

407
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,667
just for the record, my
incarceration was very short term,

408
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:12,967
so i never had any need
for any anal-- you know.

409
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:19,600
so this fellow who's been
outed, what's he saying?

410
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:22,567
you think i'm lying,
don't you?

411
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:25,168
about when
i was in jail.

412
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:28,667
i've given you no indication
i think you're lying.

413
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:41,901
what the fuck, i suppose
something inside me says

414
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:45,134
god bless, a' salut'.

415
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,567
who gives a shit?

416
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:53,600
i mean i had a second
chance. why shouldn't he?

417
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,101
part of your new outlook?

418
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:58,834
maybe.

419
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,034
i salute it, then.

420
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,367
tall fuckin' order,
i'll tell you that.

421
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:07,034
how so?

422
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:11,267
you can talk about every day being a
gift and stopping to smell the roses,

423
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:15,467
but regular life's got a way
of picking away at it.

424
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,367
your house,
the shit you own,

425
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:20,467
it drags you down.

426
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,767
your kids,
what they want.

427
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:25,834
one bad idea
after another.

428
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:31,367
just trying to work a cell phone
menu is enough to make you scream.

429
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:36,567
there's some cold pasta.

430
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:39,534
no, i ate already.

431
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,434
what's all that?

432
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:45,333
for the silent auction.

433
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
my busy little beaver.

434
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,233
not really.

435
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:55,333
look, ton', i haven't
wanted to bug you,

436
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,567
but before you'd
gotten hurt,

437
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:59,801
you said you would get
that building inspector

438
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,367
to cut me some slack so i
could get back to my business?

439
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:05,600
oh yeah, right right.
i will, later.

440
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,333
come here.

441
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,134
no, uh, i'm still not
ready for that.

442
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,267
last time i thought i tore
something from tensing my muscles.

443
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,634
no, i got something
for that scar.

444
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,267
oh.

445
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,434
vitamin e.

446
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,467
my facialist said it
will help get the red out.

447
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:52,834
you were right
about my uncle, carm.

448
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,400
all along.

449
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,901
it doesn't give me
any pleasure, believe me.

450
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:03,801
i should have cut him
out of my life.

451
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:07,034
i brought this
all on myself.

452
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:11,367
you did not.
don't ever think that.

453
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:19,001
all this, you never once
said "i told you so."

454
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:24,367
accentuate the positive.

455
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:30,300
i wanted you
to get better.

456
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:37,400
you know my shrink...

457
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:41,801
told me that, uh...

458
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:46,267
i stood by junior through
all his jealousy and shit...

459
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,834
trying to prove
i'm a good guy...

460
00:34:56,634 --> 00:35:00,267
and that my mother couldn't
hate a good boy like that.

461
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,068
imagine laying
next to a guy 15 years

462
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:09,634
and all the time he's been
playing for the pink team.

463
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:12,300
who told you?
tony swore me to secrecy.

464
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:13,767
i'm not gonna
burn my sources.

465
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,767
anyway, it's all over
the place.

466
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:20,534
<i>those children... imagine when they
find out their father's a finook.</i>

467
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,168
god, she's such a bright
girl, marie spatafore.

468
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,300
you think she and vito
had some arrangement?

469
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,233
i just hope she
gets herself tested.

470
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:33,367
still, vito? he'd be like
the last one you'd suspect.

471
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:36,333
suspect of what?

472
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,967
wow, such a young lady!

473
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:40,767
<i>yes, she's working
two jobs.</i>

474
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:44,500
days she's interning at gendler,
lookstein, abruzzo & abruzzo.

475
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,400
what about vito?

476
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:50,200
nothing. him and marie are
having some problems, that's all.

477
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:55,701
- i can probably guess.
- excuse me?

478
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:58,168
huh-uh, i'm not
going first.

479
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:00,101
do you know
something?

480
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,867
okay...

481
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:11,834
he is possibly...

482
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,634
gay.

483
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:15,701
finn saw him giving
some guy a blowjob.

484
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,767
what?

485
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,801
when dad got him that job
in construction?

486
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:21,434
finn showed up early
one morning

487
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,068
and he saw vito in a car going
down on some security guard.

488
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:27,233
- oh my god!
- he saw this?

489
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,467
he had finn all freaked
out. he still does.

490
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:31,101
why didn't you
say something?

491
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:34,001
because vito
warned finn not to.

492
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,300
you gotta hear
what meadow just told us.

493
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,367
- mom!
- the cat's out of the bag, meadow.

494
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:51,068
<i>oh, it's "dr. yank
'em," the painless dentist.</i>

495
00:36:51,134 --> 00:36:53,801
- how you doing, kid?
hey ton'.

496
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:56,267
hey--

497
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:00,701
- unfortunately, finn here
has got some bad news,

498
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:03,068
so, uh, listen up.

499
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:04,834
sit down.

500
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:07,967
go ahead.

501
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,667
tell 'em
what you saw.

502
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:19,168
don't be scared.
it's all right.

503
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,767
- all right, if we can just head over and have lunch.
- good morning.

504
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,701
good morning.

505
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:28,434
let me ask you
a question.

506
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,267
before he cornered you
in the porta-potty,

507
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,834
when the security guard
was sucking him off--

508
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:37,200
- whoa one sec, it was the other way around.
- what?

509
00:38:39,168 --> 00:38:42,967
vito was blowing
the security guard.

510
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,600
son of a bitch!

511
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,767
catchin', not pitchin'?

512
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,367
he's not gonna know
i told you?

513
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:57,467
you ain't gonna have no
problem from vito, believe me.

514
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:00,867
<i>- what are you gonna do?
- it'll be okay.</i>

515
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:03,267
get him to pay
for some therapy.

516
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:07,068
look, why don't you...
why don't you go out front,

517
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:09,534
get yourself a sandwich,

518
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,101
any kind you like, huh?

519
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:13,634
soda.

520
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:17,101
when we're done here,
somebody will take you back.

521
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:21,467
all right.

522
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:31,001
i wanna kill
the fat faggot myself.

523
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,500
be a fuckin' honor.

524
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:35,934
<i>cut off his pisciatil'
and feed it to him.</i>

525
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,734
there can be no mistake now.

526
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:39,434
i can't believe
i stuck up for him!

527
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,434
i feel like i've been
stabbed in the heart.

528
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,600
we can't have him here
in our social club no more.

529
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,134
i mean, that much i do know.

530
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,901
social club?

531
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,400
he's gotta go!

532
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:50,834
i wanna think about it.

533
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:53,467
yeah, i don't know.

534
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:56,233
what the fuck? what is
there to think about?

535
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,134
- sit down.
- fuck that! i'll say it again!

536
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,901
what the fuck is there
to think about?

537
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:04,300
you gonna take care of his
kids, huh, after he's gone?

538
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,634
it's true.
they didn't do nothing.

539
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,801
poor little guys.

540
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,068
now sit down.

541
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,500
i'm sorry if i yelled, t.
it's just...

542
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,834
how much more
betrayal can i take?

543
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,300
vito, a fag.

544
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,801
big construction tycoon.

545
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:38,901
ton', when he was always talking
about "greasing the union,"

546
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,434
who knew that's
what he meant?

547
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,367
all right, this stays
in these four walls.

548
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,834
am i understood?

549
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,034
- phil, oh my god.
- you poor kid.

550
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:02,600
i know. i can't
believe it myself.

551
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:06,034
i keep waiting
for him to call.

552
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:08,834
how long am i supposed to tell
the kids he's away on business?

553
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:11,467
that fuckin' shitbag.
i get my hands on him

554
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,101
i'm gonna tear him
limb from limb.

555
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:16,233
- oh, phil, don't say that.
- you're my cousin he married,

556
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,034
making a mockery
of the whole sacrament.

557
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,701
but what do we
really know?

558
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,901
i mean, maybe there
were signs, but...

559
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:31,001
vito spatafore
is a good man,

560
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:32,667
and he's
a wonderful dad.

561
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:38,600
somebody sees something one time
and he's tossed aside like garbage?

562
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:43,068
that's why
i'm here, honey.

563
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,500
there's been confirmation
through the grapevine.

564
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:49,267
vito was seen
in a car with a man.

565
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,567
i don't want to get
graphic beyond that,

566
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:54,734
the idea of it
repulses mso much.

567
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:57,701
what confirmation?
who?

568
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,801
the witness has
no reason to lie.

569
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,801
no...

570
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:05,767
we can't be in denial
no more, much as we love him.

571
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,534
where do you think
he might have gone, honey?

572
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,300
so we can get him back here,
get him to do something about it.

573
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:26,300
excuse me, angie here?

574
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:28,034
in the office.

575
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,500
<i>we can get you anything
you want, sweetheart,</i>

576
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:32,300
air bags,
chrome rims--

577
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:35,168
- oh, hi.
- carm, hi.

578
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,367
i'm sorry. am i interrupting something?

579
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:41,734
i'm here for the free body work
certificates for the auction.

580
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:44,534
- oh, that's right.
- but if you're busy...

581
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,500
this'll just take
another sec.

582
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,834
okay, sure.

583
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:02,434
they were doing something
behind closed doors.

584
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,634
well you know angie's
put money on the street.

585
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:07,001
how do you know?

586
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:09,267
- angie told me.
- she didn't tell me.

587
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:13,467
probably 'cause of tony. aw, maybe he
didn't want you to know something like that.

588
00:43:13,534 --> 00:43:16,333
<i>me and my big mouth.</i>

589
00:43:17,534 --> 00:43:20,101
she's got enough money
to do that, huh?

590
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:28,068
well, she's pretty successful
with that body shop, so...

591
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:31,101
our grandmothers did it.

592
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:36,001
those were harder times,
but...a' salut', right?

593
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:40,134
she's one of us. now it's
like she's one of them.

594
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:45,467
- you wanted to see me, ton'?
- yeah.

595
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:47,734
hey, carlo.

596
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:52,101
- good to see you.
- sit down.

597
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:57,667
putting you in charge of
all construction business,

598
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,534
replacing vito.

599
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,333
holy shit!

600
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,701
guys respect you
across the board,

601
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,101
you done real good
real with the ports...

602
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,068
thank you, ton'.

603
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,767
jeez, i don't know
what to say.

604
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,734
we'll have a drink.

605
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:17,168
congratulations.

606
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:18,934
a' salut'
a' salut.

607
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:28,667
listen, ton'...

608
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:32,200
since you think enough of me
to give me this responsibility

609
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:34,367
<i>i might as well be
the one to say it.</i>

610
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:37,101
all right,
skip the preambles.

611
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:40,134
the guys on vito's crew,

612
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,168
they say if he
was to come back,

613
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:43,901
they refuse to take
orders from him.

614
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:46,667
oh, they do?

615
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:49,934
not only that,

616
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:52,267
a couple of the other
captains won't talk to him,

617
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,734
and i don't disagree.

618
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:58,001
paulie especially.

619
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:00,434
now that he's
accepted it, hey...

620
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,867
he's the most out
for vito's scalp.

621
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:07,701
yeah, you should hear him, ton'. he's
goin' fuckin' mau-mau on the subject.

622
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,367
it's not their fucking
decision who they work with.

623
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:15,333
let me tell
you something.

624
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,434
fuckin' vito,
through sheer hard work,

625
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,200
turned himself
into my best earner.

626
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:23,767
i don't even know if i'd
have the new boat without him.

627
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:26,101
he's a come-from-behind
kind of guy.

628
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:28,267
that's true, but--

629
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,367
so i'm gonna burn
that kind of dedication?

630
00:45:31,434 --> 00:45:35,267
it's hard to believe i couldn't get something
more out of him, if he were to come back.

631
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,500
stocks, offshore shit,
i don't know.

632
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:42,168
well...

633
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:44,367
these other guys feel
an effort should be made

634
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:46,934
to find him and put him down
for the honor of the family.

635
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,467
oh, please, huh?

636
00:45:49,534 --> 00:45:51,934
you know, certain people,
they love the high drama,

637
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,801
<i>like fuckin'
high school girls.</i>

638
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:58,101
and others i could name, they just
can't wait to whack somebody, anybody.

639
00:45:58,168 --> 00:46:02,400
but some people feel it's
against our principles, tony.

640
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,434
a sin.

641
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:10,333
carlo, let's be honest
with ourselves here.

642
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,200
we all know vito's
not the first.

643
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:21,600
well...

644
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,701
we're gonna do
great things.

645
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,567
aw, jesus, thanks again,
anthony. thank you.

646
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:01,233
what?

647
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:07,667
it's 2006.

648
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:12,068
there's pillow biters
in the special forces.

649
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:15,834
let me just
ask you, ton'.

650
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,667
sake of argument.

651
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:21,333
let's say he shows up.

652
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,134
you gonna kiss this guy
on both cheeks?

653
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,300
take paulie, okay?

654
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:31,667
you know perfectly well

655
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:36,634
guys like him never kick up
their full percent to you.

656
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,734
you look the other way,

657
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:42,233
price of doing business.

658
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,134
but you cut vito slack now
that he's "out of the closet,"

659
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,867
just the excuse people need
to go off the reservation,

660
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,134
and start withholding
serious money.

661
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,134
let me read
in peace, will you?

662
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:04,901
having fun
with all this paper?

663
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:07,233
i can't believe
this is just one case.

664
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,867
rafaella martino. i'm the
lead attorney on this mess.

665
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:11,801
oh.
meadow soprano.

666
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:14,168
- i'm michael kardish. i work with rae.
- hi.

667
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:16,101
ms. soprano came
highly recommended.

668
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:19,534
columbia dean's list, volunteer
at the south bronx law center...

669
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,867
this is really
interesting too.

670
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:25,001
of course it's different than the
kind of thing we see at the law center.

671
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,767
clients there are so
trampled and abused--

672
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:28,801
welcome to
white-collar fraud.

673
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,967
i need the emails from box
44 and 45, july and august.

674
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,101
pull them and leave them
with my assistant.

675
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:36,168
okay.

676
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:40,134
tony soprano's kid.

677
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:52,934
tony.

678
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:54,634
building my
lats back up.

679
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:58,634
did you by any chance talk to the
building inspector about my house?

680
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:01,034
shit, i forgot.

681
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:17,168
the sorting's tedious,
but some of the cases--

682
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,901
this guy was
pretty clever, really.

683
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,134
he set up all these
phony investment firms

684
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,867
and then just siphoned
the money out:

685
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:24,934
- $80 million.
- whoa.

686
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,034
yeah, he's out on bail.

687
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:30,567
then you look at
my father's friend,

688
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,034
federal marshals
dragging him

689
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:33,734
out of his own
daughter's wedding.

690
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:35,233
he hasn't even
been tried yet.

691
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,834
you're innocent in this
country until proven guilty.

692
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,300
yeah, but johnny macaroni
was indicted for murder.

693
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:43,367
they couldn't let him
stay 15 more minutes?

694
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:47,500
you better put
your pants on.

695
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,500
you know why
they did that.

696
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:54,667
to humiliate him
in front of everyone.

697
00:49:54,734 --> 00:49:57,101
metal detectors,
frisking,

698
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:58,734
my father with the shoes?

699
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,567
it was pure harassment.

700
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:02,901
yeah, but the guy's lucky
they even let him out.

701
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,134
oh, so white-collar criminals
can destroy people's lives

702
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,333
and steal their pensions
and it's no big deal to you.

703
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,967
you know what?
bad subject.

704
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:15,567
let's talk about
something else.

705
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,400
no, let's talk about it

706
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:19,434
so we can stop
with the macaroni cracks.

707
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,667
weird, since you're
part italian yourself.

708
00:50:22,734 --> 00:50:24,934
please, my dad
is so deracinated.

709
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:27,567
yeah, the way he prefers it.
all those hysterical jokes

710
00:50:27,634 --> 00:50:29,600
about italian cheeses
and smelly feet.

711
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:32,134
why are you
picking a fight?

712
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,168
i'm not, but you're slamming
my family. i don't know.

713
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:41,101
this is good shit.

714
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:42,801
it's amazing.

715
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:49,967
you weren't there for the
"grand inquisition" about vito.

716
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:53,001
i knew it.
i'm picking the fight.

717
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:55,701
i was in the back
of a butcher shop

718
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:57,767
with your uncle paulie,

719
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:00,967
ratting out a guy i don't
really even know.

720
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:04,333
i mean what do you think's going
to happen to vito for being gay?

721
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:10,400
and don't give me any of that
"poverty of the mezzogiorno" bullshit.

722
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,434
we're in fucking
caldwell, new jersey,

723
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,267
and you're on your
high horse about justice?

724
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,701
they are gonna
mete it out themselves.

725
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,168
this is untenable.

726
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:26,701
this is nice,
this pot.

727
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:30,934
yeah, that's a baneda.
arts and crafts movement.

728
00:52:31,001 --> 00:52:35,267
yeah? i really don't know
much about this stuff.

729
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,034
well, you've got
a good eye.

730
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:39,901
that's the most expensive
piece in the store.

731
00:52:39,967 --> 00:52:42,901
you're a natural.
