HE'S BEING ACCUSED OF
IS JUST PERSECUTION.

THAT ENTRAILED.

55
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,614
I THINK THE ONLY SOLUTION
IS TO MOVE AWAY

56

61
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:21,363
WE CAN BE SOMEPLACE

OR WHAT HAPPENED.

YOU COULD DO...

68
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:43,118
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HIS UNCLE ? 

69
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:44,953
- WHO ? 
- PHIL.

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,190
PHIL'S NOT HIS UNCLE.
HIM AND I ARE SECOND COUSINS.

FROM YOUR FRIENDS

74
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:58,934
- I SHOULD TALK TO HIM.
- HE'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK TO.

75
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:02,371
IT'S NOT EASY
TO SUBSTITUTE FOR A DAD.

76
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,606
I KNOW.

77
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:08,610

FILL IN HERE.

78
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:13,615

THAT NEVER WORKS.

86
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,637
SHE SHOULD GET HIM A DOG.

87
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,806

THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:16,084
I WOULDN'T WISH IT
ON MY WORST ENEMY.

170
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:17,753

171

172
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,390
NU ? 

173
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:31,333
I TALKED TO PHIL
ABOUT THE SPLIT ON
THE MRI CENTERS.

174
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,135
YOUR CUT IS ON THE WAY.

175
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,770
( chuckles )
SO IS CHRISTMAS.

176
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,706
YOU SHOULD HAVE
HEARD HIM TONIGHT.

177
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:40,609
- COMMENTS, SMUG.
- REALLY ? 

178
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:42,844
WORRIES ME.

179
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:45,313
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GETTING ALONG PRETTY
GOOD FINALLY,

180
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,416
YOU KNOW,
CONSIDERING.

181
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,484
COULD BE T HUBRIS,
MAKING BOSS.

182
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,287
BUT I STILL THINK
IT'S WHAT WENT DOWN
WITH HIS BROTHER BILLY.

183
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:54,056
I THOUGHT ALL THAT
GOT BURIED WITH YOUR COUSIN.

184
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:56,992
- EH.
- YOU ENJOY THE DINNER ? 

185
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,861
- I LEFT RIGHT AFTER.
- OH YEAH ? 

186
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:03,832
I DON'T KNOW.

187
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,667
I LOOK AT MY KEY GUYS--

188
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,936
PAULIE, CHRISTOPHER,

189
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:11,006
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW--
WHAT'S NUMBER ONE
ON THEIR AGENDA ? 

190
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:16,144
THEY'RE ALL FUCKING MURDERERS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

191
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:19,348
LONELY AT THE TOP,
BOYCHIK ? 

192
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,783
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

193
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,519
IT'S NICE BEING HERE.

194
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,521
- ALWAYS IS.
- ( chuckles )

195
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:32,060
OH ! 

196
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,062
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

197
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,231
( chuckles )

198
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,402
<i>COVER UP THAT DOME.</i>

199
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,474
ACTUALLY, I WAS
EXPECTING SOMETHING ELSE.

200
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,110
WHAT, THE FUCKING DVD ? 

201
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,145
HONESTLY, IT'S A VERY
UNFLATTERING PORTRAIT

202
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:52,447
OF ITALIAN-AMERICANS.

203
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:55,751
NO, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE SOME OF THE $200,000
I LOANED YOU ? 

204
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:59,254
OH, JESUS.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

205
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,890
I KNOW IT'S COVERED.
IT'S JUST AFTER A WHILE
WITH NO VIG--

206
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:03,892
YOU KNOW,
I LOST TRACK.

207
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,928
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.

208
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,797
- I DON'T WANNA
BE A STICKLER.
- NO.

209
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,566
ANTHONY, COME ON.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

210
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:16,071
I GOT ABOUT $3,000 HERE.
POINT AND A HALF GOOD ? 

211
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,240
- NO, COME ON, FUCK THIS.
- YOU GOTTA HAVE IT.

212
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:21,209
- DON'T WANT
YOU EATING CAT FOOD.
- COME ON, STOP IT.

213
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:24,079
I DON'T GOTTA HAVE IT.
I DON'T WANT A VIG
FROM YOU.

214
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:25,881
<i>NO, COME ON.</i>

215
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,083
( sighs )
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON IT.

216
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,390
- YOU SURE ? 
- JESUS CHRIST,
ARE WE GOOD OR WHAT ? 

217
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:38,093
<i>WELL, IT'S LATE.</i>

218
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,128
I SHOULD BE GETTING BACK.

219
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:43,265
YOU SHOULD GET
BACK TO PISSING,
OR WHATEVER.

220
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:45,067
( both laugh )

221
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:47,769
<i>( woman talking on TV )</i>

222
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:51,173
I LEND THE GUY MONEY.
SUDDENLY I'M THE SCHMUCK.

223
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:54,209
<i>WHY DOES HE NEED
YOUR MONEY ? </i>

224
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,279
WHY ? 
TO COVER HIS NUT.

225
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,948
BETWEEN HIS GAMBLING
AND THE LIFESTYLE,

226
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,850
AND THAT BOAT--

227
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,753
$3.2 MIL.
I WARNED HIM.

228
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,689
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY
NO RESALE VALUE WHATSOEVER.

229
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,691
DOES HE LISTEN ? 
HEH.

230
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:15,931
I'VE LENT LOTS OF MONEY.

231
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:18,800
ONCE THE CHISELING STARTS--
"OOH, I FORGOT."

232
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,802
WHO FORGETS ? 
FUCK HIM.

233
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:24,406
THIS IS WHY I DON'T LIKE
YOU SEEING HIM BEFORE BED.
YOU'RE ALL UPSET.

234
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:27,609
MAKES A BIG SHOW
OF GIVING ME A VIG.

235
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,979
$3,000 A WEEK.

236
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,756
YOU GOT A LOT OF JEWS
IN YOUR BUSINESS, RIGHT ? 

237
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,657
MY BUSINESS ? 

238
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:45,260
YEAH, THIS.

239
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:49,164
YOU GOTTA HAND IT TO THEM,
WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY...

240
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:51,566
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

241
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:55,337
- THAT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN AN UGLY STEREOTYPE.
- REALLY ? 

242
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:59,875
I GOT A FRIEND,
LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU TIE A KRUGERRAND

243
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,444
TO A FISHING LINE,
YOU'RE GONNA LAND HIM.

244
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:04,246
( schwoops )
RIGHT UP ON THE DOCK.

245
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:07,649
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
YOU THINK OF HIM
AS A FRIEND.

246
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:11,219
COME ON.
WE GO WAY BACK.

247
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:16,692
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM
FROM BUSTING MY FUCKING BALLS
BECAUSE I OWE HIM SOME MONEY.

248
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,598
ANYWAY, I NEEDED
A LITTLE BRIDGE LOAN

249
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,901
TO COVER SOME
OF THE GAMBLING LOSSES
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

250
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,137
- STILL ? 
- YOU KNOW,
GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD.

251
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:32,341
- WHY NOT JUST STOP ? 
- BIG PART OF MY LIFE.

252
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,776
I KNOW, BUT YOU'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT
IT A LOT.

253
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:37,079
WELL, YOU LOSE SOMETIMES.

254
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:40,615
YOU GOTTA ACT LIKE
IT HURTS A LITTLE MORE
THAN IT DOES,

255
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:42,451
YOKNOW,
FOR YOUR GUYS.

256
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,222
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA LOSE,
WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT, HUH ? 

257
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,558
SO YOU NEED THE RISK.

258
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,560
WHAT ARE YOU CHASING ? 

259
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:54,062
MONEY OR A HIGH
FROM WINNING ? 

260
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,737
BEFORE WE END,

261
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,006
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO BRING UP.

262
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,810
YOU MISS A LOT
OF APPOINTMENTS.

263
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:12,180
EXCUSE ME, I ALWAYS GIVE
YOU THE REQUIRED NOTICE
OR I PAY FORHE HOUR.

264
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,750
- THAT'S NOT MY POINT.
- WELL, I GET BUSY.

265
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,919
IT'S MY FAULT.
I'VE CONDONED IT
FOR A LONG TIME.

266
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:21,023
I HAVEN'T HAD
A PANIC ATTACK

267
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,191
SINCE MY UNCLE SHOT ME.

268
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:25,527
- DID YOU NOTICE THAT ? 
- YES.

269
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:29,898
WELL, IT MUST BE NICE
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

270
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:33,068
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON
WHY YOU'RE HERE ? 

271
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:34,569
THE PANIC ATTACKS ? 

272
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,672
NO.

273
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,610
THIS IS AN...

274
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,846
OASIS IN MY WEEK.

275
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:47,115
SO THIS IS VACATION ? 

276
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,885
NO, I BENEFIT
IN MANY WAYS.

277
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,587
DECIDE IF YOU WANNA
KEEP COMING,

278
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:55,924
BUT KNOW THERE ARE PROTOCOLS
THAT HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED

279
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:58,560
OR I WON'T BE ABLE
TO CONTINUE.

280
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,798
OKAY, I WILL.

281
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:10,372

282
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:14,042
NOW, I KNOW BRIAN WANTS
THE MEDIA ROOM DOWNSTAIRS,

283
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:17,245
BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER
IF THE GYM HAS ACCESS
TO THE POOL.

I TOLD THE GUY TO RUN

YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T COME
OUT HERE JUST TO BUY YOU
A COUPLE OF SUNDAES.

295
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:02,157
IT'S A SILO.

296
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,026
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
WHAT IT IS.

297
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:06,094
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU ? 

298
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,097
YOU LOOK LIKE

YOU MAKE ME SICK.

299
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:11,366
SO ? 
WHAT'S IT GOTTA

300
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:14,236

00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,747
WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH,
HOW YOU'RE UPSETTING HER ? 

305
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:27,349
SHE'S JUST EMBARRASSED.

306
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,885
SHE CRIES FOR YOU.

307
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:33,822
I'M GONNA SAY THIS
BECAUSE YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAN

308
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,391
YOUR FAMILY'S HAD
ENOUGH SHAME.

309
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,126

I SAID MY PIECE.

314
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:01,850
FINISH THAT THING.
THERE'S NO EATING
IN THE CAR.

315
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:07,622
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE
A MINUTE FOR EVERYBODY
TO ENJOY THE FACT

316
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,491
THAT YOUR MOTHER
HAS SOLD HER HOUSE.

317
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:12,594

THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- CONGRATULATIONS, MOM.

318
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,530
- THAT'S SO GOOD.
- WELL, ACTUALLY, IT JUST
PASSED INSPECTION.

ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.

CONGRATULATIONS, CARM.
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING
TO DO THESE DAYS.

322
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:24,873

IT'S BIG, RIGHT ?

HE'S NOT HERE TO EAT.

357

IT'S A JOKE.

365
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,568
WHERE'S THAT SENSE
OF HUMOR ? 

366
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:37,506
YOU SHOULD PUT THIS
IN THE POT,

367
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:40,242

00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:48,884
YES, AND IT'S NORMAL.

376
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,568

378
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,107
I DON'T LIKE
THE WAY HE TALKS.

YOU'VE SEEN HOW
THESE ITALIANS WORK.

384

VITO WAS ONE OF US.

662
