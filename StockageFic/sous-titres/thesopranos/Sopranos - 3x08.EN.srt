You are so nice.

00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:02,806
I mean, i knew that

00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:04,808

00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,810
You ha

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,312
I am so not
depressed anymore.

10
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:10,313
Try what?

11
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,315
Ecstasy!

12
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,818
Where did
you get it?

13
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,821
Your friend!

14
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,823
What the fuck is
he doing at columbia?

15
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,325
God, he's
fucking cute!

16
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:25,328
Our families are friends
, i've known him forever.

17
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,333
You like that?

18
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:32,836
I choose you!

19
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,842
Having fun?

20
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,844
Not as muc
h as caitlin.

21
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,846
You see the eyes
she had on me?

22
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:43,847
The lid, dude.

23
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,849
She's from
okla- fuckin'- homa.

24
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,350
So, jackie, you're
in a frat now?

25
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,352
Rutgers chapter,
since freshman year.

26
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:50,854
I came up here
to see you.

27
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,356
Got any more x?

28
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,359
For you, the
first hit's free.

29
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,870
Just don't
tell your dad.

30
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,872
I don't
even talk to
him anymore.

31
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,380
Read'em and
suck my dick!

32
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,384
Yes, yes!
Yes, baby!

33
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,887
30 times,
right there,
that's mine.

34
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,889
Ho, he's still
got the dice?

35
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,390
I own these
fuckin' dice.

36
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,393
You're makin
' me a rich man,
ralphie boy.

37
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,898
The boss.

38

00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,904

Fuckin' faccia

00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:53,416

I'm on a roll here.

46
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,427
You'll be on a slab
you keep it up.

47
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,430
Hey, come here.

48
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,432
Hey, ton'.

49
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,434
I'm sorry,
this fuckin' guy.

50
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,949
Hello, anthony.

51
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,459
You look good.

52
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,968
Want a drink?

53
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,470
Another time,
anthony.

54
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,474
Another time.

55
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:04,487
Let's whack this cocksucker
and be done with it.

56
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,991
I'm here to
enjoy myself.

57
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,998
I'm so fuckin' hard.

58
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,504
No, jackie, don't.

59
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,515
Meadow.

60
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,018
Meadow, wake up.

61
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm so sleepy.

62
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,022
You drank too much
fuckin' tequila.

63
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,524
C'mon, i can't
stop now.

64
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:19,062
"Another time,
anthony"?

65
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:21,064
Cocksucker turns
his back on the boss?

66
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,565
That i couldn't
believe.

67
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,067
He's lucky i didn't put
one in his fuckin' head!

68
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,070
On that front, don't
be surprised if paulie
pops the question.

69
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,572
Ralphie's star
is rising.

70
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:32,575
All those unions.

71
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,078
Paulie can't come near
that kinda cash for us.

72
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,579
Ralphie's a
good earner.

73
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,081
Guy like that...

74
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,582
loose cannon.

75
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,585
You'll be leaving your hou
he'll pull a jack ruby on you.

76
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:45,088
Why'd i have to punch
this fuckin' asshole?

77
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,589
Frankly...

78
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,591
i was a little
surprised.

79
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,593
You're gonna start
on me now, huh?

80
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,595
He disrespected
"the bing".

81
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,597
So, he's barre
d from the place.

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,603
He bashed
that poor
girl's brains in.

83
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,105
I hear you...

84
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,606
i know.

85
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:05,608
It was a tragedy.

86
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,110
The fact is though,

87
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,612
she was not related to
you by blood or marriage.

88
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,614
She was no
t your goomata.

89
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,117
Ralphie's
a made guy, ton'.

90
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,619
All things considered,
he's got a legitimate beef.

91
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:21,124
Make him disappear
or make nice.

92
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,626
You only got
two choices.

93
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,133
I would suggest someth
ing in the way of an apology.

94
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,135
Absolutely
fuckin' not!

95
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,138
Do something public that
shows there's no bad blood.

96
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,639
Give him...

97
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,641
give him a piece
of the casino.

98
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,144
We're partnered
with new york on that

99
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,147
and i don't want him
that close to johnny sack.

100
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:47,150
You could bump him
up to captain.

101
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,652
It's what he's bee
n wanting, you know.

102
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:52,155
Ralphie a fuckin'
captain...

103
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,160
over my dead body.

104
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:01,664
Thank you.

105
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,669
You see that
shit before?

106
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,672
The look on tony's
face when i turned
down that drink?

107
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:11,674
Buy me a drink?
Fuck you.

108
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,676
He knew it
was wrong,
what he did.

109
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,678
He is
the boss,

110
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:17,680
he could do
what he wants.

111
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,182
Boss or no,

112
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,684
you don't raise
your hands to
another made guy.

113
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:24,687
Joe mo from mulberry street,
exact same situation.

114
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,689
He smacked that guy
from north bergen around.

115
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,690
Huge problem.

116
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,192
Of course.

117
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,194
Rules are rules,
otherwise, what?

118
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,695
Fuckin' anarchy.

119
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,198
At the very least,
tony owes you an apology.

120
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,200
The money i put
in his pocket for
construction alone,

121
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,202
he should hit his
knees, this prick.

122
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,204
What?

123
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,206
You think i'm afraid
of that fat fuck?

124
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,708
No offense.

125
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,710
I could see
if it was
his daughter,

126
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,712
or a niece of his,

127
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,216
but all this over
some dead whore.

128
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,718
He had to be
fuckin' her.

129
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:56,719
No.

130
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,222
He knew you were
fuckin' her.

131
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,224
That's why,
that's how he is,

132
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,226
like a dog
with two bones.

133
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,229
I'm supposed to
go over there...

134
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:09,232
for thanksgiving,
me and ro, tony's.

135
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:10,733
Really?

136
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,235
Fuck him
and his turkey.

137
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,238
I oughta shove a
drumstick up his ass.

138
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:25,748
Look who i
caught sneaking
in the fire door.

139
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:28,751
My parishioners
might not
understand

140
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:30,253
i'm here to help
feed the hungry.

141
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,256
Reverend.

142
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,257
Happy thanksgiving.

143
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,259
Madonn',
who needs it?

144
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,261
Oh, c'mon, turkey,
sweet potatoes,
pumpkin pie?

145
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,762
You gotta
love all that.

146
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:42,765
That's because
you never lived through
the "walyo" version.

147
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:44,767
Major antipast' first.

148
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:46,269
Then soup,

149
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:47,770
meatballs
and scharol

150
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,273
then the baked
manigott',

151
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,275
then the bird.

152
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,777
I love manicotti.

153
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:55,778
Turkeys
are here.

154
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,780
There are some
in here, too.

155
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:03,286
Thing with turkeys,
they got no sense
of direction.

156
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:06,289
They're on their
way to food emporium
and now look.

157
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,793
What's this i
hear about ralph
cifaretto?

158
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,296
He refused to
have a drink w
ith you at the club?

159
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,298
So?

160
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:18,301
He refused the
drink'cause h
e's a despicable fuck

161
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,803
that i bitch- slapp
ed at a moment of
very justified anger.

162
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,306
That sounds like
a problem.

163
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,310
Happy thanksgiving
to you and yours.

164
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,811
Yeah, you too.

165
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,813
Happy thanksgiving,
reverend.

166
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:31,814
That mine?

167
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,816
Ah, beautiful.

168
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:34,817
Look at that.

169
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,320
Ah, shit!

170
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,821
What's the matter?

171
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,324
That fuckin' asshole's
supposed to come
to thanksgiving

172
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:42,825
with rosalie.

173
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,327
No way
he'll show.

174
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,828
I'm gonna give
him the option?

175
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,331
That cocksucker
shouldn't even be ther
e in the first place.

176
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,338
Honey, i know
you don't like to--

177
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,342
i know you don't like
to be pinned down,

178
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,345
but thanksgiving, it would
be very nice to be able to

179
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,347
tell carmela
whether you're coming.

180
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,849
Who's gonna
be there?

181
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,351
Besides us?

182
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,353
I don't know,
carm's parents.

183
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,854
Great.

184
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,856
How about meadow?

185
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,859
So, thanksgiving,
who's all coming
this year?

186
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,361
You know,
the usual.

187
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:20,363
Nana and grandpa...

188
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,864
chris and ade.

189
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,867
I think janice is bringing
someone from her prayer group.

190
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,370
Um, and aunt ro
and uncle ralph.

191
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,373
Jackie's probably
not coming though, right?

192
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:32,375
Oh, i don't know, why?

193
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,876
Can't i just
ask anything?

194
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,378
Alright,
take it easy.

195
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,879
I have class, i'll
see you thursday.

196
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,881
Alright, bye.

197
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,388
Hello.

198
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:46,889
Hey, carm,
it's ro.

199
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,891
God, that is so weird
that you just called.

200
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,393
I just hung up
with meadow

201
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,395
and she was asking if jackie
was coming for thanksgiving.

202
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,896
Oh, really?

203
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,399
Jackie just asked
me about her.

204
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,400
My radar's up.

205
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,403
Oh, you and those
romance novels, rosalie.

206
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,905
Can you imagine
the beautiful children

207
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,408
those two would make,
with those genes?

208
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:07,910
Remember when meadow
was born, what we said?

209
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,912
Yes, we said a lot
of things, ro.

210
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,915
Do me a favor,
concentrate on that almond
torte of yours, alright?

211
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,417
I'm counting on you.

212
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,418
I'm looking
for the recipe.

213
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:16,919
Alright, bye.

214
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:24,927
Here's the turkey.

215
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,429
Oh, my god,
it's huge.

216
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,432
Good thing, i'm
feeding an army
this year.

217
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,434
Not as many
as you think.

218
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:34,437
I need you to call rosalie
and cancel with them.

219
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,439
Thanksgiving, why?

220
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,940
Just do it,
alright?

221
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,442
Enough of this
jetson's shit

222
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,444
them coming over to
mr. Spacely's house
for dinner.

223
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,446
I was just talking
to her, what
am i gonna say?

224
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,947
Fine, i'll call.

225
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,450
And my excuse won't be
nearly as nice as yours.

226
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,955
Goddamnit, tony.

227
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:56,959
What, your
stomach still?

228
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,470
Dr. Akavi?

229
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,474
Gloria trillo,
globe mercedes.

230
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:17,480
Listen, a pre- owned
2001 s- 600 just came in.

231
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,982
You're the first
person i thought of.

232
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,985
Wood trim package,
gps with everything.

233
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:26,489
Only 7500 miles,

234
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,994
i don't think
it's gonna las
t till saturday.

235
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,996
Tomorrow?

236
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,498
Great.

237
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,003
No, i'm sorry, i can't,
we're doing a sales
meeting at lunch.

238
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,006
Okay, see ya...

239
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:46,008
bye.

240
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,524
You waiting for
somebody in there?

241
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,025
I got an
appointment.

242
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,527
Did she
double- book us?

243
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,529
I'm usually thursday,

244
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,031
but i had to reschedule
because of the holiday.

245
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,534
This is when
i usually come.

246
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:18,541
I'm trying to
quit smoking.

247
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,543
Serial killer.

248
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,546
I murdered
seven relationships.

249
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,549
Listen, you're here.

250
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,551
Why don't you take
my appointment?

251
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,553
Oh, no, no,
i couldn't
do that, no.

252
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,555
It would be my good
deed for the day.

253
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,058
Flag on the play.

254
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:38,060
I'm pretty sure
you said tuesday.

255
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,562
I did?

256
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:42,064
I'll come back next we
ek at the same time and...

257
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,066
no problemo.

258
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,568
I told her she could
have my appointment.

259
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:47,570
Actually, it is
a little difficult

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,572
getting away
from work.

261
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:50,573
See?

262
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,576
I...

263
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:56,078
i could see you
tonight at seven.

264
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,082
Yeah,
yeah, thanks.

265
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,083
Okay.

266
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:03,085
How hard was that?

267
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,601
Hello?

268
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,102
Ro, it's carm.

269
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:24,106
This is so terrible to do
on such short notice,

270
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,108
but i just got off
the phone with ma.

271
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,109
What's the matter?

272
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,110
It's my father.

273
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,112
They had some
troubling test results.

274
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:31,614
Something to do with
his white blood cells.

275
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:33,616
Oh, my god.

276
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,618
Yeah, i know, uh...

277
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,620
they're gonna have to
do further testing

278
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,622
before they can be
sure of the diagnosis.

279
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,624
Ma just wants to have
a quiet thanksgiving.

280
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:44,126
She said that they
would have it just
the two of them, but--

281
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,128
they should be
with their family.

282
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,131
I feel so awful giving
you so little notice.

283
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:52,635
Don't be silly, i
just wish there wa
s something i could do.

284
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,637
Thank you, ro,
that is so sweet.

285
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,139
Of course, i'll let you know
when i know anything more.

286
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,641
Okay, take care,
sweetheart.

287
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,142
Bye.

288
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,144
Alright, bye- bye.

289
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,652
Carm's father,
he's sick.

290
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:12,655
She had to cancel
thanksgiving.

291
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,162
It's three a. M.

292
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,665
Bam, come
wide awake.

293
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,167
Something specific?

294
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,169
It's a management
problem.

295
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,171
It's a situation
with an underling.

296
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,674
Now, it's partly
my fault.

297
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,677
But he never should've
done what he did.

298
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,679
What was it?

299
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,681
Could you
tell me that?

300
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:43,185
He caused the...

301
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,187
early retirement...

302
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,190
of somebody else.

303
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,195
The particulars aren't
important, he fucked up.

304
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,702
Ordinarily, i would
just, you know...

305
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,704
put him
out to pasture.

306
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,206
But he's a very valuable
piece of manpower.

307
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:07,710
Is it complicated by a
personal relationship?

308
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,719
I been reading that...

309
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:19,221
book you
told me about.

310
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:22,725
"The art of war",
by sun tzu.

311
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,229
Here's this guy...

312
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:31,734
a chinese general, wrote
this thing 2400 years ago.

313
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,236
And most of it
still applies today.

314
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,238
Balk the enemy's power.

315
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,741
Force him to
reveal himself.

316
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,743
Uh, i have to ask...

317
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,745
are you in any
sort of danger?

318
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,747
No, can i go on?

319
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:49,752
Most of the guys that i know,
they read prince machiavelli.

320
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,755
I had carmela go and get
the cliff notes once...

321
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,759
he's okay.

322
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,262
But this book is much
better about strategy.

323
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,774
Listen, i wanted to
ask you about the girl.

324
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,776
That woman that
was here today.

325
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,778
The mercedes
saleslady.

326
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,780
I'm very sorry
about the confusion.

327
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,782
What does somebody like
that need a shrink for?

328
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:22,785
I can't talk about
another patient.

329
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:24,286
Just...

330
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,790
it makes you wonder,
that's all.

331
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:43,806
It's after hours,
it's dark.

332
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,810
You want me to walk
you to your car?

333
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,813
No, thank you.

334
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:54,316
I have some work i have
to catch up on here.

335
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:06,829
Anyone for
a turtle?

336
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,831
Hmm?

337
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,833
Aaron, honey.

338
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,834
Hey!

339
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:12,835
What?

340
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,837
Oh.

341
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,338
Who's winning?

342
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,340
Like you even know
who's playin'.

343
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,842
It so happens
that i do.

344
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:21,343
Detroit plays
every thanksgiving.

345
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:24,346
What a shame barry
sanders retired.

346
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,348
He's a real
sweetheart.

347
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,350
A. J. , did you tell
your dad and your grandpa

348
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,853
how i served him
when i waitressed
at kenny roger's?

349
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,354
Colonel sanders.

350
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,857
No, at kenny rogers,
barry sanders.

351
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,359
Yeah, sh
e served him.

352
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,869
Yes!

353
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:47,870
Hey.

354
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,881
Yeah!

355
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,390
Hey.

356
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,391
Hey.

357
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,897
Meadow, you know i lov
e you more than anything
in this world, right?

358
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:17,900
Dad, what are you
talking about?

359
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,403
I know things haven't been
so good with us lately,

360
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,905
it's just...

361
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,909
if anything were eve
r to happen to you...

362
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,411
everybody, come
on, dinner!

363
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:30,913
Go ahead.

364
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,422
I'll tell you, thi
s turned out to be
a blessing in disguise.

365
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,925
My two boys...

366
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:46,428
i was worried about
the gravy, but...

367
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,432
ralph, honey,
you feel alright?

368
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,935
You hardly touched
your manigott'.

369
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,938
I'm fine,
christ, please,
how many times?

370
00:20:55,938 --> 00:21:00,442
Jackie, honey, you don't
have to stay for dessert
if you don't want to.

371
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,444
Jesus chri
st, a little
manners, huh?

372
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,946
What'd she
just say?

373
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:04,947
It's okay.

374
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,448
Why do
n't you go see

375
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,951
if meadow wants to go
to a movie or something?

376
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,452
Sure, ma.

377
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,955
Good dinner.

378
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,461
I'll tell ya
a nifty trick.

379
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,463
Break off a piece
of ohio kitchen match,

380
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:22,965
in the screw hole,

381
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,967
give the
threads something
to grab onto.

382
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,969
Yeah?

383
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,971
'Cause i used th
e elmer's and th
e knob still fell out.

384
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,472
Forget about it.

385
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:43,485
Narcolepsy
is an a. S. D. A.
Certified dissomnia.

386
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:45,487
It's no picnic.

387
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:47,489
Almost time for
turkey sandwiches!

388
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:50,993
I'll put
more coffee on.

389
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,496
Oh, my god, who
could that be?

390
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,999
It's the boston
strangler, jesus, ma.

391
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll get it.

392
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,005
Hey.

393
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:04,506
Hey!

394
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,008
Jackie, hi!

395
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,011
I guess you know
everybody here

396
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,014
except for aaron,
janice's friend.

397
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:13,515
Hey, aaron.

398
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:15,517
Have you heard
the good news?

399
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,520
He is risen.

400
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,023
Sit down, we're gonna have
some turkey sandwiches.

401
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:25,027
Thanks,
i already ate.

402
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:28,030
Just figured i'd
see if meadow wanted
to do something.

403
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,032
See a movie,
whatever.

404
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,036
Sure, i mean, i was gonna
go over to hunter's.

405
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,037
You wanna go?

406
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,538
Whatever.

407
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:39,541
I'll be down

408
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,543
A soprano

409
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:48,050
So, how's school,

410
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,552
Yeah, gpa's up
this quarter.

411
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:59,061
Why don't you just bag
it, and come to dov's?

412
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,064
Hunter's
expecting me.

413
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,084
We can hang out
all weekend.

414
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:24,086
We wouldn't have to
like do anything.

415
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,090
I have to study.

416
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,092
Don't you have
midterms too?

417
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:31,593
I don't ev
en go anymore.

418
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:32,594
What?

419
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,096
Why?

420
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,598
Organic chemistry?

421
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,600
Nucleotides and shit.

422
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:42,604
You wanna know wha
t i'm interested in?

423
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,606
Men's fashion.

424
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:48,110
Not the faggy part of
it, but like to be hugo boss.

425
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,613
Did you ever think
of applying to fit?

426
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,116
It's supposed to be
a good school for that.

427
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:55,617
Come on,
come to dov's.

428
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,120
I wanna be
with you so bad.

429
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:02,624
I can't, jackie.

430
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,629
What?

431
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,133
You won't go
with me, but you'd
go with that black guy?

432
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,635
It's not that i
don't want to go.

433
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,637
I've been hurt.

434
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,641
Just give me
some time, okay?

435
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:40,662
...as street corners

436
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,664
are heaps of crumbled
wrath and masonry.

437
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:44,666
...darling christmas gift--

438
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:47,169
three shuttles remain, now--

439
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,174
it makes me crazy,
rosalie, all of them.

440
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:54,676
They're alread
y hiring the caterers.

441
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:57,679
I mean, we were young
when we got married,
but those two?

442
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,681
Emotionally they are
much younger than we were.

443
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:01,683
...until then,

444
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:04,686
here's how you'll
get your thrills.

445
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:10,192
The mercedes- benz
coups and convertibles.

446
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:11,693
Earth to tony.

447
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,198
I'm thinking of
getting one of those.

448
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,700
What,
a mercedes?

449
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,203
Go ahead, it's
a cute car.

450
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:25,207
You hear?

451
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,709
T disinvited ralph
to thanksgiving.

452
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,710
No shit.

453
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,711
Madonn'.

454
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,714
Tony sees
the big picture.

455
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:34,216
Oh, little paulie.

456
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,717
Hey, ton'.

457
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,219
This prick
treating you okay?

458
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,721
No complaints.

459
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:41,723
C'mon, little paulie,
everybody,

460
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:44,226
i'll buy you
an egg cream.

461
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,229
C'mon,
sit down.

462
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:57,739
So...

463
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:01,243
how are things going ove
r there with our friend?

464
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,245
The same,
you know.

465
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,247
What's he saying
about me?

466
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:08,250
To me? Nothing,
he knows better.

467
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,751
He's still breaking
my balls though,

468
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:11,753
about taking
orders from me.

469
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:13,755
Plus now, with you and him
and all that other shit there.

470
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:16,258
It's your job to
make my job easier.

471
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:18,260
I'm not complaining,
you asked me.

472
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,762
He's a frustrating guy.

473
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,268
I don't know how
things are gonna go...

474
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:29,271
but i can't promis
e he's gonna go away.

475
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,772
It's not just him.

476
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,274
This freon deal.

477
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:34,276
We're in the middle
of a major renovation
at the house,

478
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:37,279
i got two kids
getting ready for
college soon.

479
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,782
Hey, hang in there
, you're doing a good job.

480
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,302
Did you see
those bags?

481
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:02,304
Fuckin' stress
is killing him.

482
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:03,305
Yeah.

483
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:07,309
Maybe he wants
my fuckin' job.

484
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,812
...it's a matter of
honor this thanksgiving

485
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:13,815
because everyone a
t texas remembers turkey
day two years ago...

486
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:15,817
sure you don't wanna eat
? i got a little turkey left.

487
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,319
No, than
k you, dear.

488
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,820
Johnny, please,
don't get up.

489
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:21,823
I'm off to physical
therapy, hon.

490
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:25,327
Used to be some
hoofer, poor thing.

491
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,829
Takes a terrible
toll on the joints.

492
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,836
You heard what he di
d with thanksgiving?

493
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:37,839
It's not good,
ralph.

494
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,841
Will you please tell m
e what i did to this guy?

495
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:43,345
Turn down a drink
? i wasn't thirsty!

496
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,846
Ralph.

497
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,848
Ever since i'm back fr
om miami he's up my ass!

498
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:48,850
I'm earning with
three hands here,

499
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,853
and it's still not good enough
to satisfy this cocksucker!

500
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,356
And then he
fuckin' hits me?

501
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:57,859
I'm telling you, john.

502
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,861
He's not leaving me
a lot of options here.

503
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:00,862
Don't talk crazy!

504
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,366
You wanna commit suicide,
pills are a lot easier.

505
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:11,873
What do you th
ink carmine wouldsay

506
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,875
if i wanted to
switch families?

507
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,377
Come w
ith you guys.

508
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,879
Carmine doesn't
know who you are.

509
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,881
You could tell him.

510
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:22,384
Ralph,
listen to me.

511
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:24,886
As a friend...

512
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,888
i know tony
can be difficult.

513
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:28,890
His father was the
same, his uncle,

514
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,892
they always need
someone to demonize.

515
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:33,895
But new york and
the sopranos have
long- standing ties

516
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:35,897
and that's
not gonna change,

517
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,899
not for you
or anybody else.

518
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,901
You want me
to be frank?

519
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,904
You brought
this on yourself
with that girl.

520
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:44,906
"A", she was
a whore,

521
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,909
"b", she hit me.

522
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,414
And that wasn't my
kid she was carrying.

523
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,421
It was the
fucking coke,

524
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:02,424
i should've never
started with that shit.

525
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:06,928
Fuckin' miami, it'
s all over the place.

526
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:08,930
Just tell anthony
you're sorry.

527
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,932
I was high
, i admit it,

528
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,934
and i swear to christ
i'm not doing it anymore.

529
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:15,437
"Tony, i'm sorry."

530
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:16,938
Fuck that, what good
would it do?

531
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,440
It might
save your life!

532
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,942
He hit me!

533
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:23,445
He was wrong,
believe me, he knows.

534
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:29,951
You don't think i know
people are laughing
behind my back?

535
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,954
I'll talk to tony,
i'm sure he'll
make it right.

536
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:34,456
At this
point, how?

537
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,958
I don't know.

538
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,464
Would you take
capo of your crew?

539
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:47,469
No, no, i wouldn't
, no fuckin' way.

540
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,471
Ralph cifaretto
came by.

541
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,473
What'd he want,

542
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:55,477
a fully- fueled jet
and a safe trip to the pope?

543
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,479
He's running scared si
nce you cancelled that dinner.

544
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,482
If your opponent
is of choleric
temper, irritate him.

545
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,484
Yeah, well,

546
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,986
he wants
to apologize.

547
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:06,488
Oh, really?

548
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,990
Would that p
ut this to rest?

549
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:13,495
If it's sincere.

550
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:17,499
It might relieve me of
a very unpleasant decision.

551
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:20,001
You know, they're about to
break ground on the esplanade.

552
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:23,004
We're talking about
millions of dollars
here, tony.

553
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:25,507
It wouldn't hurt either of
to have a point man in there

554
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,008
feels appreciated.

555
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,011
I'm just saying.

556
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,514
It wouldn't hurt
to throw him a bone.

557
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:33,515
Like what?

558
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,018
Capo?

559
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:38,520
No fuckin' way.

560
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,021
Never.

561
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,024
You heard
what he did.

562
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:46,027
That poor girl just
had her 20th birthday.

563
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:47,529
Capo's what
he mentioned.

564
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:50,031
I threw cold water
on it right away.

565
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,536
But she was
a whore, tony.

566
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:58,540
I don't want to talk about
that situation ever again,
with anybody.

567
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,041
You understand me?

568
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,043
It was just
a suggestion,

569
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:03,545
keep a happy shop.

570
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:05,046
Correct me
if i'm wrong,

571
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,048
didn't you say you weren't
gonna stick your beak in?

572
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,550
Can't two friends talk?

573
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:12,053
I talked to him, he's
delighted you wanna see him.

574
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,556
Great, he
said that?

575
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:16,558
That's great.

576
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,560
That's fuckin'
great news.

577
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,561
What'd i tell you?

578
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,062
Listen, the
other thing,

579
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:24,065
what's he gonna do
to make that right?

580
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:25,567
Just talk to him.

581
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,569
He indicated he's very open
to working something out.

582
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:29,571
Thank you,
thank you.

583
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,072
Anything!

584
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,575
Thank you,
thank you.

585
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,080
Oh, fabian!

586
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,082
The fuck you doing
up before noon?

587
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,584
I'm moving out,

588
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:44,085
over to dov's.

589
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,589
Beanie boy?

590
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:50,091
Yeah, his reserve unit
in israel got called up.

591
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,093
God bless
america, huh?

592
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:57,098
Listen, you find
yourself short on x,

593
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:59,601
i know a guy.

594
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:01,603
X?

595
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:02,604
What?

596
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,607
I'm trying to
do you a favor.

597
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,610
And just so
you know,

598
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,113
that bullshit
your future father- in- law
pulled over thanksgiving,

599
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,616
he knew i had no intention
of going over there.

600
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:16,618
He's trying
to save face.

601
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:20,622
So he stoops so
low, he had his wife
lie to your mother.

602
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:24,125
Whatever you need,
give me a call.

603
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,127
Be good.

604
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,584
The woman is
50 years old.

605
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,088
Sometimes i just want
to scream in her face,

606
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:41,092
"quit whining, no
wonder he left you!"

607
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,095
Her supervisor looks
at her cross- eyed

608
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:48,099
and i get a call at
3:00 in the morning.

609
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,602
She wants to talk
about how her father
laughed at her

610
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,605
when she fell off her bicycle
when she was seven.

611
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,607
Does she call yo
ur emergency number?

612
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,609
No, that's not
the point, elliot!

613
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,113
Oh, these fuckin'
interruptions!

614
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,616
I was raped.

615
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,619
You have feelings of y
our own and who is listening?

616
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,121
That's right,
damnit.

617
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,125
I have to sit there

618
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,628
and take care of these
people hour after hour

619
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,132
with all
their problems...

620
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,135
and some of them are very
real and very serious,

621
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,637
and i'm sorry,

622
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,639
i care,
i really do...

623
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,643
but it's hard
sometimes.

624
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,646
I just want to
say,"i hurt!"

625
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,150
Good, sure.

626
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,651
That's why
you're here.

627
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,154
I'm sorry,
elliot.

628
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,656
No need to
be sorry.

629
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,161
You've been
through such trauma.

630
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,164
It takes tremendous
strength of will

631
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,166
and inner resource

632
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,168
to soldier on as you
do at your work.

633
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,170
Thank you,
elliot.

634
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,675
I try,
i really do.

635
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,178
It's just
hard sometimes.

636
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,684
And patient
soprano?

637
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,686
How's all that?

638
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:20,691
He offered to
escort me to my car.

639
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,694
I almost fell in
his arms crying.

640
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,199
Oh, jesus christ.

641
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,706
Chris.

642
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,707
Paulie.

643
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,209
Ralphie.

644
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,246
You wanted
to see me?

645
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,748
Yeah, tony.

646
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,750
About what?

647
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,252
About what?

648
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,753
You know...

649
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,256
to apologize.

650
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:27,758
Oh.

651
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,764
Sit down?

652
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,277
I was doing
a lot of coke.

653
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,280
I said some things and
i did some things...

654
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,285
that i'm sorry for.

655
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,787
It's not gonna
happen again.

656
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,792
What'd you do?

657
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,297
I was rude

658
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,799
when you offered
me the drink.

659
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,804
And i disrespected
"the bing".

660
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,311
And the girl...

661
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,318
that shouldn't
have happened.

662
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,819
Like i said,

663
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,321
i was doing
a lot of coke.

664
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,327
But i gave
that up, and...

665
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,830
end of story,
and...

666
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,337
i'm sorry,
tony, okay?

667
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,855
Anything else?

668
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:22,873
Hey.

669
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,375
What's up,
gi?

670
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,876
Hey, gi.

671
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,379
My wife made some
turkey sandwiches
if anybody wants one.

672
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,382
I'm still a
little bloated
from thanksgiving.

673
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,884
Thanksgiving,
1982.

674
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,887
Fucking turkey,
it's like spackle
in my bowels.

675
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:37,888
Nothing moves.

676
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,391
Want me to run to rite aids
and get you some metamucil?

677
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,892
Nah, i hat
e that shit.

678
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,395
Maybe i'll try
one with lettuce
and cranberry.

679
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,898
Ralph around?

680
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,899
Not yet.

681
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,401
Want me to
give him a call?

682
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,404
Please, let's just
enjoy the quiet, huh?

683
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,407
After decades of planning,
ground was broken today

684
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,410
on the city
of newark,
new jersey's

685
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,412
museum of science
and trucking, and
riverfront esplanade.

686
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,913
Oh, hi, ralphie.

687
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,915
C'mon in, he's
watching tv.

688
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,917
...the project
was held up several times

689
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,919
by political infighting--

690
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,922
nothing, he
gave me nothing.

691
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,925
Two seconds,
look, the fuckin
g esplanade, finally.

692
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,928
We're gonna need our
own bulldozers to
take the money away.

693
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,430
Not a thing, john.

694
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,932
Not a thank
you, not an
apology, nothing!

695
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,435
Calm down,
take it easy.

696
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,938
He let me stand there
like a servant...

697
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,941
scraping,
bowing!

698
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,445
Cocksucker didn't even
invite me to sit down.

699
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,447
It's posturing,
it's part of the game.

700
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,449
Fuck the game,
he's going down.

701
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,451
Are you fucking
stupid coming in here
talking to me like that?

702
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,453
I don't give a
fuck anymore!

703
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,456
I've given my life
to this thing

704
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,958
and this is the
thanks i get?

705
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,977
It's silvio dante
on the phone.

706
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,479

707
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,481
Tell him i

708
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,482
They're my children.

709
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,484
You seriously cannot be--

710
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,990

711
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,493
You shut the door?

712
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,998
Jesus christ, you're
worse than bobby.

713
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,502
Anybody see
you come in?

714
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,503
Yeah.

715
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,505
Fuck'em.

716
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,507
I don't give
a shit anymore.

717
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,009
Brought you some
leftover turkey
and stuffing,

718
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,511
manigott'.

719
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,513
Keep it.

720
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,515
Everything
goes through me.

721
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,518
And these drafts,
i should be down in boca.

722
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,020
Drafts?

723
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,523
It's like the fucking
amazon jungle in here.

724
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,025
What's the
thermostat say?

725
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,527
Don't touch it!

726
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,531
Alright.

727
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,534
Jesus.

728
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,537
You're scaring t
he hell outta me here.

729
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,542
The though
t of losing you.

730
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,544
Grandpa,

731
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,547
did he ever work for
somebody named trillo?

732
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,550
He owned a
lumberyard?

733
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,552
My father was
a master stonemason,

734
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,554
he never cut
fucking wood.

735
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,556
A contractor then?

736
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,058
Built garden
apartments?

737
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,061
There was somebody
named trillo, he had
seven daughters.

738
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,063
I can't remember.

739
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,571
I thought you were
gonna ask my advice
about ralph cifaretto.

740
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,078
Got any thoughts?

741
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,580
What else
do i have left?

742
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,584
A real contremps you have
on your hands here.

743
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,089
A good kid, but you never
should've put gigi in there.

744
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,091
He's strong,
a good earner,

745
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,093
well respected.

746
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,095
Not by that crew.

747
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,097
To them he's a ghibelline
coming over to butt in.

748
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,100
They don't trust him,
they undermine him.

749
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,103
On top of that,
you got ralph now
pissing in their ears.

750
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,606
Any day you'll have a
mutiny on your hands.

751
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,109
So, i take gigi out,

752
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,111
what kind of message
does that send?

753
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,114
That you're indecisive
and unsure of yourself.

754
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,116
Exactly.

755
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,619
Who the fuck would i
replace him with anyway?

756
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,621
All good questions.

757
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,623
Great, what's
the fuckin' answer?

758
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,625
Who says
there is one?

759
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,627
That's what
being a boss is,

760
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,128
you steer the ship
the best way you know.

761
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,631
Sometimes it's smooth,
sometimes you hit the rocks.

762
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,633
In the meantime,

763
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,135
you find your pleasures
where you can.

764
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,142
How much longer,
skip?

765
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,144
I gotta
take a leak!

766
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,662
Holy jesus.

767
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,176
What the fuck
are you lookin'
at? Call 911.

768
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,181
I don't
feel a pulse.

769
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,184
I'm so sorry.

770
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,191
I'm sorry.

771
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,693
Thank you,
tony.

772
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,195
He was a
good man.

773
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,198
Never said
a bad word
about anybody.

774
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,704
Thank you,
tony.

775
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,707
I'm so sorry.

776
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,223
It's fuckin' awful.

777
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,726
He's a young man.

778
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,228
Heart disease...

779
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,232
the silent killer.

780
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,235
Hey, there are
worse ways togo.

781
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,740
Even still, on
the pisciadood?

782
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,242
Pretty fuckin'
humiliating.

783
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,745
It's how
elvis died.

784
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,247
That guy in
hollywood too.

785
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,249
Don something.

786
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,752
Producer o
f "the simpsons".

787
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,257
So, there'
s a vacancy.

788
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,760
There's a lot
of business to do.

789
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,764
You thought about
who it's gonna be?

790
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,801
Terrible, it's a
terrible thing.

791
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,303
Guy was in here
twice a week.

792
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,807
Brought the kids
in and everything
on sundays.

793
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,317
Artie,
hey, ton'.

794
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,322
I gotta go

pork shoulder.

795
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,829
You wanted
to see me?

796
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,330
Sit down.

797
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,844
I'm making

798
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,347
You are?

799
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,850
That's great.

800
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,852
Oh, that's
fuckin' great.

801
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,354
Anthony, you're no
t gonna be sorry.

802
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:25,355
Thank you.

803
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,868
What?

804
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,373
I need to hear

805
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,876
it was merit,

806
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,879
and not just'cause

807
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,883
somebody was constipated
and blew a gasket.

808
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,391
You're gonna be making
a lot more money, ralphie,

809
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,393
so, don't
question.

810
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,896
You wanted captain?
You're captain.

811
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,898
Thank you, tony,
you're right.

812
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,403
I've wanted this

813
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,406
Well...

814
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,910
you know
what they say.

815
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,413
Be careful what you wish
for, you just might get it.

816
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,920
So, um...

817
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,923

821
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:13,964

826
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,981
Her body is mad ripe.

827
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,983
Yeah, but did

828
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,485
She's creamin'

You didn't
fuck her yet.

830
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,492
I don't know if it's
even a smart thing.

831
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,494
She's tony soprano's
daughter.

00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,014
Ha, ha, ha.

Ow! Easy.

850
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,552
What's the matter?

851
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,554
My purse is stuck.

852
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,559
You gu

00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,064
Blew a tire.

As long as

00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,574
I don't know what
i would've done if

861
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:06,076
You almost died.

862
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,577
I'm so sorry.

863
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,080
I should've
taken you to vassar
like you wanted.

864
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,082
But you loved
that car.

865
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,583

880
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,649
You have good taste.

881
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:24,154
Mind if i take
it for a test drive?

882
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,157
You have to be accompanied
by a sales rep.

883
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,159
