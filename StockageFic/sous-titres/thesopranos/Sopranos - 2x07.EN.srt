1
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,056
Oh, my god.

2
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:09,562
What'd you
freak out for?

3
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,564
Holy shit.

4
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,579
Hey fac',
how you doing?

5
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,580
How's it goin'?

6
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,582
How you doin'?

7
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,586
Adriana, this is
my cousin gregory,
the ambulance chaser.

8
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,088
Nice to meet you.

9
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,090
This is my fiancee,
amy safir.

10
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,592
Pleasure, christopher,
to finally meet you in person.

11
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,095
Greg's always giving me updates
on his new york cousin.

12
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,596
We're from
jersey.

13
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,599
My apologies,
that's the red- eye talking.

14
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,102
Your earrings
are so excellent.

15
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,103
Thank you.

16
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,105
How was
your flight?

17
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,606
Fine, good.

18
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,109
Drink, drink, drink!

19
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,612
Morgan stanley's
night out.

20
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,115
Christopher said you're
here shooting a movie.

21
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,617
That must be
so interesting.

22
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,619
This is the first project
i brought in to jon.

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,121
Who's jon?

24
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,123
Jon favreau, she's head
of his development.

25
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,624
I told you that.

26
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,625
You told me
tarrantino.

27
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,628
I worked for quentin,
he's still a friend.

28
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,131
Anyway, favreau
snapped her right up.

29
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,633
That movie he did,
"swingers".

30
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,136
Vince vaughn
is so cute.

31
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,639
So christopher,
how goes the screenplay?

32
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,144
It's one of the best
i've ever read.

33
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,647
Hey, easy,
okay?

34
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,150
What's he like
in person?

35
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,651
Incredibly funny,
smart,

36
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,153
jon's totally
accessible.

37
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,654
You guys should come
visit the set.

38
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,656
No, i meant
vince vaughn.

39
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,658
Great, great,
a friend.

40
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,660
So, when do we get
to read this opus?

41
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,163
I flushed it
a long time ago.

42
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,664
Remember what i told you
on the phone?

43
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,666
Mob theme stories
are always hot.

44
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,169
You should've learned
to keep your mouth shut.

45
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,172
What do you do,
adriana?

46
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:05,678
Right now i'm in
the food service industry.

47
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,680
Christopher!

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,182
You, get up.

49
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,683
Who, me?

50
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,187
Hey, bridge and tunnel boy,
chill out.

51
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,698
Hey, guys, let's go
to tribeca grill.

52
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,700
It's cooler,
it's better.

53
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,202
Why are we leaving?

54
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,206
Just do it.

55
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,709
She seemed so down to earth
for a hollywood person.

56
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,211
What's with
those clothes?

57
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,213
She in the fucking
"addams family"?

58
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,215
That's prada!

59
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,218
If i was greg,
i wouldn't allow it.

60
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,220
Look at you,
you look like a fucking woman,

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,721
not a bellhop.

62
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,723
Jon favreau,
he's great!

63
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,726
He's also a writer,
you should show him
your script.

64
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,228
"Swingers"?

65
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,732
He can suck my dick,
that swings, too.

66
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,736
That acting class really
rubbed you the wrong way.

67
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,239
I love movies, but i just
want to be a player.

68
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,741
I don't want to fuck around
with all this other shit.

69
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,742
So?

70
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,744
Be a player.

71
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,746
We'll go to the set,
she invited us!

72
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,248
Slip him your script.

73
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,251
That's what they call it,
slipping the script.

74
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,255
Who knows...
you know?

75
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,259
Would it be
so friggin' horrible
to attend a premier?

76
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,760
I don't even
have the thing.

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,765
I threw it away.

78
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,267
What?

79
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,269
You have a copy?

80
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,771
Adriana, i told you,
i'm not interested.

81
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,773
I believe in you.

82
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,793
It wasn't my fault!

83
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,295
You stole my car.

84
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,297
Where's the trust
in this house?

85
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,299
When i get confirmed
i'm gonna be a man.

86
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,800
So how come
i can't drive?

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,302
You really want
to get into this?

88
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,804
Who was that man
that we had to pick up
at camp last year

89
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,306
for bed wetting?

90
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,807
That was the year
before last.

91
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,809
You could have
killed those girls.

92
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,811
That would've
been interesting.

93
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,812
What?

94
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,314
What did
you just say?

95
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,316
Death just shows the ultimate
absurdity of life.

96
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,817
What is this?

97
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,819
Are you trying to get me
to lose my temper?

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,322
'Cause i'm about to put yo
u through that goddamn window.

99
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,324
See?
That's what i mean.

100
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,825
Life is absurd.

101
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,327
Don't say that!

102
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,828
God forgive you!

103
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,830
There is no god.

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,831
Hey!
Hey!

105
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,833
Where is this
coming from?

106
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,835
They teach you this crap
at school?

107
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,338
Is this this new
english teacher, mr. Clark?

108
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,340
Where is
he from?

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,342
Answer me!

110
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,343
Oberlin.

111
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,845
Want him to read something
other than "hustler"?

112
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,848
Hello, he got assigned
"the stranger".

113
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,850
You want him to be
an educated person?

114
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,852
What do you think
education is? You
just make more money?

115
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,854
This is education.

116
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,857
Do you ever think, like,
why were we born?

117
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,359
Madame de stael said,

118
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,862
"in life one must choose
before boredom and suffering."

119
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:14,367
Go to your room.

120
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,369
No, i'm serious.

121
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,873
Why were we born?

122
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,876
We were born because of
adam and eve, that's why.

123
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,879
Now go upstairs
and do your math.

124
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,881
Algebra?
That's the most boring.

125
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,883
Your other choice
is suffering.

126
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,886
You want t
o start now?

127
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,888
Move your ass!

128
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,899
Jesus christ,
let me think.

129
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,902
You wake me up,
my head's all cobwebs.

130
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,406
Wyczchuk, wyczchuk...

131
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,907
waldemar wyczchuk.

132
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,410
You had lobster fra diavolo
with him in atlantic city

133
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,911
on the 14th
of this month.

134
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,913
He got blown up?

135
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:01,914
Fuck.

136
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,916
We're not necessarily trying
to pin this on soprano

137
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,418
or anybody
in your crew, sal.

138
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,420
We're drawing
no conclusions.

139
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,921
But what do you
got for me?

140
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,922
If i had
some coffee--

141
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,424
cut the the quips!

142
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,925
Tell me about
the merger talks.

143
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,427
What do you
want me to say?

144
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,929
Philadelphia's been putting
pressure on the shy business?

145
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,432
That's been going on since
moses wore short pants.

146
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,435
Tony's still resisting
the philly overtures?

147
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,946
Sometimes, puss',
you don't act like a guy

148
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,449
that's facing 30 to life
for selling h.

149
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,950
Don't get heavy
with me.

150
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,453
You come to my house
because somebody's
leaning on your ass?

151
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,455
8:00 in the morning
you come to my house?

152
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,457
You know what
this looks like?

153
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:50,963
I'm doing all i can
to help you guys.

154
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:54,467
One time tony bought
a pool table from wyczchuk.

155
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,474
So he's sitting there
and he asks me,

156
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,477
"if there's no god,
why was i born?"

157
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,479
He tells me
he's got no purpose.

158
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,481
How'd you
answer him?

159
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,983
I told him it cost
about 150 grand
to bring him up so far,

160
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,486
so if he's got no purpose
i want a fucking refund.

161
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,988
Are you angry with anthony jr.
About the car?

162
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,990
You can't put shit
back on the donkey.

163
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,492
Boys will be boys.

164
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,494
It's this other crap,
that's not normal.

165
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,997
Adolescent angst
is very normal.

166
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,999
You never
went through it?

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,002
You think my mother and father
are gonna stand for that shit?

168
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,005
How is
your mother?

169
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:39,011
She's dead to me.

170
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,014
And how's anthony jr.
Been taking it?

171
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,016
What?
About the family?

172
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,019
About your nonrelationship
with his grandmother.

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,522
How's he supposed to
understand that?

174
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,023
And in general,

175
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,026
the whole strain of
the current atmosphere
in your household?

176
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,529
But that don't give him
the right to mouth off.

177
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,031
Sounds to me like
anthony jr.

178
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,034
May have stumbled
onto existentialism.

179
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,536
Fucking internet.

180
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,038
No, it's
a european philosophy.

181
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,540
After world war ii,

182
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,542
people were
disillusioned

183
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,545
by the sheer weight
of the horrors.

184
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,047
That's when
the whole idea took root

185
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,050
that there were
no absolute truths.

186
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,552
You believe that?

187
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,053
In your family,

188
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,556
even motherhood
is up for debate.

189
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,057
No, it's not,

190
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,059
i teach him to
love and respect
and appreciate his mother.

191
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,564
What about
your mother?

192
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,567
Anthony, i think it's important
we talk about your mother

193
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,569
and what she tried
to do to you.

194
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,070
Don't need to.

195
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:45,077
She showed her true colors,
that's all.

196
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,080
Has anthony jr. Heard you say
"she's dead to me"?

197
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,582
I don't know.

198
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,584
Don't you think
that kind of talk

199
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,087
could lead a kid
to embrace these ideas?

200
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,089
Oh, so, now
this is my fault.

201
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,093
When some people first realize
that they're solely responsible

202
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,597
for their decisions,
actions, and beliefs,

203
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,600
and that death lies
at the end of every road,

204
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,103
they can be overcome
with intense dread.

205
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,105
"Intense dread."

206
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,107
A dull, aching anger

207
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,109
that leads them
to conclude

208
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,113
that the only
absolute truth is death.

209
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,121
I think the kid's
onto something.

210
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,629
It's puttin' me off,
way off.

211
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,631
Okay, ready?
Ready to go?

212
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,633
Okay, picture's up,
lock it up!

213
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,134
Ready to roll,
wait.

214
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,637
Standby to roll,
quiet please!

215
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,138
Roll sound!

216
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,640
Camera!

217
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,142
Smoke out,
camera's rolling!

218
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,144
And, action!

219
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,147
My leg,
i think it's broken.

220
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,649
Okay, cut!

221
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,150
Alright,
check the gate.

222
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,153
Michele,
can i talk to you?

223
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,155
C'mon.

224
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,157
Holy shit,
that's...

225
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,159
she was in
"kings of comedy".

226
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,161
And the other one, too,
i seen her.

227
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,664
That movie my girlfriend likes
with uma, what's her name?

228
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,668
Jon,
this is christopher.

229
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,169
Hey,
how's it going?

230
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,671
It's a real treat
to meet you.

231
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,672
"Swingers"
kicked ass.

232
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,173
Thanks,
thank you.

233
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,676
Thanks for coming out here,
i appreciate it, seriously.

234
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,680
What were you doing
before you started
writing for "los angeles"?

235
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,183
Jon, this is
christopher.

236
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,686
Oh, oh, i'm sorry,
i thought you--

237
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,689
there's a guy from
"los angeles" magazine
coming down here

238
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,692
to do a story on
my favorite place
for breakfast.

239
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,195
But you're the guy
from jersey, right?

240
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,697
Yeah.

241
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,698
Cool.

242
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,199
Very, very cool.

243
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,702
Michele foreman,
our director,

244
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,204
she's from jersey,
you see her first picture?

245
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,706
She's a director?

246
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,708
Beautiful film,

247
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,710
it won the audience award
at sundance.

248
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,711
Madonn'.

249
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,212
It was also
hilariously funny,

250
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,214
this lesbian- romantic
screwball comedy she did.

251
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,717
This one's much
more mainstream,
it's about spies.

252
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,219
So, anyway, we're getting ready
to shoot the last scene.

253
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,721
This is the one where

254
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,223
the two lesbians,
the lovers, they die.

255
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,225
Janeane,
her character's
zephyr--

256
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,727
that's her
fucking name.

257
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,228
Garofalo!
Janeane garofalo.

258
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:20,232
Yeah, so she's been
chasing gina, sandra,

259
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,233
all around
the country.

260
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,735
Gina?

261
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,737
Gina shecter from brooklyn,
that's the character.

262
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,238
So they end up
here in soho

263
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,240
where they just had a standoff,
they shot each other.

264
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,242
Picture's up,
let's lock it up!

265
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,744
Quiet please!

266
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,745
Excuse me.

267
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,246
And smoke!

268
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,748
Standby, to roll,
quiet please!

269
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,250
And roll sound!

270
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,753
The silencers underscore their
voiceless place in society.

271
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,757
We're rolling!

272
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,259
We're rolling!

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,762
Camera's rolling!

274
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,764
Spin the wheel!

275
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:57,770
And action!

276
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,772
I never had
an eggcream.

277
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,775
They're not coming
for either one of us.

278
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,277
You live your
whole life in a place

279
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,280
and never taste the thing
it's famous for.

280
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,783
Couldn't hear the fucking shots
with this thing.

281
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,285
There's a plac
e on st. Mark's--

282
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,787
it's over,
you bitch.

283
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,290
Don't do it.

284
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,291
Michele!

285
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,794
Cut, i'm sorry,
i'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

286
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,295
Can we cut
for a second?

287
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,798
Are we really
gonna say "bitch"?

288
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,299
You don't like
"bitch"?

289
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,301
We discussed this,
we're losing light.

290
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,803
It's not that
i don't like it.

291
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,805
It's just, it's the last thing
my lover says to me?

292
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,306
I don't find it
particularly interesting.

293
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,808
You're thinking you should
shoot her again?

294
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,309
No, wait a minute--

295
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,811
i don't think shooting's
right in this case.

296
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,813
Your character's strength
is her passivity.

297
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,814
Whose passivity?

298
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,815
Zephyr.

299
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,816
In this case.

300
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,817
In this case.

301
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,819
I think he's right,
janeane.

302
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,320
Obviously, throughout
the rest of the piece,

303
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,322
you got testes
to burn.

304
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,825
Is there anything
other than "bitch"?

305
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,327
Buchiach.

306
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,329
What?

307
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,834
Let that one call
that one "buchiach".

308
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,836
That sounds
more interesting.

309
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,840
Bu--
what?

310
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,341
Buchiach.

311
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,343
If she's
from brooklyn...

312
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,846
that sounds okay.

313
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,848
Okay,
let's roll.

314
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,349
What does
it mean?

315
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,350
Cunt.

316
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,853
Cunt,
i like that.

317
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,855
Okay, picture's up
, let's lock it up!

318
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,356
Standby to roll!

319
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,858
Roll sound!

320
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,860
Camera's rolling!

321
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,361
We are rolling!

322
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:36,368
Smoke!

323
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,369
We're rolling!

324
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,371
Smoke out!

325
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:47,880
And action!

326
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,382
What's going on
with you?

327
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,884
Nothing.

328
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,385
"Nothing."

329
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,387
You know,
that "no god" shit,

330
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,389
that upset your mother
very much.

331
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,392
It's not "no god",
it's just god is dead.

332
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,894
Who said that?

333
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,396
Nitch, he's a 19th century
philosopher from germany.

334
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,900
Anyway, that's why
i'm not getting confirmed.

335
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,901
Enough with that shit.

336
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,903
Your confirmation's
this weekend

337
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,404
and you are
getting confirmed.

338
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,906
That sucks my nut.

339
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,907
Hey!

340
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,909
You got a lot of balls,
you know that?

341
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,411
You go to catholic school
and your mother wants it.

342
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,913
What does she know?

343
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,414
She knows that
even if god is dead,

344
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,417
you're still gonna
kiss his ass.

345
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:30,923
Hey!

346
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,424
Hey, joe.

347
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,926
Hey, chris,
how's it going?

348
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,927
Coke and a slice.

349
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,929
It's the best pie
in north jersey.

350
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,431
What do you guys want?
Anything, it's taken care of.

351
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,933
Same thing,
coke and a slice.

352
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,434
Coke and
a slice.

353
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,936
You got it.

354
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,437
That laundromat
across the street,

355
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,940
that's where joe's
restaurant used to be.

356
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,942
Willie moretti,
that's where he bought it.

357
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,445
Moretti was sinatra's
guardian angel, right?

358
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,948
Stuck his gun
in tommy dorsey's mouth

359
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,951
and bought sinatra's contract
from him for a dollar.

360
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,452
Fuck,
that's so cool.

361
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,954
That's like the inspiration
for johnny fontaine

362
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,455
and the studio bos
s in gf one, right?

363
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,957
Right.

364
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,459
That's the one beef
i had with "swingers".

365
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,962
You guys patterned yourselves
after frank and dean,

366
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:15,968
but there was like
a pussy- assness to it.

367
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,471
I mean, it was kind of
the point of the piece--

368
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,474
so, you brought us
your script.

369
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,475
Yeah, but--

370
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,977
c'mon,
let's see it.

371
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,478
No, you're
jon favreau.

372
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,981
Rocky marciano,
"deep impact",
"swingers".

373
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,482
Here's the thing.

374
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,984
Your script
is set in the world

375
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,486
that i'm interested in
doing my next project on.

376
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,488
A picture on the life
of crazy joe gallo.

377
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,990
Joe gallo?

378
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,492
They already did "the gang that
couldn't shoot straight".

379
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,494
Yeah, but i see gallo
as this tragic figure.

380
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,996
He was a flawed
and blinkered guy,

381
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,498
but he wanted
to learn, to grow,

382
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,500
to read, to paint.

383
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,503
He had this yearning,
this hunger for--

384
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,506
fuck your mother,
what's the word?

385
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,510
You as joey gallo,
i don't see that.

386
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,512
I'm part italian.

387
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,516
Vince, maybe,
vaughn.

388
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,020
This project happens to be
a personal passion of mine.

389
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,521
I could play
joey gallo

390
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,024
but i don't want to be an actor
unless i can play myself.

391
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,526
Which is totally
understandable.

392
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,028
Listen, ever since amy
told me about you,

393
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,529
i thought maybe
we could work together.

394
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,531
You could tell me
the way shit goes down,

395
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,533
what makes sense,
what people really say,

396
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,535
you know
what i mean?

397
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,038
Joey gallo, i was
like three years old
when he got whacked.

398
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,539
Yeah, but
speech patterns.

399
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,041
You saw "swingers".

400
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,542
Whatever you think
of that motherfucker, man,

401
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,045
it's, like, you can tell
it's extremely important to me

402
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,047
how people
really talk.

403
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,548
Like that
"buchiach" thing.

404
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,050
How could i forget
that fucking thing?

405
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,052
I mean, i grew up
right in queens.

406
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,554
I guess it is
a long time ago.

407
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:47,059
You wouldn't be betraying
any oath thing.

408
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,562
Holy fucking shit,
that thing is still alive?

409
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:55,067
If i told you 15 years ago
that she was a piece of ass,

410
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,069
would you
believe me?

411
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:57,569
What?

412
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,071
What happened?

413
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,572
Forget it.

414
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,575
C'mon, man,
we're just talking.

415
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:07,079
Wise- guy friend of mine would
kill me if he knew i told you.

416
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,086
This made guy, right?

417
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,588
Had the most discriminating eye
when it comes to t&a.

418
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,092
He's at a club one night,
this broad's all over him.

419
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,094
And she's got
a really nice body,

420
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,595
she's horny as hell.

421
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,099
They step outside,
they walk over to this
picnic ground.

422
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,601
She starts blowing him
next to this swing set.

423
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,604
He's about
to shoot his load,

424
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,606
he reaches down
to start fingering,

425
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,109
undoes the skirt,
reaches in,

426
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,611
grabs hold
of a goddamn prick.

427
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,612
Jesus christ.

428
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,114
"Crying game."

429
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,117
This is
a true story.

430
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,619
So my friend can't
let this story get out.

431
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,622
He wants to humiliate the freak
as much as he was humiliated.

432
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,126
So he gets this fucking acid,
you know, burns everything.

433
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,629
He pours it on her arms,
on her face, everywhere,

434
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,632
her prick.

435
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,634
That's one
bad motherfucker.

436
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,636
That's how good looking
this broad used to look,

437
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,639
had this wise- guy friend
of mine totally fooled.

438
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,141
She had to get
a glass eye.

439
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,656
Hey, look
who's here.

440
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,159
You can't say hello
to your uncle?

441
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,660
Hey, uncle pussy.

442
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,663
Look what my little friend
did to carmela's car.

443
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,165
What were
you thinking?

444
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,168
You got to learn to respect
the value of things.

445
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,169
This is
your own property.

446
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:43,175
Here,
go get a soda.

447
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,677
The longest fuckin
g car ride of my life.

448
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,179
What's the matter?

449
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,681
It's the kid,
he used to be happy- go- lucky.

450
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,183
Now he's moody,
he questions the universe.

451
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,684
Like father,
like son.

452
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,686
Fuck you,
i'm serious.

453
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,688
You're his
confirmation sponsor.

454
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,690
Do something
with him.

455
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,192
Alright, alright.

456
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,693
But 13, 14,
they start getting broody.

457
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,196
It's getting so i don't
want to be with him.

458
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,198
If you gotta use a belt,
go ahead.

459
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,699
He's bombing out
in school.

460
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,202
He got a "c",
three "ds" and an "f".

461
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,204
Look at this kid.

462
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,206
How you making out
in school?

463
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,708
I got a "c",
three "ds" and an "f".

464
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,731
Hey.

465
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,733
Where you been?

466
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,735
I was hanging out
with jon.

467
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:44,736
Izzacupo?

468
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,239
Favreau.

469
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,242
You were?

470
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,244
You went
to the set?

471
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,745
Yeah.

472
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,247
Why didn't
you call?

473
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,249
We were only there
for like half an hour,

474
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,750
then him and amy
wanted me to give them

475
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,253
kind of like
a tour around jersey.

476
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:06,758
They did?

477
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,260
What?

478
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,763
Vince vaughn didn't
come down there.

479
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,272
Elbow up, matt,
keep it straight.

480
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,274
Coach is having
me pull more.

481
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,775
Fuck him.

482
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,777
My son don't hit
sacrifice flies.

483
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,279
You're up next.

484
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,781
Nah, i just want
to want watch.

485
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,284
You got to snap
out of this, anthony.

486
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,286
C'mon, a. J. ,
it's fun.

487
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,288
I know, i just
don't feel like it.

488
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,791
Sometimes you got to do things
you don't want to.

489
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,293
Why?

490
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,295
'Cause your parents
say so.

491
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,796
It's part
of your tradition.

492
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,798
Baseball's not
part of my tradition.

493
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,300
It ain't?

494
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,801
Your dad,
in high school,

495
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,303
was almost all- county
left field.

496
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,306
I'm not talking about that,
i'm talking about
your confirmation here.

497
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,807
I don't want
to get confirmed.

498
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,309
Why not?

499
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,810
Don't matter
why not.

500
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,312
If you're looking
for a purpose in life,

501
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,314
doing what's right
is your purpose.

502
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,815
That's not what
nitch says.

503
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:04,816
Who?

504
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:05,817
Nietzsche.

505
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,319
Let me tell you
something.

506
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,822
Nietzsche wound up
talking to his horse.

507
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,324
And i know what
you're gonna tell me.

508
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,326
Sartre, right?

509
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,828
Sartre was
a fucking fraud.

510
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,331
He copped it all
from husserl and heidegger.

511
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:24,336
Go on.

512
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,838
You should start
at the beginning.

513
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,841
Take a look
at kierkegaard.

514
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,343
Whatever.

515
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:36,348
Kierkegaard said,"every duty
is essentially duty to god."

516
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,850
"Nigga be a leader,
not a follower."

517
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,851
What?

518
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,353
Master p said that.

519
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,355
You still
listen to rap?

520
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,356
Why?

521
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,359
It's just all about
marketing now.

522
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,875
Hi, welcome to
soho grand.

523
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,877
I'm here to see
jon favreau.

524
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,879
One moment, please.

525
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,382
Whom may i say
is calling?

526
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,884
Jerry from newark,
he's expecting me.

527
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,888
I'm sorry, sir, mr. Favreau
requested not to be disturbed.

528
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,890
Tell him his 2:00 pm
is waiting.

529
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,894
He has his telephone programmed
so as to not be disturbed.

530
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,896
It's 2:00 in
the fucking afternoon.

531
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:29,401
Would you care
to leave a message?

532
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,405
Would you you see if
amy safir is in?

533
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,407
Hey.

534
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,409
What you
doing here?

535
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,411
I was supposed to be meeting
jon to discuss my script

536
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,413
but now he's got
the "do not disturb" on.

537
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,416
Yeah, shooting ran late,
we didn't wrap till 5:30.

538
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,420
C'mon in.

539
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,423
I brought him jersey's
best sangweech,

540
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,924
fucking best
in the world.

541
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,426
That was very nice.

542
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,927
You want it?

543
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,429
Oh, no thanks,
i brushed my teeth.

544
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,931
Here,
have a seat.

545
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,433
You want
some coffee?

546
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,436
No, i can't stay,
i got business to take care of.

547
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,444
If they ever knew
i was into this.

548
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,946
What i'm saying is...

549
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,449
this kind of thing
is unacceptable
where i come from.

550
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,952
Do you know if he read
my script yet?

551
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,953
I have your script.

552
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,455
What?

553
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,956
Jon asked me to give it
an official read.

554
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,460
Don't take it personally,
it's his process.

555
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,962
Billy bob wrote something
he wanted to do with jon

556
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,464
and jon had me
read it first.

557
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,466
Hello.

558
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,968
Hey, honey,
your cousin's here.

559
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,971
Yeah, that's right,
the screenwriter.

560
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,973
Okay, i will.

561
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,975
Gregory says,
"go fuck yourself".

562
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,978
Union square cafe?
Okay.

563
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,981
Alright, i'll
see you there, bye.

564
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,485
What did you
think about it?

565
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,986
About what?

566
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,488
My script.

567
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,990
I love movies,
i started with the dialogue,

568
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,492
but then you gotta
find the conflict

569
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,994
and tell the story
in picture arcs.

570
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,998
I think it's--
it's got some real heart.

571
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,000
Some good
raw emotion in it.

572
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,502
You should probably
try and finish it.

573
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,004
Yeah, i hit
a fucking wall.

574
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,506
Third act shit.

575
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,509
Vicki king, in "21 days
to how to write a movie in",

576
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,511
she says that's
not uncommon.

577
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,514
These aren't third
act problems, they're
in the second act.

578
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,516
Get the fuck
out of here.

579
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:30,021
See, you ended right here
in the middle of page 83.

580
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,525
Yeah, this sentence
could've gone either way.

581
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,528
See...
when frankie says,

582
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,530
"i don't know whether
to shit or go blind",

583
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,533
he's at a crossroads,
he doesn't know.

584
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,535
That's an
expression, right?

585
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,037
Like a joke,
"shit or go blind".

586
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,540
Well, no,
'cause later on

587
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,041
his father gets
that cancer of the eye.

588
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,043
What do they call that,
glaucoma?

589
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,545
Whatever the fuck,
runs in the family.

590
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:55,547
They have to get him
a guide dog.

591
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,549
Oh.

592
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:02,053
But the third act
starts at page 90.

593
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,556
I'm not in the third
fucking act yet.

594
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,058
You're inciting incident
doesn't happen till page 12,

595
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,060
it should be
on page three.

596
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,062
I knew that arc shit
fucked me up.

597
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,065
I tried making it
all these three dimensions
like she said.

598
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:20,071
Here, sit,
i'll show you.

599
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,072
Okay.

600
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,575
See,
i was thinking...

601
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,077
if you take the scene
where rocco

602
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,079
is fucking the two
asian strippers.

603
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,581
That's a plot point.

604
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,082
I know, i know.

605
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,584
But my question is,
what's at stake?

606
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,586
The jeopardy's
unclear.

607
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,587
What jeopardy?

608
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,590
There's a seven part
hierarchy of human needs

609
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,594
that explains and
clarifies what drives us.

610
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:47,098
Starting with
the basic needs
like food

611
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,600
and water.

612
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,102
So you like
my script?

613
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,605
It's very good,
christopher.

614
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:58,109
You want me to tell you
what all seven are?

615
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,611
Seven what?

616
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,613
The human needs.

617
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,114
Yeah.

618
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,116
Survival.

619
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:05,617
Yeah.

620
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,119
Safety and security.

621
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,621
Yeah.

622
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,125
The need
to understand.

623
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:19,190
Hi grandma.

624
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,191
Grandma?

625
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,192
Who is it?

626
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,694
You woke me.

627
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,196
It's me,
anthony jr.

628
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:29,200
I didn't know
i had a grandson.

629
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,202
I miss you.

630
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,204
Yeah,
you should.

631
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,206
You never
come see me.

632
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,708
I've been busy.

633
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,209
Everybody's busy.

634
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,211
And don't lie to me.

635
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,214
I know your father forbids
your coming down here.

636
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,216
He doesn't,
honest.

637
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,719
He just doesn't want us to
talk about you in the house.

638
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,222
You can go
shit in his hat.

639
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,726
He's mad at me
right now.

640
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,228
I shouldn't use
that kind of talk.

641
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,732
Don't let me ever catch you
talking that way.

642
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,735
Now what did
you do bad?

643
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,738
My dad doesn't
like my attitude.

644
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,740
So uncle pussy said that
i should come talk to you

645
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,244
because you're old and
have wisdom and stuff.

646
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,747
His mother's
another one.

647
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,749
Well, what'd
you do?

648
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,252
I took mom's car out of
the garage and it got wrecked.

649
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,254
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

650
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,757
Was it bad?

651
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,759
Uncle pussy
already fixed it.

652
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,260
Did you wear
your safety belt?

653
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,762
Yeah.

654
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,264
Because there was an article
in the paper the other day

655
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,266
about a bunch
of teen- agers

656
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,268
from out near
the delaware water gap.

657
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,772
They overcrowded their car,
it hit a tree,

658
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,774
and it incinerated.

659
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,776
And they got trapped.

660
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,279
People could
hear'em screaming,
they couldn't get out.

661
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,283
The safety belts did it,
buckled them in.

662
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,785
See, that'
s what i mean.

663
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,286
What's the purpose?

664
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,788
Of what?

665
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,791
Being...
here on our planet.

666
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,293
Earth.

667
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,295
Those kids
are dead meat.

668
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,797
What's the use?

669
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,298
What's the purpose?

670
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,301
Why does everything
have to have a purpose?

671
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,803
The world is a jungle.

672
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,305
If you want my advice,
anthony,

673
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,309
don't expect happiness,
you won't get it,

674
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,311
people let you down.

675
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,313
And i'm not
naming any names,

676
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:30,822
but in the end,
you die in your own arms.

677
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,325
You mean alone?

678
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,327
It's all
a big nothing.

679
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,330
What what makes you think
you're so special?

680
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:52,844
Guess i won't order us
any espresso.

681
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,846
I took an
acting class once.

682
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,848
Oh, yeah?
How'd that go for you?

683
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,850
But i didn't
need it.

684
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,851
Oh, yeah.

685
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,853
I figured out
as far as movies go,

686
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,855
i want to be a player,
not an actor.

687
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,356
Smart man,
like bugsy.

688
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,859
That was another thing
that kind of blew
about "swingers".

689
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,360
The acting?

690
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,362
You know what's
good fucking acting?

691
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,364
Hanks,
"private ryan".

692
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,366
"Earn it."

693
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,868
It's kind of unfai
r to compare the two.

694
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,871
One's about young soldiers
dying on the beach
at normandy,

695
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,874
the other one's about
young guy's lookin' for
blow jobs in vegas.

696
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,377
Well, you made
the movie.

697
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,379
So...

698
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,882
listen...

699
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:36,888
you mind if
i ask you something?

700
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:42,894
You strapped
right now?

701
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,396
Strapped, huh?

702
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,399
Yeah.

703
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:48,900
Fuck.

704
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,402
Jesus fucking christ!

705
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,904
Watch out, man.

706
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,906
Holy fuck.

707
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,910
Can i ask you
something else?

708
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,411
That's what
i'm here for, jon.

709
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,914
It will not leave this room,
i swear to you.

710
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,916
Have you ever-- ?

711
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,918
Have i ever what?

712
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,419
C'mon, you know.

713
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,921
No, what?

714
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,423
I'm not gonna answer
unless you ask.

715
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,927
That's cool, man,
i'm sorry.

716
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,929
No, c'mon,
you can ask me.

717
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,930
No, it's cool.

718
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,431
Oh, c'mon.

719
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,433
C'mon, rocky,
c'mon, rocky!

720
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,935
C'mon, ask me.

721
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,436
Did i what,
did i what?

722
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,438
Have i
ever what?

723
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,440
It's cool,
just take it back.

724
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,442
What, this?

725
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,944
I think
the safety's on.

726
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,447
Here we go,
you're money.

727
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,950
Did i ever what,
did i ever what?

728
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,455
What?

729
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,457
That's not cool, man.

730
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,959
I got dialogue
tomorrow.

731
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,963
If my voice gets scratchy,
it's not cool.

732
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:58,469
What'd you think
of my script?

733
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:58,970
Well...

734
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,972
you know,
like, frankie?

735
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,975
I know frankie,
he's my fucking
leading man.

736
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,977
He's...

737
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:12,984
he's kind of like
a contradictory character.

738
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:19,490
In a good way,
you know, like complex.

739
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,493
You think he should wear
those taps on his shoes?

740
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,495
That's the questio
n i was gonna ask you.

741
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,998
They sound cool,
they're his trademark.

742
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,499
But in the hit
against rocco,

743
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,501
somebody's gonna hear him
walking on the roof.

744
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,003
That's a problem.

745
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,504
What i was
thinking was,

746
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:37,508
in this script,
in all scripts, really,

747
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:42,013
it begs to show more
of the author in it.

748
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,515
Your life,
your vision.

749
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:51,022
The roof
is soft tar!

750
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,023
That'll work.

751
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,025
The roof
is soft tar!

752
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,026
Okay.

753
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,538
And the father could,
you know,

754
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,541
go blind sooner
and then...

755
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,544
then he could smell the tar
on frankie's shoes,

756
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,547
then he knows that
his son's the killer.

757
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,050
Holy fuck,
that's fucking great!

758
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,553
Then frankie's gotta put one
in his old man's head!

759
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:26,057
Blam,
then another one,
blam!

760
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:27,558
Fucking brilliant.

761
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,569
I spent all day with
my best friend anna

762
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,072
picking out her
bridesmaids' dresses.

763
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,574
I still haven't
found anything for
anthony's confirmation.

764
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,576
With all the flowers
coming into bloom,

765
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,578
i would love
to be a june bride.

766
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:52,083
Here's your
june groom.

767
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,585
C'mon.

768
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,587
Sorry i'm late.

769
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,589
Babe, i ordered you some
pasta fajioli to start.

770
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,092
And we're gonna get a plate
of antipast to share.

771
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,595
They got some
rare imported salami.

772
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,597
You feel okay,
christopher?

773
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,599
I'm fine.

774
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,102
We were just discussing
anna's wedding.

775
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,104
What about
you guys?

776
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,105
What about
who guys?

777
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,606
You should make it
a double wedding.

778
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,109
First someone
has to propose.

779
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,119
Has anna chosen
her caterer yet?

780
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,620
She booked
villa de roma.

781
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,123
'Cause if you ask me,
caravaggio's is slipping.

782
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,624
I heard they fired
their produce guy.

783
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,126
Enough!

784
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,127
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing you people

785
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,628
talk about
food, food, food!

786
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,630
That's all anybody
ever talks about

787
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,133
is proscuitto, cheese,
and fucking fava beans.

788
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,134
I'm drowning here.

789
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,635
Take it easy!

790
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,137
We're not even
engaged yet!

791
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,638
When you're married

792
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,140
you'll understand
the importance
of fresh produce.

793
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,641
Fuck the importance!

794
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,642
Oh!

795
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,656
He didn't
mean that.

796
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,158
Fuck him.

797
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,659
I tried so hard
to be supportive

798
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:14,165
with his art and
getting his screenplay made.

799
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:20,171
His screenplay?

800
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,173
Any updates
on wyczchuk?

801
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,176
I'm working on it,
i got my ear to the dirt.

802
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,677
We're wiring you
for the confirmation.

803
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,179
You fucking prick.

804
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,181
You think i'm wearing a wire
in god's house?

805
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,182
Actually, yes.

806
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,683
We don't care so much
about the service

807
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,685
as the party right after
at tony's house.

808
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,687
You miserable motherfuck,
i'm the kid's sponsor!

809
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,190
Who the fuck i
s sponsoring you
, motherfucker?

810
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,204
Excuse me, sir,
i don't want to
have to tell you again

811
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,706
this is
a smoke- free
environment.

812
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,218
Yo, amy.

813
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,220
Hey, you.

814
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,722
What a nice
surprise.

815
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,224
I was in
the neighborhood.

816
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,726
Where were you?

817
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,229
I was at the big
chloe party.

818
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,232
I sat across
from alphonse d'amato.

819
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:27,238
God, these things
are killing me.

820
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,740
I was thinking we could
stop down at umberto's.

821
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,743
Excellent, i'll just
change real quick.

822
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,757
I like those.

823
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:51,762
Manolo blahnik.

824
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,764
Let me see.

825
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,766
What, these?

826
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,268
Come here.

827
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,270
You want
to see these?

828
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,771
Yeah.

829
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,775
You want to
see my shoes?

830
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,278
You can look,
but you can't touch.

831
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,779
I can't touch?

832
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,795
So, what'd your
father do?

833
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,798
Was he
a movie producer?

834
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,801
He's a neurosurgeon
at cedars- sinai.

835
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,803
What is this,
question and answer hour?

836
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,805
I want to
know about you.

837
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,807
I'm not usually
an open person.

838
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,809
How come your old man
didn't pressure you

839
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,811
to become
a doctor like him?

840
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,814
I was premed at yale
my freshman year.

841
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:44,815
Fuckin' yale,
i swear to god,

842
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,318
you jews have your own
cosa nostra

843
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,821
hidden in that
ivy fucking league.

844
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,823
That's very funny.

845
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,825
Very imagistic.

846
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,327
Thank you.

847
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,329
So...

848
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,333
that blond guy in the club
the other night,

849
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,834
what'd you
say to him?

850
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,336
That's for me
to know.

851
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,838
You make him an offer
he couldn't refuse?

852
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,839
What'd you say?

853
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,840
Nothing.

854
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,342
C'mon!

855
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,843
I told him,
"be a good boy

856
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:18,849
and i'll let this girl
blow you afterwards."

857
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,852
You ever been with a member
of the tribe before?

858
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:22,853
Yeah.

859
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:23,854
Really?

860
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,356
What do you think,
i discriminate?

861
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,857
I'm p. C.

862
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,359
No, you haven't.

863
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,362
So why you gotta ask
if you think you know it all?

864
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,363
When?

865
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,864
I don't
fucking tell.

866
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,366
When?

867
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:42,373
Two nights ago.

868
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,877
You ever shag another
skinny- ginny?

869
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:52,383
Oh, fuck, fuck me!
My cousin.

870
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,385
How are we
gonna tell him?

871
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,886
Amy, don't
do this now.

872
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,889
We'll figure
something out, c'mon.

873
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,391
I'm not
a terrible person.

874
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,893
Amy, get
back here.

875
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,930
Shit.

876
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,432
Amy...

877
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,933
amy, listen.

878
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,436
"Long shot,
a nightclub.

879
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,937
"Not just any nightclub.

880
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:51,442
Cut to closeup on letter "c",
then an "o", then a "p"."

881
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,444
You're not supposed
to be reading that.

882
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:56,947
It's a limited distribution,
numbered draft.

883
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,950
"Pull back to reveal
this is the copacabana.

884
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,952
"Inside it's
all fun and games

885
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,955
as mobsters wine and dine
their beautiful goomahs."

886
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,958
Jesus,
you can see it.

887
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,960
You can see the movie
from the words.

888
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,463
This is the way
you write a fucking script.

889
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,971
Fucking shit!

890
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,473
Hey!

891
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,975
Hey, come out
of there!

892
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,977
He used it.

893
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,480
What, just'cause he gave me
that tar- smell idea?

894
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,981
I could've
come up with that.

895
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:31,982
What?

896
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,984
The friend of mine,
stone wiseguy,

897
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,986
jon used his
whole fucking story.

898
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,988
The she- male and acid,
it's all here.

899
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,990
This is joey cippolina's
fucking story!

900
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,992
There's no character
named cippolini.

901
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,994
Forget it,
he can't put that in there!

902
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,996
It's not
the same at all.

903
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,498
What the fuck
you talking about?

904
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,500
You said your wiseguy friend
was at a swing set.

905
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,502
This guy gets
his dick sucked at
the statue of liberty.

906
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,003
Don't you understand
where i come from?

907
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,005
I explained it
how many times?

908
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,007
Where are
you going?

909
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,510
We can't
take it out now.

910
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,012
We faxed it to oliver,
who's agreed to be attached.

911
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,514
It's his
favorite thing.

912
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,016
Don't, don't, don't,
he's sleeping.

913
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,018
How mad could
your friend get?

914
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,020
12- 04 checked out.

915
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,022
Where is he?

916
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:15,025
This is so absurd of you
to get so bent out of shape.

917
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,034
Can i see your
production pass?

918
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,536
I've been on
the set before.

919
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,037
I still need
to see your pass.

920
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,038
I know jon.

921
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,540
Look, sir,
this is a closed set.

922
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,043
No visitors, no press,
no friends of jon.

923
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,044
Hey!

924
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:35,546
Hey, buchiachia!

925
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,547
Hi.

926
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,548
Where's jon?

927
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,049
He left this morning
for l. A.

928
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,552
That fucking cocksucking
mezzofinook!

929
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,053
What does
that mean?

930
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:49,059
You got more stuff
like that i could use?

931
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,562
The confirmation
starts in an hour.

932
00:43:51,562 --> 00:44:00,070
Would you let me in, already?
I need to put my face on.

933
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,072
You've been in there
all week.

934
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,575
I'm shaving!

935
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,078
I don't want you
coming in here
while i'm in here!

936
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:12,583
The only goddamn mirror with
any good light is in there!

937
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,085
Here's your
fucking mirror.

938
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,587
Jesus!

939
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,111
Don't open
that fucking door!

940
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,112
Shit.

941
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,621
Fuck!

942
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,122
You fucking bitch!

943
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,125
I'll kill you,
i'll kill you!

944
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,627
Dad!

945
00:44:56,627 --> 00:45:02,633
Jesus christ,
what the fuck's with you?

946
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,134
What are you,
bleeding?

947
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:19,149
Mr. Decamillo will
be with you shortly.

948
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,651
May i get you
a water?

949
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,152
No, thank you.

950
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,154
Wow, robert rodriguez
has signed on

951
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:28,659
to do a remake
of "viva, zapata"
with harvey and bob.

952
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,660
What is this shit?

953
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,662
You don't return
my fucking messages?

954
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,163
Christopher,
this is so not cool.

955
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,665
You listen to me,
you stupid bitch!

956
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,166
You cannot
use that story.

957
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,668
Okay,
alright.

958
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,169
This is neither the time
nor the place.

959
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:41,171
You want to
see me clipped?

960
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,173
Have you
touched base with jon?

961
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:44,675
What the fuck?

962
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,177
I call, i spoke to
his jerk- off assistants,

963
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,179
she said i should
take it up with you.

964
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,681
I'm sorry i don't even know
who that would be,

965
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,182
that assistant.

966
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,184
Sir, are you here to see
david decamillo?

967
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,186
Get the fuck
out of here!

968
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,688
Look, i'm flying
into l. A. This afternoon,

969
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,689
we'll touch base.

970
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,692
You were
just gonna leave?

971
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,194
What are you
talking about?

972
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,196
My script.

973
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:10,200
Christopher, based on
"mickey blue eyes"
first- weekend foreign,

974
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,203
there's a wait- and- see attitude
toward mafi- related projects.

975
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,205
So we're gonna
have to pass.

976
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,707
Did jon say that?
Are those his words?

977
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,709
I speak for jon,
and if you'd let me finish,

978
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,711
we want to assure you
that we'll certainly

979
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,212
take a look at
anything else you write.

980
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,714
You're good.

981
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:24,715
Christopher--

982
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,717
fuckin' walnuts
don't lie as good as you.

983
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,218
Amy.

984
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,220
David's ready
to see you.

985
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,221
Right this way.

986
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:36,727
Chris, it was
wrong with us and...

987
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:41,732
and greg
and all that.

988
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,734
I really
liked you.

989
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,743
This is getting kind of
"william inge" here,
isn't it?

990
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,244
I gotta go.

991
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,747
Fucking d- girl!

992
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,749
Excuse me?

993
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,251
Excuse me,
i'm a vice president!

994
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,754
You fucking
asshole!

995
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,761
Tony!

996
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,262
Hey!

997
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,764
There they are.

998
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,766
Ton',
congratulations.

999
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,267
Thanks, thanks.

1000
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,269
Kid did real good up
at the alter, didn't he?

1001
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,771
Sabenedic'.

1002
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,774
Were you
proud of him?

1003
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,775
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,776
Where's carm?

1005
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,277
In the kitchen.

1006
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,278
Ange.

1007
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,280
Some place you got
here, ton'.

1008
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,282
Hey, richie,
have a drink.

1009
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,285
Fucking resort
s international.

1010
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,287
Hey,
little brother.

1011
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,289
The bars down
the hall, richie.

1012
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,791
Over there.

1013
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:45,796
Oh, and we count
the silverware.

1014
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,798
Hi, i'm
janice soprano.

1015
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,299
Janice now?

1016
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,301
I don't know.

1017
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:54,304
I heard we won't be
bothered anymore
from our neighbor wyczchuk.

1018
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,306
No neighbor
of mine.

1019
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,308
What'd you
hear on that?

1020
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,310
Tony, we're out of
ice in here.

1021
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,812
Alright.

1022
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,335
Oh, shit.

1023
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:30,340
You two,
get out of here.

1024
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,843
Tony, we also
need more cokes--

1025
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:36,346
what is
that smell?

1026
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,848
What kind of animal

1027
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,850
smokes marijuana
at his own confirmation?

1028
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,852
I don't know.

1029
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,354
Enough with th
e "i don't knows".

1030
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,355
What are you
yelling at me for?

1031
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,357
Even grandma says
the world has no purpose.

1032
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,359
Get inside right now
and join your guests.

1033
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,862
Be a good catholic
for 15 fucking minutes!

1034
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,864
Is that
so much to ask?

1035
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,882
What happened,
what's the matter?

1036
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,383
You don't
want to know.

1037
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,386
Fucking kid's down in
the garage getting high.

1038
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,388
Alright,
let me talk to him.

1039
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,400
Anthony?

1040
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,902
Would you
go away?

1041
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,404
No, i'm
your sponsor.

1042
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,908
We need to talk,
you need to listen.

1043
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,417
You know,
you see your parents

1044
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,420
as these great big dictators,
these disciplinarians.

1045
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,923
But i know your dad
from the time
he was younger than you.

1046
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,926
What difference
does it make?

1047
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:59,429
Listen to me, alright?
You listening?

1048
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,931
Yeah.

1049
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:04,935
I know him.

1050
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,938
I was 16 years old,
and my kid sister nucci,

1051
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,440
she had
the spinal meningitis,

1052
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:17,447
and she got a to a point
where she couldn't breathe.

1053
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,448
She was
real sick?

1054
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,950
Yeah.

1055
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,952
And she was
in the hospital.

1056
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,954
And your father,
he was the only one,

1057
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,956
he came with me
every day.

1058
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,959
He sat by her bed,
he looked at her drawings.

1059
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,962
He watched her for me
when i had to use the john

1060
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:35,966
or get something
to eat.

1061
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,968
I was down there waiting
in line for a hamburger

1062
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,469
when she passed away.

1063
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,472
She died?

1064
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,475
Yeah.

1065
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,478
You know what pisses
me off about my dad?

1066
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,480
He did all these
great things, then,

1067
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,483
before
he was my dad.

1068
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,987
Now he's just
an asshole.

1069
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,490
Hey, hey, hey,
listen to me.

1070
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,993
Your father would
catch a bullet for you.

1071
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,995
Don't you ever
forget that.

1072
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,497
He's a stand- up guy.

1073
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,499
I don't know.

1074
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,001
Not to me
he's not.

1075
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,502
Well, i do know.

1076
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,504
And i know what kind
of man he is.

1077
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:21,511
Don't ever forget it.

1078
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,514
Uncle pussy,
what's the matter?

1079
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,516
Nothing.

1080
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,528
Now go down and enjoy
your party.

1081
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,030
Make your
parents happy.

1082
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,531
You got your health,
your family.

1083
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,533
Enjoy it
while you can,

1084
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,536
while you got it
all in your hand.

1085
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,537
Come here.

1086
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,539
Give uncle pussy
a hug.

1087
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,042
And get
out of here.

1088
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,554
Hey.

1089
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:10,560
Hey, he's
down there.

1090
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,062
Where the fuck
you been?

1091
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,064
This is
for a. J.

1092
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,567
I got one son and you miss
his confirmation ceremony?

1093
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,569
I figured
with all my sins

1094
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:24,074
i don't want the church
caving in on everyone.

1095
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:29,079
Hey!

1096
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,081
On the fucking
rag again.

1097
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,582
No, i'm
on the rag.

1098
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,084
She's just wondering
who the fuck you are.

1099
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,586
No lectures, alright?
I'm not in the mood.

1100
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,088
I agree.

1101
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,091
I'm gonna go back in there
and be with my guests.

1102
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,093
Exactly ten minutes,
i'm gonna look up,

1103
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,095
if you're not here
i'm gonna assume

1104
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,097
that you went to look for
whatever the fuck it is

1105
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,598
that's calling you
out there.

1106
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,600
And that i will
never see you again.

1107
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:55,105
If you are still here,
then i'm gonna assume

1108
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,108
that you have no other
desire in the world
than to be with me.

1109
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,111
And your actions will
show me that every second
of every fucking day.

1110
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:05,115
You understand me?

1111
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,116
Don't answer me.

1112
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:14,124
Take the ten minutes,
you think about it.

1113
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,126
Hey you,
come here.

1114
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,629
C'mon, let's take
the picture.

1115
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:10,180
C'mon, let's
get the picture.

1116
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,682
A. J. , c'mon.

1117
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,184
Wait,
where's pussy?

1118
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:19,189
Where's
the godfather?
