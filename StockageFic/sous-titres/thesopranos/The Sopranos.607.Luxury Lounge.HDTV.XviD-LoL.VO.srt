1
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,468
you guys speak english?

2
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,934
not some too much.

3
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,101
i just wanna say

4
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,533
it's been a while
since we opened the books

5
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,368
and in regards
to you guys--

6
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,967
burt, gerry--

7
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,967
as a man
of few words, i--

8
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:02,201
not few enough, though, huh? new blood.

9
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,834
- new blood.
- salud.

10
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,167
sure, we break
some balls here tonight,

11
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,900
<i>but i go way back.</i>

12
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,934
and in light
of recent humiliations,

13
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:18,800
<i>it's a honor
to be joined by men</i>

14
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,800
and nofaggot-ass
corn-holing cocksuckers

15
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,500
like married my cousin.

16
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,267
- he should fuckin' die!
- phil, relax.

17
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:28,434
- whoa whoa whoa, phil.
- take it easy.

18
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,633
phil, you know the wine
makes you emotional.

19
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,500
'cause i got
an empty fuckin' stomach.

20
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,468
- so have a breadstick.
- 45 minutes for some grilled eggplant?

21
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,967
jesus christ, is there nothing
without this complaining?

22
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:43,034
you didn't notice? artie's
game is a little off lately.

23
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,401
<i>well, carmela sent her
branzino back sunday night,</i>

24
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:47,368
but she loves
to do that.

25
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,034
gentlemen, how's everything so far?

26
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:50,800
- fantastic.
- delicious.

27
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,468
the delay--
a thousand pardons.

28
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,301
<i>i'm breaking in
a new guy on the line.</i>

29
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,800
you seem set
for antipasto.

30
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:58,867
i gotta be honest-- new guy
in the kitchen aside,

31
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,167
i mean, how come we're waiting?
it seems empty out there.

32
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,600
people like to get in
that last barbecue.

33
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:07,234
artie, you been to this "da
giovanni" up by troy hills?

34
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,667
- no, i haven't been.
- supposed to be incredible.

35
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,633
- he's a kid, right?
- i hate fish,

36
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
<i>but his,
with the agrodolce...</i>

37
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,101
i'll check it out.

38
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,867
<i>- ah, buon appetito.
- about time.</i>

39
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,600
fuckin' phil.
some display, huh?

40
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,334
paid a visit
to vito's goomah, jill.

41
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,468
she still hasn't heard
from vito.

42
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,834
<i>- we were just discussin'
"la cage aux fat."</i>

43
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,334
i was gonna get my cousin tommy
to call his detective friend.

44
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:46,700
i've been hamstrung with that
work stoppage at the office park.

45
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:50,201
vito shows up-- he shows up,
then we deal with him. if not...

46
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:52,368
it's just a phone call.
and seriously,

47
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:56,001
tommy says the guy can track
somebody from the corn in his shit.

48
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,067
yeah, i saw them
do that on "csi."

49
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,034
- good night.
- bye, sack.

50
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,167
- bye now.
- good night, kid.

51
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:07,700
hey, i was glad to hear you
say that about the search,

52
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:11,468
'cause i gotta take a little time
off for some business in cali.

53
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,767
little carmine's lined
up a meet in l.a. for us.

54
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,234
so, what is it,
business or time off?

55
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,533
time off from here,
but definite business.

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,434
with ben kingsley, ton'.

57
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,034
so you're gonna go
get an autograph

58
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,567
on the weekend of the
notre dame-michigan game?

59
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,867
i got my guys all over it.
little carmine says

60
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:30,334
if we attach ben kingsley,
the picture's a go.

61
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,101
little carmine?

62
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,401
it's common knowledge
the guy's retarded.

63
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,667
i don't get it. you agreed
to this in the hospital.

64
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:39,001
christopher,
i was in a coma.

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,800
okay, fine.
i'll call little carmine,

66
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:47,067
call the airline, cancel.

67
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:51,001
i'll probably
still reach someone.

68
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,867
what am i gonna do
with you?

69
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,267
make a lot of money.

70
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,201
all right.

71
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,767
what the fuck
is this idiot doing?

72
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,167
no speak english.

73
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,101
...brooklyn.

74
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,201
ho, pal. move your car. we're late.

75
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,567
<i>move el automobile.</i>

76
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,700
rusty! don't forget
to call marissa.

77
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:37,067
- hurry up. let me see.
- oh, yes.

78
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,934
- museum...
- eastern parkway.

79
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,533
eastern parkway,
not the belt parkway.

80
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:06,567
so i'm trying to eject the
dvd and the kids are freaking,

81
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:09,067
- "what's wrong
with that lady, daddy?"

82
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,500
- and carrie says--
- how's the scaloppini?

83
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,700
uh, it's delicious.
thanks.

84
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,401
it all depends on slicing
the veal very thin.

85
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,401
my way--

86
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,667
i like to chill it down
a degree or two

87
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,067
and then i pull a straight
razor right across it.

88
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,934
your father could cook.

89
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,900
he told me when you were in
here last. 75th birthday, right?

90
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:32,101
in the navy.
- what's that?

91
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,567
in the navy,
he cooked.

92
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,834
terrific guy.
great head of hair.

93
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,334
- you enjoy.
- mmm.

94
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:40,934
save room. i'll be back
with dessert specials.

95
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,468
ho, benny,
moe and jack.

96
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,334
how's the bruschett'?

97
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,134
you got a quorum.
let me get you a table.

98
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,967
you guys go ahead. i'm
gonna stay right here.

99
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,934
my best customer, but he's
nailed to this fuckin' spot.

100
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:57,001
it's either the wine
or the view.

101
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,567
such a sweet kid.

102
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,834
you know, she told charmaine
that back in albania

103
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,334
her whole family
got blown up

104
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:05,700
waiting on line
for an oil change.

105
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,800
the shit she's been
through, we just had to help.

106
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:10,001
i even called in a favor
with my cousin in manhattan,

107
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,633
got her a working visa,
started on the green card.

108
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,001
martina,
come do some hosting.

109
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,734
- hi.
- hi.

110
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,700
- what's up?
- this is your cheering section over here.

111
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,500
- hello, benny.
- you got the reservations squared away?

112
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,368
it's very few
right now.

113
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:29,134
football season.

114
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,533
i could watch her
walk away all night.

115
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,700
good, 'cause like most girls with
you, that's what she's gonna do.

116
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,900
ah, to be young and single
again like these two,

117
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,434
- huh, benito?
- ahh.

118
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,734
i can put the credit card
numbers on actual plastic

119
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,301
for an extra five bills.

120
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:18,201
we do internet strictly.

121
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:36,368
mmm, the gnocchi!

122
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,867
i'll take your word. it's a
little too rich for my stomach.

123
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,767
it's okay.
just a bite.

124
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:48,267
i think it's
a lamb ragu

125
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,368
with just a scoop
of cold rigott'.

126
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:54,001
- holy shit.
- it's also fresh. that fish witpistachios?

127
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,567
i feel like a traitor.

128
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,267
vesuvio, lately,
it's depressing somehow.

129
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,633
maybe they need to remodel
or something. i don't know.

130
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,900
that menu is so tired.

131
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:06,633
<i>- hey, homo junior!
- leave me the fuck alone!</i>

132
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,767
get-- stop it!
mom, they're hurting vito!

133
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:13,434
<i>- stop it!
- where are your parents?</i>

134
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:18,867
i guess she can't hide
her face at home.

135
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,967
it'd be like admitting
there was something wrong.

136
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,800
i should have brought
a pair of sweatpants

137
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,700
to change into.
i'm gonna explode.

138
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,700
apparently,
there is still a veal loin

139
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,533
yet to be unveiled.

140
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,934
please, don't get up.

141
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,700
- congratulations.
- thank you.

142
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,368
that kid,
i'm tellin' you...

143
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:41,967
- thank you.
- ...he was so handsome in that church.

144
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:44,767
the name he took, "francis"--
after my pop.

145
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:48,001
no restaurants in brooklyn? you
gotta come all the way to jersey?

146
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,500
this food-- it's worth a
detour. why? is there a problem?

147
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,767
artie's a friend of mine, you know?
i like to throw him some business.

148
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,500
talk to you a minute?

149
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,134
visited with john.

150
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:04,867
he said to tell you he
appreciates the recent headlines.

151
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,700
- rusty.
- i don't know what you're talkin' about.

152
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,201
i turned him down
on that.

153
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:14,900
madonn', you're
a cautious man.

154
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,533
you know, some people might
feel a little offended.

155
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
me-- my heart
is an open book.

156
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,267
anyway, rusty's gone

157
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,267
and we'll chalk it up
to the headless horseman.

158
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,767
<i>giovanni.</i>

159
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,734
bravo!

160
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,334
martina was just
tellin' me

161
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,368
that in montenegro
i'd be the tallest guy.

162
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,267
another fun fact
from the balkans.

163
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,401
ben, are you up
for dessert?

164
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,167
no, i'm all set here.
thanks.

165
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:11,167
martina, sweetheart,

166
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:13,234
can i talk to you
for a second?

167
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,067
what is it, artie?

168
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:20,167
you're looking at me
very serious.

169
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,167
you remember i had
that friend in manhattan

170
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:25,401
that was gonna help speed you
through the green card process?

171
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:28,734
apparently,
it's not happening.

172
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,334
- why?
- too much on his plate, he said.

173
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,900
i guess you're just gonna have
to do it yourself. i'm sorry.

174
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:37,234
all those forms.
shit me.

175
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,767
i wish i could help you,
but really,

176
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,600
it's a small inconvenience compared
to living in freedom, right?

177
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,468
yes, i know this.

178
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,334
get him another 'buca.

179
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,834
hey, tony.

180
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,834
you could fuck her,
you know?

181
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,334
<i>well...</i>

182
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,934
<i>i'm not 100%
in that department,</i>

183
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,134
but i'm startin'
to feel the old pressure.

184
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,867
it's funny, 'cause guys
like me, we come here,

185
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,867
we get drunk
and stare.

186
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,834
best-case scenario, we go in
the back room, we get a lap dance

187
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,368
a dry hump and pfft--
blow in our pants.

188
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:42,301
listen, you wanna fuck her so bad,
i'm sure it could be worked out.

189
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,434
nah, i couldn't.

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,600
but you...

191
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,667
well, what do you
want me to say?

192
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:51,134
nothing.
it's just a fact.

193
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,500
if i knew you were gonna
be in such a pissy mood--

194
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:01,234
gabriella dante and rosalie
aprile came in for lunch yesterday.

195
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,134
so what, you wanna fuck
one of them now?

196
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:05,468
no.

197
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,134
gab said you all went and had
a meal at da giovanni on sunday.

198
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:14,167
well, i was gonna
tell you.

199
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:18,700
it was phil's grandson's
confirmation. it's a pain in the ass.

200
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:20,468
what are you gonna do?
you gotta eat.

201
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,001
it's nothing' special,
believe me.

202
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:27,334
actually, carm got a little sick
after. too much oil, she thought.

203
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,201
gab said
i should check it out,

204
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,734
like i could learn
something.

205
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
well, she runs her mouth,
that one.

206
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,067
fuck her.

207
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:38,167
carm got sick.
nice touch.

208
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:40,067
it was a business
obligation, artie.

209
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:43,600
uh-oh. last time i heard that, i
had to call the fire department.

210
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,734
well, maybe you need another
fresh start to fuck up.

211
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:50,633
i should go.

212
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
- oh, come on, come on.
- no.

213
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,900
- i'm sorry. have another one, come on.
- forget it.

214
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,468
i know where
your heart is.

215
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,600
i gotta plan
the menu for tomorrow.

216
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:08,001
fasanella,
my old man's a meat guy.

217
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,967
he said that the restaurant business
was like keeping an elephant.

218
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:14,468
it costs a fortune and sooner
or later it shits on your head.

219
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,134
i miss him.

220
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:21,667
hector had to trim three
inches off the fiorentinas.

221
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,234
great. we can't even get
the good meat anymore.

222
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,834
fucking western beef
is leaving us for dead.

223
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,167
i wanted you to call their
guy, but you were on the floor

224
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,967
talking to the cohen's
mother-in-law.

225
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,533
you can't deal with the
westeeef guy yourself,

226
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,633
my blushing flower?

227
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,734
it's not
the same from me.

228
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,734
and arthur,

229
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,834
the chatting

230
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,001
with the guests...

231
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,533
again, that's it.

232
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,334
it's not hector or the
meat or these assholes

233
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:54,767
that are always looking for
the next hot thing. it's me.

234
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,767
limit it to a quick
visit at coffee.

235
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,734
people wanna talk
to each other, not you.

236
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,867
really? you know better
than new jersey zagat--

237
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:07,234
"arthur bucco,
warm and convivial host"?

238
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,767
yeah, we're here
right now.

239
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:31,301
sure, the broad strokes.
perfect.

240
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:34,368
kingsley's agent says we
grab lunch tomorrow, poolside.

241
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,633
- that guy, jay?
- yeah, i got him out of some trouble

242
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,134
on a party yacht
down in the keys.

243
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:42,067
ben kingsley, can he do
a new jersey accent?

244
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,301
welcome
to the viceroy.

245
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,834
i usually send
the bags up, hit the bar,

246
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,800
decompress a little,
unless you're against it.

247
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,667
- what are you talking about?
- you're in aa.

248
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,401
you gave the stewardess an earful
when she put down the champagne.

249
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,633
i just don't wanna make you
feel uncomfortable.

250
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,500
relax.
i can deal with it.

251
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,401
be careful
with this wine,

252
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:06,434
because the way you two
are looking at each other,

253
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,533
pretty soon
we're gonna have to...

254
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,334
- put a high-chair
right here.

255
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,700
did you clip the daily-special
cards to all the menus?

256
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:27,101
hey, artie,

257
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,034
c'mere.

258
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:31,767
you ready to order?

259
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,468
why you kicking
her ass like that?

260
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:36,101
if you're referring to the
fact that she's my employee

261
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,934
and i'm telling her what to do, last
time i checked, that's the way it works.

262
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,800
she thinks you want her
to cry. i said not true.

263
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,468
she told you that?

264
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,434
'cause you two
talk all the time.

265
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,034
<i>- yeah. so what?
- so, maybe you should hire her.</i>

266
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,867
i know
how to treat people.

267
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:53,234
- you're a people person, obviously.
- i am.

268
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,500
and when they're good
to me, they get treats.

269
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,633
and when they're not, well, i
got this severance thing i do.

270
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
it's a complete break,
actually.

271
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,101
i get it.

272
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,134
see, 'cause you talked around that
threat so much, i almost missed it.

273
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,700
sorry to interrupt
you guys,

274
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,167
but, arthur, you have
to plate the salmon.

275
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:16,834
arthur, the kid
is a hood, okay?

276
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,800
if he feels protective
of his girlfriend,

277
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,468
you should just
leave it alone.

278
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,401
she's a slow learner.

279
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,934
she's a nice girl,
and as predicted,

280
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,434
the customers love her

281
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,867
with her little stories
from the old country.

282
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:30,600
you are just
picking on her.

283
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:33,234
it's disgusting.
he's a married man.

284
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:50,101
so it's 500 for the hour,
300 for half.

285
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,700
and if you wanna keep
skiing, that's extra.

286
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:55,834
all right, eden, how's about 400 for 40

287
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,734
and four more lines and then
we'll take it from there?

288
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,201
that'll work.

289
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:14,867
fuckin'-a.

290
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:16,533
those are
some amazing tits.

291
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,734
thank you, sweetie.

292
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,334
carlo's running late. route
23, they think there's a sniper.

293
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,500
listen,
the other night--

294
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,368
it's this place.
you know, the rope's

295
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,067
a little tight
at my collar.

296
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,134
down 40%
from last year.

297
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,500
- you need a little help?
- from you? god no.

298
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,368
oh, there's the gratitude
i was looking for.

299
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,667
<i>no, i mean i'm not
at that point, thank god.</i>

300
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,934
but thank you.

301
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:54,001
well, listen, the other
day i was driving along

302
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,401
and i was thinking
about your little problem.

303
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:58,834
how about a little promotion?
a coupon, two-for-one?

304
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,401
two-fers, wow.

305
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,167
you mean, like you get a
free spaghetti and meatballs

306
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:06,567
if you bring another cheap
gomer douche-bag in here?

307
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,600
how about an early-bird
special? salad wagon?

308
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,267
this is a fine dining establishment.
i'll give it back to the bank

309
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,967
before i turn it
into a fucking ihop.

310
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:16,301
just send the waiter
over here.

311
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:19,734
you wanna help me so
badly? try paying your tab.

312
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,633
- excuse me?
- that little roast you and the waste management people

313
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,334
threw for dick barone
when he got sick--

314
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,434
40 fucking garbagemen
from around the country.

315
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,567
of course you paid
pat cooper.

316
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,134
you paid
the entertainment.

317
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:13,134
afternoon. we're looking
for arthur bucco.

318
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,934
- that's me.
- dave kloski. this is jim hollings.

319
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:22,101
american express? funny,
i had you two for cops.

320
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:25,034
in a past life. actually
we're here to investigate

321
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:28,334
some recent irregularities in charge
activity here at nuevo vesuvio.

322
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,167
"nuovo."
irregularities?

323
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,101
well, there is credit card fraud
going on in this restaurant.

324
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,001
- that's impossible.
- based on cardholder disputes,

325
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,867
we show nine hits in this locus
that precede fraudulent activity.

326
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,067
- what does that mean?
- people's card numbers were copied

327
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,001
and those numbers were used to rack up
thousands of dollars in phony charges.

328
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,834
wait, you think i'm ripping off
my own customers? that's insane.

329
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,034
were these meals
actually served?

330
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,301
shit.

331
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,900
councilman carillo?
that was just two weeks ago.

332
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,500
so you understand
we have to suspend

333
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,800
<i>the use of our cards here
pending an investigation.</i>

334
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:01,800
suspend?
you're cutting me off?

335
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,368
what's going on?

336
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,633
they're from amex.
no more charges.

337
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,034
- what?!
- someone's stealing!

338
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,434
guys, this is like 30%
of my business here

339
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,201
and i can't fucking
spare it right now!

340
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:16,234
artie, please don't curse.
the minute you use profanity,

341
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,167
you give them the high moral
ground to do whatever they please.

342
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:20,967
we need copies
of your reservations

343
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:23,567
and a list of anyone who has
access to customer plastic.

344
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,934
i'm just asking, jay.

345
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,301
well, tell me again.

346
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,967
why am i meeting
with these chaps?

347
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:40,800
oh! oh, bollocks, jay.
uh-- bollocks!

348
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:46,267
oh, please.

349
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,867
anyway, we appreciate
that your time

350
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:54,834
is less than limited,
so i'll cut to the chase.

351
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,900
log line-- "the ring"
meets "the godfather."

352
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:02,001
wiseguy-- murdered,
i guess you could say--

353
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,401
seeks revenge on the man
who ordered it.

354
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,867
you would play that man.

355
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:07,800
which man?

356
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,800
who are we kidding here?

357
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:12,434
you're ben kingsley.
you'd play the boss.

358
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,934
i heard this idea--
i call jay and i say,

359
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,401
"sir ben kingsley,
no one else."

360
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:22,167
well, you know, as ever,
it's script-dependent.

361
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,867
oh, we got a sensational
writer-- jt dolan.

362
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:29,368
i'm embarrassed.
i haven't heard of him.

363
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:32,401
he's from tv-- "nash
bridges," "hooperman,"

364
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:34,867
and "law & order,
the s.u.v."

365
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:36,700
so there's a script?

366
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,567
we wanted to surmise
your interest

367
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,934
and then tailor the part
to your specificities.

368
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,434
no one plays a tough, ruthless,
hard-hearted prick like you do.

369
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,401
you got it down,
trust me.

370
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,267
i take that
as quite a compliment.

371
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:51,700
sure.
"sexy beast"?

372
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,134
now, we do have
a shortlist of directors.

373
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,234
we could go a-list
down the horror genre--

374
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,067
ridley, tobe hooper.

375
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:01,800
or we could try to find the
next james wan. he did "saw."

376
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,767
did you see that?
fuckin' brutal.

377
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,267
betty?

378
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:09,867
it's ben.
how are you?

379
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:12,134
what on earth
are you doing out here?

380
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,134
oh, i don't know.

381
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,301
oh.

382
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:19,633
gentlemen, allow me to
introduce miss lauren bacall.

383
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,667
lauren, this is carmine
tazzi and christopher...

384
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,567
...moltisanti.
huge fan.

385
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,500
- thank you.
- "lupertazzi."

386
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,468
you were great in "the
haves and have-nots."

387
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,434
oh yes, dear howard hawks. thank you.

388
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,533
i'm a presenter at one
of these award shows--

389
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,533
showest,
some bullshit.

390
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
oh, i did one of those years ago,
after "death and the maiden," i think.

391
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,900
they do take good care
of you, though.

392
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:44,767
i have shiatsu
in about 10 minutes.

393
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,834
- wow.
- but let's catch up.

394
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,468
absolutely.
great to see you.

395
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:52,234
- thank you.
- as always.

396
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:54,934
- so nice meeting both of you.
- enjoy your success.

397
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,334
uh, that reminds me,
i have a scheduling problem.

398
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,500
this meeting was last
minute and i'm supposed to be

399
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,867
at the luxury lounge
at 2:00.

400
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:09,067
yeah, but we haven't even
gotten to the particulars yet.

401
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,434
we'll walk with you.

402
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,500
i think this is
going very well.

403
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,368
you okay? you seem
a bit distracted.

404
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,767
it's fucking sir ben kingsley
is all. lauren bacall.

405
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:30,800
- yo.
- murmur, i'm chipping here major.

406
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,533

407
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,468
sir ben kingsley
and... guests.

408
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,934
janine will take
you around.

409
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:42,434
hi, janine.
ben kingsley.

410
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,368
we're offering
the full services

411
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,700
of the spa today,
including massage.

412
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:50,667
listen, we're thinking about
sam rockwell for the younger guy.

413
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,468
- is that a good chemistry for you?
- hmm.

414
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,600
may i offer you
champagne?

415
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,633
maybe later.

416
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:09,267
this is yael from cosabella
lingerie. sir ben kingsley.

417
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,867
i'll take an extra large
in these.

418
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:16,234
for a man, white and warm is
giving this cashmere throw,

419
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:19,700

and here, one for the car.

420
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,734
- thanks, yael.
- they charge this shit to the room?

421
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,334
- hmm?
- this is carla from oris.

422
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:27,734
men's and women's,
sporty and dressy.

423
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,001
a lot of guys are going with
the classic stainless chrono.

424
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,500
oh, my godson would love that. he's
having his birthday in three weeks.

425
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:38,167
- but for me...
- this is elegant.

426
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:40,067
- really is.
- take the chrono too?

427
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:43,267
- are you sure?
- of course.

428
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,434
is all this shit free?

429
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,900
i'm gettin' that.

430
00:26:56,734 --> 00:27:00,067
"true crime, new york city."

431
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,334
pam has
a huge crush on you.

432
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:10,101
thanks, pam.

433
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,533
so kingsley, they do this all the time?

434
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,667
- it's sir ben, actually.
- sorry.

435
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,967
a couple of times a year, mainly
clustered around award seasons.

436
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,101
how is that even
fuckin' possible?

437
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,034
i know. it's embarrassing, isn't it?

438
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,267
- i know i have one of these.
- shelly from iriver.

439
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,468
i don't know
if you have this one.

440
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:28,301
it's got 20 gigs of space
in a tiny package.

441
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:31,700
<i>that's 80 hours of video
or 600 hours of music.</i>

442
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,967
shelly, can i get
one of these?

443
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:37,067
- here you go, sir ben.
- thank you, shelly.

444
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:41,334
sir ben, you've got a
meeting with doug in 10, so...

445
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:43,500
hey, guys,

446
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,234
looks like i ate up
all our time here.

447
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,134
what do you say
we catch up in new york?

448
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,368
you got a lot
of tables left.

449
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,368
we're gonna make
that work, sir ben.

450
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:53,201
they're giving away
a caddy over there!

451
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:55,800
well, no, it's just a
test-drive for a couple of weeks.

452
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:59,134
<i>you know, my family gave me
some sunglasses for christmas</i>

453
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:02,201
so why don't you
have these?

454
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:05,134
- i bet they'll look great on you, chris.
- i don't know. you think?

455
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,468
sir ben, can we get a shot?

456
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:19,500
the thing, the arabs.

457
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:22,034
chris wanted me to take
care of you while he's away.

458
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,034
<i>cecil b demoltisanti
there.</i>

459
00:28:26,201 --> 00:28:28,934
- this is one week?
- yeah, murmur caught some big ones.

460
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,767
you're going to see your
girlfriend over at vesuvio?

461
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,368
yeah.

462
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,334
all right.

463
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:37,368
uh...

464
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,167
give this to artie.
keep it on my tab.

465
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,767
we're not here
to accuse anybody,

466
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:49,267
'cause mainie and i like to
think of you all as family.

467
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:51,368
and this is
very serious.

468
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:54,600
it is, but know
that as family

469
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,101
you'll be treated
with respect

470
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,267
and, if need be,
forgiveness.

471
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,134
hector,
and you, mustache...

472
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,067
you got
something to say?

473
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:12,101
we have no intention of pressing
charges. it's just gotta stop.

474
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,834
that's all we want.
any questions?

475
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:21,500
understand this is not about
a 42-oz. jar of moroccan olives

476
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,600
<i>or a couple of rolls
of toilet paper here.</i>

477
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,767
- this is our livelihoods.
- are you looking at me?

478
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,800
nobody's looking
at anybody.

479
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,533
- i didn't take the toilet paper.
- but the olives?

480
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,034
i'm joking here.

481
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:36,267
i'm just saying if you
don't come clean to us,

482
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:38,101
those investigators,

483
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,134
well, they just might
question the honesty

484
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,900
of somebody
that wears a coat

485
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,567
pulled from
the lost-and-found.

486
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:45,734
- fuck this!
- no, fuck you!

487
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,234
- arthur...
- i don't know which one of you pieces of shit did this,

488
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:50,500
- but i've been good to you!
- ...getting us nowhere.

489
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,500
and you pay me back
with nonstop ass rape!

490
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,434
well fuck all of you!

491
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:09,468
you know what?
just forget it.

492
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,434
i-- i'm so sorry,
everybody.

493
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,700
um, could you just get this
cleaned up so we can open? thanks.

494
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,001
no no. it's very bad.

495
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,134
they had
the credit card police.

496
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,468
those companies
are huge.

497
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,967
they come on tough, but in
the end, they gotta eat it.

498
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,401
okay.

499
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,767
everything okay
in there?

500
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:42,234
for once i'd like to eat without
you getting a call from work.

501
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:47,134
ah.

502
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,867
god damn it.

503
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,567
motherfucker.

504
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,201
arthur!

505
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:18,001
what do you want, a repeat
performance of the fourth of july?

506
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,734
<i>that cop told you,</i>

507
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,234
no firing guns in
the borough limits.

508
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:24,267
i brought those
arugula seeds

509
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,334
all the way back from italy
in my shaving kit.

510
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,834
<i>- eden, get the fuck
out of there!</i>

511
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,900
<i>- fuck off.
- i wasn't going through your purse!</i>

512
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:38,533
i was movin' it
and it fell.

513
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,167
<i>go fuck yourself,
you guinea bastard!</i>

514
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,867
<i>good afternoon, mr. moltisanti.</i>

515
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,867
room 812, please.

516
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,600
- yes.
- hey, sir kingsley.

517
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,167
it's chris moltisanti
from yesterday?

518
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,834
i spoke with jay

519
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,234
and he's working on that
new york meeting right now.

520
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:08,401
fine, but that's not what
i'm calling about, though.

521
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,900
that luxury lounge thing,
can you get me in there?

522
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:13,734
i don't know. my publicist
handles all that stuff.

523
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,234
- so, can you call 'em?
- i don't know

524
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,267
how my publicist
can help you, you know?

525
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:21,101
all right.

526
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:24,234
yeah, in the city then.
my partner went back.

527
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,134
friend of his died
recently. guy's wife

528
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,334
is having a breakdown.
he'll call you.

529
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:38,101
that's security, eden! they're
gonna blow that door open!

530
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,234
<i>fuck you!</i>

531
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:47,533
- fuck.
- i know, i gotta get it together.

532
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,867
black truffle doesn't have the
intensity of white so you gotta use more.

533
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,767
i'll be at my investing club at
the learning annex with my cell

534
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:57,267
if you have to call,
but try not to.

535
00:32:57,334 --> 00:33:00,034
sandy,
about the meeting...

536
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:01,900
- oh, everybody knows you're upset.
- i know.

537
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,567
but alonzo's coat, you
told me that in confidence.

538
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,067
i thought you
needed to know.

539
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:08,867
i also think-- well,
it's probably nothing,

540
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:12,401
but yesterday martina was showing
off these caovilla sandals.

541
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,767
i know she makes
more than me,

542
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,067
but they cost
like $600.

543
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:21,800
you should get back
to the coat room.

544
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,434
hold on a second.
i wanna ask you something.

545
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,800
- i knew it.
- i'm sorry. i'll pay you back.

546
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:38,001
- how could you do this to me?
- you were so mean to me.

547
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,034
like helping you find the
apartment? teaching you to drive?

548
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:44,267
as soon as you found out i wasn't going
to fuck you, you started picking on me.

549
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:47,934
i wanna fuck you? you certainly
have a high opinion of yourself.

550
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,234
you stare at me
like food.

551
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:52,600
well i never
fuck you.

552
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,767
- i go to benny and we laugh at you...
- benny.

553
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,533
...when i fuck him
in the pile of money

554
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,633
that we take from
your stupid customers.

555
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,101
you're fired.

556
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,101
oh yeah?
oh, who's laughing now?

557
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,001
oh, what do you think? i can't press
charges 'cause of my friendship with tony?!

558
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,700
three months
you worked here!

559
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,368
<i>you think that doesn't go
on your permanent record?!</i>

560
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:12,301
we lead the world in
computerized data collection!

561
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:38,301
artie, you know
what time it is?

562
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,900
- we need to talk.
- now?

563
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:42,834
my wife is pregnant.
she needs to sleep.

564
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,234
martina told me about your
little credit card business.

565
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:47,101
step outside, ben.

566
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,567
i'll be outside
a minute, honey.

567
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,034
look.

568
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,468
you're upset,
all right?

569
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,967
but it's not my fault.
that little trick got greedy.

570
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,700
oh, so she's
a little trick, huh?

571
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,001
i was gonna cut you in,
but now you're acting stupid.

572
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,533
regular people are
all fucking stupid.

573
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,767
you want some more?!

574
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,468
piece of dogshit!
little, crazy,

575
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,900
motherfucking
meatball dogshit!

576
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:43,800
<i>yeah, i'm stupid.</i>

577
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:01,500
ho! there he is.

578
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,533
how you doing?

579
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,567
- great, thanks.
- this is murmur.

580
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,734
- you heading to the pool?
- massage.

581
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,734
oh.

582
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,533
listen. you get a chance to call
about that luxury lounge for me?

583
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,567
well, it's like
i explained...

584
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,800
there's nothing very much
i can do about it.

585
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:23,667
- you see, they decide whom they give it to.
- very important people,

586
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:26,700
like you, right? 'cause
you're a very important person.

587
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,700
to them, i guess.

588
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:34,167
murmur's an interesting name.
what's the genesis?

589
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,667
i had a heart murmur
when i was a kid.

590
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:39,834
they just keep
handing stuff out, huh?

591
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,834
the coolest shit
in the world

592
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,700
to the people
who need it the least.

593
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:54,533
look. i think you've
misunderstood something.

594
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,301
i give most
of that stuff away

595
00:36:57,368 --> 00:37:00,201
to homeless shelters, the rest
i give to charity auctions.

596
00:37:00,267 --> 00:37:03,167
- not to your godson?
- i agree with you,

597
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:05,600
the whole thing's obscene,
and it's nothing

598
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,667
compared to the situation
at award shows.

599
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:11,067
presenters get about $30,000
worth of merchandise

600
00:37:11,134 --> 00:37:12,900
<i>in those baskets.</i>

601
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,734
<i>that's a year's salary
for some people.</i>

602
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,567
go figure.

603
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:19,167
hopefully we can spread
some of that lolly around.

604
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,567
we'll get you
that script.

605
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:34,301
hell of a tub here, guys.

606
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:37,267
sea, sun. i'm gonna
make it my second home.

607
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:40,633
- anybody else hungry? huh?
- we'll get lunch started.

608
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,301
- artie, another margarita?
- i could say no, but i won't.

609
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,900
you lost
your fucking mind?

610
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:07,867
the shit you're in with that kid,
which you brought on yourself.

611
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:10,001
brought on myself?
oh, i suppose you let

612
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,700
a certain element into your
world, you're asking for it.

613
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:15,234
- oh!
- jesus fucking christ, tony,

614
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:17,434
- how could you pull that scam at my place?
- come on,

615
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
you know i never would've
let that happen if i'd known.

616
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,900
you're innocent, i get it.
i'm justther victim

617
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,334
- of benny fazio, criminal mastermind.
- that's right.

618
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:27,334
and once you found out, instead
of putting him in the e.r.,

619
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,867
you should've come to me. he
says he's gonna kill you, artie.

620
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,533
i can't take
american express now, ton'.

621
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,867
you know what that means? i have
to start with the fucking two-fers.

622
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:39,001
my accountant insisted.
are you happy?

623
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,800
life's not fair.
right, i know.

624
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:43,334
but somehow i believe my
dad's crap about honest work.

625
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:46,767
he used to say
to me, "you'll see.

626
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:49,101
pays off in the end."

627
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,633
what a joke.

628
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,067
i hate to see you like this,
you know that.

629
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:02,934
'cause you start
thinking crazy shit.

630
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,167
who's hungry?

631
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,867
- yeah?
- ben kingsley passed.

632
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:20,767
fuck.

633
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,934
you know, i tried
to be his friend,

634
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:26,034
i sent a muffin basket
with the script,

635
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:27,967
i tried everything.

636
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,301
you can kill me after
if you want,

637
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,900
- but he's a fucking dead man.
- calm down, ben.

638
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:42,201
he came to my house, tony,
where my wife was watching tv.

639
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:45,434
my wife, who's carrying
my unborn son.

640
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,934
i'm gonna take him to
that warehouse in paterson

641
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,234
- and drive fucking...
- nails into his balls. i know.

642
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:52,834
i heard you
the first time.

643
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,401
- you're having a son, huh?
- they showed us his cannoli

644
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:03,900
on the ultrasound
like a month ago.

645
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,500
that's beautiful.

646
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,934
oh, congratulations.

647
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:13,067
thank you.

648
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:15,234
<i>i'm gonna tell you
this once--</i>

649
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,633
it's over.
you drop it.

650
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,334
and frankly you should be very
happy i'm not gonna tax you.

651
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:24,468
i mean beside the fact you
know i grew up with the man,

652
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,468
you don't shit
where you eat.

653
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,834
and you really don't shit where i eat.

654
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,567
i know, and i'm sorry
about that, but--

655
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:33,700
and your parents'
anniversary party?

656
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,001
it's not going to be at da
giovanni's. it's gonna be at vesuvio.

657
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,867
what? tony,
look at my face.

658
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,734
he's going to apologize
to you, and give you a rate.

659
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:47,067
he's hurtin' too. and
it's the least you can do.

660
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:53,900
well ms. bacall, your limo
is second in line there.

661
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,401
oh, well i can take it
from here.

662
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:58,567
- you sure?
- yeah, thank you so much.

663
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:00,301
- okay, you're welcome.
- good night.

664
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:02,034
night.

665
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,934
- get the fuck away from me!
- what are you doing?!

666
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,667
somebody help us!

667
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,934
those guys!

668
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,267
ms. bacall,

669
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:22,734
yes, an ambulance
by robinsons-may.

670
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,800
oh jesus,
my fucking arm.

671
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,700
- hmm?
- no.

672
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,867
there's a line outside.

673
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:43,800
okay, push the scampi. wholesaler
says they gotta get eaten tonight.

674
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:47,500
and don't spread out too much. we still
got the fazio party in the banquet room.

675
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:52,834
okay, sandy.
open the door.

676
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,434
hello. welcome.

677
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,767

low-salt selections?

678
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:12,034
ma, pop, order whatever you want.

679
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:14,533
i'm having
that loin of veal.

680
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,834
that's
the other place, ma.

681
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:23,900
this the young couple?

682
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:25,800

683
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,368
cent'ann'!

684
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:30,368
- hundred years!

685
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:35,434
well, i hope you all enjoy.
you're all set for wine, cocktails?

686
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:39,067
- nothing?
- fine, thanks.

687
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,368
benny, can i get
you a martina?

688
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:46,134
- excuse me?
- a martina.

689
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:48,967
it's like a martini,
but it's from albania.

690
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,468
<i>hmm. i never heard of it.</i>

691
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,101
well, apparently
they go down real easy.

692
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:54,800
right, ben?

693
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:59,600
we're gonna look
at the menu.

694
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,867
good enough.

695
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:09,600
<i>- you order for me.
- fine. the monkfish.</i>

696
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,101
<i>there's such
a strange consistency.</i>

697
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,001
- ow!
- in front of my wife?!

698
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:27,134
fuck!

699
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,067
jesus! fuck, my hand!

700
00:43:29,134 --> 00:43:32,001
shit! oh god!
oh fuck!

701
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,667
<i>fuck! my hand!</i>

702
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:41,034
oh my god!
oh my god!

703
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:45,301
oh my god, arthur!
somebody call 911 please!

704
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:15,567
look at this.

705
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:26,434
<i>i had no idea. i'd have
booked another flight.</i>

706
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,533
fuck.

707
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:36,667
where is everybody?

708
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:38,500
my father-in-law
don't wanna come.

709
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,500
him and carm
aren't speaking.

710
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:44,001
- how's the meathook?
- had to be my fuckin' saute hand, huh?

711
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:46,234
why, you got an okay
crowd here today.

712
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:48,667
sunday pasta's
the last thing to go.

713
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,633
the place is on life-support
ever since word got out

714
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,500
to the regulars
about their credit cards.

715
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:55,134
and my staff is pissed
off about martina leaving.

716
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:57,934
benny did a real
number here, tony.

717
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:01,167
who knows? maybe it's
cursed. the fire, then this.

718
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:02,834
will you stop talkin'
like an old lady?

719
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,234
- artie.
- no go, huh?

720
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:09,101
he's just being dramatic.

721
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,800
- how are you, sweetie?
- better.

722
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:13,500
<i>and carm, the flowers...</i>

723
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:18,468
tonight, only the best

724
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:20,134
for the best people.

725
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:29,334
hmm, that's excellent.

726
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:38,700
<i>hey, be careful you two,</i>

727
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,633
because the way you two
are looking at each other,

728
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,767
pretty soon we'll have to
put a high-chair over here.

729
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:46,633
like the icing on a cake, okay? capisce?

730
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,734
keep your thumbs
out of the food.

731
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,368
we gotta talk
about your problem.

732
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,234
oh, great.
another idea.

733
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:00,434
how 'bout a strolling
accordionist?

734
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:05,267
i'm gonna give you the name
of a good psychiatrist.

735
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:07,734
she's italian.
you'll like her.

736
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:11,533
you know what? you go
about in pity for yourself.

737
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,101
- i go about in pity for myself?
- yeah.

738
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:16,234
i gotta tell you,
bodhisattva,

739
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:18,334
that is fucking
priceless.

740
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,934
use the other door.

741
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,301
you bitch and you moan
and you blame

742
00:46:23,368 --> 00:46:25,434
everybody else
for your problems,

743
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:29,600
instead of maybe... not letting the
mexicans do all the cooking for you

744
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:32,900
or, i don't know, changing
the menu or changing the decor.

745
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:36,134
i guess because you know how to eat,
you know how to run a restaurant.

746
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,967
on one of the bleakest
nights of my life,

747
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:45,800
after the shit with my mother
and that fuckin' storm outside,

748
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:48,533
i came here to this place.

749
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,401
i sat out there
with carm and my two kids

750
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:54,034
and we ate and we drank and
we were so happy to be here,

751
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,267
more than any other
place in the world.

752
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:59,034
and you know i'm gonna eat
here until i fall off the chair.

753
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:03,800
but in business,
sometimes shit happens.

754
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:06,301
the playing field
changes, whatever.

755
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:09,567
and you gotta do whatever you
gotta do to keep your dick up.

756
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:15,267
if you hate it here so much,
why don't you go to da giovanni?

757
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:17,967
see ife'll cook you that bland
shit for your shot-up pancreas.

758
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:25,334
i'll tell you one thing

759
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:27,334
and this is very hard.

760
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:29,201
nobody wants
to hear you talk.

761
00:47:29,267 --> 00:47:33,101
they're trying to eat out
there and you come along

762
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:36,001
with your corny jokes
and your stupid stories.

763
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,867
just stay in the kitchen.

764
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,334
that'd be a start.

765
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,267
hey.

766
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:04,234
you wouldn't believe what these
people in the business get,

767
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,633
totally fuckin'
absolutely gratis.

768
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,767
yeah, i hear the streets
are paved with hand-jobs.

769
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:12,267
right. i scored
some major swag.

770
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:14,533
a little taste for you.

771
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:18,633
trip to australia,
first-class vouche,

772
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,500
some kind of golf resort.

773
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:23,034
looks like sarasota.

774
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:26,633
after what,
a 20-hour flight? no.

775
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:45,101
that's for a pocket dog.

776
00:48:50,234 --> 00:48:51,900
how'd it go
with the movie star?

777
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:55,034
he was all over us, but
i don't think he's right.

778
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:58,034
we made some great contacts.
plus we saw lindsay lohan.

779
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,734
total piece of ass.

780
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:04,201
you hear artie
burned his hand?

781
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:08,368
yeah. him and benny.
how crazy is that?

782
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:10,368
- he okay?
- a layer of skin

783
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,301
came off his hand
like a glove.

784
00:49:12,368 --> 00:49:15,567
but, they said, you know,
no scarring, no grafts.

785
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,301
- lucky.
- hmm.

786
00:49:19,767 --> 00:49:21,967
well, not for nothin'.
i couldn't help but thinkin'

787
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:25,567
if you were here
watching your crew,

788
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:27,734
things wouldn't have gone
the way they did.

789
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,633
you let me go, t.

790
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,201
i asked you. now it's my fault
artie and benny got into it?

791
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:36,101
this is what i was concerned about,
christopher, the loss of focus.

792
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,700
look...

793
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:42,800
not many guys have had to make
the kind of sacrifice i did.

794
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:45,334
how many times you gonna
play the adriana card?

795
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,633
sandy just seated
a couple.

796
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,567
kitchen's closed.

797
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:02,567
he said they were supposed to go to
the city but they had car trouble.

798
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,267
hector already left
to pick up his wife.

799
00:50:06,334 --> 00:50:08,767
plus i got nothing
back here, charm.

800
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,900
they already opened
the bottle.

801
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,533
they're gonna have to eat
what i give them.

802
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:19,368
arthur, a lot of people
don't like rabbit.

803
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,633
my grandfather's way. only with
provencal elements i been thinking about.

804
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,201
i thought you were taking
it to him at the home.

805
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:29,067
okay-- out. i wanna
get outta here tonight.
