1
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:45,038
You have to be absolutely
110% sure this is who you saw.

2
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,040
This is definitely
the man i saw.

3
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,042
Have you ever
seen him before?

4
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,043
No.

5
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,044
And the other man?

6
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,546
Unfortunately, i didn't
get a good look at him.

7
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,048
The light was reflecting
off the windshield.

8
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,050
But he was heavyset,

9
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,053
it was really dark,
i didn't want them to see me.

10
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,554
I heard gunshots,

11
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,056
but i thought it was
kids with firecrackers.

12
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,557
And then when two men
drove out in a car,

13
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,059
i crouched down
in the ragweed.

14
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,060
Sure.

15
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,562
It began to dawn on me
what had happened.

16
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,564
Like i told
the responding officers,

17
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,066
i didn't finish
changing the tire.

18
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,567
I walked to a phone,
called right away.

19
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,069
Thank you.

20
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,571
I'm so goddamn
fed up with crime.

21
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,573
I'd hate myself if
i didn't come forward

22
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,075
and help you put
these people behind bars.

23
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,578
Thanks to people like you,
we may just do that.

24
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,580
May i ask who
the dead man was?

25
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,083
Just a poor kid, got hooked up
with the wrong crowd.

26
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,584
Crack?

27
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,086
Something like that.

28
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,111
Mommy!

29
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,612
Mommy!

30
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,613
Mommy!

31
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:05,568
Mommy, no!

32
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,487
Mommy.

33
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,995
Hey, what's the matter,
you lost?

34
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,996
Uh- huh.

35
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,499
You scared me
half to death.

36
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,501
I can't turn
my back for a minute.

37
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,002
I know what that's like.

38
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:30,009
My little guy was
a real cadet at his age.

39
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,010
Tony.

40
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,011
Yeah.

41
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,513
It's good you
could meet me.

42
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,014
No problem.

43
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,016
I went over to brookstone
and i got myself a scale.

44
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,518
What do you want
to talk about?

45
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,019
Dick barone

46
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,522
as long as the two
of you are happy

47
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,523
i'm in no mood.

48
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,525
This freaking
garbage business...

49
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,027
i found out that bow tie
wearin' bloodsucker's

50
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,029
charging me twice as much
as everybody else

51
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,031
to tip my trucks
at his place.

52
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,033
So, you'll pad the tonnage,

53
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,536
and you charge your townships
a little extra for the pick up.

54
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,037
That's all.

55
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,540
I got the smallest
amount of roots

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,542
of anybody in
the association.

57
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,545
You're like the old woman who'
got a virginia ham under her arm

58
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,047
and she goes around crying
'cause she's got no bread.

59
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,549
What the hell?

60
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,050
Never mind,
the point is...

61
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,054
your brother, jackie, he never
concentrated on sanitation,

62
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,556
so, what do you
want dick to do?

63
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,057
I want a rate.

64
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,059
Alright, i'll see
what he says.

65
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,561
Yeah.

66
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,562
You see.

67
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,565
Since you own part
of the company.

68
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,574
Did you shut
all the lights?

69
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,074
Yeah.

70
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,075
In the kitchen?

71
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,079
Yeah.

72
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,081
I want to spend
more time with a. J.

73
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,083
It's the other one
you should spend time with.

74
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,084
She's almost
out of the house.

75
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,587
Hey, i'm not worried
about meadow.

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:53,092
Meadow can take care
of herself.

77
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,094
Why this sudden
burst of fatherhood?

78
00:04:55,595 --> 00:05:00,600
Can you say anything
without it being sarcastic?

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,604
You're right,
i'm sorry.

80
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,105
I think it's
a good idea.

81
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,607
He adores you.

82
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,108
He never gets to spend
enough time with you.

83
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,611
Yeah, well...

84
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,113
i was reading in "time"
the other day,

85
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,114
this study at harvard.

86
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,618
The father's support
is absolutely linked

87
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,621
to a boy's later capacity
to manage frustrations,

88
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,625
to explore new circumstances,
and to do well in school.

89
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,126
Kid needs to
toughen up.

90
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,628
I'm not talking
about toughening up,

91
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,129
i'm talking about
opening up.

92
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,631
Somebody needs to teach that kid
some street smarts

93
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,633
and not to be a sucker.

94
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,135
And not to be involved
with the wrong people.

95
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,638
I don't want another
christopher on my hands.

96
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,641
I mean, look at him,
he's lucky to be alive.

97
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:47,647
That other poor prick,
they found dead.

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,649
Kid was 23
or something.

99
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,660
Hey pal,
with the ramlosa.

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,662
Put three cases
of that in my car.

101
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,163
Got it.

102
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,665
That's not a mistake.

103
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:10,169
No, i want another 14 gross
of the model number 4784.

104
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,672
Plastic picnic cooler,
just ship them.

105
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,173
I'll worry about
selling them.

106
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,174
Red.

107
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,177
Forget blue,
red sells.

108
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,178
Put it here.

109
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,180
Put that on
the store tab.

110
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,684
He says take three gross
of the blue coolers,

111
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,685
he'll give us
a price on the red.

112
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,186
Screw that.

113
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,188
He's never getting
paid anyway.

114
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,690
They got to be all red.

115
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,692
Yeah, just do it,
please?

116
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,693
Thank you.

117
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,694
Goodbye.

118
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,196
Who gets chicken
and peppers?

119
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,699
A lot of freakin' work
to move some picnic coolers.

120
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,200
Coolers are
like scissors.

121
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,202
Everybody wants one.

122
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,705
Nobody has a freakin' idea
how much they cost.

123
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,207
You put a nigerian
out on the street,

124
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,210
have them sell these for
a couple, three bucks a piece.

125
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,714
Who's not gonna say,
"screw it, give me one."

126
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,216
Davey, how we doin' with them
books of airline tickets?

127
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,219
Won't it raise a red flag
with the travel agency?

128
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,722
A sporting goods store charges
airline tickets in bulk?

129
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,224
You say it's
a promotional device.

130
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,727
You know, customer of the year,
salesman of the month.

131
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,228
That kind of thing.

132
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,730
Don't worry about it.

133
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,732
You put it on different
lines of credit.

134
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,733
Yeah, but all of a sudden,

135
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,234
i'm ordering all
this weird shit,

136
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,738
i mean, picnic coolers,
ramlosa water.

137
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,241
When's one of
these vendors gonna realize

138
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,243
i'm never gonna pay'em
and call the cops?

139
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,745
When your freakin' credit
runs out, diamond jim.

140
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,748
Until then, get on
the freakin' horn and order.

141
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:34,253
Unless you're ready to pay us
the principle you owe us.

142
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,757
Hey!

143
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,760
Put the heat up.

144
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,765
Today!

145
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,266
Oh, jeez!

146
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,768
What's the matter?

147
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,771
Spider.

148
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,272
So, kill it.

149
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,274
Uh- uh, you do it.

150
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,777
Come here and kill
the freakin' thing.

151
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,284
Come here.

152
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:05,785
No way.

153
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,789
No, c'mon.

154
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,291
It was a leaf,
you freakin' idiot.

155
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,793
Mister?

156
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,794
Yeah.

157
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,295
Some man here
to see you.

158
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,296
Who?

159
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,801
The police.

160
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,302
Be right back.

161
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,811
Did you let them in the house?

162
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,815
"Warrant."
How do you say it
in fuckin' polish?

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,322
Agent harris.

164
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,824
Who's your friend?

165
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,326
I'm detective
harold giardina.

166
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,828
From the essex
county task force.

167
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,329
Well, i'm pleased
to meet you.

168
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,831
But if you don't
have a warrant,

169
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,833
could you get the hell
out of my house?
'Cause i'm kind of busy.

170
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,834
I can see that.

171
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,835
Oh, you're a comedian.

172
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,336
Is that how you
broke your nose?

173
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,838
Tony, we could
have phoned.

174
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,339
We paid you the courtesy
of a visit.

175
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,842
We want you to come down
to the station to talk.

176
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,843
To talk.

177
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,345
About matthew bevilaqua.

178
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,847
Dad?

179
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,848
Take the backboard
out of the cabana.

180
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:14,353
I'll be down there
in a couple of minutes.

181
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,856
Look a lawyer up,
come in one on one,
it's your call.

182
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,357
Just name a time
at your convenience.

183
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,358
On your way out,

184
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,360
you think you can roll
the garbages down the hill?

185
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,863
Tomorrow's pick up day.

186
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:30,870
Let's go, harry.

187
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,372
So those were those fbi guys
that were here before.

188
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,874
What did they want?

189
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,876
Nothing.

190
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,878
Keep this between us,
alright?

191
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,013
You know how
your mother gets.

192
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,402
What do yo
u got for me?

193
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,406
Partial list of the major
investors in webistics.

194
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,909
Other than that, i haven't
seen tony in a while.

195
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,912
You mean, besides the night
tony capped the bevilaqua kid.

196
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,914
What are you
talking about?

197
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,415
Did you fuck me?
Did you fuck me?

198
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,416
Take it easy.

199
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,918
Take it easy?

200
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,921
How about i put a bullet
in that boars head of yours?

201
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,923
He was spotted, sal.

202
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,424
So, don't go
pulling my taffy.

203
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,927
'Cause at this second,
if you lie to me,

204
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,431
you will never see
the streets where you live
for 50 freakin' years.

205
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,433
Did you know
about this?

206
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,435
No.

207
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,437
If you knew he was
planning something...

208
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,940
...and didn't tell me,
and didn't wear a wire--

209
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,441
i told you,"no."

210
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,449
Well, there was
someone else with tony

211
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,951
the night he shot
the kid up.

212
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,955
A quote- unquote
husky accomplice.

213
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:56,455
Yeah?

214
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,456
Yeah.

215
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,960
But the witness
couldn't i. D. Him.

216
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,962
Were you the prep
the witness couldn't make?

217
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,464
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?

218
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,467
What'd i tell you?
No fucking violence.

219
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:13,973
I oughta burn you right
now and let the judge
throw away the key.

220
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,975
I'm gonna decide
to believe you, okay?

221
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,977
But here's what
you're gonna do for me.

222
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,479
I want to hear tony's
voice on tape, sal, saying,

223
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,981
"i killed matthew bevilaqua."

224
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,484
No distortions,
no throat- clearings,
no fucking nose- blowings.

225
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,487
Okay, i get it.
But let me ask you something:

226
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,490
If i did ride with tony
on something like that,

227
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,493
don't you think it would only
get me tighter with him,

228
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,494
raise my coinage?

229
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,496
Make tony forget
all his suspicions?

230
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,498
You're a cute prick, puss,
i'll give you that.

231
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,503
Get me tony on tape
talking about this murder.

232
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,505
So, who's the witness?

233
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,008
No joke, sal.

234
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:56,515
You don't want to
see my darker side.

235
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,516
Go.

236
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,518
If they had enough
to pinch you for,

237
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,520
there'd be bars between us
right as we speak.

238
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,022
Why do they want me
to go down there?

239
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,024
Lock you into a story,
any story.

240
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:10,529
So, later at trial,
any contradiction'll sink you.

241
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,531
Are we gonna go?
Did you say you'd go?

242
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,533
Please.

243
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,534
Alright.

244
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,535
Procrastinate.

245
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,037
Let me get
our ducks in a row.

246
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,538
In the meantime,

247
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,540
keep your cool
and go the speed limit.

248
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,543
Don't give them an in.

249
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,047
What'd i just say?

250
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,548
Don't give them an in.

251
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:34,053
Are you alright, tony?

252
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,555
This is some bad shit here.

253
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,557
What's up, anthony?

254
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,059
How did
this happen?

255
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,061
Mid- life crisis?

256
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,064
You can talk to me.

257
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,067
The mothers last year
said we should end senior night

258
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,069
at sunrise at
long beach island.

259
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,571
That way they can dance,
they'll do the scavenger hunt

260
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,073
and the liquor stores'll
be closed.

261
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,074
We count noses.

262
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,075
Yeah, okay.

263
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,576
Jeez,
is that the time?

264
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,578
I'm gonna barely
get natalie to tap.

265
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,080
Chris, need a ride?

266
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,081
No, my brother's
coming to pick me up.

267
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,083
Eric took my car
to a fencing meet.

268
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,085
Alright, next week,
my house.

269
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,587
We'll tie up
the loose ends.

270
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,607
Christine, i'm so glad
you stayed behind.

271
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,109
I kind of
wanted to.

272
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,111
When i found out
about eric's car,

273
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,613
i told tony to
give it right back.

274
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,615
I wish i could say
this is the first time

275
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,118
dave has pulled a stunt
like this, but...

276
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,621
uh...

277
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,124
eric is going
to college

278
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,627
and maybe it's better
for his grades
he doesn't have a car.

279
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,129
So, april 1st, huh?

280
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,630
How i dread it.

281
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,132
Just so long as eric
gets into georgetown.

282
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,133
It's his first choice.

283
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,134
I wish it was meadow's.

284
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,136
She wants to go
to berkeley.

285
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,141
Hi.

286
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,642
We just finished.

287
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,144
I'm sorry i'm late.

288
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,145
I was bidding
a job in rumson.

289
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,647
My brother,
the artist with wallpaper.

290
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,150
The only one you trust
with your brunswick and fields.

291
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,152
Vic, carmela soprano.

292
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,153
Victor musto.

293
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:14,653
Nice to meet you.

294
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,155
You too.

295
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,157
You have
a beautiful house here.

296
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,658
Oh, thank you.

297
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,160
Not that it couldn't use
a little freshening up.

298
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,661
Vic does amazing
border work too.

299
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,664
Actually, i was thinking
of doing some wallpaper

300
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,665
in the dining room.

301
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,167
Do you have
a card, vic?

302
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,168
Yeah.

303
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,669
Sure.

304
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:36,675
I'm bonded, state certified,
but i'm still dangerous.

305
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,677
Well bye, carmela,
thanks.

306
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,679
Well, let's get together soon
and have lunch, okay?

307
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,181
Have you tried
the new vesuvio?

308
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:42,681
No.

309
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,183
Okay, lunch,
promise.

310
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,187
Yes.

311
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,688
Nice meeting you.

312
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,691
Oh, you too, and i'm gonna call
about the wallpaper.

313
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,699
Nice lady.

314
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,201
Don't even
think about it.

315
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,204
She's married to
tony soprano.

316
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,706
Married's good
enough for me.

317
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,708
Who her husband is
doesn't matter.

318
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,709
I respect the ring.

319
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,211
Oh, especially that ring.

320
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,213
Probably came off
a dead person's finger.

321
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,730
David, are you
down there?

322
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,732
Be right up.

323
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,742
What are you
doing up there?

324
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,744
I'm fixing the freakin
' lightbulb, that's all!

325
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,746
It's glares out
the "one" ball when i rack.

326
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,248
Jesus, okay.

327
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,749
You're the one
that's always worried

328
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,751
about somebody
ruining the felt.

329
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,768
Oh, richie, oh, baby,
you're the best.

330
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:14,773
Oh, you're the best.
One ever.

331
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,777
Oh, baby, you're the best.
Oh, baby, you're the best.

332
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,280
Oh, richie.
Oh, richie.

333
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,282
Oh, baby, you're the boss.

334
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,784
Oh, you're the boss!

335
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,286
Oh, baby.

336
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,288
Oh, you're the best.

337
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,790
Oh, oh,
it should be you.

338
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,292
Oh.

339
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,793
It should be you.

340
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,795
Oh.

341
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,797
What?

342
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,299
Where'd that
come from?

343
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,300
What?

344
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,801
"It should be you"?

345
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,804
What are you trying
to say, janice?

346
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,805
What?

347
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:51,810
Don't "what" me!

348
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,312
Why'd you say that?

349
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,316
I was making love
to you, baby.

350
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,318
You know what you said.

351
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,323
I was in the heat of passion,
i'm doing it like you like.

352
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,325
"Boss" this.

353
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,826
"Boss" that.

354
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,330
"Should be you."

355
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,831
That's not part of it.

356
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,334
How can you think of
stuff like that during sex?

357
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,836
You're not in the moment.

358
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,349
I find powerful
men erotic.

359
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,351
Is that another
dig in me?

360
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,353
Oh, jesus, richie.

361
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,864
I gotta be loyal.

362
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:51,370
Without that,
we crumble.

363
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,873
Tell that to
paul castellano.

364
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,382
I'm old school, janice.

365
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,886
All i mean is
my brother needs help.

366
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,889
Teaching him
manners is one thing.

367
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,891
My uncle junior
still has friends

368
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,895
and junior thinks
the world of you.

369
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,406
When your opponent
gives you an opening,

370
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,909
be swift as a hare.

371
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,914
When i think of that jacket
i gave your brother

372
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:40,419
and he spit on it.

373
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,422
I could slice an ear
off his head.

374
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,924
Richie wait,
wha--

375
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,928
ma, if you need something,
call, i'll bring it up.

376
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,431
Are you smoking
marijuana?

377
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,933
I want to watch the tv.

378
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,935
Well, we should get
another one for your room.

379
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,437
Listen to her.

380
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,439
Like rose kennedy

381
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:05,944
with all our money
to throw around.

382
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,994
Gives me agita.

383
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:56,995
They want me to
go downtown.

384
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,497
Lock you into a story.

385
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,998
And if they
do have something,

386
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,500
why the hell ain't
they talking to you?

387
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,006
Give them time,
they will.

388
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,509
Murder and
aid of racketeering.

389
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:17,015
20 to life.

390
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,517
There they are.

391
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:24,022
The flying
garvone brothers.

392
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,023
Not good.

393
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,525
Not good.

394
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,027
On my freakin' kids,
i will freakin' cut you.

395
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,028
Just tell me.

396
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,531
Take it easy, ton',
it's fixable.

397
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,033
First off,
it's not a rat.

398
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,535
Thank god.

399
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,036
Don't thank him yet.

400
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,540
There's an
eyeball witness.

401
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,543
What're you
talking about?

402
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,546
Jesus christ.

403
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,547
Did you see anybody?

404
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,549
Another freakin'
living soul?

405
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,550
No.

406
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,552
Don't worry,
a mere bump in the road.

407
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,554
Oh, you're beautiful.

408
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,055
Who, do we know him?

409
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,058
All my friend
at the station knows
is that he's a civilian.

410
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,561
A flag- saluting
bloodsucker.

411
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,564
Maybe you should
"lamb chop it" for a while.

412
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,566
I keep a suitcase
in my truck.

413
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,067
Yeah,
tell us about it.

414
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,068
Forget all of yous.

415
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,070
Bygones are
never bygones.

416
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,572
This is
a freakin' nightmare.

417
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,574
I have to move
some cash around.

418
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,576
If i'm gonna lam it, i'm going
with a freakin' package.

419
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,077
I'm not gonna
be like mickey marsucal.

420
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,079
That poor jerk, he had
five freakin' minutes to run.

421
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,083
He ended up in some
rat- infested motel
down in elvis country.

422
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,585
Where is that?

423
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,088
Anywhere there are
no jews or italians.

424
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,089
I don't get it.

425
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,092
It's starting!
It's already starting!

426
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,594
Get back in
your office, david!

427
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,596
I'm opening my mail
and it's a lawsuit!

428
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,097
It's a freakin'
lean on the building,

429
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,599
they're gonna
close me down!

430
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,100
Davey, not
fucking now, okay?

431
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,102
They're gonna know after this
that it's fraud.

432
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,604
I'm gonna
go to jail for this!

433
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,608
Get the fuck back
in your fucking hole, now!

434
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,118
Davey...

435
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,621
you're doing
a good job!

436
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:18,637
Don't worry about
this witness, t.

437
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,138
Exactly.

438
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,140
You don't even know
what he said.

439
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,141
Fuck you,
i did too.

440
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,142
What, then?

441
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,644
I understood.

442
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,645
What's it mean?

443
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:34,152
It means sit on this,
cocksucker!

444
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,654
Five minutes
away from the can

445
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,656
for the rest of my fucking life
and i'm laughing.

446
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,658
You gotta, skip,
you gotta.

447
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,160
It's been months since
davey took me to dinner.

448
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:46,164
When you're dating
it's all candles and wine.

449
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,167
Dave's been even more
preoccupied than usual lately.

450
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,170
He's busy.

451
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,173
Carmela,
my husband has a disease,

452
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,175
a serious
gambling problem.

453
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,176
I am so sorry.

454
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,678
Thank god the store's
in my name.

455
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,680
He can't sell the business
without me

456
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,181
or he would've gambled
it all away by now.

457
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,684
But i'm gonna make sure
we get through this.

458
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,686
Uh- uh.

459
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,188
Give me those.

460
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,191
I'm gonna make you
two beautiful women

461
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,193
a special
tasting menu.

462
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,695
I was hoping
he would say that.

463
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,196
Now i know you
ordered the pelligrino,

464
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,199
but i want you
to try this.

465
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:25,704
I got such a deal
on this ramlosa.

466
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,206
It was so nice to meet
your brother the other day.

467
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,208
He seems like
a very interesting person.

468
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,710
Vic's a doll.

469
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,212
When his wife was dying,
he waited on her
hand and foot.

470
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,714
Really?
A widower?

471
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,716
So young.

472
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,718
Breast cancer.

473
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,221
I thought there was
a sadness about him.

474
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:43,722
Yeah.

475
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,723
And the children?

476
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:45,724
Childless.

477
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,226
She had
a hostile womb.

478
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,728
I had a dream
about him.

479
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,729
You did?

480
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,230
Christine...

481
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,732
well, he asked me
about you too.

482
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,734
He was wallpapering
my dining room.

483
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,736
Oh, well, the dream
was your subconscious

484
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,737
telling you
you want to have him

485
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,239
wallpaper your dining room,
that's all.

486
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:14,252
Hey, go- gootz!

487
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,253
I got something
for you.

488
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:16,755
What?

489
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,757
What?
A rod and
a penn international reel.

490
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,258
Thanks.

491
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,760
You wanted it for christmas
last year, remember?

492
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,261
We couldn't get it,
it was back- ordered.

493
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,263
Well i got
a great deal on them.

494
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,265
We'll, take the boat,
we'll go out fishing.

495
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,266
Okay.

496
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,768
What are you
doing now?

497
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,770
You want
to go fishing now?

498
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,774
No, no, i'd figure
we'd see a movie or something,

499
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:36,274
get some pizza.

500
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,275
I can't.

501
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,777
What do you mean
you can't?

502
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,780
I'm going
to the mall.

503
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,782
You can't see a movie'cause
you gotta go to the mall?

504
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,283
Not just me,

505
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,286
brad, alan, heidi,
her sister maybe.

506
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,788
Like a double date.

507
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,791
No, dad, okay?

508
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,293
We're just going to the mall,
we go there sometimes.

509
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,295
And do what?

510
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:00,298
I don't know,
get something to eat,
some mrs. Fields.

511
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,802
Anyway, i gotta go,
i'm meeting them there.

512
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,803
Alright.

513
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,806
Go ahead.

514
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:12,811
See you later.

515
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,813
Yeah, my girl
did the same thing...

516
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,815
at his age.

517
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,817
Boys and girls
always in a group,

518
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,318
what's that about?

519
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,320
What's it about
for you?

520
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,823
In my day a boy and a girl
went on a date.

521
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,325
And your father hoped
you wouldn't get too far

522
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,327
or else you'd get
the girl knocked up

523
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,330
and her parents would come over
and break your legs.

524
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,332
I don't think
it's about him

525
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,335
going to mall with a group
that bothered you.

526
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,338
Wasn't it that
he was going to mall

527
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,841
instead of going
to the movies with you?

528
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,844
He's getting to that age
where he's got
a life of his own.

529
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,846
One that
doesn't include you.

530
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,849
It's always,"we'll do this,
we're gonna do that".

531
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,851
Not so fast,

532
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,854
i've heard you talk many times
about being with your son.

533
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,856
Yeah well,
that's over now.

534
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,858
Gone, done.

535
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,860
It's bittersweet,
this period.

536
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,362
You're glad that
they're growing up,

537
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,364
but you're sad
to lose them.

538
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,879
I could be
going away...

539
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,883
for a very
long time.

540
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:31,389
For something
i didn't do.

541
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,391
How about,
"gee, that's too bad, anthony",

542
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,893
or "what a shame, tony"?

543
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,395
We can't go into
specifics on this.

544
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,397
Here's something
specific,

545
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,398
i didn't
do anything wrong.

546
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,900
We're not supposed
to talk about it.

547
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,403
I could be going to can
for the rest of my fucking life.

548
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,907
And i'm not
supposed to discuss it
with my psychiatrist?

549
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:55,413
What the fuck
are you for, anyway?

550
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,415
How does that
make you feel,

551
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,918
the idea that you might
be sent to prison?

552
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:12,931
I just gotta stay around
a little while longer
for the kids.

553
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,935
Especially my boy.

554
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,436
Once he's out
of the house

555
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,939
the government can do
whatever the fuck
they want to do.

556
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,941
Give me life,
give me the fucking chair,

557
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:23,942
whatever they want.

558
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,443
I've never
seen you like this.

559
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,444
Like what?

560
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:31,449
Scared.

561
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,451
You know, i wouldn't
use that word.

562
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,953
But sometimes i feel...

563
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,956
i don't know,
i don't know.

564
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:44,462
You motherfuckers,
you motherfuckers!

565
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,466
I don't fucking
deserve this.

566
00:27:55,473 --> 00:28:01,479
How's your medication?

567
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,981
Maybe we should stop.

568
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:17,996
What?

569
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:22,000
Don't have
the witness yet.

570
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,501
Nothing.

571
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,003
This is
the fbi, ton'.

572
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,006
Local cops, you buy them
a christmas tree,

573
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,507
they'll give you
their grandmother.

574
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:36,014
But you know how tight these
fed cocksuckers can keep it.

575
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,016
Alright go home,
get some sleep.

576
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,518
You don't want to
stop by "the bing",

577
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,519
get something
to eat or something?

578
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,021
No.

579
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,024
Just tell me, t,
what do you want me to do?

580
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,025
Just let me think.

581
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:51,029
C'mon.

582
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,530
Alright.

583
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,066
Tony.

584
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,567
What are you
doing here?

585
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,070
I could ask you
the same fucking question.

586
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,572
It's my store.

587
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:39,577
Congratulations,
it's a fucking disaster.

588
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,579
Hey, some of those
airline tickets came in.

589
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,581
You and me split them
with you and richie.

590
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:49,087
They're mine,
it's my idea.

591
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,588
That's where
you sleep?

592
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,090
Yeah, sometimes.

593
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,592
It's easier
than going home.

594
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,594
I know
what you mean.

595
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,108
I remember when you transferred
into 10th grade from...

596
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,611
boden boden.

597
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:18,116
Fucking army brat.

598
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,119
Hey, you remember when those
guidos from paterson,

599
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,621
they caught you up
at garret mountain,

600
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,623
they had you barricaded
in your old man's car

601
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,625
and i whipped that rock
and hit that guy in the eye?

602
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:33,631
Don't reminisce
on me.

603
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,135
You told me not to
get in the game.

604
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:42,640
Why'd you
let me do it?

605
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,644
Well, i knew you had
this business here, davey.

606
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,146
It's my nature.

607
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,649
The frog and the scorpion,
you know?

608
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,151
Besides, if
you would've won

609
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,654
i'd be the one
crying the blues, right?

610
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,656
What's the end?

611
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,657
The end...

612
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,659
it's planned
bankruptcy.

613
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,171
Hey, you're not the first guy
to get busted out.

614
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,173
This is how a guy like me
makes his living.

615
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,176
This is
my bread and butter.

616
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,678
When this is over
you're free to go.

617
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,681
You can go
anywhere you want.

618
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,184
Oh, for chrissake.

619
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,206
Anthony!
Dig!

620
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,217
Anthony!
Anthony, dig!

621
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,218
C'mon!
Anthony!

622
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,229
Oh, my god,
that was so exciting.

623
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,232
If i wouldn't
have banged my foot,
i would've came in second.

624
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,735
You were like
a fish out there.

625
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,237
Where's dad?

626
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,238
He couldn't
make it.

627
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,739
Oh.

628
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,740
He called, he had
a very important meeting,

629
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,741
he'll be here
next time.

630
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,243
This is the last meet
of the season.

631
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,746
Next year,
i mean.

632
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,748
Oh, okay.

633
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,762
Got a safe?

634
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,764
Yeah, why?

635
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,274
You want to pay
in advance?

636
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,775
There's a little over
400k in there.

637
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,277
I want you
to hold it for me.

638
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,280
This goes down,
i'm out of this area code.

639
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,782
My wife's gonna
come in here once a week
for an allowance.

640
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:10,288
You don't ask her any question
and you never ever refuse her.

641
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:14,292
She wants it all...
you give it to her.

642
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,295
But she won't do that,
carmela's smarter than that.

643
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,297
And if you're gone
longer than the money lasts?

644
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,300
Don't worry, you won't
have to go into your own kick.

645
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,304
This witness can't remain
nameless forever.

646
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,806
I didn't hear that.

647
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,315
Don't you got
school tomorrow?

648
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,317
So?

649
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,320
So, it's late,
go to bed.

650
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,823
Did you hear me?

651
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,332
I hope you
apologize to him.

652
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,833
For what?

653
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,337
Tony, you promised him
you were gonna
be at his swim meet.

654
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,838
Oh, shit,
i forgot.

655
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,840
How could
you forget?

656
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,842
Something
i had to do.

657
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,844
Tony, he almos
t came in second.

658
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,846
You should've seen his face
when you weren't there.

659
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,848
I saw his face
the other day

660
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,351
when he had to go to mall
when i wanted to
take him to movies.

661
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,852
What are you
six years old?

662
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,855
I said i'd try
to be there.

663
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,857
What is
with you, tony?

664
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,361
This whole week, you're like
an alien life- form among us.

665
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,864
There's nothing wrong.

666
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,866
Thank you
for sharing.

667
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,369
You know what?
Leave me the fuck alone.

668
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,870
I'm exhausted.

669
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,873
I'll make it up to him,
the swim meet.

670
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:36,874
So, where were you?

671
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,876
Did you go see christopher
at the hospital?

672
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,879
Yeah, i went to see
christopher at the hospital.

673
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,381
Wherever you were,

674
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,882
it couldn't have been
more important

675
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,884
than letting your son know
that you care about him!

676
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,387
No, only you care.

677
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,888
Fuck you.

678
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,889
No, fuck you!

679
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,391
Fuck you!

680
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,894
You fuck!

681
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,897
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

682
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,442
Hey.

683
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,445
My god, you scared
the shit out of me.

684
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,446
No.

685
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,949
Shut'em off.

686
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,452
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

687
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,954
I don't know.

688
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,956
I like the dark,
sit.

689
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,458
I gotta
go online.

690
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,459
Oh, c'mon.

691
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,961
Sit for a minute,
c'mon.

692
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,972
What's going on?

693
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,974
With what?

694
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,476
Whatever,
i don't know.

695
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,479
What's going on?

696
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,980
I just told you,
a chatroom.

697
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:28,486
Is that it?

698
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,490
You know i love you,
right, med?

699
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,491
Dad...

700
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,494
no, don't "dad" me,
c'mon.

701
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,996
I want to know.

702
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,998
Do you know
that i love you?

703
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,501
Yes.

704
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:48,005
I know
that you love me.

705
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,008
'Cause your mother doesn't
think i love you enough.

706
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,010
And you
listen to her?

707
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,018
Everything i do...

708
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:05,523
and everything i've done
and everything i will do...

709
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,526
it's all for you
and your brother,
you know that.

710
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,027
I think you should
go to bed.

711
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,030
I mean, i tell people,
you're like your mother, but...

712
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,536
you're all me,
nothing gets by you.

713
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,539
And i know you think
i'm a hypocrite.

714
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,042
I'm going to bed.

715
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:30,047
Alright,
go ahead.

716
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:35,052
Dad, why don't you
go to bed?

717
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,055
I'm gonna
finish my drink.

718
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,558
Okay.

719
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,059
Goodnight.

720
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,561
Goodnight, baby.

721
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,569
Sometimes...

722
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,571
we're all hypocrites.

723
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:05,583
Goodnight, baby.

724
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,585
Goodnight.

725
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,110
So, how are
you guys doing?

726
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,112
Anybody ready
for another sandwich?

727
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,114
You oughta go
into business with those.

728
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,115
Oh, stop it.

729
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,619
Thank you,
no, mrs. Carmela.

730
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,621
Yeah, i thought you might
be able to use this.

731
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,624
You said that ramone
backed over your old cooler
with the truck.

732
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,625
I lied.

733
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,627
I smelled those
sausages cooking

734
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,629
and i wanted you
to make me lunch.

735
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,130
You...

736
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,133
i guess i'm hungry
for a home- cooked meal.

737
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,136
My wife was
a gourmet cook.

738
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,639
Christine told me about her,
i'm so sorry.

739
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,141
Thank you.

740
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,149
So, listen, we were talking
about the powder room.

741
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,151
Do you have a minute
to take a look at it now?

742
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,152
I could kind o
f use some input.

743
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,654
Oh, yeah, sure.

744
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,163
The paper
that is in here now,

745
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:30,167
i think it kind of
closes the room in.

746
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,671
Yeah, i see what you mean,
it's the vertical striping.

747
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,672
Yeah.

748
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,673
Somebody even
talked me into

749
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,675
papering the back
of the door here.

750
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:42,680
I must've been
out of my mind.

751
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,684
Yeah, it's a lot
for the eye to handle

752
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,186
in such
a confined space.

753
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,189
So, what do you think,
should i just paint maybe,

754
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,191
or do something
sort of plainish?

755
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,695
Just grass cloth
maybe, or...?

756
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,697
Oh, jesus.

757
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,205
Oh, jesus,
mary and joseph.

758
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:09,707
I swear to god

759
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,708
i never did anything
like this in my life.

760
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,209
It's my fault,
i couldn't help it.

761
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,712
I never felt like this before,
not in years, maybe never.

762
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,714
Me, too, this will
never happen again.

763
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,715
No, of course not.

764
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,716
I apologize.

765
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,217
You should better
get back to work.

766
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:21,218
Yeah.

767
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,234
What about
little eric?

768
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,737
He has been
ripped from the arms

769
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,240
of the only mother
he has ever known.

770
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,744
You know how that
little boy loves you.

771
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:51,248
We cannot
let her do this.

772
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,751
Hey, uncle junior.

773
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,254
I thought you guys might like
some salami and eggs.

774
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,757
Always thinking.

775
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:03,761
My mother says
to send her love.

776
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,763
Put that stuff
in the bedroom.

777
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,264
Leave the sneakers.

778
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,266
Want to try them on?
They got lights on the bottom.

779
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,268
I don't wear
that shit.

780
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,771
I'm gonna give it to black kid
i let wash my car.

781
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,775
Poor prick, he wears a pair
that's wrapped with duct tape.

782
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,276
You're too good,
junior.

783
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:23,781
That's your problem.

784
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,783
Did she say
she was knocked up?

785
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,784
Who?

786
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,286
Fuck, i turn my head
one second

787
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,788
and they slip one
in on you.

788
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,790
She's a putana,
this one.

789
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,294
Fucked an arson investigator
last week.

790
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,296
Thank my nephew
for the stuff.

791
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,297
Your nephew?

792
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,800
This shit
comes from my end.

793
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,802
I'm sorry,
i take it back.

794
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,303
The sneakers
are from tony.

795
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,806
Cock.

796
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:53,310
You know, jun', it kills me
to sit back and watch.

797
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,312
Forget it.

798
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,814
No, finish what
you were gonna say.

799
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,315
I forgot already.

800
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,317
Then un- forget.

801
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,320
I can't not notice
that he's fucking you.

802
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,822
This scatino
bust out,

803
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,823
is like
a license to steal.

804
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,325
What's he
throwing your way?

805
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,326
Un gatz.

806
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,327
This garbage thing,

807
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,829
he's already taking
your townships.

808
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,330
Now he's fucking
with mine?

809
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:14,832
What am i supposed
to do about it?

810
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,333
I'm under indictment.

811
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,836
Sorry, junior, i don't want to
rip open old wounds, but...

812
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,838
i'm in no shape
for disharmony.

813
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,340
You and i both know
he's gotta go.

814
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,842
That's my nephew
you're talking about.

815
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,344
How dare you
in my own home!

816
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,345
C'mon junior,

817
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,847
this fucking guy
was supposed to be laid out

818
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,348
on midland avenue
a year ago.

819
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:31,849
I know it.

820
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:37,354
You know it.

821
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:43,360
Let me tell you
who's not a good kid.

822
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,362
That niece of mine.

823
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,864
I left my brother's house
one night

824
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:48,365
and my wallet
was light.

825
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:54,872
I'm talking about
a 10- year- girl here, richie.

826
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,375
A word to the wise,
that's all i'm saying.

827
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,914
Now for
the first time ever

828
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,416
you can make homemade sausage
and homemade pasta...

829
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,418
hi, grandma.

830
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,921
Your aunt forgot
to lock that door.

831
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,424
I told her i don't trust
that new mailman.

832
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,426
Guess what?

833
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,428
I got my answers
from colleges today.

834
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,431
Oh, yeah?
How'd you do?

835
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,935
Accepted at berkeley,

836
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,436

00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,438

boden, i didn't make it,
b. U. Accepted.

839
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,443
What about
that other place?

840
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,946
Um, georgetown.

841
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,449
Wait list.

842
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:19,456
You don't
owe them anything.

843
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,960
Thanks, grandma.

844
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,963
Oh, lock that door,
will you?

845
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,464
And for dessert,

846
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:34,471
the kids can make
their own chocolate pasta.

847
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,483
Hello?

848
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,485
Carmela,
vic.

849
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,487
Hi, how are you?

850
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,991
I'm good,
i'm fine.

851
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,994
I was just thinking
about you and...

852
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,496
and what happened
this morning.

853
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,497
And i just wanted
to say again--

854
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:05,502
oh please, please,
it was just a crazy thing.

855
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,005
But if it's a problem
for me to come back

856
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,506
i've got another job,

857
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,509
and yours is far enough along
that ramone can finish up.

858
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,012
So, there's
no charge to you,

859
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,014
except for materials.

860
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,016
No, no, no,
i wouldn't think of it.

861
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,518
It's just that,
you know,

862
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,521
since jill, there hasn't been
anyone to even talk to.

863
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,023
Oh, i know.

864
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,024
In fact--

865
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,026
what?

866
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,527
Well, i was thinking
maybe tomorrow

867
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,529
you could send ramone
to other job.

868
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,032
That way you and i would
have a chance to talk

869
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,535
on your lunch break
or something.

870
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,537
That would be
so great.

871
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,539
I could make
a lunch for us.

872
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,042
Maybe a du poulet?

873
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,045
Mesculin salad,

874
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,546
nice bottle
of barollo.

875
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,049
That sound
s incredible.

876
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,050
Okay.

877
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,551
Then thanks,
thanks for calling.

878
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,552
That's terrific.

879
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:56,553
Um...

880
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:57,554
see you tomorrow.

881
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,056
Yeah, i will talk to you
tomorrow then.

882
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,060
Bye, bye.

883
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,061
Who was that?

884
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,563
It was nobody,
the wallpaper man.

885
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,097
Oh, my god.

886
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,100
What?

887
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,601
Oh, my god,
please god, no.

888
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,103
What the hell is it?

889
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:49,606
"The victim has further been
identified as matthew bevilaqua,

890
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,109
a soprano
family associate."

891
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:57,614
Fuck,
give me that.

892
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,616
"Officials close
to the investigation

893
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,118
"are keeping
tight- lipped

894
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,619
as it may involve
a high ranking mafia member."

895
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:03,620
Oh, my god.

896
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,122
Where's that
detective's number?

897
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,123
On the fridge.

898
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:09,626
Those lying
cocksuckers.

899
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,627
Where on
the fridge?

900
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,129
On the fridge,
on the fridge!

901
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,130
Where on
the fucking fridge?

902
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,131
I knew it,
i knew it!

903
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:19,636
But you had to be
a big man!

904
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:24,641
Jesus christ, david,
where the hell have you been?

905
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,144
Thanks for coming,
thanks for coming.

906
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,645
I'm glad
you called me.

907
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,148
My sister's been
worried sick about you.

908
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,149
I know.

909
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:35,652
I'm sorry,
i should've called her.

910
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,655
How about i say i'm sorry
to the whole fucking world?

911
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,158
Rent the fuji blimp
or something?

912
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,160
Christine knows you're
gambling again, she told me.

913
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,662
Not gambling anymore,
i'm broke.

914
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,165
Jesus christ.

915
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,667
I screwed up, vic.

916
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,669
I screwed up really bad
this time.

917
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,671
Look, it's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be alright.

918
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,673
You're gonna go back
to gamblers anonymous,

919
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,175
we'll figure out
a payment plan

920
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:58,675
and we'll get you
back on your feet.

921
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,177
Gamblers anonymous.

922
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,179
You think it's a big joke,
but you're going back there.

923
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,680
Is that right?

924
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,183
Where the fuck were you when
i dropped out in first place?

925
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,685
I was just twisting
in the fucking wind out there.

926
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,186
What?!

927
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,187
Both of you!

928
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,688
With your fucking
broom up your asses.

929
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,690
You didn't
give a fuck.

930
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,692
You just fucking
looked the other way!

931
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,194
Now it's
our fault now?

932
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,695
Don't you ever talk
about christine like that, ever.

933
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,199
Fuck her!
Fuck you!

934
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,201
How much
did you lose?

935
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,203
How much?

936
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,205
How much did you
fucking lose?

937
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,706
Everything.

938
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,707
What do you mean
everything?

939
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,209
Everything, everything!

940
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,211
For chrissakes, vic,
everything,

941
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,214
the savings,
the business, everything.

942
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,722
You disgust me.

943
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,224
I have to go
chapter 11.

944
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,726
And then the liquidators
will come in

945
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:50,727
and they'll
pick through the bones.

946
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,728
This is it, david.

947
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,232
I fucking had it,
this is it.

948
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,234
As soon as eric
goes off to college,

949
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,236
by the way, he got
into georgetown today,

950
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,237
you probably didn't
know about that.

951
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,738
But as soon as that kid's
out of the house,

952
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,240
you're packing your bags

953
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:09,246
and you're keeping the fuck
away from my sister.

954
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:13,250
David, don't tell me
you blew eric's college fund.

955
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,259
Jesus christ.

956
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,262
Jesus.

957
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,763
You fucking asshole.

958
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,767
How could
you do that?

959
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,770
Jesus.

960
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,272
Well...

961
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,774
i'm paying for
that kid's education.

962
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:38,775
Thank you.

963
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,777
Thank you.

964
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:46,283
You're
a great man, vic.

965
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:50,787
Wait a minute.

966
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,290
How could you gamble
the business away?

967
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,791
It's in
my sister's name,
isn't it?

968
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,293
I didn't gamble it
away exactly.

969
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,296
What happened?

970
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,298
I got involved
with some bad people.

971
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:04,801
And i got in debt
to'em, and...

972
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,804
fucking tony soprano,
alright?

973
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,308
Yeah,
tony fucking soprano.

974
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,809
It's a bust out.

975
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,811
You get in debt to'em
where you can't pay'em,

976
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,313
they become
your partners

977
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:20,317
and then they fucking
eat through everything
like fucking termites.

978
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,319
What about
the cops?

979
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,821
They're animals, vic.

980
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,824
They started a fire
in my dumpster.

981
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,327
These two guys came
to see me one night.

982
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,830
You got no idea
what dead eyes means
until you face these people,

983
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:37,334
in your fucking bathrobe
and flip- flops.

984
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,343
France 1944...

985
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:50,847
general george patton lead
s his third army into battle.

986
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,349
He knows that
the controversies

987
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,852
that have swirled about him
have tarnished his reputation.

988
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,355
He desperately wants
to vindicate himself

989
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,357
in the only way
he knows how...

990
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,362
hello.

991
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,863
It's over, skip.

992
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:07,864
What do you mean?

993
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,367
You know that other party
who said he saw something

994
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,868
that we know
didn't happen?

995
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:14,371
Yeah.

996
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,373
He realizes now
he didn't see

997
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,375
what we know
didn't happen.

998
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,883
Yeah.

999
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,386
Sleep well,
my friend.

1000
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,888
...major strategy
is the attack.

1001
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,890
"The more germans we kill,

1002
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,394
the fewer of our own men
will be killed", he said.

1003
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,396
Patton's hatred for the enemy

1004
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,399
is matched only by his
fierce concern for his men.

1005
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,431
You seem relieved.

1006
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:15,932
Yeah.

1007
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,936
Yeah.

1008
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,439
So this person,
the witness,

1009
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:25,442
simply changed
his or her mind?

1010
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,943
I don't know
what happened.

1011
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,945
You don't?

1012
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:35,952
What's that
supposed to mean?

1013
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,454
You know,
when i was in italy

1014
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:41,458
i met somebody
that reminded me of you.

1015
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:42,959
A woman.

1016
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,462
And it's not
what you think.

1017
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,963
Like me
in what way?

1018
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,466
Smart.

1019
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,468
You know what
she said to me?

1020
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,469
What did she say?

1021
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,471
She told me that
i'm my own worst enemy.

1022
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,973
That's kind of a cliche,
isn't it?

1023
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:57,974
You had
to be there.

1024
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:03,480
She's one of them
witchy broads,
you know?

1025
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,981
Not like
a psychic, but...

1026
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,484
i didn't mean
to sound disparaging.

1027
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:12,489
That's some
ancient culture over there.

1028
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,992
They believe
all this weird shit...

1029
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:16,993
like sybils.

1030
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,495
Sybils?

1031
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,998
Like i said,
you had to be there.

1032
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,000
Okay, so,
i wanted to fuck her.

1033
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,503
But she was right,
what she said, right?

1034
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:27,504
I mean...

1035
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,506
i bring
all this on myself.

1036
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,509
I mean, that's what
you keep telling me.

1037
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:39,015
Yes, i suppose it is
at root.

1038
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,517
The question is...

1039
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,018
how do you stop?

1040
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,025
You know what?

1041
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,026
What?

1042
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,529
I dodged
a very big bullet.

1043
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:56,032
And i'm feeling pretty
fucking good about it.

1044
00:53:56,032 --> 00:54:01,037
So, i don't need anymore
psychiatry today.

1045
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,051
Hey, license
and registration pal.

1046
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,053
Hey, tony,
what are you doing here?

1047
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,061
I got something
for you.

1048
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,062
What is that?

1049
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,065
50 grand.

1050
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,067
Get the fuck out of here
with that.

1051
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,569
Why?

1052
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,570
Because
i'm a paraplegic?

1053
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,572
My idea was
for you to donate it

1054
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,074
to the spinal cord
injury foundation.

1055
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:41,578
I'm gonna
walk again, tony.

1056
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,580
I know you are, beans.

1057
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,083
But in the meantime you donate,
you get your picture up,

1058
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,585
inspire people
a little bit.

1059
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,087
Oh what, you mean be
like a fucking poster boy?

1060
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,589
Is that
what you mean?

1061
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:53,590
Just take the money,

1062
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,593
you can whack it u
p with the foundation.

1063
00:54:56,593 --> 00:55:01,097
Fuck you, tony.

1064
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:04,100
Take the money,
beans.

1065
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,603
You got to take it.

1066
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,104
Beansie...

1067
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,111
thank you.

1068
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,114
Thank you.

1069
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,116
Thank you, beans.

1070
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,138
Lilliana
can you get that?

1071
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:07,664
Ramone.

1072
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:11,668
Morning, mrs.

1073
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,669
Mr. Musta
no es come.

1074
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,170
Oh.

1075
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,172
Oh, is he okay?

1076
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,675
Yeah, but he has
to go to the other job.

1077
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,676
Oh.

1078
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,177
Okay.

1079
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,219
Want to steer?

1080
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,220
Yeah.

1081
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,221
No you don't.

1082
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,223
I do.

1083
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,726
I'd let you but
if the harbor master sees us,

1084
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,227
we get in
a lot of trouble.

1085
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,731
Nobody's gonna see.

1086
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,733
I don't know.

1087
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,234
C'mon.

1088
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,736
Go ahead.

1089
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,739
Now listen, driving a boat's
not like driving a car,

1090
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,240
'cause you got
no breaks to slam on,

1091
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,742
and you can't
make quick turns.

1092
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:28,745
So you got to anticipate
your turns a lot sooner.

1093
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,247
This is so cool.

1094
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,750
620 horsepower.

1095
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,265
Look out!

1096
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,267
Stop!

1097
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:57,273
Look out!
