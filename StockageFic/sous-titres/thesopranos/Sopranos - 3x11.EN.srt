13
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,153
I know we

00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,656

00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,158
i look everywhere
and i think i lost it.

16
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,160
I think it's
on the stugots.

17
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,662
Oh, okay.

18
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,164
Who is on the
boat with you?

19
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,166
I'll be sure
and tell him.

20
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,167
Alright.

21
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,170
Is your son okay?

22
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,672
Attendance shit.

23
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,173
Two weeks, not eve
n a kiss hello?

24
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,176
I'm sorry,
yeah.

25
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,683
How was morocco?

26
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,184
Great.

27
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,696
Listen...
that phone call...

28
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,698
it was an old
girlfriend.

29
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh, you mean she wasn't
from the school?

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,702
My god, she sounde
d so convincing!

31
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,704
I'm just trying
to be honest here.

32
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,706
If you're trying to be
honest, why'd you lie?

33
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,708
I didn't want
to piss you off.

34
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,209
So, it's really
more about you, then.

35
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,712
What are you talking
about? I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

36
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,714
No, what you said

37
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,216
was that you didn'
t want to piss me off,

38
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,218
which implies that
you'd have to deal with me,

39
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,222
which is more abou
t sparing you than m
y fucking feelings!

40
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,735
Merry christmas.

41
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,745
Let's go with
the satin finish.

42
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,247
Excuse me.

43
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,753
Hello.

44
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,254
Yeah, it's me.

45
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,257
You know that russki,
valery, works for slava?

46
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,760
He owes sil
five grand.

47
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,762
For that oth
er thing, you know.

48
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,764
I need you to go
pick it up tomorrow.

49
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,265
Why don't sil go?

50
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,267
I'm sending him home
, he's dying from the flu.

51
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,269
I didn't
hear you, ton'.

52
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,271
He's sick, he's
got the flu!

53
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,774
I'm supposed to take my mother
to social security tomorrow.

54
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,776
So, you do it after.

55
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,277
The guy's in fairlawn.

56
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,780
327 dexter avenue,
number six.

57
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,282
I don't even
know why we deal
with these people.

58
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,784
You wanna guess?

59
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,785
They make us money.

60
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,786
Thank you.

61
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,289
And the family's well?

62
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,292
Honestly, i'm
a little concerned
about our daughter.

63
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,294
What's the problem?

64
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,796
She's dating a boy...

65
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,800
the son of some friend
s of the family actually.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,802
I think i mentioned
him to you.

67
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,303
I don't know,

68
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,306
i guess i'm not
as optimistic
as i once was.

69
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,808
She was dating
a different boy,

70
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,810
a young
african- american man?

71
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,812
Yeah, they
broke up.

72
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,313
Actually he br
oke it off with her.

73
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,314
Believe that?

74
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,817
You didn't exactly give
him much choice, tony.

75
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,319
So now i'm responsible
for her being with jackie.

76
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,322
I'm just saying
that if you hadn't
been so mean to him

77
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,825
who knows, may
be she might not
be with this one.

78
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,333
I find it
very interesting

79
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,837
that you're able to ta
lk about this without rancor.

80
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,843
Actually we haven't been
arguing as much lately.

81
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,345
It's the therapy.

82
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,348
We're learning
how to communicate.

83
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,353
18 double word
score, that's 36.

84
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,856
No spanish.

85
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,358
Spanish?

86
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,359
Oh- bleek- ay?

87
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,861
Oblique.

88
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,363
Indirect, not
straightforward.

89
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,866
Come on, you're
in college.

90
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,368
I'm not an
english major.

91
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,386
As in, how'bout
giving me some?

92
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,388
Jackie, i'm sick.

93
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,891
I know, i'm
only kidding.

94
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,396
Unless you
want to.

95
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,398
Jackie.

96
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm kidding,
kidding.

97
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,411
Wanna do
some x?

98
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,413
I'm already
taking nyquil.

99
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,920
Tired?

100
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,421
Actually i am
kinda wiped.

101
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,924
Mind if we finish
this tomorrow?

102
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,925
Okay.

103
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,930
Wow, you'r
e burning up.

104
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,432
I'll come by tomorrow night
and bring you some echinacea.

105
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,935
You're leaving?

106
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,938
I better let you
get some sleep.

107
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,948
The russians?
They're not all bad.

108
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,950
How about the cuban
missile crisis?

109
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,953
Cocksuckers moved
nuclear warheads
into cuba,

110
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,955
pointed'em
right at us.

111
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,456
That was real?

112
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,959
I saw that movie,
i thought it
was bullshit.

113
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,963
Who is?

114
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,465
Kgb, openup.

115
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,978
We didn't
wake you, did we?

116
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,480
Or the other 30 people
who live here?

117
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,483
You want?

118
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,985
Little early, no?

119
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,993
Look at this shit, tv,

120
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,496
stereo, dvd.

121
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,503
The fuck's this?

122
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,005
Universal remote.

123
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,506
Universal remote.

124
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,009
Probably wiped your
ass bare handed

125
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,011
till you came to
this country.

126
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,513
So valery, you got
silvio's money?

127
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,515
Fucking silvio.

128
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,517
Watch it, comrade.

129
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,021
Money is on
entertainment center.

130
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,028
Better not be any
rubles in there.

131
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,530
Put remote on
docking station.

132
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,531
What?

133
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,534
Universal remote...

134
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,038
put down on
docking station.

135
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,040
Listen to this
prick giving orders.

136
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,543
You got some balls,
my friend.

137
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,545
Oops.

138
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,048
Paulie.

139
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,050
What? It was
an accident.

140
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,554
Ay, you want to fuck
here, cocksucker?

141
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,556
You come
to my house!

142
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,058
What'd you call me?

143
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,569
Paulie, paulie,
where the fuck are you?

144
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,105
What the fuck?
What'd you do?

145
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,107
What'd, i have
a choice?

146
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,610
I think he's dying.

147
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,612
Must've cracked
his windpipe.

148
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,114
That's it
for him.

149
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,615
What are you, a
fucking doctor now?

150
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,117
What are
we gonna do?

151
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,120
Pull the car around.

152
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,145
"I'm feeling
very sheepish."

153
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,152
About the other day.

154
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,155
I had no right to even
answer your phone.

155
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,158
It's alright.

156
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,661
I'm sorry
i lied.

157
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,163
You gonna open it?

158
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,184
It's beautiful.

159
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,685
It's from
morocco.

160
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,687
Yeah
mm- hmm.?

161
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,192
Now i feel like a jerk,
i got nothing for you.

162
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,194
Of course you do.

163
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,714
No, i gott
a see who this is.

164
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,215
Oh!

165
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,724
I gotta
take this.

166
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,226
Yeah.

167
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,727
Ton', it's me.

168
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,730
We saw that guy,
but we had a problem.

169
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,733
It got a
little physical.

170
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,736
You were just supposed
to pick up the money.

171
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,739
We did, but he started
giving us some shit.

172
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,741
The prick
sucker- punched me.

173
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:57,743
Hang on.

174
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,744
What?

175
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,246
Hang on.

176
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,254
Where are you now?

177
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,256
Rest sto
p, garden state.

178
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,759
Where's the guy?

179
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,761
With the luggage.

180
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,263
Are you fucking
kidding me?

181
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,765
You're breaking up,
i can't hear you.

182
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,768
I said, are you
fucking kidding me?

183
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,770
It got bad, t,
we had no choice.

184
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,772
I'm supposed to
meet slava later.

185
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,274
What the fuck
am i supposed
to say to him?

186
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,277
It's okay,
nobody was around.

187
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,779
What do you
wanna do?

188
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,783
You use your
own judgment.

189
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,785
But whatever
you decide,

190
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,288
you do it way the
fuck away from me,
you understand?

191
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,291
Motherfucker!

192
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,295
That was a big
waste of water.

193
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,797
Look, it was just
some work shit, okay?

194
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,802
You got ti
me for lunch?

195
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,805
You are my lunch.

196
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,808
I gotta get back.

197
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,310
How'bout dinner?

198
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,812
What do you
got in mind?

199
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,316
9:00, my house.

200
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,818
You like
london broil?

201
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,321
Yeah.

202
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,827
We could dump him
down the shore.

203
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,830
It's too light out
, we should wait.

204
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,335
They got a roy roger
s over there, you hungry?

205
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,337
First thing's
first, chrissy.

206
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,340
I know, i'm just sayin
g, i didn't eat breakfast.

207
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,342
Most important meal.

208
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,847
How you doing?

209
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,851
Let's take him down
to pine barrens.

210
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,353
That's south jersey.

211
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,854
It's perfect,

212
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,856
it's fuckin'
deserted down there.

213
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,359
We take him in the
woods, dig a hole,

214
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,860
end of story.

215
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,862
With fuckin' snow
all over the ground?

216
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,864
That's some
hard shit.

217
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,868
I got a shovel i use
for digging the car out.

218
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,371
Best part is, we'll be
like 20 minutes from a. C.

219
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,874
We can get a
room, freshen up,
little blackjack.

220
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,876
Fuck that, i gotta
eat something.

221
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,878
We'll go to morton's,
have a steak.

222
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,381
This way the day
won't be a total loss.

223
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,888
Things with you and carmel
a seem to be going well.

224
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,391
It's the therapy.

225
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,903
Look, i'm gonna
be honest with you.

226
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,409
I'm seeing somebody.

227
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,911
A patient of yours.

228
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,416
Gloria trillo.

229
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,419
Why gloria?

230
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,920
Why not?

231
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,423
She's smart, she's
sexy, she's italian.

232
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,924
Italian?

233
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,926
Stick to your own
kind, you know.

234
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,431
What is this,"west
side story" now?

235
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,434
Do you think havin
g met her in therapy

236
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,436
holds any
significance?

237
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,438
Maybe she reminds
me of you.

238
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,440
Okay.

239
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,441
How?

240
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,943
Smart, sexy,

241
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,445
she's italian.

242
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,450
She's actually
nothing like you.

243
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,952
Well...

244
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,455
maybe a little.

245
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:30,456
Who else then?

246
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,957
You both
got great legs.

247
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,959
Keep joking,
it's your dime.

248
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,461
Don't get jealous.

249
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,463
It was your fault we
met in the first place.

250
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,465
The scheduling
mix- up?

251
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,468
Point is, she
makes me happy.

252
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,474
Does she seem
happy to you?

253
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,975
When she's with me.

254
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,977
And you know what?

255
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,480
So am i.

256
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,486
Do you think lying
to carmela in therapy

257
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,988
is the best thing for
your panic attacks?

258
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,490
Things are going good
between me and carm,

259
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,492
you said so yourself.

260
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,993
Yeah, it's all
predicated on a lie.

261
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,497
Predicated on my ass,
what's the difference?

262
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,499
I'm content,
i'm relaxed.

263
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,502
The bottom line is
i'm a better husband
and a better father.

264
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,505
If you wanna
know the truth...

265
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,507
as much as i
love my wife,

266
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,009
being with gloria
makes me happier

267
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,512
than all your prozac
and your therapy bullshit

268
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,013
combined.

269
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,557
What do
you think?

270
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,059
I think we
should've ate.

271
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,061
Ya!

272
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,067
Cocksucker's
still alive!

273
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,571
Look at
this, he chewed
through the tape.

274
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,574
Fuckin
g piece shit!

275
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,076
Keep hollerin', i'
ll put one in your head.

276
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,078
Fuck you
fucking mother!

277
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,082
Get the shovel,
chrissy.

278
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,607
Fuckin' freezing
out here.

279
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,608
Hey asshole,

280
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,610
don't you know better
than to wear pajamas

281
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,612
in the middle
of winter?

282
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,117
Think this is
far enough?

283
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,118
It'll do.

284
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,622
The fuck
you doing?

285
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,625
You think we're
digging the hole?

286
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,126
That's right,
shit- head,

287
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,128
get to work.

288
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,130
I know
the ground's
kinda hard,

289
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,633
but give it some of
that siberian action.

290
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,636
Shut up.

291
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,652
The fuck's
he saying?

292
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,153
Who gives
a shit.

293
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,655
Keep digging.

294
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,658
Not that it
matters now,

295
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,661
but we didn't come to
your house to kill you.

296
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,163
That mouth
of yours,

297
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,667
you gotta learn to
shut the fuck up.

298
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,169
So, how far is
it to atlantic city?

299
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,181
Motherfucker!

300
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,189
Ah, fuck!

301
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,713
What the fuck?

302
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,715
I got him,
didn't i?

303
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,717
Yeah,
fuck!

304
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,218
Maybe he's
stunned.

305
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,735
How bad is it?

306
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,237
Couple of stitches,
hang on,

307
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,239
we'll finish him up,
we'll cover him with snow.

308
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,241
You see which
way he went?

309
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,743
He's gotta
be close.

310
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,245
Half his head's
probably hanging off.

311
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,247
There's some blood
over there.

312
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,756
Where is
this prick?

313
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,758
You sure i hit
him in the head?

314
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,761
Yeah, fuckin'
positive.

315
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,763
I don't see
any more blood.

316
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,765
It's like the
trail just ended.

317
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,285
Are you gonna be
home for dinner?

318
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,787
Yeah.

319
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,289
Alright, i'm going
to the market.

320
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,294
Maybe it's like
when you cut the
head off a chicken,

321
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,796
how they
keep runnin'.

322
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,301
Fuckin'
believe this?

323
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:18,804
Hello?

324
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,305
Where the fuck
you been?

325
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,807
We're down the
pine barrens.

326
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,308
Did you wrap
the package?

327
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,810
Not yet.

328
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,312
We were abou
t to, we had a
little problem.

329
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,815
What problem?

330
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,818
The package hit
chrissy with an
implement and ran off.

331
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,819
Ran off?

332
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,822
I thought you said
it was, you know...

333
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,323
we thought it was, t.

334
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,325
It's complicated, we'r
e looking for it now.

335
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,327
I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

336
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,329
I said we're
looking for it.

337
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,832
It's like she gets sciatica,
the whole world grinds--

338
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,834
...could surive?

339
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,836
The package?

340
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,838
Is there any way the
package could survive?

341
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:53,839
Ton'!

342
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,340
Goddamnit!

343
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,842
Is there any
way the package
could survive?

344
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,344
No t, no
fucking way.

345
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,346
It's my life and i
'll live it any way i please.

346
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,348
Cocksucker!

347
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,349
What?

348
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,851
I got a meeting
with slava!

349
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,854
I could be
walking into a
fuckin' buzzsaw!

350
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,857
T, hello?

351
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,859
Fuck.

352
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,360
What'd he say?

353
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,862
I dunno,

354
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,864
he's all fucking worri
ed about this slava asshole.

355
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,366
I know we're doing
work with this guy.

356
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,869
But you gotta wonder
what tony's got going.

357
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,871
None of our fuckin'
business, is it?

358
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,873
I'm a fucking
captain.

359
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,875
You got a match?

360
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,376
My lighter's
in the car.

361
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,878
Mine, too.

362
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,383
I'm not dressed
for this shit.

363
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,887
He's gotta be dead
by now, right?

364
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,890
How could
he not be?

365
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,892
Fuck it,
let's just go.

366
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,894
Squirrels will
eat him anyway.

367
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,896
Where'd we park?

368
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,898
Back there, half
a mile or so.

369
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,901
You sure? 'cause
i thought we kinda
looped around.

370
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,903
Four years in
the army, kid.

371
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,406
We just follow our
own footprints, c'mon.

372
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,425
Wait a minute.

373
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,427
We walked
in a circle.

374
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,430
How's that
fuckin' possible?

375
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,933
Alright, let's
reason this out.

376
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,434
We were
driving south

377
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,937
and the sun's
setting there.

378
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,438
What good's
that do us?

379
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,440
At least we know wha
t direction we're headed.

380
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,442
Yeah, but we're
still fuckin' lost!

381
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,443
We're not lost.

382
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,945
Stop getting cunty.

383
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,453
Slava.

384
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,455
Tony.

385
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,457
Tony, come in.

386
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,959
Come in.

387
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,961
My daughte
r ilana.

388
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,462
Say hello
to mr. Soprano.

389
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,463
Hello.

390
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,965
How you doing?

391
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,967
Go to drugstor
e, buy some candy.

392
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,973
Beautiful girl.

393
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,975
Brilliant student.

394
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,978
One day she goes to
harvard in massachusetts,

395
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,980
maybe.

396
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,988
Family...

397
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,490
nothing is
more important.

398
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,492
That's why you
gotta plan ahead.

399
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,494
There's 200
in here.

400
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:30,495
Okay.

401
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,499
Same drill
, to isle of man,

402
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,502
four days,
clean as whistle.

403
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,006
We drink.

404
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:53,018
So, where's
your friend?

405
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,020
Valery?

406
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,522
Who knows?

407
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,524
He give silvio
the money, yes?

408
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,026
'Cause i told him.

409
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,527
I don't know,
i wasn't there.

410
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,029
Salut.

411
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,039
Ho, that's you and
him, ain't it?

412
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,546
He was like
brother to me...

413
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,050
closer than brother.

414
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,055
But now he's
tragic figure.

415
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,057
What do you mean?

416
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,059
The alcohol,
the drugs.

417
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,062
Disgraces to
his family.

418
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,065
He breaks my heart.

419
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,071
Maybe you could
send him to a. A.

420
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,076
In chechnya he
saves my life.

421
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,585
You're...

422
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,588
very emotional.

423
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,594
I would do
anything for him.

424
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,603
Take it ea
sy, we'll find it.

425
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,105
I'm dizzy,

426
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,107
my fuckin' head
is killing me.

427
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,610
Hello?

428
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,612
It's a bad connectio
n so i'm gonna talk fast.

429
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,116
The guy you're looking
for is some kind of
ex- commando or some shit.

430
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,119
He killed 16 chechen
rebels single handed.

431
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,120
T?

432
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,122
T, that you?

433
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,124
Ah, damnit.

434
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,626
I didn't hear
what you said, ton'.

435
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,129
It's a bad connection,
so i'm gonna talk fast.

436
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,630
The guy you're looking
for is an ex- commando.

437
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,632
He killed 16 chechen
rebels single handed.

438
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,634
Get the fu
ck outta here.

439
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,635
Yeah, nice, huh?

440
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,637
He was with the
interior ministry.

441
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,140
Guy's some kind of
russian green beret.

442
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,643
This guy
cannot come back

443
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,646
to tell this story,
you understand?

444
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,148
I hear you.

445
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,649
I'm serious, paulie.

446
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,151
Ton'?

447
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,653
Ton', you there?

448
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,655
Goddamn--
fuck!

449
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,657
Call me back!

450
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,162
You're not gonna
believe this.

451
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,165
He killed
16 czechoslovakians.

452
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,668
Guy was an
interior decorator.

453
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,171
His house
looked like shit.

454
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,686
Didn't you
hear it?

455
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,688
Twig snappin'.

456
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,191
You said yourself
i hit him in the head.

457
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,693
Fuckin' rasputin,
this guy.

458
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,200
See?

459
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,203
C'mon, he's
running.

460
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:11,716
Oh!

461
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,718
Oh, fuck!

462
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,221
Fucking cunt!

463
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,729
Paulie, come on,
i think i got him!

464
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,244
If we were trying
we wouldn't have
come close.

465
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,747
I lost my shoe.

466
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,759
Hello?

467
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,260
It's me.

468
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,761
How you feeling?

469
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,762
Like shit.

470
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,264
When are you
coming over?

471
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,266
I gotta get my mother's
car inspected.

472
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:02,767
At night?

473
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,269
My friend's
a mechanic.

474
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,271
It's the only time
he can do it.

475
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,773
I'm so bummed,
i really miss you.

476
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,276
Can't you do
it tomorrow?

477
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,277
I can't.

478
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,278
My mother
needs thecar

479
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,280
and i gotta move all o
f dov's shit out of here.

480
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,283
I'll call
you later, okay?

481
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,784
Yeah, okay, bye.

482
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,286
This is no
fucking joke here.

483
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,789
I coul
d lose a foot.

484
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,290
It's numb, huh?

485
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,292
The fuck
you think?

486
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,296
How coul
d we be lost
like this?

487
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,799
We're in fucking
new jersey.

488
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,301
South jersey.

489
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,804
Maybe we should eat
some of these berries.

490
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,305
Are you nuts?

491
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,307
Shit like that
could be poisonous
, you don't know.

492
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,309
C'mon.

493
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,315
The fuck's that?

494
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,319
Looks like
a truck.

495
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,324
Ah!

496
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,827
There's fuckin' gravel
under this snow!

497
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,831
The back wheels
are gone.

498
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,342
Thank you, god!

499
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,845
My fucking ears
feel like they're
gonna fall off.

500
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,346
Fuck your ears.

501
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,849
Get me something
for my foot!

502
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,355
Ooh.

503
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,860
Jesus, that pr
ick really brained me.

504
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:14,365
I gotta sit with m
y foot under my thigh.

505
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,368
Use my own body heat,
that's the trick.

506
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,879
What if this guy's
not dead, paulie?

507
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,880
He's fucking dead.

508
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,382
I know, but 16
czechoslovakians!

509
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,384
He's trained
for this shit.

510
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,887
That's like
"die hard" shit.

511
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,392
I heard on the news
it's supposed to s
now again later this week.

512
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,394
You know the weather
report in mexico?

513
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,896
Chili today,
hot tamale?

514
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,898
You heard it
before?

515
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,899
Hmm.

516
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,400
It's an old
joke, a. J.

517
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,903
Egon kosma said
he made it up.

518
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,411
What's the matter,
you're not hungry?

519
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,414
Late lunch.

520
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,933
Could be him out
there, stalking us.

521
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,435
With wha
t, his cock?

522
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,437
Think about
it, chrissy.

523
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:27,939
Even if he's alive,

524
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,441
he's unarmed
and bleeding
like a sieve.

525
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,444
He's in the woods,
he's in his pajamas.

526
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,446
It's the fucking
yukon out there.

527
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,948
Probably thinks
we left anyway.

528
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,950
If he's alive,
which he ain't!

529
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,960
What's that?

530
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,961
Nathan's bag.

531
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,963
There's some
ketchups and shit.

532
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,965
They clean?

533
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,466
I dunno, they
were in the bag.

534
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,969
They were a little
half- way frozen.

535
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,471
Fuck it,
gimme some.

536
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,472
Here.

537
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,986
Not bad.

538
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,487
Mix it with
the relish.

539
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,491
It's nana
and grandpa.

00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,501
I may need
an operation.

544
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,003
Oh, my god.

545
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,006
C'mon,

546
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,008
You hungry,

547
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,510
Who could eat after
news like that?

548
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,512
I'll make
some coffee.

549
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,018

That's really
fuckin' great.

556
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,532
That language,
is that necessary?

557
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,035
Listen ton',

558
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,537

I lost my shoe.

560
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,541
We found
some old truck.

561
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,043
A truck.

562
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,045
I don't know what the fuck

You stay there till

your nephew,

574
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,066

00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,567
That's all
i'm gonna say.

576
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,070
I thought the guy
sucker punched you.

577
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,071
He did.

578
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,572

580
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,087
You're having
coffee, right?

581
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,092

00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,601

589
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,645
If i wanted to be treated

590
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,647
I'm sorry.

591
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,151
Something came up.

592
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,153
Dinner is
fucking ruined.

593
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,158
We'll go out.

594
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,164
Anywhere
you want.

595
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,667
C'mon, don't
be like that.

596
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,170
Inconsiderate prick.

597
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,672
I said i
was sorry.

598
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,677
It was
family shit.

599
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,680
It couldn't
be avoided.

600
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,685
Let me make it
up to you.

601
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,189
You were supposed
to be here three
hours ago.

602
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,691
I know.

603
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,194
I'm here now

604
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,198
Hmm?

605
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,229
This is fucking
bullshit!

606
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,233
It was silvio's
money, he should've
got it himself!

607
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,736
Cocksucker got
the sniffles,

608
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,738
and we're
stuck out here!

609
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,240
You shouldn't
have hit the guy.

610
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,742
I shouldn't have
even been there!

611
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,245
Fuckin' insult

612
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,247

me this shit,
your uncle.

613
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,249
Yeah, blame
tony now.

614
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,751
You had to hear him
on the phone before.

615
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,254
Talking to me
like a child.

616
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,257
You have any idea
the money i made for
him over the years?

617
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,259
Or his old man
before him?

618
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,262
He's living like
a fucking king

619
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,765
and now all i hear about
is cocksucker ralphie.

620
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,268
I'm going to sleep.

621
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,770
Let me get some
of that carpet.

622
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,780
I been working
on a plan.

623
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,283
A plan?

624
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,784
We're in a
truck, right?

625
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,786
It had to get
here somehow,

626
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,288
there's gotta
be a road out.

627
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,790
It's grown over,
it stops at
those trees.

628
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,293
Give me your shoes,
i can go get help.

629
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,295
Fuck you,
you're not
leaving me here.

630
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,796
You don't trust me?

631
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,298
It's stupid,

632
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,799
And what's
your fucking plan?

633
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,800

634
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,302

637
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,813
Calling tony again.

638
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,814
You're gonna
piss him

639
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:44,815
Fuck him!

640
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,317

641
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,329
Oh, fuck!

642
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,832

643
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:02,833
It's me.

644
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,335
What now?

645
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,836
What now?

646
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,838
Chrissy's head is bleeding
and i'm freezing to death,

647
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,839
that's what's
fucking now.

648
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,341
Hey, take it easy!

649
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,842
I'm through
taking it easy.

650
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,344
We're fucking
starving out here.

651
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,845
What do you want
me to do about it?

652
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,847
Come fucking

653
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,350
You don't even know
where the fuck you are!

654

Exit 12.

655
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:21,352

656
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,354
Exit fuckin' 12.

657
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,355
Pike's hollow
or some shit.

658
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,856
Pike's hollow.

659
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,858
There's a dirt roa
d at the turnoff.

660
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,360
We're parked
about a mile in

661
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,861
near some
picnic tables.

662
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,863
And when i find the
car, then what?

663
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,865
I don't know,
start yellin'!

664
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:35,866
We're in a truck.

665
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,869
That dirt road might be
the same one we're on.

666
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,872
Put my nephew
on the phone.

667
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,376

668
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,877

Are you alright?

670
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,880
I don't know, my
head's killing me.

671
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,382
I can't hear you.

672
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,384
My head hurts,
i think i got
a concussion.

673
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,387
Alright,
just stay calm.

674
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,389
Bring some food,

675
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,890

ng shoes, too.

676
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,893
Alright,

677
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,900
I gotta go.

678
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,402
What, are you
kidding me?

679
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,903
It's an emergency.

680
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,906
What do you
want from me?

681
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,409
What do you
think, i'm some
fucking whore?

682
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,910
Just calm down.

683
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,912
You think you're
just gonna come over
here and fuck me?

684
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,415
You know what?
I don't got time
for this shit.

685
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,917
Oh, now you're gonna leave,
you low- life piece of shit!

686
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:27,918
You know
what? Here!

687
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,920
Take your
fucking dinner!

688
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,937
I fucking
hate you!

689
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,454
I know he's
cheating on me.

690
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,456
I could hear it
in his voice.

691
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,458
Car inspection?

692
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,959
It's bullshit.

693
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,467
What if he's
not though?

694
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,969
Doing this would make
me as bad as he is.

695
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,972
Maybe we
should go.

696
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,480
Hey.

697
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,482
Sorry i had
to wake you.

698
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,485
Fucking chemo.

699
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,987
I'm awake throwing
up half the night anyway.

700
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,490
Did you
call bobby?

701
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,492
He's on his way.

702
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,995
What've you
been eating, steak?

703
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,497
No--

704
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,499
i dunno.

705
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,502
I need to
borrow a shirt.

706
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,503
You want
some tea?

707
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,004
No.

708
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,524
Fuck this!

709
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,527
Where you going?

710
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,530
It's not bad enough
you wake me in the
middle of the night.

711
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,032
I gotta get my balls
broken too?

712
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,535
Go with my nephew,
do what he says.

713
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,541
I gotta
change my shirt.

714
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,046
I got my limits
too, jr.

715
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,053
Be strong.

716
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,062
You have a good time?

717
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,564
Me, too.

718
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,567
What are you
doing tomorrow?

719
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,570
Yeah, of

720
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,572
I can't believe
you did this to me.

721
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,574
What are you
doing here?

722
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,575
I loved you.

723
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,576
Who the hell
are you?

724
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,077
Fuck you,
bitch.

725
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,078
What'd you say?

726
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,580
Don't ever
call me again!

727
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,081
Meadow, wait.

728
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,086
Yeah, you better
leave, bitch!

729
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,092
What the fuck is the
matter with you?

730
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,594
That's tony soprano's
daughter!

731
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,096
Oh, what do
i care, asshole?

732
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,599
Fuckin' bitch.

733
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,100
Goddamnit!

734
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,606
You really know
about this shit?

735
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,108
The woods
and hunting?

736
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,111
My dad and me used
to go every year.

737
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,617
I'm sorry i laughe
d at you before.

738
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,119
It's alright.

739
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,122
One time we
went hunting...

740
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,626
we saw a sign that
said,"bear left,"

741
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,628
so we went home.

742
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:08,138
I want you to know
i appreciate you
taking care of my uncle.

743
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,140
Yeah, i know.

744
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,144
He really loves you,
you know that?

745
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,646
C'mon, that old prick?

746
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,147
I'm serious.

747
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,149
He talks about
you all the time.

748
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,653
I know you had your
problems but, i dunno...

749
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,157
i wish he was my
uncle sometimes.

750
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,173
What time is it?

751
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:48,679
4:30.

752
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,685
Where the
fuck is he?

753
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,689
What are those,
tic- tacs?

754
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,691
I just found'em.

755
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,192
I didn't know
i had'em on me.

756
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,194
You had tic- tacs all
along? Give me some!

757
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,697
There ain't no
more, i ate'em.

758
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,198
Selfish prick,
i'm dying here!

759
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,700
Then fucking
die already.

760
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,202
Where you going
? don't go out there!

761
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,704
I'm eating
those berries.

762
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,205
I'm telling you,
they're poison!

763
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,207
I don't give a
shit, at least i
won't die hungry.

764
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,232
You sure this is
the right place?

765
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,734
Yeah,
pike's hollow.

766
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,736
One mile in, by
the picnic table.

767
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,237
Where's their
car, though?

768
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,239
Maybe they left.

769
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,741
They wouldn't leave
without calling.

770
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,243
Let me try
him again.

771
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,754
Tony?

772
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:07,758

777
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,771
I don't know!

778
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,781
Ho!

779
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,283
Do that by
your own window!

780
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,785
I don't wanna
smell your piss.

781
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:35,786
Fuck you.

782
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,287

00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,801

00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,303
You thin

792
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,806
I heard you on
the phone trying to
blame this on me.

793
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,809

I'll leave you

Yeah, i do.

806
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,353
Promise me you won't

00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,368
Paulie!

809
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,871
Christopher!

810
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,375
What do you think,
what should we do?

811
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,377
There's nothing
we can do.

812
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,880
We'll wait
till it's light,

813
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,882
then we'll
head in.

814
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,393
1- 0- 1.

815
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,395
Let's get some
fluids in you,

816
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,897
we'll send you
home later.

817
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,401
Oh, my god,
are you okay?

818
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,905
She was out
all night, i
couldn't stop her.

819
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,406
It's over.

820
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,409
He was cheating on me.

821
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,911
Holy shit.

822
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,413
We drove out
to jersey,

823
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,915
i caught them together.

824
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,917
She was a real
whore, too.

825
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,919
Oh, my god.

826
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,921
That's horrible.

827
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,923
It's all
my fault.

828
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,425
I shouldn't
have pressured
him like that.

829
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,427
You're bet
ter off without
him, meadow.

830
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,428
I mean
, he was cute,

831
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,430
but he was
really boring.

832
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,432
You didn't know
him like i did.

833
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,434
You don't know what it's like
to grow up where we did!

834
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,937
Whatever, mead,
he was such a drip.

835
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,439
No, me wasn't,
he was great!

836
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,461
Bruno magli

837
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,986
Which way, wha
t do you think?

838
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,988
Don't matter
to me.

839
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,490
I ain't stopping
till we hit cement.

840
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,007
A lotta strange
people used to
live in these woods.

841
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,509
Jackson whites,

842
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,512

looking albinos.

843
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,016
Paulie!

844
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,518

845
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,524
First place i'm

00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,026
I know.

847
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,528
Get like five of those
grand slam breakfasts.

848
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,534
Shit!

849
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,038
What's the matter?

850
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:51,041
Fucking thing'

851
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,555
Motherfucker!

852
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,562
What are
you doing?

853
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,065
What if we need
the bullets?

854
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,067
That's n
o deer hunter.

855
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,569
Paulie!

856
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,570
Christopher!

857
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,580
Tony!

858
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,581
Over here!

859
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,584
Over here!

860
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,586
Paulie!
Christopher!

861
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,088
Where are you?

862
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,593
Over here, tony!

863
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,108
Thank fuckin' god!

864
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,111
You guys

865
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,613
What the f
uck you shootin' at?

866
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,615
Nothing,
never mind.

867
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,118
Jesus christ,
look at you two!

868
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,121
All night in this
fuckin' hell hole.

869
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,124
Alright, c'mon.

870
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,129
C'mon, easy.

871
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,144
Is this
the spot?

872
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,645
Yeah, but...

873
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,647
my fucking
car's gone.

874
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,150
You sure this is
where you left it?

875
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,651
I'm positive.

876
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,653
Is the
heat on?

877
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,165
Jesus christ, i
can't feel my toes.

878
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,167
You got any
blankets?

879
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,668
No, sorry.

880
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,170
Turn up the
heat, huh?

881
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,175
I can't
believe it,

882
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,677
i fuckin'
loved that car.

883
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,179
Probably kids
or something.

884
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,680
What if it
was the guy?

885
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,684
You got the money?

886
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,189
It was in the car.

887
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,191
That's all i asked
you to do, paulie.

888
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,693
I'm sorry, t, it
couldn't be helped.

889
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,196
The guy fuckin'
lunged at us.

890
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,203
Listen, ton', i know
i fucked up, but--

891
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,705
it's okay,
really.

892
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,207
Just forget it.

893
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,211
What do you think,

894
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,713
you wanna look for
this guy or what?

895
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,215
You tell me.

896
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:46,716
Is it worth it?

897
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,717
I hit him in
the head, ton'.

898
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,719
I saw it with
my own eyes.

899
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,723
Is it possible this fu
ck made it outta here alive?

900
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,225
It's hard to say.

901
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,228
Flesh wound maybe,
head shot, i don't know.

902
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,231
On the other hand,
anything's possible.

903
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,238
You're a captain,

904
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,240
what do you wanna do?

905
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,254
Fuck it,
let's go home.

906
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,256
Alright.

907
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,259
But let's be clear
on this right now.

908
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,761
If this cocksucker
crawls out from
under a rock

909
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,264
he's your problem,
not mine.

910
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,266
You deal with slava,
you take the heat,

911
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,268
you pay the price.

912
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,270
Capisce?

913
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:43,773
Fine.

914
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:14,304
You got mayonnaise
on your chin.

915
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,805
What?

916
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,808
Mayonnaise,
mayonnaise!

917
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,342
I'm telling
you, something's
fucked up here.

918
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:53,343
Because one minute
she's fine,

919
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,346
next minute she's a
fuckin' lunatic!

920
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,848
I asked you
whether or not

921
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,850
she seemed like
a happy person.

922
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,352
Oh, and by tha
t i'm supposed to know

923
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,854
she's gonna throw
a fuckin' roast
beef at my head?

924
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,859
Read into things
however you choose.

925
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:18,368
Why does everything
gotta be so hard?

926
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,871
I'm not saying
i'm perfect,

927
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,374
but i do the right
thing by my family.

928
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,878
Doesn't that
count for anything?

929
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,884
I think we
should discuss

930
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,387
what attracted you to
gloria in the first place.

931
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,389
We been through
that already.

932
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:43,393
And irina
before her.

933
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,896
Depressive
personality,
unstable,

934
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,399
impossible to please.

935
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:55,905
Does that remind you
of any other woman?
