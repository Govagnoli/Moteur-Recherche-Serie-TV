1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,729
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,287
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,768
Sir Thomas Boleyn, you are,
by order and permission...

4
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,800
...of His Majesty, King Henry
today created Lord Rochford.

5
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,244
Arise, my lord.

6
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,929
Majesty.

7
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,399
Henry Fitzroy.

8
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,401
Henry Fitzroy, you are, by order
and permission of His Majesty...

9
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,963
...King Henry, today created
Duke of Richmond and of Somerset...

10
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,883
...and Earl of Nottingham.

11
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,480
Arise, Your Grace.

12
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,560
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey.

13
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,438
Your Majesty.

14
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,726
I see His Majesty's bastard son
is made a duke.

15
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,199
Does this mean he is next in rank
to His Majesty?

16
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,644
Next in line to the throne?

17
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,410
Above my daughter?

18
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,763
Yes. Technically.

19
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:49,402
He is set above all others,
except for a legitimate son.

20
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,878
His Majesty loves our daughter.

21
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,641
He has shown it on many occasions.

22
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,559
I cannot believe he wishes to place
his bastard child above her.

23
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,601
I do not believe...

24
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,362
...that His Majesty...

25
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,288
...was personally responsible
for this action.

26
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,602
After all, our daughter
is engaged to the emperor.

27
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,839
Then Your Majesty has not heard?

28
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,125
The emperor has married
Princess Isabella of Portugal.

29
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,683
Apparently he decided it was not worth
waiting for your daughter to grow up.

30
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,404
Who is to say, perhaps
he was influenced by the fact...

31
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,083
...that the beautiful Isabella brought
with her a dowry of 1 million pounds.

32
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,766
He broke his word.

33
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,288
My Lord.

34
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,402
How your tok ens
and signs of affection frighten me.

35
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,249
How can I be to you
what you think me to be?

36
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,489
You know I am a commoner
and think myself unworthy of your love.

37
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,126
Though the offer of it and the passion
of Your Majesty's words and looks...

38
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,400
...touch both my heart and soul.

39
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,842
"You have flattered me with so many
and such wondrous gifts.

40
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,087
Allow me to send you
this token in return.

41
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,679
Small though it is.

42
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,724
And allow me to remain,
in all things...

43
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,446
...your ever-loving servant. Anne."

44
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,089
Your Grace.

45
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,649
Mama.

46
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,969
Now, Henry, listen to me.

47
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,962
You are going to own
your own house now.

48
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,401
You'll have lots of servants
to help you and look after you.

49
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,162
But you must promise me
to be a good boy.

50
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,806
And thoughtful and kind
to those around you.

51
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,680
You may be set above them...

52
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,205
...but if I find you have grown
too proud, I will be sad and displeased.

53
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,486
Yes, Mama. I promise.

54
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,918
And I promise I'll come
and see you as often as I can.

55
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,281
And I'm sure your new house
will be very grand.

56
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,201
I love you, my darling boy.

57
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,568
I love you.

58
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,285
Do you think they were suspicious?
Ever?

59
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,765
Of course they were suspicious.

60
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,284
Didn't you see the way
his servants looked at you?

61
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,448
But his son was overjoyed.

62
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,199
I mean, His Majesty was overjoyed.

63
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,123
After all, he had waited
many years for the crown.

64
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,370
The old man had hung on grimly.

65
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,364
You need not tell me about that.

66
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,648
What are we going to do?

67
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,159
- Isn't this enough?
- No.

68
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,646
Well, yes. And no.

69
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,523
I shall come to England eventually.

70
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,163
Marry me.

71
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,598
What?

72
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,045
You heard me.

73
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,842
Marry me.

74
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,958
My poor sister.

75
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,562
Indeed.

76
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,480
To be made queen for just a few days.
It seems incredible.

77
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,009
A tragedy.

78
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,208
Upon return, she's to be treated
to every comfort and kindness...

79
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,604
...while she mourns.

80
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,842
As to the great matter
of Your Majesty's annulment...

81
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,122
...I have set up an ecclesiastical court
with Archbishop Warham...

82
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,686
...to consider
and decide on the matter.

83
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,087
It will meet in secret,
if Your Majesty agrees.

84
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,169
Make sure they come
to the right decision, quickly.

85
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,725
I have some further news.

86
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,727
About the emperor.

87
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,079
He has released King Francis.

88
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,239
What?

89
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,123
- I have it on good authority.
- Under what terms?

90
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,922
I have yet to find out.

91
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,248
Why wasn't I consulted?

92
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,406
We are supposed to be allies.

93
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,085
What's he playing at?

94
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,084
Tell his ambassador
I want to see him.

95
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,125
Anne. Anne.

96
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,409
Anne...

97
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,405
...I want to say something to you.

98
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,440
If it pleases you to be
my true, loyal mistress and friend...

99
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,164
...to give yourself up to me,
body and soul.

100
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,646
I promise I'll take you
as my only mistress.

101
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,484
I won't have a thought
or an affection for anyone else.

102
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,649
If you agree to be
my maitresse en titre...

103
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,959
...I promise I shall serve only you.

104
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,202
- Your official mistress?
- Yes.

105
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,287
And you will have everything
you need.

106
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,768
Everything within my power
to give you to you, it's yours, just ask.

107
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,518
What is it?

108
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,119
What have I done to make you
treat me like this?

109
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,518
Done?

110
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,325
What fault have I committed?
Tell me. Tell me.

111
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,919
Your Majesty, I have already given
my maidenhead...

112
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,768
...into my husband's hands.

113
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,043
And whoever he is,
only he will have it.

114
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,242
Anne.

115
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,283
Because I know
how it goes otherwise.

116
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,968
My sister is called
The Great Prostitute by everyone.

117
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,328
I'm sorry if I offended you.

118
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,882
I did not mean to.

119
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,129
I spoke plainly of my true feelings.

120
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,608
Your Majesty...

121
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,249
- Your Majesty.
- Open the door.

122
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,441
- Your Majesty.
- What?!

123
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,926
Mary. Mary.

124
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,919
Go to your room. I will come later.

125
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,721
Another visit, Your Eminence.

126
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,200
You are always so busy.

127
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,128
Majesty, I have some good news.

128
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,403
Since His Majesty has given his son
the Duke of Richmond...

129
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,285
...his own establishment,
he considers it only right and proper...

130
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,642
...that his beloved Princess Mary
should also have hers.

131
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,918
What do you mean?

132
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,041
His Majesty intends to send
the princess...

133
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,764
...to Ludlow castle
in the Welsh Marches.

134
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,686
She will be under the care
of Lady Salisbury, her lady governess.

135
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,404
Her tutor, Dr. Fetherston,
will also accompany her...

136
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,922
...along with 300 members
of the princess's household.

137
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,207
She is to be taken away from me?

138
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,726
No. His Majesty is according her
the true honours of a princess.

139
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,886
This is your idea.

140
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,885
Madam, I am often accused of things
that are not my fault, or responsibility.

141
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,365
Some people are always prone
to speak evil...

142
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,403
...without knowledge of the truth.

143
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,046
I fear they may have poisoned
Your Majesty's mind against me.

144
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,726
You are taking my child from me.

145
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,286
My child.

146
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,960
You are tearing her from me as if
you were tearing her from my womb.

147
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,559
I do as His Majesty commands.

148
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,167
No.

149
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,839
You are my enemy.

150
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,845
Your Majesty is unfair.

151
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,481
Get out of my sight.

152
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,729
Mary.

153
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,209
Mary.

154
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,045
The ambassador of His Highness
the Holy Roman Emperor.

155
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,526
Senor Mendoza,
I am not pleased to see you.

156
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,049
Majesty?

157
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,083
Your master has broken
all his promises.

158
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,686
He has taken our money
but used it against us.

159
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,846
He has negotiated a separate peace...

160
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,644
...with the king of France
and His Holiness the Pope...

161
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,324
...while neglecting
his friend and ally.

162
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,925
He has not kept faith.

163
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,644
Charles has nothing
but words for me.

164
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,522
Deeds he keeps for others.

165
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,920
The emperor would never
betray Your Majesty.

166
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,485
Never, he regards you as his uncle.
He...

167
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,440
His fucking uncle?! How old am I?

168
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,598
Well, Your Highness
must consider that you, yourself...

169
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,005
...may not always have kept
to your obligations.

170
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,438
After all, we received only
half the gold that was promised.

171
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,766
Your accusations are totally false.

172
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,409
Unacceptable.

173
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,726
I will answer
for my honourable conduct...

174
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,602
...whoever contradicts me.

175
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,763
Leave.

176
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,204
My Lord Rochford.

177
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,968
Yes, Your Honour?

178
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,202
The emperor sends you
his congratulations on your elevation.

179
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,129
What does the emperor care
about my elevation?

180
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,406
He cares to have friends
at the English court.

181
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,202
And pays for the privilege.

182
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,566
Does he have many friends here
already?

183
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,289
Several.

184
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,966
- You would know them.
- And what does friendship pay?

185
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,565
One thousand crowns a year.

186
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,366
I will certainly consider
His Highness's offer.

187
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,323
- Your Grace.
- My lord.

188
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,404
So how did you find
the imperial ambassador?

189
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,163
Stimulating.

190
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,082
Indeed?

191
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,121
I find him a man of great principle.

192
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,363
Indeed.

193
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,845
Hallelujah.

194
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,449
Hallelujah indeed.

195
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,329
My lord.

196
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,447
No, I was just listening.

197
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,728
Yes, l...

198
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,840
You have such a talent.

199
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,003
Orpheus himself
would be jealous I think.

200
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,723
Sir.

201
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,169
A very good day to you ladies.

202
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,800
- Isn't the music divine?
- Yes, I quite agree.

203
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,489
Ladies.

204
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,766
No, George. Please, give it back.

205
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,202
"I have given you my heart, now
I desire to dedicate my body to you."

206
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,684
No, please.

207
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,848
"Written by the hand of him
who in heart, body and will...

208
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,408
...is your loyal
and most ensured servant, HR."

209
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,767
And look. He's drawn a little heart
between the letters H and R.

210
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,398
Just imagine.

211
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,920
The king of England writing
to my little sister.

212
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,083
Promising to be her servant.
It's incredible.

213
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,966
- Give me the letter.
- He's in love with you.

214
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,121
Give me the letter.

215
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,124
You're not in love with him, are you?

216
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,483
He wants a divorce?

217
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,843
It's not a divorce.

218
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,881
King wants an annulment
on the grounds...

219
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,604
...that he was never married
in the first place.

220
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,043
By marrying his brother's wife...

221
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,208
...he has offended the laws
of both God and man.

222
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,963
He simply wants that recognised.

223
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,525
The pope gave him a dispensation
to marry Catherine.

224
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,403
Indeed he did. No one denies it.

225
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,044
But the king feels
more beholden to God...

226
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,569
...than he does to the pope.

227
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,486
His conscience is genuinely stricken,
and tender.

228
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,164
He has disobeyed God's injunction...

229
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,646
...and there is nothing His Holiness
can say or do that can alter that.

230
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,207
The pope is God's representative
on Earth.

231
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,207
- He speaks for him.
- Come, come, Thomas.

232
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,002
What are you pretending?

233
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,320
Kings get divorced all the time.

234
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,090
And popes always find an excuse.

235
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,643
I know you're an idealist
but you're not stupid.

236
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,404
If Henry wants an annulment,
who's to stop him?

237
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,244
All right. You talk of fact.

238
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,606
Let me give you a fact.

239
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,961
Catherine is not only a great queen
and the daughter of kings...

240
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,923
...she is also immensely popular
throughout the country.

241
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,683
God forbid that the king should abandon
her just to ease his own conscience.

242
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,404
I don't think the English people
would ever forgive him.

243
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,282
Does she know yet?

244
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,043
Does she know yet?

245
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,684
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.

246
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,481
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.

247
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,045
Behold the cross on which
hung the saviour of the world.

248
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,122
The queen.

249
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,562
Good people of Lambeth.

250
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,489
On this Good Friday,
the Queen's Majesty will distribute...

251
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,124
...alms to you unfortunate...

252
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,925
...but true and loyal subjects
of Their Majesties...

253
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,883
...in the Christian spirit
of charity and love.

254
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,484
- Your Majesty.
- Bless you.

255
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,527
- Your Majesty.
- And you.

256
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,839
God be with you.

257
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,569
In good faith.

258
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,840
May you know him in deed.

259
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,478
In good faith.

260
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,679
I beseech you, help me.

261
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,528
God bless you.

262
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,648
Do not be afraid.
You are God's child.

263
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,086
Want some business?

264
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,848
Sorry, love.

265
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,159
My dear William.

266
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,520
Charles, welcome back.
Good to see you.

267
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,522
You too. Come sit down,
have a drink.

268
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,570
I don't understand. Why here?

269
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,278
We've been expecting you
back at court.

270
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,162
How is the king?

271
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,079
Anxiously awaiting his sister,
to share her grief.

272
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,642
We're married.

273
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,326
- What?
- She and me.

274
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,568
We're married.

275
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,799
- You and?
- Yes.

276
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,244
Here you are, sir. One for you.

277
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,119
You have to tell him.
You have to tell the king.

278
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,042
I have to tell him? Why do I have to?

279
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,127
Because it will be better
coming from you.

280
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,486
What's the matter?
Have you lost your nerve?

281
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,322
This is no laughing matter.

282
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,798
Then why did you do it?

283
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,563
You know me.

284
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,042
I don't always think.

285
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,929
Yes, you do. Just not with your head.

286
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,169
Henry.

287
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,440
Catherine,
I have something to tell you.

288
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,645
As far as I am concerned,
our marriage is at an end.

289
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,969
Actually, there is no need to end
something which has never been.

290
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,521
You and I were never truly married.

291
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,720
It was a misunderstanding
of scripture...

292
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,128
...and a papal misapplication
of canon law.

293
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,440
It's true I did not know
about these things before...

294
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:28,407
...but it has been brought to light
by learned opinion...

295
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,879
...and it weighs down
my conscience.

296
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,202
It has forced me to give up
your bed and board once and for all.

297
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,723
All that remains...

298
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,046
...is for you to choose
where to live...

299
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,560
...and to retire there
as quickly as possible.

300
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,649
I swear to you
all will be done for the best.

301
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,398
Your Grace, my lords.

302
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,685
I believe you know why we are
gathered here in private.

303
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,121
We are here
at His Majesty's bidding.

304
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,085
His Majesty has requested
an enquiry into the nature...

305
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,521
...of his marriage
to Catherine of Aragon...

306
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,285
...for the tranquillity of his conscience
and the health of his soul.

307
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,646
For as it says in Leviticus:

308
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,366
"If a man shall take his brother's wife,
it is an impurity...

309
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,879
...he has covered
his brother's nakedness...

310
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,046
...they shall be childless."

311
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,241
Now, if, my lords, we are able to agree
between ourselves...

312
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,918
...that the marriage was, in fact,
never legal...

313
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,248
...and was proceeded with against
both canon and ecclesiastical law...

314
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,726
...as His Majesty, to his great regret,
has come to believe...

315
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,639
...then it is my understanding
that, as papal legate...

316
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,446
...I myself have the power and authority
to dissolve and end it.

317
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,001
Of course
I would be grateful to hear...

318
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,566
...the opinions of your lordships
on this great matter.

319
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,604
Your Grace?

320
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,370
I am inclined to agree
with Your Eminence...

321
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,166
...though I reserve judgement
until I have heard all opinion.

322
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,248
My Lord Fischer.

323
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,119
I see no merit in the king's case,
so expressed.

324
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,729
None whatsoever.

325
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,407
If there was any obstacle
to the king's marriage...

326
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,005
...then it was overcome
by the pope's dispensation.

327
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,519
The marriage was therefore legal.

328
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,847
As Your Eminence knows,
divorce is disallowed by the Church.

329
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,289
That is my opinion.

330
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,043
Madam, Lady Salisbury's here.

331
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,841
Your Majesty.

332
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,245
I have brought your daughter,
to say goodbye.

333
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,282
- My baby.
- Your Majesty must be reassured.

334
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,205
The princess will be well taken care of,
as befitting her station.

335
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,887
You will be sent regular reports
of her health and accomplishments.

336
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,728
And naturally, you will visit her...

337
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,683
...during the course
of Your Majesty's progresses.

338
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,841
You must make sure
she practises her music.

339
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,804
She has a great facility for music.

340
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,520
Be strong, my daughter.
Remember who you are.

341
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,888
The descendent of Isabella
and Ferdinand of Castille.

342
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,361
The only daughter of the
king of England.

343
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,243
Be strong, and be true,
and one day...

344
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,161
One day you will be queen.

345
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,289
Yes, Mama.

346
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,283
Is he sorry?

347
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,166
Does he repent it?

348
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,767
Tell me, does he beg
my forgiveness?

349
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,681
Your Majesty knows His Grace.

350
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,046
You mean he does not.

351
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,966
Send in my sister.

352
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,328
You are not wearing black.

353
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,318
No, Your Majesty.

354
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,563
But you are in mourning.

355
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,400
Your husband is dead.

356
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,963
I said your husband is dead.

357
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,443
He's alive. My husband is alive.

358
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,968
I gave you no permission
to marry Brandon, nor would I ever.

359
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,168
You gave me your promise.
I was free to choose.

360
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:21,403
I made no promise.
You are mistaken.

361
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,802
How dare you look at me?

362
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,168
I am your lord and master,
not your brother.

363
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,247
You are both banished from court.

364
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,049
You will relinquish
your London houses.

365
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,044
You will remove yourself
from my sight.

366
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,842
Do you understand?

367
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,528
Yes, Your Majesty.

368
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,048
- And Margaret?
- What?

369
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,366
I have yet to decide whether
to make your bedmate a head shorter.

370
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,563
Say yes.

371
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,563
Say yes.

372
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,000
- You're married.
- So?

373
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,838
So...

374
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,042
- Why deny me?
- I do not love you.

375
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,206
- Is that all?
- For me, yes.

376
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,449
You're so beautiful, Tom.

377
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,722
You're a lord.

378
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,768
What am I?

379
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,088
A genius.

380
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,728
What is it?

381
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,886
A parcel, Your Majesty.

382
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,764
Who is it from?

383
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,006
The Lady Anne Boleyn.

384
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:33,645
A ship, with women on board.
What is a ship?

385
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:39,522
A ship is protection,
like the ark that protected Noah.

386
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,527
And the diamond?

387
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,562
What does it say
in the Roman de la Rose?

388
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:59,123
"A heart as hard as a diamond,
steadfast, never changing."

389
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,968
She is the diamond.

390
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,122
And I am the ship.

391
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,607
She says yes.

392
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,283
King Francis is eager
for a rapprochement...

393
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,162
...with Your Majesty.

394
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,646
He is disgusted
at the treacherous behaviour...

395
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,249
...of the emperor towards you.

396
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:27,160
Behaviour he knows only too well
having suffered it himself at firsthand.

397
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,842
And offers you instead
a true and lasting friendship.

398
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,401
It is true,
the emperor has betrayed us.

399
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,524
Perhaps he was never sincere
in the first place.

400
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,761
Even so, he still has friends at court.

401
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,689
Which friends?

402
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,406
My agents intercepted this letter.

403
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,920
The letter is from the queen.

404
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,283
She asks why the emperor
doesn't write to her more often.

405
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:08,679
And promises, as always,
to be his true and humble servant.

406
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,407
His servant. Not mine.

407
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,198
Tell the French ambassador
that we are in the mood...

408
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,526
...for a rapprochement
with King Francis.

409
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,804
Tell him to send delegates.

410
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,928
Let us be allies
against this emperor.

411
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,369
My lady.

412
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,164
I lay claim to your maidenhead.

413
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,966
And I make you this promise.

414
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:18,609
When we are married,
I will deliver you a son.

415
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,409
No.

416
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,085
I shall honour your maidenhead
until we are married.

417
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,406
No less could I do for love.

418
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,603
Oh, my love.

419
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,923
Love.

420
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:14,243
By daily proof, you shall me find,
to be to you both loving and kind.

421
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,768
I hate you.

422
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,402
You said it would be all right.

423
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,441
You said he would believe you.

424
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,925
- You promised.
- For the love of God, wife.

425
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,402
Don't call me "wife."

426
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,360
I don't want to be your wife.
I hate you.

427
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,929
No, you don't.

428
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,129
Yes, I do.

429
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:59,479
If it weren't for you,
I would still be the queen of Portugal.

430
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,359
- And now what am I?
- You are drunk.

431
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,800
And you are foolish.

432
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,844
Henry will forgive us.
He's just standing on his pride.

433
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,083
We just wounded his vanity.
Believe me.

434
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,327
Why should I?

435
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:27,889
I don't know if you're really brave
or if you're just a fucking fool.

436
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,328
Neither do I.

437
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,649
God.

438
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,042
Thank you, Alice.

439
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,366
I know you've talked to Wolsey.

440
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,442
And I know you do not approve
of what I am trying to do.

441
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,205
It's against your conscience.

442
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,209
And I'm not going to try
and change your mind.

443
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,878
That's unlikely in any case.

444
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,600
But I need you to understand,
Thomas.

445
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,320
I need to explain.

446
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,607
I have been living
with my brother's wife...

447
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,926
...and I have come to believe
their marriage was consummated.

448
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:45,439
If that is true,
then I have been living in sin.

449
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,644
Can you understand
what that feels like, Thomas?

450
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,483
That is why I asked the cardinal
to examine the matter.

451
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,007
What if it can be proved
that the pope's dispensation was valid?

452
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,361
That there was no sin?

453
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,369
Then I shall be
the happiest man alive.

454
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,679
I shall be content to live with Catherine
until the end of my days.

455
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,969
Wait.

456
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,082
I ask you again.

457
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,929
If the king is so troubled
by his conscience...

458
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,361
...why has he waited so long
to bring this matter to a head?

459
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:37,559
Because of his love for the queen,
he has denied the truth to himself.

460
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,968
But her failure to produce
a living son is proof of it.

461
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,247
Then he'll want to remarry?

462
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,881
If his marriage is annulled, then, yes,
I am certain he will remarry...

463
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,684
...in the hope of producing an heir.

464
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,283
He has an heir.

465
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:57,281
I do not believe for a moment...

466
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:01,119
...that the English people will accept
his bastard son as a legitimate heir.

467
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,369
- Nor does the king.
- He has a legitimate daughter.

468
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,205
My lords, English history
is littered with the tragedies...

469
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,766
...of those who have tried to pass
on their crown to a daughter.

470
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:20,360
Then he has a new wife in mind?

471
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:25,083
He has a mind to take one, yes.

472
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,046
It stinks.

473
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,682
I think you should be careful,
my lord.

474
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,682
As should you.

475
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,205
One of the great advantages
of having a library...

476
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,968
...is that it is full of books.

477
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,644
And some of these books
contain ecclesiastical law.

478
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,602
And according to those books...

479
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,768
...you have no authority
to judge this matter.

480
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:54,128
It is for the pope alone,
or those whom he appoints.

481
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,368
It seems that in this case...

482
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,447
...your reach
has exceeded your grasp.

483
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:57,206
So I have invited a French delegation
to visit Your Majesty's court...

484
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,799
...to discuss a new treaty,
binding us together...

485
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,161
...in the face of the emperor's
intransigence and aggression.

486
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,685
Good. Excellent.

487
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,800
And since the emperor
has reneged on his promise...

488
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,729
...to marry your daughter,
it could perhaps be politic...

489
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,081
...to resurrect her betrothal
to the dauphin.

490
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,680
Or if the dauphin is already promised
perhaps to the Duke of Orleans...

491
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,450
...King Francis' youngest son.

492
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,522
And what of your secret sessions?

493
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,280
Have they come to a decision?

494
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,203
How soon can I expect
my annulment?

495
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,840
Your Majesty should
not be concerned but...

496
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,367
We were not able to come
to a conclusion.

497
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,319
- Not able?
- The matter is a complex one.

498
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,964
Really? How?

499
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,842
It is my considered opinion...

500
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,689
...that we should apply to His Holiness,
Pope Clement...

501
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,120
...for a ruling on this matter.

502
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:58,325
Since he loves Your Majesty,
I am certain he will rule in your favour.

503
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,407
I hope so.

504
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,686
I certainly do hope so.
For your sake.

505
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,559
- You can always tell the French.
- Oh, yes.

506
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,044
Ponces.

507
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,648
But they never did anything so clever
as giving Wolsey a pension.

508
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,169
He's never failed them.

509
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,769
We must wait and see.

510
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,844
When the wheel of fortune
has reached its zenith...

511
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,520
...there is only one way for it to go.

512
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,207
Move aside, move aside.
Out of my way.

513
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,247
I bring most important news.

514
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,765
Your Majesty,
Rome has been sacked.

515
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,728
Let him through.

516
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,560
Your Majesty, I bring
most terrible and calamitous news.

517
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:28,683
Rome has been captured and sacked by
the German and Spanish mercenaries.

518
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,680
They have plundered
and befouled its churches...

519
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,239
...destroyed its relics
and holy treasures...

520
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,323
...tortured and killed thousands
of its priests.

521
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,327
What of His Holiness?

522
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,809
The pope is a prisoner
in the Castel St. Angelo.

523
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,081
He is the emperor's prisoner?

524
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,169
Yes.

525
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,518
Lady Blount.

526
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,607
He caught the sweating sickness.

00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,805
There was nothing we could do.

00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,639
He complained this morning
of feeling ill.

529
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,448
And by this evening,
he was in the hands of God.
