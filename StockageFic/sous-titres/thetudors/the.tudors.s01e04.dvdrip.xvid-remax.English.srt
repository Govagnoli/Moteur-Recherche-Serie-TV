1
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:06,040
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:10,718
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,846
His Majesty, the king.

4
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:42,637
My dear sister.

5
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,805
Fare you well on your journey.

6
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:53,040
Remember, the king of Portugal,
your future husband...

7
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,403
...loves and respects you.

8
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:58,241
And you must love him in return.

9
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:03,835
Remember your promise.

10
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,079
When he dies,
I marry whom I choose.

11
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:18,806
Charles, as you love me,
take care of her.

12
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:21,959
I will. You may have no doubts.

13
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,562
I shall treat her
as if she were my own sister.

14
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,326
God be with all of you.

15
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:40,925
And remember your duties
to my lady and to England.

16
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,964
Let us pray.

17
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,161
His Holiness thanked God
for raising up such a prince...

18
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,756
...to be a champion of the Church.

19
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:04,596
And he expressed astonishment that
you found time to write the pamphlet.

20
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:07,196
Furthermore, in order
to show his gratitude...

21
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:11,002
...the Pope has decided to honour you
with a new title:

22
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:12,999
Fidei Defensor.

23
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,083
Fidei Defensor.

24
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:18,995
Defender of the faith.

25
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,358
But Your Majesty should know
that Martin Luther...

26
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,563
...has also responded to your work.

27
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,683
- What did he say?
- Well, he accuses you of...

28
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,120
Yes?

29
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:38,198
He accuses you of raving
like a strumpet in a tantrum.

30
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:39,675
What?

31
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,560
He says, " If the king of England
gives himself the right...

32
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,076
...to spew out falsehoods,
he gives me the right...

33
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,005
...to stuff them back down
his throat."

34
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,442
He ought to be burned.

35
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,876
Give me a hand with these ropes.

36
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,604
This is your stateroom. I hope it meets
with Your Highness's approval.

37
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,279
It will serve.

38
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,325
The bed is narrow but adequate.

39
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,200
And in case of action,
all this panelling will be removed.

40
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,477
- Action?
- Lf we are attacked.

41
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,366
- Who will attack us?
- Pirates.

42
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,559
It seems to me, Your Grace...

43
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:25,358
...we have more to fear
from the pirates already onboard.

44
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:52,204
- Good morning, madam.
- Your Majesty.

45
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:50,880
Your Majesty, Lady Anne Clifford.

46
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,281
Your Majesty.

47
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:49,555
Your Gracious Majesty. ;

48
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:54,725
It causes me such pain and grief
to return the gifts you gave me.

49
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:59,284
Alas, they are too beautiful
and I unworthy to receive them.

50
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:03,319
I think I never gave Your Majesty
cause to give them to me...

51
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:06,519
...since I am nothing
and you are everything.

52
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,046
Give them, I pray you...

53
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:12,240
...to a lady more deserving
of Your Majesty's affections.

54
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:15,766
I am leaving now
for my family's house at Hever.

55
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,805
I shall think of you
on the journey there.

56
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:22,478
"Your loving servant...

57
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,838
...Anne Boleyn."

58
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,807
- Mr. Pace?
- At your service, sir.

59
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,360
You are to be released.

60
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,635
I don't know anything.

61
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,407
What's that?
I said, you're to be released.

62
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,726
I told my wife.

63
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:56,476
I said, I don't know anything,
anything at all.

64
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,397
You told your wife, Mr. Pace? When?

65
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,238
She's sleeping.

66
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:09,043
We talk together.

67
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:13,403
I thought she had died
when she gave birth to our son.

68
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:19,281
I was sure
I went to the funeral and wept.

69
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,924
But now...

70
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,964
...I see she's alive...

71
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,885
...and as well as I.

72
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,444
Do you not see her?

73
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:45,398
Yes, Mr. Pace. I see her.

74
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,439
Mr. Cromwell.

75
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,398
Eminence.

76
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,684
I have long noticed
your aptitude for work...

77
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,526
...and your diligence
in carrying through my affairs.

78
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:17,002
And your discretion.

79
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,598
Well, I am grateful to Your Eminence.

80
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,156
You are of obscure stock.

81
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,524
But then, so am I.

82
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,359
It should not be held against you.

83
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,798
I may have a proposition
to put to you.

84
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:36,878
Thank you, Your Eminence.

85
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,163
By the terms of our treaty
with the emperor...

86
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,006
...we are obliged
to support his war effort financially.

87
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:51,206
At present, his armies are fighting
the French in Italy, near Milan.

88
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,717
Unfortunately, I have calculated
that in order to meet our obligations...

89
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,078
...we shall be obliged to raise taxes.

90
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,680
A bill will be presented to Parliament
at the next session.

91
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:05,798
- Good, good.
- I trust the bill will pass successfully.

92
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,924
I am sure, Your Eminence,
with your guiding hand, it will be so.

93
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,638
At least our alliance
with the emperor is popular.

94
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,044
Although sometimes I ask myself
why that should be so.

95
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,760
Because he's not French.

96
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:22,486
Right.

97
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,957
The new warship
is commissioned at Portsmouth.

98
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,359
I forgot to mention to Your Majesty...

99
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,162
...we have a new visitor at court,
Princess Marguerite of Navarre.

100
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,840
I received her myself yesterday.

101
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,765
I found her
a beautiful young woman...

102
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,567
...with a very sweet
and yielding disposition.

103
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:48,600
She confessed a great admiration
for Your Majesty.

104
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:50,035
Should I arrange...?

105
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,323
Yes. Yes, do it.

106
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:57,357
With Your Majesty's permission,
I intend to appoint a new secretary...

107
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,795
...instead of Mr. Pace.

108
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:01,038
Yes.

109
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:11,355
We're coming up from England.

110
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,517
Their whores are the best
in the world.

111
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:16,797
Even if you can't understand
a word they say.

112
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,795
They don't talk to me.
They always have their mouths full.

113
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:27,041
There you are, Your Grace.
My king has your queen.

114
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:31,960
Well, I was rather hoping
that the knave would get the queen.

115
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,837
- Eminence.
- Your Majesty.

116
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,325
May I present
Princess Marguerite of Navarre?

117
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,963
- Madame.
- Majesty.

118
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:04,720
You are visiting here?

119
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,117
Oui, Majesty, the count...

120
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:12,395
...my husband, had to stay behind
in France, regrettably.

121
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:15,366
Indeed. Very regrettable, madame.

122
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:18,286
But you must be compensated.

123
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,563
You must enjoy
some pleasures whilst here.

124
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:44,441
I have some news
which may interest Your Grace.

125
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:48,155
The Bishop of Winchester
died six months ago.

126
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,600
Winchester is the richest parish
in England.

127
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:55,958
Wolsey is supposed
to appoint his successor.

128
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,044
And he just did.

129
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,040
He appointed himself.

130
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,363
How much more wealth
does that man want?

131
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,359
- There's more.
- Tell me.

132
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,922
It appears that he's been using
the king's money...

133
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:11,120
...to invest his new college in Oxford
and his own personal foundation.

134
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,764
He closes down the worst monasteries,
strips them of their assets...

135
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,195
...as he is supposed to do.

136
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,365
But instead of transferring
all the profit to the privy purse...

137
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,159
...he makes the profits disappear.

138
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:24,399
God. You must tell
the king right away.

139
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:29,038
Forgive me, Your Grace,
but we must judge the time exactly.

140
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:31,845
Such is Wolsey's hold
over the king...

141
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,880
...that whatever the evidence,
the king won't believe it.

142
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:38,079
There will come a point
when the king's belief in his minister...

143
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:39,919
...will hang in the balance.

144
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:44,484
And then, Your Grace,
we shall drop our truth into the scales.

145
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,917
And the scales will fall.

146
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:50,001
Great hunting this weekend.

147
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:53,684
Dear Thomas.

148
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,278
Majesty.

149
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,517
Come and stay at court. I need you.

150
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,325
I'll give you great chambers.

151
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,563
Compton has great chambers.
You can have his.

152
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,160
Much as I love Your Majesty...

153
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:13,040
...I like my chambers
to have my family inside them.

154
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,039
Indeed.

155
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,598
His Majesty loves you above
anyone else, Mr. More, you know that.

156
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,284
That may be true.

157
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:30,446
And yet if my head
were to win him a casque in Spain...

158
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,603
...I think he would cut it off.

159
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:41,525
Mr. Wyatt.

160
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,035
Your Majesty.

161
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,283
I hear you're a poet.

162
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,796
I write poems.
I don't know how to be a poet.

163
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,561
I have read some. I like them.

164
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,597
My lord, I don't know what to say.

165
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,479
Were you in love with Anne Boleyn?

166
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,279
I...

167
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,882
Cardinal Wolsey
tells me you were once engaged.

168
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:06,799
No, that's not true.

169
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:09,915
Did you love her?

170
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:16,126
Lady Anne is so beautiful,
it is the duty of every man to love her.

171
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,685
Of course I loved her,
but from a distance.

172
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,366
Personally, I have a wife.

173
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:28,726
Enjoy the feast.

174
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,120
Thomas? Thomas Tallis.

175
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,595
Hello.

176
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:53,561
We just wanted to say
we love your music.

177
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,604
Thank you.

178
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:59,203
We share a room.
Do you want to come back with us?

179
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:05,680
- I want to finish this song.
- Finish it tomorrow.

180
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:08,157
I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow.

181
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,045
And you'll forget us too.

182
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,246
Compton, my friend...

183
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,196
...what do you think
of Princess Marguerite of Navarre?

184
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,403
She's well-built, Your Majesty.

185
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:47,121
Little heavy in the top decks
for my taste, though.

186
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,395
She's Francis' sister.

187
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:53,246
I happen to know that.

188
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:20,079
- Mon Dieu, Henri.
- Mon Dieu, Henri.

189
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,361
Happy to take your money anytime.

190
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,798
You just save your money, captain,
for when we get to Lisbon.

191
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,520
Good night.

192
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,125
Out of the way.

193
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,641
Make way. Make way.

194
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,918
A messenger from the emperor,
Your Majesty.

195
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,682
Well, what is it?

196
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:23,566
The emperor has won
a great victory against the French.

197
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,719
- What are you saying?
- At the Battle of Pavia five days ago.

198
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:30,243
The emperor's army
totally overcame those of the French.

199
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,802
The French army was destroyed.

200
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:36,715
My God.

201
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,275
Is this true?

202
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,958
Not only that, the French king himself
was also captured on the battlefield.

203
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,642
Francis? King Francis was captured?

204
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,075
Yes, Your Majesty.

205
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,082
He is now the emperor's prisoner.

206
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,725
You are as welcome here
as the angel Gabriel.

207
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,565
Feed yourself.

208
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,957
Great news. We must celebrate.

209
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,320
Huzzah!

210
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,682
Point to Mr. Anthony Knivert.

211
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,240
Well done, Tony.

212
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:28,760
I tell you, William, I will be called
a knight today or I never will be.

213
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:30,998
His Majesty, the king.

214
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,156
His Majesty.

215
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,841
- My queen.
- My lord.

216
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:59,157
My lady.

217
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,799
Godspeed, Your Majesty.

218
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:10,958
You see how popular
the queen is with the people?

219
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,483
She is the daughter
of Isabella and Ferdinand.

220
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:19,236
Perhaps the people
think she is what a queen ought to be.

221
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:25,082
Mr. William Compton
takes His Majesty's challenge.

222
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,597
You seem out of sorts today.

223
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:33,284
I have reasons to be downcast
and pained...

224
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,125
...but they needn't bother you.

225
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,198
Why should we not have pains?

226
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,924
Some people think we ought
to go to heaven in feather beds.

227
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:44,402
But that is not the way.

228
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,563
For our Lord himself
went there in pain and tribulation.

229
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:55,119
Not that I'm suggesting
that you're like that, of course.

230
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:00,715
Are you ready?

231
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,481
I was born ready, William.

232
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,839
Your Majesty.

233
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:21,444
Huzzah!
A point for His Majesty, the king.

234
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,319
Do not look at me.

235
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:26,280
I ask you privately
to do something for me.

236
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:29,047
Take this letter to the emperor.

237
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:30,955
You will do this for me...

238
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,721
...and not show it to anyone
or speak a word about it.

239
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,918
Again.

240
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:41,446
Come on. Get him there.

241
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,884
Huzzah! Two points for His Majesty.

242
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:57,087
"I was distressed
you would not accept the brooches.

243
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:00,120
They were made for you,
not for anyone else.

244
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,125
And why are you not worthy
when I deem you so?

245
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,238
For certain,
it must be plain to you now...

246
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:07,642
...that I desire
to find a place in your heart..."

247
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:10,680
Wait. Give it to me.

248
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:13,639
Give it.

249
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,358
"That I find a place in your heart...

250
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,286
...and your grounded affection."

251
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,955
- Grounded affection?
- Grounded.

252
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,963
"Tell me at least
that we can meet in private.

253
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,806
I mean nothing more
than a chance to talk to you."

254
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,840
- I beg you, come back to court soon.
- Give it back, brother.

255
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:42,726
Meanwhile, accept this new gift
and wear it for my sake."

256
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:44,565
What gift? And where is it?

257
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,285
Oh, holy Jesus.

258
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,243
Bring it here, lads.

259
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,326
Very, very good rider.

260
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,678
When will you bring my niece
back to court?

261
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:25,684
Soon, I think.

262
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:28,765
Now the king's appetite is whetted.

263
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,760
What's this?

264
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:44,006
Just a trick, Your Majesty.
Just a trick.

265
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:53,240
His Majesty, the king
and Mr. Anthony Knivert, en plaisance.

266
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:55,637
Ready? Lance.

267
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,042
The king's forgotten his visor.

268
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,039
Hold. Hold. Hold.

269
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:07,925
Hold.

270
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:23,362
Majesty. Your Majesty.

271
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,800
- I'm not hurt.
- Let me see.

272
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:33,197
- Not your eyes, thank God.
- Cloth.

273
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,157
See? See?

274
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,045
Your Majesty.

275
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,679
Will you forgive me? Will you?

276
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,400
It's not your fault, Anthony.

277
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:51,723
It's all my fault. It's my fault.

278
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:54,885
- You didn't hurt me. You can't hurt me.
- No.

279
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,043
Let's run again.

280
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:01,040
Henry. Henry.

281
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,117
Madam, have no fear.

282
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:05,476
I intend to ride again...

283
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,042
...and prove to everyone
that I am well and unharmed.

284
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:11,165
If you insist,
but I would much rather you did not.

285
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:18,240
My lady.

286
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,886
Arm yourself.

287
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,406
Yes.

288
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:39,124
Are you ready for me, Anthony?

289
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:51,158
People of England,
your king is unharmed.

290
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,800
Lance.

291
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:48,644
He's breathing.

292
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,838
Get a physic, quick.

293
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,918
Knivert!

294
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,683
Anthony. Anthony.

295
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:15,165
You wanted to see me,
Your Highness?

296
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:18,077
Only to ask how much longer
we must be at sea.

297
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,400
With a fair wind, two more days.

298
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,884
Do you play cards, Your Grace?

299
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:29,196
Sometimes, Your Highness.

300
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,764
What game shall we play?

301
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:37,199
You choose.

302
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:41,197
French ruff.

303
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,720
You pick trumps.

304
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,879
- Kings.
- How appropriate, Your Highness.

305
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:00,715
Wine?

306
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,719
As you please.

307
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:17,639
Your Highness
must be looking forward...

308
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,838
...with great anticipation
to your wedding.

309
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:25,476
I hear the king
was a great horseman in his time.

310
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,439
And famous
for his beautiful mistresses.

311
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,757
Don't tease me. I don't like it.

312
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,884
Will you like it when an old man
tries to make love to you?

313
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:37,640
Your Grace goes too far already.

314
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:40,478
Gospel says
the truth will make you free.

315
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:42,160
Now you are blasphemous.

316
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,123
My poor lady should not hear you.

317
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:48,880
My lady.

318
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:50,725
- My lady.
- My lady.

319
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,885
I want you to leave.

320
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:09,520
Do you?

321
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,685
Yes. Now.

322
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,195
Pity.

323
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:18,883
I had a winning hand.

324
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,679
Send a message to the emperor.

325
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:36,357
Tell him of our joy and contentment
at his great victory at Pavia...

326
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,285
...and his capture of the French king.

327
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:39,715
Yes, Your Majesty.

328
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:41,838
Ask him what he intends to do
with Francis.

329
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:43,958
And whether or not,
with Francis captive...

330
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:47,204
...it may not be a good time
to think about striking France itself.

331
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:50,797
Tell him we have gold,
men and ships at his disposal...

332
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:54,556
...and are eager to do battle
and share some of his glory.

333
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,120
Yes, I shall.

334
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:58,636
Your Majesty,
this is your new secretary.

335
00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:01,606
This is Thomas Cromwell.
He is a trained barrister...

336
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:03,280
...a diligent man and a scholar.

337
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,637
He will be very useful
for Your Majesty.

338
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:10,400
- Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Majesty.

339
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,639
Ladies.

340
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,958
And back, of course.

341
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,043
May I see you privately?

342
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,085
Sweetheart.

343
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:39,158
My lady.

344
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:48,003
Why does Wolsey open my letters?

345
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,596
Am I not the queen of England?

346
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,116
- Are you sure he does?
- I am sure.

347
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,719
Then I shall stop it.

348
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:04,677
Cardinal Wolsey can be too zealous.

349
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:07,606
But it is always in our interest.

350
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:17,761
Unless you have secrets.

351
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,439
Mr. Anthony Knivert.

352
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,323
- Anthony.
- Majesty.

353
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,204
- You almost lost an eye.
- Never use that one much anyway.

354
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:44,120
Kneel.

355
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:53,639
I dub thee Sir Anthony Knivert.

356
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,323
Arise, Sir Anthony,
and be recognised.

357
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:03,677
Mr. William Compton.

358
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:10,759
Why so reproving a look,
Sir Anthony?

359
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:14,926
Majesty, I nearly lost an eye
for the same reward.

360
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:16,880
But you never carried a tree.

361
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,165
William.

362
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:25,800
Kneel.

363
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,278
So that is why it is to be understood
that the Pope...

364
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:32,523
...far from being
a descendant of St. Peter...

365
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:36,640
...is a sinner, a hypocrite,
a handmaiden to the devil...

366
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:39,315
...the living Antichrist on earth.

367
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:42,121
This is what Luther teaches us...

368
00:33:42,327 --> 00:33:46,843
...in order to free us
from false worship and false idols.

369
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:50,323
In order that we might return
to the true religion...

370
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:53,564
...and take the true and fruitful path
to salvation.

371
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:57,282
Our message of hope,
of liberty, of truth...

372
00:33:57,487 --> 00:34:00,718
...is already spreading throughout
Europe from one corner to the other.

373
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:02,485
Here in England...

374
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:08,796
...we have planted a seed
that will, with prayer, with action...

375
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,158
...and perhaps even with sacrifice,
grow one day...

376
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:16,121
...to become a great tree whose
branches will overreach the kingdom...

377
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:19,239
...and destroy the putrid
monastic houses of the Antichrist!

378
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,919
And this tree...

379
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:28,640
...this tree will be called
the Liberty Tree.

380
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:34,683
And in its branches, all the angels
of the Lord will sing hallelujah.

381
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:36,923
Hallelujah.

382
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,198
Hallelujah.

383
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:00,482
I've dreamt of this moment
a long time.

384
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:06,361
Anne, you must know I desire you
with all my heart.

385
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,566
Anne.

386
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,159
The young man
you were dallying with earlier...

387
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,360
...who was he?

388
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,761
My brother, George.

389
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:40,241
- Her Majesty expects me.
- Later.

390
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,646
Who was that, Your Majesty?

391
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:52,925
Just a girl.

392
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:18,598
Your new kingdom.

393
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,241
- The king must be looking forward to...
- Don't.

394
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:27,278
I forbid you.

395
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:32,318
I should hate you.

396
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,119
But you don't.

397
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,205
I know you don't.

398
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:48,958
What will I do?

399
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,075
Save me.

400
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:38,197
Margaret.

401
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:44,843
You are even more handsome
than your portrait.

402
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,800
I feel so greatly fortunate...

403
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:51,522
...that you are soon to
be my queen.

404
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:56,320
Everything here is
at your disposal.

405
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,962
I only want you to be happy...

406
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,239
...and to make me happy.

407
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,917
And then we will make children...

408
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:12,400
...many children...

409
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:15,002
...with God's help!

410
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:51,960
What are you doing?

411
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:54,198
What the king ordered.

412
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:59,277
Perhaps you don't understand.

413
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:04,607
But I can't sleep, I can hardly breathe
for thinking of you.

414
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:09,283
Your image is before my eyes
every waking second.

415
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:13,040
I almost believe
that I would sacrifice my kingdom...

416
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:15,636
...for an hour in your arms.

417
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:17,360
I beg you...

418
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,405
...name some place
that we can meet and when.

419
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:25,556
Where I can show you truly an affection
which is beyond common affection.

420
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:30,239
Written with the hand
of your servant, Henry.

421
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:35,202
Now he is your servant?

422
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:39,199
With some subtle care
and the lure of your flesh...

423
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:42,365
...he may become
something even closer.

424
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,684
Did His Majesty?

425
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:24,405
Hold.

426
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:29,285
- What is it?
- Ground's too boggy.

427
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:30,840
We're gonna have to go around.

428
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:32,685
Says who?

429
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:35,278
We can't jump this ditch,
Your Majesty.

430
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:37,045
You mean you can't jump this ditch.

431
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,435
Flagpole.

432
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,115
- Majesty?
- Yes, Sir Anthony?

433
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:55,720
What are you doing?

434
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,482
I'm gonna vault this stupid ditch.

435
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:02,679
Nothing stands in the way
of me and my sport.

436
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:04,485
Are you sure?

437
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:08,436
Just watch and see
what the king of England can do.

438
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,119
Your Majesty!

439
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:54,321
Fetch a physician, quickly.

440
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:14,602
With Your Majesty's permission,
may I dance with your wife?

441
00:46:39,247 --> 00:46:40,919
When do you leave?

442
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:43,120
Tomorrow.

443
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:50,718
You can't.

444
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:55,842
Why can't I?
I've discharged my duty.

445
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:59,437
Why should I stay?
You have a life to lead.

446
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:14,360
It's strange.

447
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,603
Some men who seem
at the peak of health...

448
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:18,684
...who are still young
and full of life...

449
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:20,804
...suddenly collapse and die.

450
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:22,360
By that same counter...

451
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:25,681
...some old men
whose bodies look worn out...

452
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,441
...whose race seems run...

453
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:30,325
...they can go on for years.

454
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,797
Don't you think it's strange?

455
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:37,802
Do you tease me
because it amuses you?

456
00:47:38,007 --> 00:47:39,565
Why else?

457
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:50,957
Because you love me.

458
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,285
Your Majesty.

459
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:28,279
Your Majesty,
we would like to bleed you a little...

460
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:33,356
...to drain away the bile which is
causing Your Majesty so much pain.

461
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:36,246
With your permission.

462
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:43,044
Yes.

463
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:00,715
I almost died.

464
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:02,995
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- No!

465
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:06,762
Not "Yes, Your Majesty."
I almost died! Don't you understand?

466
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:19,041
Since that moment,
I've done a great deal of thinking.

467
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,005
What if I had died?

468
00:50:23,247 --> 00:50:24,839
What would I have left?

469
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:28,045
I have no heir.

470
00:50:28,287 --> 00:50:31,006
Only a daughter and a bastard son.

471
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:33,995
You understand, Wolsey?

472
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:37,400
The Tudor dynasty, gone.

473
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:39,438
All my father's work finished.

474
00:50:39,647 --> 00:50:41,683
And it's my fault.

475
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:46,319
I have lived too long for pleasure.

476
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:51,400
I never even thought of the future.

477
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:59,840
I married my brother's wife
and God has punished me.

478
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:07,277
I've been such a fool.

479
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:19,842
Now everything has changed.

480
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,680
Everything.

481
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:29,439
I want a divorce.

482
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:35,163
And you will get one for me.
