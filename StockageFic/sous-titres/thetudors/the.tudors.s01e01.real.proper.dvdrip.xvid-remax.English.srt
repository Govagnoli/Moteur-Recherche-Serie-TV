1
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,108
Senor Ambassador.

2
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,629
This is really most humiliating,
Signore Bedoli.

3
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,518
What could be so important...

4
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,631
...that you drag me from my bed
before 7:00 in the morning?

5
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,831
The duke has called an early meeting.
He wanted you to attend.

6
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,031
Monsieur.

7
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,228
Why are the French here?

8
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,192
That is what His Grace
wants to talk to you about.

9
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,594
French bastards! Bastards.

10
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:31,153
- Mr. Pace.
- Mr. More.

11
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,556
His Majesty wants council
this afternoon to be brief.

12
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,751
- He doesn't want a lot of speeches.
- Where is the king?

13
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,598
He's in seclusion
and not to be disturbed.

14
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,631
- How is he?
- With regards to...?

15
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:46,036
With regard to Italy.
What the French are doing in Italy.

16
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,356
- What other regard is there?
- His Majesty is counselling patience.

17
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:52,153
Yes, but you're his secretary.
You see him every day.

18
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,352
In private, he's mad with grief.
Almost inconsolable.

19
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,995
I think you ought to remember
it was his uncle they murdered.

20
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,511
The king.

21
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,351
My lords.

22
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,190
We meet to consider questions
of great moment.

23
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,829
The king of France has demonstrated
to the world his aggressive policies.

24
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,796
He's already overrun
five or six city-states in Italy.

25
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,433
He's a threat to every
Christian nation in Europe...

26
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,756
...yet he bullies the pope into
declaring him Defender of the Faith.

27
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,712
On top of that,
to prove that nobody can touch him...

28
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,355
...he has our ambassador in Urbino...

29
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,196
...and my uncle...

30
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,870
...murdered in cold blood.

31
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,990
My lords...

32
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,589
...I believe these are all just causes
for war.

33
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,755
Your Majesty is certainly right.

34
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,116
You have every reason
to prosecute a war.

35
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,549
I warned you a year ago
about French ambitions.

36
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,389
It has taken this personal tragedy
for Your Majesty to accept my word.

37
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,351
Norfolk.

38
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,033
I agree with my lord, Buckingham.
The king of England...

39
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,958
...has an ancient and historic
right to the French throne...

40
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:31,755
...which the Valois have usurped.
It's high time we kicked them out.

41
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,268
We should attack France
with all our might.

42
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,276
Yes.

43
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,470
What say you, Wolsey?

44
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,437
I concur with Your Majesty.
These are indeed just causes.

45
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,072
Good.

46
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,588
Then it is settled.
We are to war with France.

47
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,312
Yes.

48
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,952
Your Eminence
will make all the arrangements.

49
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,158
Now...

50
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,593
...I can go play.

51
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,829
Do you really think
we should go to war?

52
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,633
I think we should try to do
what the king wants us to do.

53
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,069
What if the king
doesn't know his best interests?

54
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,713
Then we should help him decide.

55
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,315
How is your husband?

56
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,190
My husband is extremely jealous.

57
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,428
He's threatening to make a scandal.

58
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,194
Says he'll put me in a nunnery.

59
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,596
That would be such a waste.

60
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,354
His Excellency the French ambassador
and Bishop Bonnivet.

61
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,638
Gentlemen, welcome.

62
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,034
Your Excellency.

63
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,476
What happened in Urbino?

64
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:21,991
The butchering of our ambassador
was most unfortunate...

65
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,838
...especially for me.

66
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,872
Your Excellency is aware of
my sentiments towards your country.

67
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,516
I've laboured long and consistently
in French interests.

68
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,310
But how to explain this?
The murder of my king's uncle.

69
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,079
Well, frankly, it was not done
on my master's orders.

70
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,710
And those that committed the crime
have been punished.

71
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,753
Now, you must understand,
we are well beyond that.

72
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,556
King Henry is a young man.
He has an appetite for war.

73
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,355
And on this occasion
he will not be easy to appease.

74
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,152
Then, by all means, let us have war.

75
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,276
With the greatest respect,
you don't mean that.

76
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,668
Well, I believe that everything
humanly possible should be done...

77
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,757
...to avoid a war between
our two countries.

78
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,953
It would do England no good to get
involved in our European squabbles.

79
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,434
Far better she stands above them.

80
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,395
I'm sure Your Eminence
has ways of pacifying the young lion.

81
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,435
- Strike.
- Play on.

82
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,867
Fifteen-love.

83
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:53,435
- Thirty-love.
- Yeah!

84
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,307
Our game, I think, Anthony.

85
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,475
Your Majesty knows
we're letting you win.

86
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,068
Actually,
I was playing as hard as I can.

87
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,069
Now, there is someone I have to try.
See her? Middle gallery, blue dress?

88
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,668
See that exquisite, virginal face?

89
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,831
Who is she?

90
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,517
Forty-love, game.

91
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,877
She's Buckingham's daughter.

92
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,829
- A hundred crowns you don't succeed.
- Done.

93
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,832
How is our daughter?

94
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,637
She's well.

95
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,434
You know, her tutors say
she has exceptional talents.

96
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,550
Especially in music.

97
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,034
You should be proud.

98
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:53,431
I am. You know I am Catherine.

99
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,630
Mary's the pearl of my world.

100
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:07,193
You have not answered
my nephew's letters.

101
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,108
Your nephew's the king of Spain. Does
he think I have nothing better to do?

102
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,516
You know he advises you
to sign a treaty with the emperor...

103
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,108
...recognising France
as our mutual enemy.

104
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:21,387
He also advises you not to heed
everything Wolsey tells you...

105
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:24,511
...because Wolsey
is so biased for the French.

106
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,715
Since when are you a diplomat?

107
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:33,109
- I am my father's daughter.
- You are my wife.

108
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,635
You are not my minister,
you are not my chancellor, but my wife.

109
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,349
I should like to be your wife
in every way.

110
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,947
Henry, will you not visit
my bedchamber, as you used to?

111
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,632
Eat.

112
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,752
Gown.

113
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,590
Your Majesty.

114
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,553
Where is Queen Catherine?

115
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,910
Her Majesty is still at prayer,
Your Majesty.

116
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,910
Tell Her Majesty...

117
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,907
...I came to offer my love and devotion,
as her true husband.

118
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,757
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:37,997
Jane.

120
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,076
Your Majesty.

121
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,867
- Do you consent?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

122
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,597
Three points, Earl of Portland.

123
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:25,388
Mr. Charles Brandon
has now entered the lists.

124
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,475
Your Majesties.

125
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,757
My Lady Buckingham.

126
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,317
Would you do me the honour
of letting me wear your favours today?

127
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:27,669
Lord Hallam challenges a plaisance.

128
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,310
Two points, Mr. Charles Brandon.

129
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,749
His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham...

130
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,077
...will now joust a plaisance
with the Earl of Newcastle.

131
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,867
Another three points for His Grace.

132
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:51,270
Does Your Eminence have a plan?

133
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,869
A way to avoid war?

134
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,831
This is the outline
of a new peace treaty...

135
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,396
...uniting the English with the French.

136
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,033
- May I?
- No.

137
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:08,914
I want you to take it away
and read it very carefully.

138
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,752
I believe it represents something new
in the world of diplomacy.

139
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,475
If your king accepts it in principle,
he can sign it without any loss of face.

140
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,032
Indeed, he can rejoice.
My master can rejoice.

141
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,230
We can all rejoice.

142
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,988
In which case, what does
Your Eminence want in return?

143
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,147
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

144
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,396
Nothing from you.

145
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:41,475
What I want, Your Grace,
only you can give me.

146
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:48,392
The Duke of Buckingham
has reentered the lists.

147
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,159
He's won 10 courses already.
What is he trying to prove?

148
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,589
- I'm gonna take him.
- No. I'll do it.

149
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,632
I'd love to damage
Buckingham's pride.

150
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,273
My lords,
the king has entered the lists.

151
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,232
His Majesty makes the challenge
a la guerre.

152
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,590
Here we go again.

153
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,155
Claim or no claim,
Buckingham's not the king.

154
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,510
Not all of the court is as loyal as you,
Charles.

155
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,517
My lady.

156
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,348
His Majesty wins the day.

157
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,717
The king.

158
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,428
And easy.

159
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,555
Present oars.

160
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,076
- Thomas.
- Your Majesty.

161
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,475
This is my family.

162
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,397
Your Majesty.

163
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,989
My wife, Alice.
Alice, won't you kiss the king?

164
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,076
Mistress Alice.

165
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,716
Your Majesty.

166
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:02,148
Shall we walk by the river, Thomas?
I like walking.

167
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,316
Why won't you come live at court?

168
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,636
You know perfectly well why.
I don't like it.

169
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,992
My legal practise
and my life are here.

170
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,713
The court is for
more ambitious men.

171
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:20,989
You didn't say much in council
last month.

172
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,838
- About what?
- Going to war with France.

173
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,753
As a humanist,
I have an abhorrence of war.

174
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,554
It's an activity fit only for beasts...

175
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,389
...yet practised by no kind of beast
so constantly as by man.

176
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,877
As a humanist, I share your opinion.
As a king, I'm forced to disagree.

177
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,194
Spoken like a lawyer.

178
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,118
- You should know. You taught me.
- Not well enough, it seems.

179
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,435
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

180
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,555
- Harry. Harry.
- Easy.

181
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,828
I must urge you...

182
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,236
...that instead of spending ruinous
amounts of money going to war...

183
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:01,272
...you should spend it
rather on the welfare of your people.

184
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,429
Thomas, I swear to you...

185
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,470
...I intend to be a just ruler.

186
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,236
But tell me this:
Why is Henry V remembered?

187
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:16,875
Because he endowed universities?
Built alms houses for the destitute?

188
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,957
No. He is remembered because
he won the battle of Agincourt.

189
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,514
Three thousand English bowmen
against 60,000 French.

190
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:28,234
The flower of French chivalry
destroyed in four hours.

191
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,199
That victory made him famous,
Thomas.

192
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:36,594
It made him immortal.

193
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,555
He has no right to any of this.

194
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,235
His father seized the crown
on the battlefield.

195
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:54,317
He had no claim, only through
a bastard on his mother's side.

196
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,953
Your Grace's family is more ancient.

197
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,834
I am a direct descendant of Edward II.
This is my crown, and this is my court.

198
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,234
Not his crown or his court.

199
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:09,312
- That's treason, Your Grace.
- It's the truth.

200
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:13,151
And one day...

201
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,427
...we shall make it come true.

202
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,158
Your Grace.

203
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,873
My Lord.

204
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,637
My Lord.

205
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,748
What's this?

206
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:54,918
- Brandon.
- It's what it looks like, Your Grace.

207
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,797
You violated my daughter.

208
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:03,197
No, no, she begged.

209
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,712
You've taken her honour.

210
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,558
I swear to Your Grace,
someone else was there before me.

211
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:14,031
You son of a whore.

212
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:19,349
- Yes, that is true, Your Grace.
- I should kill you for this.

213
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:25,868
Get out.

214
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,309
Eminence, Lady Blount is here.

215
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,957
Very well.

216
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,268
Your Eminence.

217
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,395
What can I do for you, Lady Blount?

218
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,835
I am with child, Your Eminence.

219
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,717
Yes.

220
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,311
It is His Majesty's child.

221
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,676
- You are certain?
- Yes.

222
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,432
Have you told the king?

223
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,313
No.

224
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,552
Good.

225
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,955
I will inform His Majesty in due time.

226
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,029
In the meantime, you will say nothing
to anybody on pain of death.

227
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:55,877
Do you understand?

228
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,354
When you are no longer
able to hide your condition...

229
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:08,317
...you will be removed
to a private place for your lying-in.

230
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,228
And there you can give birth
to your bastard.

231
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,917
Thank you, Your Eminence.

232
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,792
Will you bless my sick child?

233
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,313
Your Eminence, please.

234
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,194
All my lords and masters,
make way for his Lord's Grace.

235
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,594
Away. Get back.

236
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,994
Please, you're my last chance.

237
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,948
- Your Eminence.
- Mr. Pace.

238
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,434
I trust you're keeping a good eye
on my interests?

239
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,470
Of course, Your Eminence.
Like an eagle.

240
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,237
Or an eagle, Mr. Pace.

241
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:28,988
They can soar too high.
Be a pigeon and shit on everything.

242
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,473
Yes.

243
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,908
- Where's the king?
- Out hunting.

244
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,394
Good. It keeps him in good humour.

245
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,836
- Send word when he returns.
- Yes, Eminence.

246
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,590
Who are you? What is it you want?

247
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,996
I have letters of introduction, sir.

248
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,347
But these are from the dean
of Canterbury Cathedral.

249
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,711
- Yes, sir.
- Why did you not present yourself?

250
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,115
- Thomas Tallis.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:06,473
And you can play, it says,
the organ and the flute...

252
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,513
...and can sing
more than moderately well.

253
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,637
Anything else?

254
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,868
Yes, sir. I compose a little.

255
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,952
Indeed.

256
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,997
Well,
if the dean commends your talents...

257
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:27,032
...we shall have to see, won't we?

258
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,278
Thomas.

259
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,395
I trust Your Majesty
enjoyed hunting today.

260
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,432
How are the preparations going?

261
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:42,517
Very well. Both your army
and fleet are assembling.

262
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:45,631
Stores and provisions are being laid in.
You could go to war...

263
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,192
...in a matter of weeks.

264
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,152
Excellent.
I knew I could depend on you.

265
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,873
I am grateful to Your Majesty.

266
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,227
What is it?

267
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:06,715
Your Majesty, wars are expensive.

268
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,391
To pay for them
you have to raise taxes.

269
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,909
That's not always popular.

270
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,147
What if Your Majesty could gain more
power and prestige by other means?

271
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,838
Other means?

272
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,752
Peaceful means.

273
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:25,747
What? No battles? No glory?

274
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,110
I think Your Majesty
should hear him out.

275
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,788
In the past few weeks, I have
conducted, on Your Majesty's behalf...

276
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,274
...an intense round of diplomatic talks.

277
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:42,117
Not just with the French ambassador.

278
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,992
Also,
with representatives of the emperor.

279
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:48,475
With envoys from Denmark, Portugal,
the Italian States and so on.

280
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,192
What for?

281
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,436
- To make a treaty.
- What kind of treaty?

282
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:57,109
A treaty of universal
and perpetual peace.

283
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,074
How is it to be effected?

284
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:09,589
In several stages. In the first place,
there would be a summit meeting...

285
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,710
...between the kings of France
and England.

286
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,797
At the summit, Your Majesty's daughter
would be betrothed...

287
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,227
...to the French dauphin.

288
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,999
At the end of the summit,
you would both sign the treaty.

289
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:22,157
The treaty is entirely new
in the history of Europe.

290
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,111
Committing all its signatories...

291
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,028
...to the principles of collective
security and universal peace.

292
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,237
How would it be enforced?

293
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,473
If any of the signatory countries
suffer aggression...

294
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,955
...all the others would immediately
demand that the aggressor withdraws.

295
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,515
If he refuses, within one month
the rest would declare against him...

296
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,108
...and continue
until peace is restored.

297
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:51,030
The treaty also envisages the creation
of pan-European institutions.

298
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,957
In some ways I like it.

299
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,112
I recognise it.

300
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,676
- So do you, Thomas.
- Indeed.

301
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:14,031
It's the application of humanist
principles to international affairs.

302
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,917
Your Eminence
is to be congratulated.

303
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,589
I do not seek praise.

304
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,030
Your Majesty would be known as the
architect of a new and modern world.

305
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,117
And that would be reward enough.

306
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:34,709
Always be assured of our love.

307
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,554
Good night, gentlemen.

308
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,951
- What is it?
- Your Majesty...

309
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:45,719
...the Duke of Buckingham
insists upon an audience.

310
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,508
Your Grace.

311
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:58,435
Your Majesty ought to be aware that I
have discovered Charles Brandon...

312
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,630
...in flagrante delicto
with my daughter.

313
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,117
Mr. Brandon has brought
shame to my family.

314
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,628
I demand that Your Majesty
banish him from court...

315
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,353
...with whatever other punishment
Your Majesty sees fit.

316
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,878
There will be no punishment.

317
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,354
Unless your daughter
accuses Mr. Brandon of rape.

318
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,992
Does she so claim?

319
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,395
Does your daughter claim
Mr. Brandon raped her?

320
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,636
She doesn't need to. The offence
is against me and my family.

321
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,955
As far as I know,
there has been no offence.

322
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,390
So there is no need
for any punishment.

323
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,437
- Your Majesty.
- Your Grace.

324
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,429
Be careful of Buckingham, Harry.

325
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:51,348
He may be stupid,
but he is richer than you are.

326
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,879
And he can call upon a private army.
Not even your father crossed him.

327
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,150
I'm very happy
that the King of France...

328
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,873
...has agreed to sign the treaty
and to host the summit.

329
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,912
His Majesty is delighted
there will be no war.

330
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,871
As we all are.

331
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,276
About the other matter we discussed.

332
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:22,391
Which other matter, Your Eminence?

333
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,471
I saved your master's arse.
Now I want my reward...

334
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,749
...and you can arrange it.

335
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:35,715
Do you understand?

336
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,475
Poor you.

337
00:34:56,319 --> 00:35:00,915
Now, where were we
when we were so rudely interrupted?

338
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,794
Charles.

339
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,271
We shouldn't.

340
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,587
My father will kill you.

341
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,678
Then I shall die a happy man.

342
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,236
Now,
have you all finished your reading?

343
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,515
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

344
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,152
Yes.

345
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,717
Very well.

346
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:57,511
May God and his angels bless you
and keep you this night and always.

347
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,477
Good night.

348
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,070
Good night, children.

349
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:12,912
Stop.

350
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,148
The letter to King Francis,
Your Majesty?

351
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,633
My dearest royal cousin...

352
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:10,192
No.

353
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,357
Make that my beloved cousin.

354
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,595
We send you our love.

355
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,156
We love you so much it would be
impossible to love you better.

356
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:24,154
Make all the necessary arrangements
so we may meet face to face.

357
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,793
Nothing is now closer
or more dear to my heart...

358
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:30,355
...than this treaty of universal peace.

359
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,237
As a token of my goodwill...

360
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,793
...my commitment to this treaty
and my love for Your Majesty...

361
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,238
...I have decided...

362
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,197
I have decided...

363
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,436
Yes, Your Majesty?

364
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,472
I've decided I will not shave again
until we meet.

365
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:04,594
My beard will be a token
of universal friendship...

366
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,073
...of the love between us.

367
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,556
- Your Eminence.
- Your Grace.

368
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:19,227
I have some news for Your Eminence.

369
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:28,788
His Holiness, Pope Alexander,
is desperately ill.

370
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,469
It cannot be long
before he is summoned to God's house.

371
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,712
In view of Your Eminence's
well-known piety...

372
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,877
...as well as your great learning
and diplomatic skills...

373
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,597
...I can assure Your Eminence...

374
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:50,518
...of the support of the French
cardinals at the conclave...

375
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,550
...to elect a successor.

376
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,435
With the votes of your own cardinals...

377
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,836
...and if it is pleasing to God...

378
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,078
...you will be elected pope.
Bishop of Rome.

379
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,595
Our new Holy Father.

380
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,470
Thank you, Your Grace.

381
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:14,914
You make me feel truly humble.

382
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:32,037
- Are you ill, Lady Blount?
- No, Your Majesty.

383
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,831
Please stay.

384
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,676
Thank you. Good night.

385
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:00,833
I have not talked to anyone
for a long time.

386
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,633
Cardinal Wolsey
dismissed my Spanish confessor...

387
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,959
...and most of my Spanish ladies,
in case they were spies.

388
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,638
And I cannot
trust my English confessor.

389
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,431
But I can trust you though.
Can I not, Lady Blount?

390
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,108
Yes, madam.

391
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,275
What is my sadness?

392
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:29,157
It is that I...

393
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,997
I cannot give the king a living son.

394
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,711
I gave birth to a baby boy once.

395
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,875
Sweet boy.

396
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,668
But he died in my arms...

397
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:55,514
...after just four weeks of life.

398
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,791
The king blames me, I know it.
He thinks it all my fault.

399
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:04,992
He does not know how much I suffer,
how much I pray.

400
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:13,592
I've been thinking about my brother.

401
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,672
Arthur.

402
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:20,477
When he died, it was decided
that I should marry Catherine.

403
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,911
I think my father
didn't want to lose her dowry...

404
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:30,836
...or the prestige
of a Spanish marriage.

405
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,790
In any case...

406
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:39,715
...Catherine swore
the marriage was never consummated.

407
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,551
That's why a papal dispensation
was granted.

408
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,909
And so I married her.

409
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,908
And since then,
we have had five stillborn children.

410
00:41:58,359 --> 00:41:59,997
A boy...

411
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:05,558
...who lived for 26 days.

412
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,316
And a single living daughter.

413
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:18,795
What if their marriage
was consummated?

414
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,312
She has sworn before God
that it was not.

415
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,589
What does it say in the Gospels?

416
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:30,074
If a man should marry
his brother's wife.

417
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,352
Tell me.

418
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,151
In Leviticus it says:

419
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:39,032
"If a man
marries his brother's wife...

420
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,752
...they will die childless."

421
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:43,150
But you have a child.

422
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,270
But not a son.

423
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,508
I have no son.

424
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,115
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

425
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,395
Sir Thomas. I hope you didn't find
my invitation presumptuous.

426
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,476
I heard you've been
recalled from France.

427
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,829
I'm here for a short while,
Your Grace.

428
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,753
Come.

429
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,278
They tell me
you're an excellent ambassador.

430
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:26,277
Then, whoever they are,
they are very kind.

431
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,115
You come from an old family.

432
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,991
Though not as ancient,
nor as grand as Your Grace's.

433
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,633
The king chooses
to surround himself with commoners.

434
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,989
Men of no distinction.
New men without pedigree.

435
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:42,633
How does that help
the prestige of his crown?

436
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,194
- Your Grace...
- His father only acquired the crown...

437
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:46,673
...by force, not by right.

438
00:43:46,879 --> 00:43:48,517
Your Grace...

439
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,076
...no one wants to return
to the evil days of civil war.

440
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:55,588
What is done is done.

441
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,869
The king is the king.

442
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:01,869
The king is the king.

443
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,388
Wolsey.

444
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,877
A man of the cloth
with a mistress and two children.

445
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:16,555
How do you like this fellow?

446
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,995
Not at all.

447
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,235
We shall talk again.

448
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,154
Tell me about King Francis,
Sir Thomas.

449
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,553
He's 23 years old.

450
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,317
Is he tall?

451
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:40,952
Yes.

452
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:43,638
But ill-proportioned.

453
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,475
What about his legs?

454
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,630
Are his calves strong, like mine?

455
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,354
Your Majesty,
no one has calves like yours.

456
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,871
Is he handsome?

457
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,795
Some people might think so.

458
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,711
- He certainly thinks so himself.
- He's vain?

459
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,869
Your Majesty, he's French.

460
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:17,667
What about his court?

461
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,109
It has a reputation for loose morals
and licentiousness...

462
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,834
...which the king, by his own
behaviour, does nothing to dispel.

463
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,154
You have two daughters, Sir Thomas.
How do you protect them?

464
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,668
I keep a watchful eye on them.

465
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:36,394
But I also trust in their goodness
and virtue.

466
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:41,718
You will return immediately to Paris.

467
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:45,912
I'm entrusting you with all the
diplomatic negotiations for the summit.

468
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:55,191
Checkmate.

469
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:57,718
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

470
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:00,314
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

471
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:03,071
Mary.

472
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:05,193
Papa.

473
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:08,197
Aren't you beautiful?
The most beautiful girl in the world?

474
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:11,871
- I don't know.
- Yes, you are. How do you feel?

475
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,274
- Well.
- Well?

476
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,471
Papa's busy.

477
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:19,352
Be good.
And do everything you're told.

478
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,151
May we speak?

479
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,311
Continue.

480
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:29,874
My Lady.

481
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,469
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

482
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,717
- I do not like it.
- What don't you like?

483
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:50,875
Your beard.

484
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,594
- Nor what it represents.
- Catherine.

485
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:57,632
You are giving my daughter away
to the dauphin and to France.

486
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,557
You did not even consult me.

487
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,632
The Valois are the sworn enemies
of my family.

488
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:09,117
She is mine to do with, as I see fit.
It's a great marriage.

489
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,668
I see Wolsey's hand behind this.

490
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,872
Though I love Your Majesty...

491
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,470
...and am loyal to you in every way...

492
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:30,517
...I cannot disguise my distress
and unhappiness.

493
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,237
Well, you're going to have to.

494
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:53,230
Where are my daughters?

495
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,512
I have some exciting news.
There is to be a summit...

496
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,507
...between King Francis and King Henry
near Calais. I am to arrange it.

497
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:05,550
That means you'll have the opportunity
to meet the king of England.

498
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:09,473
Mary...

499
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:17,870
...and Anne Boleyn. To your futures.

500
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,470
His Eminence Cardinal Wolsey.

501
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,469
I want your opinion.

502
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:29,517
Do you like this cloth?

503
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:31,954
I think it suits Your Majesty
very well.

504
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,992
Perhaps, if I might suggest...

505
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,671
...with these.

506
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:49,752
Do you think Francis
will have anything as fine as these?

507
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:52,314
Only if he steals them.

508
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:54,472
Come.

509
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,588
Let's eat together. We can talk.

510
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:07,627
Hold.

511
00:49:22,399 --> 00:49:24,117
Your Grace will apologise.

512
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,510
I said, you will apologise.

513
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,989
I apologise if I have offended,
Your Majesty.

514
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:38,634
Your Grace may leave us.

515
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,433
Boy, fetch the chancellor
a new pair of shoes.

516
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:47,671
Hopkins.

517
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:51,195
Hopkins.

518
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,354
Your Grace.

519
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,194
It's time.

520
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,197
Speak to me.

521
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:18,517
Yes, well,
everything is prepared for the summit.

522
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,711
It will take place in the Pale of Calais.
English territory.

523
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:25,548
In a valley known as the Val d'Or.
The valley of gold.

524
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:29,395
A thousand labourers have constructed
a palace for Your Majesty.

525
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,317
It's known as the palace of illusion.

526
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,356
Some say
it's the eighth wonder of the world.

527
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:40,033
Purchase cloth of gold and silver. It's
a better thing to bribe the guards with.

528
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,274
Yes, Your Grace.

529
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:44,118
Then proceed to our estates
and do as we discussed.

530
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,391
Just making noise that we're
only raising men to defend ourselves.

531
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:48,634
Yes, your Grace.

532
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,149
Lady Blount is with child.

533
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:03,838
Lady Blount.

534
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,231
If you want to keep the child,
I will arrange for her...

535
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,351
...to be moved to the house in Jericho.

536
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,548
I will also deal with her husband.

537
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:21,748
My father once told me how he'd
planned to assassinate Richard III.

538
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,754
He would come before him
with a knife secreted about his person.

539
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:30,910
Your Majesty.

540
00:52:05,399 --> 00:52:07,594
I can't wait for this summit.

541
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:10,715
It will change the world forever.

542
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,389
That is my dearest hope,
and my ultimate belief.

543
00:52:15,919 --> 00:52:19,594
Nothing will ever be the same,
Your Eminence.

544
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,233
You and I will be immortal.
