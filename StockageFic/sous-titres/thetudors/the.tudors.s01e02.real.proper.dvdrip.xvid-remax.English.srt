1
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:05,549
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,750
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,669
- Halt.
- Halt!

4
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,076
There it is.

5
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,516
Val D'Or.

6
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,549
The Valley of Gold.

7
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,193
- What if the French don't show?
- Oh, they'll show.

8
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,469
They'll just be fashionably late.

9
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,551
Your Majesty, look. There they are.

10
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,837
What's the plan?

11
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,428
I was to ride down alone
and meet the king.

12
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,591
It's a trap. What if they mean
to lure you down to kill you?

13
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:10,995
All of you. On pain of death.

14
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,877
Stay.

15
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,430
Come on.

16
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,191
The king.

17
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:45,315
What is thou doing?

18
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,069
- Cousin.
- Cousin.

19
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,747
After you.

20
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,758
After you.

21
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,629
- How do you like my beard?
- You almost look French, you know?

22
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,230
Hear ye. Hear ye.

23
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,674
"I, Henry, by the grace of God
King of England...

24
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,437
...lreland and France, do hereby..."

25
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,118
Stop.

26
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,275
I cannot be that while you are here,
for I would be a liar.

27
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,838
During this summit,
I am simply Henry, King of England.

28
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,636
And I am just Francois.

29
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,588
King of France and Burgundy.

30
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,029
Majesties, may I ask you each
to place a hand upon the Holy Bible...

31
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:28,790
...and swear before God and these
princes and lords here gathered...

32
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,113
...that you will be true, virtuous,
and loving to each other.

33
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,147
I so swear.

34
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,357
I swear too. Of course.

35
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,117
Princess Mary.

36
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,517
May I introduce Prince Henry Philip,
your future husband?

37
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,717
Are you the Dauphin of France?

38
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,988
Then I want to kiss you.

39
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,997
Mary.

40
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:59,388
I have got to get one of these.

41
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,673
Palace of Illusions.
What do you think?

42
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,995
It's incredible, Your Majesty.

43
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,878
It's only painted canvas.

44
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,717
- But real wine.
- Don't drink too much of it, Charles.

45
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,878
Your Majesty.

46
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,392
And now I have a gift for you.

47
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,753
- You embarrass me, brother.
- Oh, no.

48
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:27,912
And all I can give you in return
is this pastry.

49
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,350
What are you thinking, Charles?

50
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:34,029
I'm thinking that, while I'm here I
should behave like the King of France.

51
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,507
Which means?

52
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,916
Which means I shall slip readily
into the gardens of others...

53
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,111
...and drink water
from many fountains, eh?

54
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,994
Do you see
that young woman over there?

55
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,594
Dressed in purple and gold?

56
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,311
Yes.

57
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,152
Her name is Mary Boleyn,
the daughter of the ambassador...

58
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,397
...with her sister Anne.

59
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:07,469
I call Mary my English mare
because I ride her so often.

60
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,311
Gentlemen.

61
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,273
Thomas.

62
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,271
Papa.

63
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,917
King Henry noticed you today.

64
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,195
He wants to see you.

65
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,714
Wait.

66
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,590
I must go and tell Anne.

67
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,667
Anne.

68
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,478
What's your name, boy?

69
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,589
Thomas Tallis, Your Majesty.

70
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,155
Tallis. Good voice.

71
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,355
- Take a sovereign for your song.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

72
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,752
- Boleyn.
- What of Buckingham?

73
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,394
In my presence,
he has railed against your eminence.

74
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,749
Calling you a necromancer, a pimp.

75
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,275
Accusing you of using evil ways
to maintain your hold over the king.

76
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,434
And what did Lord Buckingham say
about the king?

77
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,674
He told me
he has a greater claim to the throne.

78
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,991
And that as His Majesty
has no male heirs, and will have none...

79
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:48,033
...that he, Buckingham,
will succeed to the throne.

80
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,189
But he also told me
that he has considered...

81
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,674
...bringing that eventuality
forward more quickly.

82
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:59,270
- In what way?
- By assassinating His Majesty.

83
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,592
You did well to come to me.

84
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:12,716
But I must warn you,
say nothing of this to anyone.

85
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,272
You see that, brother?
In most things, we French excel you.

86
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,192
We have the greatest painters...

87
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,038
...the greatest musicians
and the greatest poets.

88
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,358
Most of whom, by the way,
live at my court de ma cie.

89
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,911
The greatest philosophical minds,
engineers, architects.

90
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,395
And of course,
we have the most beautiful women.

91
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,468
You won't deny that, will you?

92
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,111
Even our wrestlers
are better than yours.

93
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,829
- Are you sure?
- What?

94
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,594
I said are you sure
all your wrestlers are better than mine?

95
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,558
Do you wanna prove it?

96
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,033
What are you suggesting?

97
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,511
I am challenging you
to a wrestling match, brother.

98
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,987
No.

99
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:31,473
You're a coward.

100
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:36,596
The French honour is at stake.
I accept your challenge.

101
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,238
- Let's do it now.
- Groom.

102
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,236
- Your Majesty...
- No.

103
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,837
Majesties, gentlemen.

104
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,194
The rules are as follows:

105
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,108
First man to throw his opponent to the
ground shall be declared the winner.

106
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:25,753
- Are you content?
- Yes.

107
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,351
Then fight on.

108
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,432
- What bet will you lay?
- Come on, Henry.

109
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,028
- Two kings, two queens and a fool.
- Who's the fool?

110
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,588
I don't know yet, but it's a full house.

111
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,198
Come on, Your Majesty.

112
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,192
Henry's gonna win.

113
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,037
Whatever happens,
he's not gonna win.

114
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,356
- Come on, Henry.
- Come on, Henry, you got him.

115
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,270
Come on. Come on.

116
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,468
- Come on, monsieur.
- Yes.

117
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,957
I want a rematch. I want a rematch.

118
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,474
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a rematch?

119
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,597
Are you calling me afraid?
Of what am I supposed to be afraid?

120
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,875
- Of me!
- Let's have it then.

121
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,878
I'm not gonna sign this treaty.
I'm not gonna sign it, go and tell them.

122
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:01,996
- Lf that's what you...
- Go and tell them.

123
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,269
All right.
If you want the world to know...

124
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:08,154
...that the king is changeable, shallow,
intemperate...

125
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,795
...incapable of keeping his word,
then, of course, I will go and tell them.

126
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,597
After all, I am merely
Your Majesty's humble servant.

127
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:30,154
- Lady Mary.
- Your Majesty.

128
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,554
I have heard a lot about you.

129
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:46,156
You've been at the French court
for two years.

130
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,838
Tell me.

131
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:56,837
What French graces
have you learned?

132
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,831
- With Your Majesty's permission?
- Granted.

133
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,276
And now I ask his gracious Majesty,
the King of England...

134
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:21,111
...to also sign in good faith, the Treaty
of Universal and Perpetual Peace.

135
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,758
Leave.

136
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,835
Forget about the French,
the Queen's nephew has been elected.

137
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,229
Now he is not only Charles V,
the King of Spain,

138
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,589
...he's also the Holy Roman Emperor.

139
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,553
His dominions are vast,
his wealth extraordinary.

140
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,750
And he's only 20 years old.

141
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,347
You will make arrangements
to visit him at Aachen. Personally.

142
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,236
It may suit us better to do business
with him than with the French.

143
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,635
Yes, Majesty.

144
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,629
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

145
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,154
Your Grace...

146
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,634
What did you think
of that performance?

147
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,831
- L...
- Don't be stupid, you're not.

148
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,599
The king's performance at the summit.

149
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,318
How did it strike you?

150
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,113
Personally, I would have wished
to have seen a greater...

151
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,311
...more powerful man
upon the throne of England.

152
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,874
Someone whose presence...

153
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,513
...would have made the French
sit up and come to heel.

154
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,789
I have the way and the means
to crush the usurper of my throne...

155
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:54,035
...as one would crush
a revolting spider.

156
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,479
I will make him wish
he'd entered the Church after all...

157
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,035
...and left the affairs of the state
to those who are born to rule.

158
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:11,633
You betray me, Boleyn,
I'll feed your body to me dogs.

159
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,796
Now,
what have you discovered here?

160
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,638
I have it on good authority...

161
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,275
...that the Duke of Buckingham
is raising an army.

162
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,956
He says it's to protect him
while he tours his Welsh estates...

163
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,672
...where he's not popular.

164
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,512
He's also been borrowing
large sums of money.

165
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,352
Buckingham?

166
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:57,479
Invite him to court for the New Year.
But don't say anything to alarm him.

167
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,396
How are your children?

168
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,988
They're well, thank you,
Your Majesty.

169
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:23,191
I encourage them all at their studies.
Even the girls.

170
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,878
Always the idealist.

171
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,035
At some point, I imagine,
it will be considered ordinary enough...

172
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,231
...and nothing strange
for a girl to be educated.

173
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,554
I've received a gift
from the Duke of Urbino.

174
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,996
It's a book called The Prince,
by a Florentine, Niccolo Machiavelli.

175
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:44,987
Yes, I know it.
It's about political opportunism.

176
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,836
It's true.

177
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,309
It's not like your book Utopia.

178
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:55,712
It's less utopian.

179
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:01,517
Nevertheless,
he asks an important question:

180
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:06,190
Whether it is better for a king
to be feared or loved.

181
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,110
Buckingham is going to try and kill me.

182
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:36,711
- Your Eminence.
- Lady Blount.

183
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:42,395
- You are full term?
- In a little while.

184
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:48,198
- Are you well?
- As can be expected.

185
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,589
Have you some message
from His Majesty?

186
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:54,868
No, none. But from your husband.

187
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,636
My husband.

188
00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:00,518
Yes, I have spoken to him.

189
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:05,554
He finds that he has reconciled
to your condition.

190
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,517
Then he won't send me to a nunnery?

191
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:12,269
He will be made an earl,
and given estates.

192
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,632
And my child?

193
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:21,914
That is for the king to decide
whether he will recognise the child.

194
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,679
I'm afraid I can offer you
no more comfort than that.

195
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,476
Will you tell the king
of my love for him?

196
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:59,588
My lord, I hereby pledge my allegiance
to you and your house.

197
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,592
And do swear to serve you,
even unto death.

198
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,472
We thank you
from the bottom of our heart.

199
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,198
And in due course, you will find your
loyalties richly and properly rewarded.

200
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,358
I thought I should tell you.

201
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,952
I'm being sent to meet
the new Holy Roman Emperor.

202
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:30,276
The king has asked me to draw up
a new treaty...

203
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,431
...uniting us against the French.

204
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:39,034
- You must be very disappointed.
- I am very realistic.

205
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,432
Then I am disappointed.

206
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,275
- Our dreams were very unrealistic.
- Maybe so.

207
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,718
But I will continue to dream them,
even if I am alone in doing so.

208
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,310
I fear His Majesty no longer
trusts or cares for me as he once did.

209
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,594
Thomas,
let me give you a little advice.

210
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,314
If you want to keep the love of a prince,
this is what you must do.

211
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,798
You must be prepared to give him the
thing you most care for in all the world.

212
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,712
The thing I care for most
is my integrity.

213
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,876
What is it you care for most
in the world, Your Eminence?

214
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,189
His Grace, the Duke of Norfolk.

215
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,317
Your Grace.

216
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:04,027
I hope Your Majesty will accept
this humble gift for the New Year.

217
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,794
We are very grateful to Your Grace.
Your generosity overwhelms me.

218
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,791
As always.

219
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,674
Lie down.

220
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:28,997
- Get some linens.
- His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham.

221
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,111
Your Grace.

222
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:53,871
Your Majesty.

223
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:02,231
- It has some words engraved on it.
- Give it to me.

224
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,038
"With humble, true hearts."

225
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:15,394
Your Grace overwhelms me.
Your words touch me.

226
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,755
They are the greatest gift.

227
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,758
Greater than any riches.

228
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,513
Push, my Lady. Push.

229
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,309
Breathe. It's coming.

230
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,236
With true and humble heart.

231
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,318
There.

232
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,150
Hold, Your Grace.

233
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,468
What do you want?

234
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:41,313
Your Grace is arrested
on suspicion of treason.

235
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:45,552
I'm ordered by the king's majesty
to take you to the Tower.

236
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,875
You take my advice, gentlemen,
you let us pass.

237
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:50,513
By no means.
And if any of your men should strike...

238
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:53,916
...against His Majesty's servants
in pursuit of their duties...

239
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,917
...that's treason too.
As Your Grace should know.

240
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,752
Your Grace.

241
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,150
You. You are only new men.
You don't know anything.

242
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,398
If I am accused of treason...

243
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,598
...I should be judged by a jury of my
peers, not by the dogs of butchers.

244
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,229
There's no lord in England
who will ever find against me.

245
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,787
Form them up.

246
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,394
I have instituted a Court of High
Steward to judge Buckingham's case.

247
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:41,709
Twenty peers will be appointed
to the court.

248
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,511
Norfolk will be first among them.

249
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,628
- Your Majesty, if I may?
- What?

250
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,948
I believe it could be dangerous
to find the duke guilty of treason.

251
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,359
- Even if he is?
- Even if he is.

252
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,638
On the other hand, he could be
found guilty of some lesser offence.

253
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,034
Heavily fined and banished from court.

254
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:07,549
In that way, he would be disgraced,
but his friends and allies...

255
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,388
...would have little cause or occasion
to rise against you.

256
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,514
- And that would be the best outcome?
- I believe it would, yes.

257
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,792
And you would see to it
that the court come to that decision?

258
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,075
I have every confidence.

259
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:29,152
As I have in Your Eminence.

260
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,268
Wolsey will set up the court.
Norfolk will head it.

261
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,471
I want you to remind His Grace
of his responsibilities.

262
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,590
14-30.
Chase to four, gentlemen.

263
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,232
Ball.

264
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,517
Mary?

265
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:55,189
Does the king
still call for you at night?

266
00:33:58,639 --> 00:33:59,913
No, Papa.

267
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,556
Even though the king is your godfather,
when you approach him...

268
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,838
Your Grace.

269
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,428
What do you want?

270
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,277
Only to pass on His Majesty's love.

271
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,909
He appreciates the role you will play
at my Lord Buckingham's trial...

272
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,475
...and for all the care you have
for His Majesty's well-being.

273
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,594
He also sends you this.

274
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,272
This is my father's ring.

275
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,749
He was executed by His Majesty's
father, did you know that?

276
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,714
His Majesty thought
you might like to wear it.

277
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:57,355
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.

278
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,512
And he's going to be received
by his godfather, the king.

279
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,429
Your Grace should have a care
for his inheritance.

280
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,435
It would be terrible
if some action of yours...

281
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,508
...were to deprive him of a father,
a title and a ring.

282
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,030
Your Grace.

283
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:50,868
Your Grace
has been accused of treason...

284
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,867
...and of imagining and plotting
the death of the king's majesty.

285
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,118
This court of High Steward...

286
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,231
...after reviewing all the evidence
against Your Grace...

287
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,551
...finds Your Grace
guilty of the charges against you.

288
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,314
No.

289
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:16,871
And so sentences Your Grace to death
at His Majesty's pleasure.

290
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,547
This is your doing.

291
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,829
Butcher's dog.

292
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,957
It's all your doing!

293
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,517
Bastards!

294
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,151
Your Majesty.

295
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,707
God bless you, sir.

296
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,277
Take this, Your Grace.

297
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,997
Traitor.

298
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,518
Do you forgive me?

299
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,229
Your Grace must lie down.

300
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:14,552
When you stretch out your arms,
I will strike.

301
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,909
Stretch out your arms.

302
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,428
I have a son. I have a son.

303
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,351
Thank God.

304
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,831
Thank God.

305
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,310
Come on, you charlatan.

306
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,468
I have a son!

307
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,631
I have a son, God.

308
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,469
Can you hear me? I have a son.

309
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,629
Your Majesty is to be congratulated
on such a happy event.

310
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,949
Thank you, Your Eminence.

311
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:30,151
The Lady is upstairs.

312
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,198
- Henry, congratulations.
- Thank you, Charles.

313
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:43,870
- I always knew it wasn't my fault.
- No.

314
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:55,231
His Majesty
has decided to recognise his son.

315
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:58,511
He will be known for the present
as Henry Fitzroy.

316
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,109
And he will have his own establishment
at Durham House...

317
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,518
...with a chaplain, officer
and a retinue befitting his station.

318
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,712
Thank you.

319
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,634
You should write
and thank His Majesty.

320
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,228
I only do his bidding.

321
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:25,668
The queen. The queen.

322
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:02,707
To my son.

323
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,674
What was your deal with Wolsey?

324
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,149
In return for England
not going to war with France...

325
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,271
...I promised him the French vote.

326
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:43,949
The fact is, Wolsey has gone to Aachen
to meet the new emperor.

327
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,595
He obviously means to break the treaty
with your king.

328
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,557
In which case...

329
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:53,638
...we are no longer obliged
to deliver our side of the bargain.

330
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,155
In any case,
we don't want an English Pope.

331
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,428
We had one once.

332
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,631
He was insane. Never again.

333
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,354
The Pope must be an Italian.
That is God's will.

334
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:21,594
- Your Holiness must swallow it.
- Push it.

335
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:28,391
My Lady, full of grace, I pray you,
I beseech you in all humility...

336
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,831
...for the love I bear for you,
and for your son, Jesus Christ.

337
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,231
I pray you give me a child.

338
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:40,988
A son to fill my empty womb.

339
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:44,109
I beg you.

340
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,153
In a few weeks, the court
will quit Whitehall for Hampton Court.

341
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:03,474
There's been an incident
of Sweating Sickness in the city.

342
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,268
You know how afraid the king is
of any illness.

343
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,307
How is the king?

344
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,471
I was sorry to hear
of Cardinal Orsini's election as Pope.

345
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,758
You are perpetually sorry, More.

346
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:29,791
- I wasn't simply being polite.
- Oh, really?

347
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:31,557
I was not.

348
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,434
As long as there is such corruption
in the Church...

349
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,278
...that heretic Luther
will continue to gain followers.

350
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:42,630
I know that if you had been elected
he would have worked tirelessly...

351
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,353
...to cleanse the Church
of all its evil practises.

352
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:52,595
Perhaps you think too highly of me,
Thomas.

353
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:58,074
Perhaps, you think too highly
of the whole human race.

354
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:11,509
- Lady Blount.
- Mr. More.

355
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,915
The queen.

356
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:25,917
My lady.

357
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,755
The queen.

358
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:09,831
- Uncle.
- Anne.

359
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:30,429
- Sweet Anne.
- Yes, Papa.

360
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:33,517
- You know why you're here?
- No, Papa.

361
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:37,428
- In Paris no one explained.
- Good, it's better that way.

362
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,554
What's happened?

363
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:42,319
His Majesty is tiring
of his French alliance.

364
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,314
It seems he's also tiring of your sister.
He no longer invites her to his bed.

365
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:51,309
- Poor Mary.
- Poor us.

366
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,716
When she was his mistress,
all our fortunes were made.

367
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:57,672
Now most likely they will fall.

368
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:00,591
Unless...

369
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,947
Even if he had me,
who is to say he would keep me?

370
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,754
It's not just Mary. They say
that all his liaisons are soon over.

371
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:16,678
He blows hot, he blows cold.

372
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,232
Perhaps you could imagine a way
to keep his interest more...

373
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,151
...prolonged?

374
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:27,957
I daresay
you learned things in France.

375
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,508
How to play his passions?

376
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,073
There's something
deep and dangerous in you, Anne.

377
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,638
Those eyes of yours
are like dark hooks for the soul.

378
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:53,311
How was your meeting
with the emperor?

379
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,350
Good. Productive.

380
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,312
He makes no secret
of his antipathy for the French.

381
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,797
He wants to go to war with them...

382
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,275
...and he's desperate
for an alliance with Your Majesty.

383
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:09,396
And in return for our alliance?

384
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,435
There will be a joint invasion of France
for the overthrow of King Francis.

385
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,429
And I shall claim the crown.

386
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,394
And once more truly be King
of England, Ireland and France.

387
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,874
Just like my forefathers.

388
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,876
Your Eminence has built
the most beautiful palace here.

389
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,992
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Probably the finest house in England.

390
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:43,713
I have nothing to compare with it.
Nothing to show more fair.

391
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:52,876
Your Majesty...

392
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:56,870
...it is yours.

393
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:05,267
With the furnishings?

394
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:17,947
Come on.
