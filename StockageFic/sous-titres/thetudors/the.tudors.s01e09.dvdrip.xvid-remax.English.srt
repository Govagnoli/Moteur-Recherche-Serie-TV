1
00:00:01,025 --> 00:00:04,335
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:09,537
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,182
My lords.

4
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,819
In the absence
of the queen herself...

5
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,539
...whom this tribunal
has pronounced contumacious...

6
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:38,782
...since she does not appear
when summoned.

7
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,976
We are trying to determine
whether or not...

8
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,062
...her first marriage
to Prince Arthur...

9
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:48,339
...was in fact
consummated in carnal copula.

10
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:51,981
We call a witness.
Sir Anthony Willoughby.

11
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:06,503
I understand you were in the escort
taking Prince Arthur to the nuptial bed?

12
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:10,340
I was, sir. My father was at the time
steward of the king's household.

13
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:17,024
So, I was present when the prince was
inserted into Lady Catherine's bed...

14
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,864
...and also
when he woke in the morning.

15
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:24,178
And did the prince say anything to you
when you saw him in the morning?

16
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:27,377
Yes, sir.
He said, "Willoughby, I'm thirsty.

17
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:32,784
Bring me a cup of ale.
Last night, I was in the midst of Spain."

18
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:39,217
Silence. Silence in the court.

19
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:45,654
- Anything else?
- Yes, sir.

20
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:52,014
Later that day he said to us, " Masters,
it's a good pastime to have a wife."

21
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,185
Silence in the court.

22
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:01,896
I believe we may have the bloodstained
sheets to corroborate my lord's story.

23
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:06,815
That would be most useful,
Your Eminence. Most useful.

24
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,857
- Your Majesty.
- Gentlemen.

25
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:48,097
The king asks
why you are not in court.

26
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:50,415
I have given answer to that already.

27
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:54,301
- Could we go somewhere private?
- Why?

28
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:55,824
I have nothing to hide.

29
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,495
Let my ladies and the whole world
hear what you have to say.

30
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:05,141
The king commands that you surrender
this whole matter into his hands.

31
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,143
Otherwise, the court
will condemn you.

32
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,381
I am surprised to receive
such a request...

33
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,702
...from such wise
and noble men as you.

34
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:18,456
I am but a poor woman,
lacking both in wit and understanding.

35
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,816
How am I supposed to respond to
a request made to me out of the blue?

36
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:24,937
You know perfectly what the king
desires and what he shall have.

37
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:28,103
All I know, Eminence, is that you...

38
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:30,500
...for your own purposes,
have kindled this fire.

39
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,458
All this time, all these years...

40
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:37,584
...I have wondered at your high pride
and your vain glory.

41
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,578
I have abhorred your voluptuous life
and had no regard...

42
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:43,504
...for your presumptuous power
and your tyranny.

43
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:46,902
I know also of your malice
against my nephew, the emperor.

44
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:50,575
You hate him like a scorpion.
And why?

45
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:55,094
Because he would not satisfy your
ambition and make you pope by force.

46
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,943
You should never presume to know...

47
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,375
My only satisfaction
is that in frustrating you...

48
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,894
...I hasten your fall
from the king's good graces.

49
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:06,223
An outcome I desire
above all others.

50
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:17,776
Hold, Your Eminence.
You will not get your divorce this way.

51
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:21,060
It is the only way.

52
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:33,374
Friend, give me a drink. I'm thirsty.

53
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:38,098
And if you'd all been to Spain as many
times as I went there last night...

54
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,415
...you'd all be fucking thirsty too.

55
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:45,613
In and out, in and out, in and out.

56
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,019
And I'll tell you this, lads.

57
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:54,899
First time I lay with a lady
I was but a chit of a lad.

58
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,542
So high to a grasshopper, I was.
I poked her all night.

59
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,335
A toast, I say a toast.

60
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:07,983
To Queen Catherine.
Who doesn't give a fig.

61
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:10,335
- God bless her.
- To the queen of England!

62
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:19,783
His Majesty, the king.

63
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,899
- My lords.
- Your Majesty.

64
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,417
You look splendid.

65
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:57,978
So my sources have just told me
that the emperor believes...

66
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,177
...Wolsey is to blame
for instigating the divorce.

67
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:04,741
He believes that the people of England
will soon rise up...

68
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:06,981
...and bring that creature
to the scaffold.

69
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,301
His end is surely approaching.

70
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:13,259
After which, Your Grace
will be the first man at court.

71
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:14,814
As you ought to be.

72
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,617
In which case, Boleyn...

73
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:20,181
...I shall not fail to promote
your family's interests.

74
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:25,459
It's true you have risen high.
But you shall rise higher yet.

75
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,137
Did you see?
They were all looking at you.

76
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,941
I'm glad. I want them to look at you.

77
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,943
I want them to be envious.

78
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:47,422
I want all of them to know
exactly how much I love you.

79
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:52,658
Then like my family motto,
I am "the most happy."

80
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:02,097
- How did it go in court today?
- Well enough.

81
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:04,222
Yet Catherine refuses to attend.

82
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:07,182
It will make no difference.

83
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,819
Wolsey promises me
I will have a divorce by summer.

84
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,139
Promises are easy.

85
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:17,343
What if you don't?

86
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,583
Margaret, what is it?

87
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,664
I couldn't sleep.

88
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:39,381
Come back to bed. It's cold.

89
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,338
Not yet.

90
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:47,256
I'm going to court tomorrow.
Will you come?

91
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,303
Your brother has asked again
for your presence.

92
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,856
I told you.

93
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:58,378
Not while he makes love in public
to that Boleyn girl.

94
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,737
It's offensive
and it makes him look like a fool.

95
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:09,498
Everyone else can see how proud
and grasping the Boleyns are.

96
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:13,937
- Why can't he?
- What if he commands you to come?

97
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,937
What is this?

98
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:39,340
Only a wife to a husband.

99
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:47,823
Sleep now, my sweet Charles.

100
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,381
I pray you, sleep.

101
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:49,819
Silence in the court.

102
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:57,261
In the absence of the queen,
we have been asked by her council...

103
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:01,936
...Bishop Fisher,
to make a statement to this court.

104
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,101
And being the circumstances...

105
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:09,379
...we have decided
that such a statement is admissible.

106
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:11,304
Your Grace.

107
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:22,822
Your Honours,
you have been asked to give verdict...

108
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,937
...on the validity
of the royal marriage.

109
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:32,261
Sirs, it is my contention that
this marriage of the king and queen...

110
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:38,176
...can be dissolved by no power,
human or divine.

111
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:44,062
Let me give, if I might,
a Biblical parallel.

112
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:48,975
You will remember, I am sure,
the tyrant Herod Antipas.

113
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,499
Who disembarrassed himself
of his wife.

114
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,055
In order that he might take
his brother's wife.

115
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:57,300
Damn you.

116
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:01,180
And who then executed
John the Baptist...

117
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:05,304
...when he dared to criticize
the royal couple.

118
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:10,416
Just as John the Baptist,
so I, in all humility...

119
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:15,858
...say to you here today
that I am ready to lay down my life.

120
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,544
To lay down my life...

121
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:22,421
...to defend the sanctity of marriage
and to condemn adultery.

122
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,737
Outrageous.

123
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:27,017
Your Honours.

124
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,582
I accuse this man, Bishop Fisher...

125
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:35,580
...of arrogance, temerity
and disloyalty.

126
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:41,613
I demand that you disregard
every vile word.

127
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:51,300
Thomas. Come in.

128
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,417
- Drink?
- Not for me, thank you.

129
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,024
No.

130
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:01,385
I have a mission for you, Thomas.

131
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:06,539
The French and lmperial forces
have ceased their aggression.

132
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,738
There is to be some sort of conference
at a place called Cambria, in France...

133
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:15,655
...between their negotiators and also
with representatives of the pope.

134
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:19,782
I, of course, am unable to attend.

135
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:22,374
Now the vital thing, Thomas...

136
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:27,140
...is that there be no agreement
between the other two parties.

137
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:30,178
I have had private reassurances
from the king of France...

138
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,501
Who is, after all, our ally.

139
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:37,221
- That he will never make peace with
the emperor, under any circumstances.

140
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:40,298
Similarly, there must there be
no rapprochement...

141
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:43,542
...between the Holy Father
and the emperor.

142
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,895
You must understand
under those circumstances...

143
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:49,939
...it would be impossible for the pope
to grant the king his desire.

144
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:53,497
- Yes, I do understand.
- Now...

145
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,294
You have your principles,
I understand that.

146
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,338
But for the love we both have
for the king...

147
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:06,094
...your job at Cambria
is to be as obstructive as possible.

148
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,013
Don't let Francis renege
on his commitments to us.

149
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:12,058
And don't let the pope forget
that it was Charles' forces...

150
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,574
...that invaded and sacked Rome.

151
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,901
And there is one other thing.

152
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,533
More than this?

153
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:24,061
Try to discover, by subtle means,
through his agents...

154
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:28,497
...if the emperor is prepared
to support his aunt by use of force.

155
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:31,543
You think he might invade England
in support of the queen?

156
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:36,381
I don't think anything.
But I imagine everything.

157
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:40,381
And it is those imaginings
that cause me great pain, Thomas.

158
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,657
Great pain.

159
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:46,094
But then wasn't it you that said:

160
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:50,423
"No man can expect to go to heaven
on a feather bed."

161
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,742
Have you no kind things to say?

162
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:13,499
- Kind?
- To your wife.

163
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,339
The mother of your child.

164
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:19,423
You treat me so unkindly.
And in public, neglect me.

165
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,338
Catherine,
you must accept the inevitable.

166
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:25,139
The weight of academic opinion
is against us.

167
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:29,822
We were never legally man and wife.
And the court will decide in my favour.

168
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:32,215
And if the court does not decide
in my favour...

169
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:36,424
...I shall denounce the pope as
a heretic and marry whom I please.

170
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,418
Sweetheart.

171
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:51,300
By all the angels,
I was intact when I came to your bed.

172
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,934
All right.
So you were a fucking virgin!

173
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:56,101
That's not the point.

174
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:10,095
Did I not tell you that if you argued
with her she'd have the upper hand?

175
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:13,854
I see now, one morning you'll succumb
to her reasoning and cast me off!

176
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,862
What do you mean?

177
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:20,856
- Anne, I love you.
- Let me go, let me go.

178
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:24,783
Why don't you see?
Why can't you understand?

179
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,216
I've been waiting for so long.
For what?

180
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,213
I could have contracted
some advantageous marriage...

181
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:35,174
...and borne sons which is a woman's
greatest consolation in this life.

182
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:38,616
Instead, I've been wasting my time
and my youth. For no purpose at all.

183
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,100
Anne, stop this.

184
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:44,024
You will have sons.
We will have sons.

185
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,779
No, no. It's too late.

186
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,903
Your wife won't let you go.
I should have realized.

187
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,663
- Where are you going?
- Home.

188
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,140
Stay here, I beg you. Anne.

189
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:56,984
I'm the king of England!

190
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:01,254
Make way for His Grace. Make way.

191
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,138
Your Eminence.

192
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:20,340
- An urgent message from the pope.
- Thank you, kind sir.

193
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:33,974
Look.
He is always leaning on someone.

194
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:38,018
Perhaps
someone should lean on him.

195
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,136
Perhaps.

196
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,295
- Your Eminence.
- Your Majesty.

197
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:49,857
- I trust we will soon have a verdict.
- Indeed.

198
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,374
We hear with great distress
of events in Germany.

199
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,937
- The destruction of the churches.
- Melancholy events, Majesty.

200
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,381
But why is it happening?

201
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,499
Majesty?

202
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:11,016
I'll tell you.

203
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,743
The Lutherans attack what they see
as the wickedness of Rome.

204
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,935
They believe
corruption is rewarded...

205
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:23,134
...but the faithful are abandoned
and badly treated.

206
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,177
I am a man of faith, Your Eminence.

207
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:35,777
God forbid His Holiness
should ever turn his back on me.

208
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:21,218
Alas, my love, you do me wrong

209
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:25,862
To treat me so discourteously

210
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:29,222
Don't you ever get tired of it,
Charles?

211
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,541
Of course. Then I go to sleep.

212
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,940
I bet you dream of women too.

213
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:38,736
No, I dream of God.
Of heaven and hell and of repentance.

214
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:41,417
Since you asked.

215
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,380
What are you thinking, Anthony?

216
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:56,739
I'm listening to that song,
and I'm thinking, omnia vincit amor.

217
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:03,858
No one can resist love.

218
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:19,936
- My lord.
- Your Majesty.

219
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:27,100
Please ask Anne to come back to court.
I beg you for my sake.

220
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,261
I can't live without her.

221
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:34,256
Tomorrow I shall have my verdict
and I shall be free.

222
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,817
Majesty.

223
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:05,940
Eminences, in accordance with
the rules and laws of this tribunal...

224
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,817
...and the wishes of His Majesty.

225
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:11,301
I ask you officially
to deliver your judgement.

226
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:19,456
Your Majesty, my lords.

227
00:21:19,665 --> 00:21:22,179
After much deliberation,
we have decided...

228
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:26,219
...that this great matter is too important
to be here decided...

229
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:30,543
...without consultation
with the curia at Rome.

230
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:35,421
Unfortunately,
the curia is now in summer recess.

231
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,776
In which case,
there is no alternative...

232
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:44,935
...but to prorogue this tribunal
until October 1 st.

233
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,295
That is our judgement.

234
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,777
You stupid cunt.

235
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:49,381
It's never been good to be in England
while we have cardinals among us!

236
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:53,055
Are you so dense
that you really think this is my doing?

237
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:57,338
And of all people, you have the least
cause to be offended by cardinals.

238
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:01,936
If it wasn't for me, a simple cardinal,
sometimes having praised you...

239
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:05,501
...you would no longer have
a head on your shoulders.

240
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:12,294
Happy day.

241
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:13,859
Indeed, Senor Mendoza.

242
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:21,417
Campeggio received secret
instructions from His Holiness...

243
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,264
...who has advocated the matter
back to Rome.

244
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,099
I was not abandoned.

245
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,058
The emperor worked tirelessly
for your cause.

246
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,662
It is true you are leaving?

247
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,576
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:41,821
Ambassador Chapuys
will replace me.

249
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,217
I know him.

250
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,703
He's a most trustworthy person...

251
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:50,778
...and will take up your defence
with fidelity and diligence.

252
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:54,261
As you have done, Senor Mendoza.

253
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:05,221
In memory of me.

254
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:17,339
Majesty.

255
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:36,662
Thomas, how very good to see you.
How is the king?

256
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:43,063
The king is going on a progress.
Immediately.

257
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:46,099
With the Lady Anne.

258
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,704
I see.

259
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,815
Tell His Majesty that I am
handing over to him at once...

260
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,141
...the entire revenues
of the see of Durham.

261
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:55,983
It is one of the richest in England.

262
00:24:56,185 --> 00:25:00,861
And tell him I shall not cease to work
for his great matter.

263
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:06,139
Campeggio and I will gladly accomplish
his lawful desire. Do you see?

264
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:09,858
- I shall tell him.
- And Thomas...

265
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:19,855
Tell me I can trust you
to advocate my interests to the king.

266
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,663
You may.

267
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:29,180
For without you, I would be
a lowly clerk, without profit or future.

268
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,741
I owe you my life.

269
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,304
I've been summoned to Rome.

270
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:59,065
I have to appear before the pope
and answer for myself.

271
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:00,334
Can you imagine it?

272
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:05,539
Me, the king of England,
who answers to no authority, but God!

273
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:09,135
Damn Wolsey. Damn him to hell.

274
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:12,775
- May I speak plainly?
- Yes, of course.

275
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,776
There are some who on good authority
care not for popes.

276
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:19,780
These writers say that the king...

277
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:23,944
...is both emperor and pope
absolutely in his own kingdom.

278
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:25,978
Which writers?

279
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,458
I have a book to show you,
with your permission?

280
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:37,017
Show it to me.

281
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:26,421
Softly love and to love softly.

282
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,021
Dew on the sycamore branch.

283
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:33,264
By the creaking gate.
Where my heart hurries afterwards.

284
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:38,539
Through the path of wheat,
along the briar, to that stone.

285
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:40,975
Under which I lie.

286
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:10,694
- Thank you for the audience.
- Very well, my lords.

287
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:13,624
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.

288
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:15,218
Lord Rochford?

289
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:18,019
Majesty, the new lmperial Ambassador,
Mr. Chapuys...

290
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,183
...asks permission to present
his credentials to the queen.

291
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,741
Granted.
My lord, is there anything else?

292
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:28,183
Your Majesty, Cardinal Campeggio
is returning to Rome...

293
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:31,616
...and would like to take
his formal leave of Your Majesty.

294
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:34,863
Very well.

295
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,819
Mr. Cromwell,
invite him here to Grafton House.

296
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:42,978
Also Wolsey. Anything else?

297
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,699
Your Grace?

298
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:56,101
Majesty, forgive me.

299
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,377
Margaret is dead.

300
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:14,703
She died of consumption.

301
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:40,858
You never even told me
she was sick.

302
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:35,902
If that's the king's sister,
why isn't the king here?

303
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:38,414
- The king cannot go to funerals.
- Why?

304
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,934
No one is allowed
to imagine the death of the king.

305
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:42,897
For that would be treason.

306
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,584
Forgive me.

307
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,103
I'm sorry.

308
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,461
Come, come, Thomas.
Tell me what happened.

309
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:04,538
I take it you arrived at Cambria
on time?

310
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:08,181
Not exactly. We were a week late.

311
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:10,697
A week?

312
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:14,417
Then how could you have contributed
to the substantive arguments?

313
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:18,101
No, we couldn't. We weren't privy
to the main discussions.

314
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,664
We were only able to enter into
negotiations with the major parties.

315
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:24,577
What negotiations?

316
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,253
Well, I'm happy to report
that we secured a return...

317
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,501
...to mutually beneficial
trade relations...

318
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,616
...between ourselves
and the Low Countries.

319
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:34,703
We also obtained guarantees
regarding long-standing payments...

320
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,577
...owing to the king by the emperor.

321
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,580
But the major disputes, Thomas.
The major disputes!

322
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:44,017
What happened? Did the king
of France refuse to make peace?

323
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:45,453
No.

324
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:51,219
No, on the contrary, he settled
all his differences with the emperor.

325
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:56,504
Both of them settled their differences
with His Holiness Pope Clement.

326
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,859
In other words,
we were deliberately sidelined.

327
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,583
If you choose to put it like that.

328
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:21,457
Now there is no chance that the pope
will give the king his divorce.

329
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,578
Tell me, Thomas.

330
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:32,657
What exactly do you think
you might have achieved at Cambria...

331
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:35,538
...that makes you look so smug?

332
00:34:38,425 --> 00:34:39,858
With respect, Your Eminence...

333
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:42,533
...to some degree
it wasn't for me to achieve anything.

334
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:47,422
Yet I consider this diplomacy
to be somewhat successful.

335
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,225
Once more, there is peace in Europe.

336
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:53,536
England is at peace with the empire.

337
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:58,656
More importantly, papal authority
is restored and recognized.

338
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,176
That is what I believe in.

339
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:06,978
- Francis betrayed me.
- Francis saw the futility of war.

340
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:11,098
He recognized the need for tradition.

341
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:14,699
And you, Thomas...

342
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,974
...you have destroyed me.

343
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:39,255
Make way.

344
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:02,054
This way, Your Excellency.

345
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,175
Your Honour's chamber.

346
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:25,298
Thank you.

347
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:38,258
Wait. Wait.

348
00:36:39,785 --> 00:36:41,013
Where is my chamber?

349
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,574
There is none prepared for you,
Your Eminence.

350
00:36:46,265 --> 00:36:48,096
I must change
from my riding clothes.

351
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,219
Then you had best ask elsewhere.

352
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,423
Your Eminence.

353
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:12,977
- Mr. Norris.
- Use my room.

354
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:15,255
It's not much, but...

355
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:18,104
I'll have your trunk sent up.

356
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:21,902
When you've changed,
you are to go to the presence chamber.

357
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:24,937
I am very grateful to you, Norris.

358
00:37:25,145 --> 00:37:29,104
There are many here, sir,
who have cause to be grateful to you.

359
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,944
Though alas, they do not show it.

360
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,182
Cardinals Wolsey and Campeggio.

361
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:24,341
I hear you have been unwell.
Is it true?

362
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:29,738
Majesty, when was I ever
unwell enough not to serve you?

363
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:34,817
That's what I thought.
They tell such lies, these people.

364
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:42,416
Who can I trust?

365
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:48,137
We've come a long way together,
you and I, cardinal.

366
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,058
Did you think I'd forget?

367
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:53,257
And there is still
a great deal more to do.

368
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,693
I know, I know.

369
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,061
Don't be afraid.

370
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:06,425
We shall talk properly tomorrow.

371
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,661
Good morning, sweetheart.

372
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:54,138
Halt!

373
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:56,779
Stand aside,
I must speak with the king.

374
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:58,899
Stand aside.

375
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,097
Your Majesty.

376
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:07,495
Majesty! Your Majesty!

377
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:09,815
Majesty!

378
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:12,263
Majesty!

379
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,700
Majesty!

380
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,255
Ambassador Chapuys.

381
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:22,576
Your Majesty.

382
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:25,696
I have come at the king's invitation...

383
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:29,136
...to present my credentials
from the emperor.

384
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:31,704
Please.

385
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,221
I am glad to see you.

386
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:43,178
You know your mission has fallen
at a complicated time.

387
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:48,340
Indeed. I see my mission, madame,
as one of toute douceur.

388
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:51,377
All sweetness.

389
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:54,824
May I ask Your Highness
if I should now, at once...

390
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:58,734
...also present my credentials
to His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey?

391
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:03,775
I do not see
that there is such a need as before.

392
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:07,819
The cardinal is somewhat undone.

393
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:11,222
He has been refused permission
to attend court.

394
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:20,179
- Then who should I attend instead?
- Norfolk, Suffolk and Rochford.

395
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,335
They are now closest to the king,
and carry out his affairs.

396
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:27,139
Seek them out,
if you would know things.

397
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:31,940
You should also know, ambassador,
that they are not great friends of mine.

398
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:33,624
Any of them.

399
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:38,656
In fact, better to say,
they are all my mortal enemies.

400
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:44,943
Make way.

401
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:04,657
Cardinal Wolsey,
you are here charged with praemunire.

402
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:08,944
That is exercising your powers
of papal legate in the king's realm.

403
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:11,904
Thus derogating
the king's lawful authority.

404
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,101
You are to be dismissed
of all your offices.

405
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:16,739
And all your goods shall be taken
to the king's hands.

406
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,299
I take it you have the king's
written authority for this?

407
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:35,893
You are commanded to relinquish
the great seal of your office.

408
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:42,423
- And where am I to go?
- To the king's house at Jericho.

409
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:46,458
To await the verdict of the court.

410
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:03,543
Make way for His Lord's Grace there.

411
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:13,581
How about a blessing now,
Your Eminence?

412
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:21,856
My own eternally beloved Cromwell.

413
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:26,741
I beseech you, as you love me
and will ever do anything for me...

414
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:30,255
...come here today,
as soon as your work is finished...

415
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:32,342
...and forgetting everything else.

416
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:37,141
I would not only communicate things
to you for my own comfort and relief...

417
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:43,341
...but would also have your good, sad,
discreet advice and counsel.

418
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:46,543
In haste, this Saturday...

419
00:43:46,745 --> 00:43:52,263
...with the rude hand and sorrowful
heart of your assured who loves you.

420
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:54,057
Wolsey.

421
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:14,344
Wolsey pleaded guilty
to all the charges made against him.

422
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:17,855
Yes, I heard.
And sentenced to prison.

423
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:19,942
I have rescinded his punishment.

424
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:23,217
I've even agreed
to let him keep the Bishopric of York.

425
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:26,064
With a pension of 3000 angels.

426
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,299
You see what kind of monster I am?

427
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:37,263
I need to appoint a new chancellor.
Someone I can trust.

428
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:40,618
You're trained as a lawyer
and in royal service.

429
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:43,739
You have international prestige.

430
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:48,814
The friend of Erasmus,
the greatest humanist in all England.

431
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:51,978
- You have a fine, sharp mind.
- No.

432
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:54,540
- No what?
- No, I don't want to be Chancellor.

433
00:44:54,785 --> 00:44:57,458
You will do as I command!

434
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:09,937
Listen, Thomas. I know you have
scruples concerning my divorce.

435
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:12,745
And I swear to you,
it will only be dealt with...

436
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:15,584
...by those whose consciences
agree with it.

437
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:17,821
I'll only use you for other things...

438
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:20,823
...and I will never let it
molest your conscience.

439
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:26,625
Look, Tom.

440
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:34,780
I want you, nay, I command you,
in all the things that you do...

441
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:39,536
...to look to God first,
and only then to me.
