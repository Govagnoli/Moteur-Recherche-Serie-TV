1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:04,698
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:09,131
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:29,973
"Dear heart,
I cannot say how much I miss you.

4
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,369
I wish myself,
especially in the evening...

5
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,934
...in my sweetheart's arms, whose..."

6
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,450
Pray continue.

7
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,850
"Whose pretty breasts
I trust shortly to kiss.

8
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:49,893
Neither tongue nor pen can
express the hurt of not seeing you.

9
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,377
The only compensation is the thrill
of anticipating our next meeting.

10
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,015
For what joy in this world
can be greater...

11
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,973
...than to have the company of her
who is the most dearly loved?"

12
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,777
Well, the king
is plainly in love with you.

13
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,214
Don't you see, niece?

14
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:26,168
It makes a man, any man,
extremely vulnerable.

15
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:30,895
How do you like
your charge, sweetheart?

16
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,731
I...

17
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,693
At first, I confess,
I did not like it so much.

18
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,174
I did not care for the king.

19
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,335
But now, I...

20
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,137
- Now I...
- Anne.

21
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,133
It would be wise for you not to be
fooled by your own masquerade.

22
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,098
It is your duty to use his love...

23
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,655
...to our advantage
in supplanting Wolsey.

24
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,529
The cardinal
stands between us and everything.

25
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,053
And it is now in your power
to do him a great hurt.

26
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,648
And we expect you to do so.

27
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,093
I shall go straight to Paris
to meet King Francis...

28
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,177
...and ratify the new treaty
between Your Majesties.

29
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:26,207
And since His Holiness
remains a prisoner of the emperor...

30
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,933
...I have summoned
a conclave of the cardinals...

31
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,731
...to meet in Paris.

32
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,016
It will be little matter to persuade
them, in the absence of the Pope...

33
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,052
...to grant me licence and authority...

34
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,569
...to make a final judgement
on Your Majesty's annulment.

35
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,572
You leave with our blessing.

36
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:50,177
And with anticipation of your
success, Your Eminence.

37
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,887
For which we are most impatient.

38
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,293
I'm Your Majesty's
true and humble servant.

39
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,767
Oh, I forgot.

40
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,295
There is someone you should take.

41
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,615
His name is Thomas Wyatt.

42
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,696
- The poet?
- I don't like him.

43
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,538
He once possessed
a jewel I would have.

44
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,778
Lady Anne, what are you doing here?

45
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:27,093
I have an audience with His Majesty.

46
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,491
What would a silly girl like you
have to say to a king?

47
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,098
Your Majesty.

48
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,854
Tell me he'll succeed.

49
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,337
Who, sweetheart?

50
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,052
Wolsey.

51
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,057
He will, won't he?
He'll get an annulment?

52
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,690
Of course he will.

53
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,208
Don't you doubt it.

54
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,934
What is it?

55
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,897
Is it not strange?

56
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:32,807
Strange?

57
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:39,498
To trust so great a matter
to just one servant, whoever he is?

58
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,849
When Your Majesty
has a thousand servants...

59
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,890
...ready and willing
to do your bidding?

60
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,932
And when your very happiness
hangs upon this resolution.

61
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,657
My love.

62
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:54,014
This should not concern you.

63
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,890
Forgive me.
I spoke of things I should not.

64
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,976
No, no.

65
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,137
I give you leave that we may always
speak freely with each other.

66
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,218
Honestly, openly
and with a true heart.

67
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,777
For me,
that is the true definition of love.

68
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,134
Forgive me, ambassador,
for receiving you here.

69
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,648
I am at Your Majesty's disposal.

70
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,779
Senor Mendoza, help me.

71
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,852
Of course, I am Your Majesty's.

72
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:03,975
I need to get a message to the emperor.
I have no other way.

73
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:06,170
Wolsey opens all my letters.

74
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,372
And now I know that he has turned
several of my women into his spies.

75
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,491
By what means?

76
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:21,492
By money, or even, so they tell me,
by granting them sexual favours.

77
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,336
Dear God. How can I help?

78
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,008
The emperor is the head
of my family.

79
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,848
I want him to know that
the king is trying to divorce me.

80
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,887
He wants to keep it secret, but he has
already instigated proceedings.

81
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,018
It's impossible!

82
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,730
Surely he needs
the Pope's permission?

83
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,614
But the Pope is still the
emperor's prisoner.

84
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,538
Senor Mendoza...

85
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,252
...for the love of our saviour,
Jesus Christ...

86
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,733
...and the love of all that is sacred...

87
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,329
...tell my nephew what is
being done to me here!

88
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,452
Leave it to me.

89
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,176
I will find a way to evade
the cardinal's spies.

90
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,095
What are you thinking about?

91
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,977
I wasn't thinking.

92
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,897
I was listening.

93
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,208
You working on something new?

94
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,648
To work on something
I have to hear it.

95
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,897
I love you.

96
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,650
What about your wife?

97
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,457
You know very well
she's not my wife.

98
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:04,249
I never believed that love
should be bound by doctrine.

99
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,657
I'm going away.

100
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,330
You're going away? Why?

101
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:19,258
Cardinal Wolsey is going to France.

102
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,012
He invited me to go with him.

103
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,175
With other musicians.

104
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:27,897
Must you go?

105
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:31,258
You know very well
that an invitation from a cardinal...

106
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,495
...is like an invitation from a king.

107
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,817
We little people must put our hands
into the fire if invited to.

108
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,971
I'll miss you.

109
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,212
No, you won't.

110
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,531
You'll soon find other distractions.

111
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,295
Tell me truthfully.
What are your hopes for this mission?

112
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,057
I have many hopes.

113
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:15,815
Firstly, to heal the wounds caused
by years of Anglo-French hostility.

114
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:20,015
And then to work towards
a new balance of power in Europe.

115
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,687
The sacking of Rome,
the imprisonment of the Pope...

116
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,493
...these things have destabilized
the whole of Europe.

117
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,297
And the Church?

118
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,178
The Church is also
in need of mediation.

119
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,248
At the conclave, we shall lay plans
for a general council which...

120
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,291
...in the absence of the Pope...

121
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:43,573
...will deal with pressing matters
of heresy and reform.

122
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,735
And the king's matter?

123
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:51,209
That will also be dealt with. But as
one of a number of other matters.

124
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,890
Do you think the cardinals will
give you the authority to deal with it?

125
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:03,175
- Yes.
- Then you will be de facto Pope.

126
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,697
And since His Holiness
may never escape captivity...

127
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:09,373
This is idle speculation.

128
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,449
I have work to do, Sir Thomas.

129
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,814
Why are you sitting in the darkness?

130
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,647
What's wrong?

131
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:55,336
- You don't understand.
- Of course I do.

132
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,498
I'm your brother, aren't I?

133
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,934
If only you were still
as you used to be.

134
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,494
I remember I told you everything.

135
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,777
All my secrets.

136
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:09,539
- You can still tell me.
- I can't.

137
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,733
Why?

138
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,331
You'd share them.

139
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,292
Your Majesty.

140
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,413
We salute you, Cardinal Pacificus,
cardinal of peace.

141
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,497
Eminence.

142
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,769
Enchante, Madame.
As beautiful as ever, like the sun.

143
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,768
You are very gracious,
Monsieur Cardinal.

144
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,777
And we treat you as a brother,
for that is what you are.

145
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,377
A true and loyal friend of France.
We welcome you...

146
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:43,217
...and all those with you,
into our court and into our hearts.

147
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:53,416
I am greatly honoured, Your Majesty.
And very touched.

148
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,210
- This is nothing.
- Tallis.

149
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,738
Mr. Wyatt.

150
00:13:57,939 --> 00:13:59,577
I've been thinking.

151
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,577
Perhaps you would set
a poem of mine to music.

152
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,974
I'd be honoured.
Do you have one ready?

153
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,568
I'm working on one.
I have the first line.

154
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,849
Then you have almost everything.

155
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:17,972
Bonjour, Monsieur Cardinal.

156
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:19,811
Bonjour, Your Grace.

157
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,455
The Duke of Orleans is very glad
to be betrothed to Princess Mary.

158
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,576
Very, very happy.

159
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,058
Charming.

160
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,648
You don't like the French much,
do you, Sir Thomas?

161
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,656
I don't mind them, Mr. Wyatt.

162
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,378
It's just that they're always
so very French.

163
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,249
Were there any letters for me?

164
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,855
No letters, madam.

165
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,977
Lady Anne.

166
00:15:23,979 --> 00:15:25,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

167
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,857
I know what you are doing.

168
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,252
But do not think
to take the king away from me.

169
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,218
Let him play with you.
Let him give you gifts.

170
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,368
But he cannot give you
his true heart.

171
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,814
For I have that in my keeping.

172
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,096
Letters from His Eminence
Cardinal Wolsey.

173
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:23,089
Your Majesty should know
that His Holiness Pope Clement...

174
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:26,496
...has escaped Castel St. Angelo.

175
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,132
He's escaped?

176
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,375
Apparently, he dressed
as an old blind man...

177
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,452
...and walked out past his captors.

178
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,858
Where is he now?

179
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,530
According to my information,
in an Italian town called Orvieto...

180
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:43,299
...in the bishop's palace there,
with his court.

181
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:47,051
Of course, he is still within
the power of the emperor.

182
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:50,615
And yet he is free?

183
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,450
It would be possible...

184
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,339
It would be possible
to send someone to him?

185
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,495
To give him a message?

186
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,055
Indeed, it would be possible.

187
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,977
How do you know all this?
From Wolsey?

188
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:20,178
No, Your Majesty.
I have my own sources.

189
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,012
Let us say I wanted a message
carried to His Holiness.

190
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,214
Do you know someone? Someone
you could trust with your life?

191
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:31,417
Dr. Knight. A man of God.

192
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,770
A diplomat. And a true Englishman.

193
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,772
Bring him to me.

194
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,214
So that's how he does it.

195
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:35,738
Call.

196
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,492
My two queens win.

197
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:50,418
I hate cards.

198
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,535
I hate this court.

199
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:57,088
I even hate time itself.

200
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,296
Your Majesty,
might I make a suggestion?

201
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:03,376
Anything.

202
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,218
Forget the court.

203
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,374
Let's go to the woods.
Let's go for a hunt.

204
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,171
As we used to do.

205
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,889
Yes, yes.

206
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,737
But not Brandon.

207
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,968
- Charles is your...
- I haven't forgiven my Lord Suffolk.

208
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,170
I can't forgive him.

209
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,179
He never asked permission
to marry my sister.

210
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,577
It's insufferable arrogance.

211
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,168
I mean, what did he expect?

212
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,012
Look.

213
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,012
I don't mean
that he's banished forever.

214
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,577
Just as long as he breathes.

215
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:50,977
Come on.

216
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,052
You know what we should do?

217
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,454
- What, sweetheart?
- Have a picnic.

218
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,411
At Compton's place.

219
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:05,249
Keep your eyes open.

220
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,131
Walk them round.

221
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:17,332
You see, William?

222
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,376
Things can never be
as they used to be.

223
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:36,817
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

224
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,818
- My lord.
- Your Grace.

225
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,257
- To what do I owe this pleasure?
- May I speak frankly?

226
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:06,857
To your health, my lord.

227
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:09,537
And yours.

228
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,651
Norfolk has sent me.

229
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,257
But Norfolk hates me.
I am a new man, after all.

230
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,376
And he is far too grand for me.

231
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,889
I suspect he despises us all
for the same reasons.

232
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:26,613
And yet he has interests
to protect and further...

233
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,372
...like the rest of us.

234
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,854
He must deal with us
as he finds us.

235
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,688
And, after all, there is
someone he hates even more.

236
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,014
- The cardinal.
- Of course.

237
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,818
But what is that to me?

238
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,617
Do you miss the court, Your Grace?

239
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,938
Perhaps you don't.

240
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,770
Down here, in this green space...

241
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:55,690
...you have so much leisure to enjoy.
So many idle pursuits.

242
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,531
Yet I have heard it said by some...

243
00:21:57,739 --> 00:22:01,334
...that the king's presence
is like the sun.

244
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:05,133
And when you are away from it...

245
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:08,734
...there is only eternal night.

246
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,177
You're a clever man, Boleyn.

247
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:21,694
That is what people say.

248
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:25,371
They say you are
charming and clever.

249
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,211
What does Norfolk want?

250
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,648
He wants you to help us
destroy Wolsey.

251
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,138
And in return, he will persuade
the king to forgive you...

252
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:44,295
...and welcome you back to court.

253
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:50,218
Thank you, my lord.

254
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,211
What did you hear?

255
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:12,898
Everything.

256
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,097
What will you do?

257
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,051
What should I do?

258
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,569
You once told me...

259
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,492
...that sometimes Wolsey
had been kind to you.

260
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,012
Did I?

261
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,610
I had quite forgotten.

262
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:02,097
It seems Our Majesty is in love.

263
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,772
Sir.

264
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:27,297
Poor Harry.

265
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:46,738
Tallis?

266
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,015
What is it?
Bloody poets never sleep.

267
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,649
I've written the first few lines.
Can I read them to you?

268
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,254
They flee from me
That sometime did me seek

269
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,098
With nak ed foot
Stalking in my chamber

270
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,616
I have seen them
Gentle, tame and weak

271
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:16,371
That are now wild
And do not remember

272
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:18,535
That sometime
They put themselves in danger

273
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:22,527
To tak e bread at my hand

274
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,934
And now they range

275
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:29,496
Busily seeking
With a continual change

276
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:38,688
- That's all there is so far.
- It's wonderful.

277
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:40,093
There is music in it.

278
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,533
What's it about?

279
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:46,458
- A girl.
- What girl?

280
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,530
Let's just call her the brunette.

281
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,690
I loved her once.

282
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,497
And I thought she loved me.

283
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,577
But now she belongs to another?

284
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,256
Quiet in here.

285
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:17,934
She may be just a girl,
but I tell you this, Mr. Tallis...

286
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:20,414
...if she gets her way...

287
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:24,134
...she will set
our whole country in a roar.

288
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,698
Thank you.

289
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,092
His Majesty wants assurance...

290
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:46,813
...that Your Eminence
has everything you desire.

291
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:54,887
Forgive me.

292
00:26:55,099 --> 00:27:01,652
If I was younger, or more foolish,
or more alive...

293
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,259
...I would gladly take this offer.

294
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:16,327
You deserve better
than to be used as a whore.

295
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:36,097
My lords and ladies, the queen.

296
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,453
Your Majesty.

297
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:46,817
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

298
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:52,295
- Your Majesty.
- Your Grace.

299
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:55,011
Your Grace.

300
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:58,010
Your Majesty.

301
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,894
- Lord Darby.
- My queen.

302
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,010
I have something for you.

303
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:27,492
You see.

304
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:31,692
The falcon is your crest
and the pomegranate is hers.

305
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,696
You still don't understand, do you?

306
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,178
It's not a game, George.
It's dangerous.

307
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,058
Mistress Boleyn.

308
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,411
- Mr. Cromwell.
- I have some news.

309
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,728
The king is dispatching a good man
to see the Pope about the divorce.

310
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,930
A Dr. Knight.

311
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,175
I know Dr. Knight. He was my tutor.

312
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:01,576
Indeed. All things connect.

313
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:12,897
Ladies.

314
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,698
Sir.

315
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:18,417
Would I be right to think you
are maids of honour to Her Majesty?

316
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:19,847
Yes, sir.

317
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,333
George Boleyn.

318
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,894
You don't know me now
but one day you will.

319
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:29,896
- We could be useful to each other.
- How so?

320
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:34,213
You tell me who you're fucking...

321
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,217
...and I'll tell you if it's a good idea.

322
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,054
You understand?

323
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,692
And in return?

324
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,530
I'll think of something.

325
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:50,132
It depends how hungry you are
to be rich and famous.

326
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,137
It's something I can arrange.

327
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,175
I'm a builder of fortunes.

328
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,012
Here.

329
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:03,809
We rely upon you, Dr. Knight...

330
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,329
...to deliver these two bulls
to His Holiness, at Orvieto.

331
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,856
They were written by our own hand.

332
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,498
Majesty.

333
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,171
It would be better for Europe...

334
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:43,855
...if we now make peace
with the emperor.

335
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:50,814
How can you say that?
He made me his prisoner.

336
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,495
He squeezed my balls.
I had to pay him millions in ransom.

337
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:56,775
And my eldest son is still his captive.

338
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,691
How can I make peace
with that piece of shit?

339
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:14,654
You must be gratified
by the progress you've made so far.

340
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:16,218
It's something of a burden...

341
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,808
...dragging my old body
from country to country.

342
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,416
You'd rather be at home.

343
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,816
I do fret, rather, that the king
will be influenced...

344
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,850
...by others in my absence.

345
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,610
After the conclave,
you need not fret.

346
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:35,458
You'll soon have the power
to please him.

347
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:45,857
Evening, my lord.

348
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:48,138
Thank you.

349
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,092
Boy.

350
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,411
Boy.

351
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:07,978
Damn you.

352
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,818
The king.

353
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,012
Sweet Anne.

354
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,091
The queen.

355
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:04,771
No, no. Wait.

356
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,971
Only a moment.

357
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:13,208
Tonight I dine
with your father and uncle.

358
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,847
Your Majesty, my father says
it is all beyond his deserving.

359
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:20,572
No.

360
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:24,768
For when I am with them,
I am close to you.

361
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,412
Here.

362
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,734
Another token of my affection.

363
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:40,776
Take it. From your humble servant.

364
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:52,413
Your neck.

365
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,097
I love your neck.

366
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,011
My lords, let us drink...

367
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:36,808
...to the resolution of the matter
which is uppermost in our minds.

368
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:39,135
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty.

369
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,811
In a very short while,
we shall have an answer.

370
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,177
I would trust to hear it more
from Dr. Knight than Cardinal Wolsey.

371
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,575
Why do you say?

372
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:56,567
I fear it is not in the cardinal's
interest to succeed.

373
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:01,810
But surely his interests and mine
are one and the same?

374
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,498
He is my servant.

375
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,851
His Grace means that the cardinal...

376
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,778
...has some prejudice
against my daughter.

377
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,176
I know. I know.

378
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:14,653
He called her a silly girl.

379
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:16,733
She told me.

380
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:22,451
There is another matter.

381
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:24,212
My lord did not want to tell you.

382
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:28,412
But it is something I think Your Majesty
should be made aware of.

383
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,138
Well?

384
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:36,092
Majesty...

385
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,650
...by your great bounty,
I was appointed...

386
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:42,168
...comptroller
of Your Majesty's household.

387
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:44,574
And in such a capacity...

388
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:49,454
...I have discovered that when corrupt
religious houses are closed down...

389
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:52,014
...instead of their assets
going to your exchequer...

390
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,777
...as they should do...

391
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:58,292
...they are often diverted elsewhere.

392
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:02,738
Elsewhere?

393
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:07,457
Into Wolsey's private foundations.

394
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,450
Into the creation
of his college at Oxford.

395
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:21,290
I must admit...

396
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:23,888
...I find your intimations shocking.

397
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:27,730
Indeed, I am hurt.

398
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,817
Cardinal Wolsey
is not only my chancellor...

399
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:35,811
...he has always been my friend.

400
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:41,011
In this world, Majesty,
a true and loyal friend...

401
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:43,130
...is the greatest boon
any man can have.

402
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:50,011
For in everything else,
there is a strange habit of forsaking.

403
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,335
That reminds me,
the Duke of Suffolk came to see me.

404
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,892
- Brandon?
- He said...

405
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:00,737
...he would crawl
on his hands and knees...

406
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:02,770
...to beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

407
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,527
The necklace. Who gave it to you?

408
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,092
Answer me.

409
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,532
His Majesty.

410
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:42,858
You are expensive, huh?

411
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:44,892
An expensive whore!

412
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,698
I am no whore...

413
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:50,251
...Your Majesty.

414
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:55,257
I love His Majesty.
I believe he loves me.

415
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:02,736
He is infatuated by you,
as men often are by new things.

416
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:07,296
Soon he will see you
for what you really are.

417
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:10,218
And he will tire of you...

418
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:13,132
...as all the others.

419
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:18,818
And what if he does not?

420
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:22,051
I did not give you permission
to speak.

421
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,853
You are a servant.

422
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,251
Go now.

423
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:30,452
Go.

424
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:04,850
- Who are you?
- Dr. Knight, forgive us, sir.

425
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,254
We must just ask you
to break off your journey.

426
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:09,694
Impossible.
I am on the king's business.

427
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:12,732
Yes, sir, we know that.
That is why you must come with us.

428
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,894
Dr. Knight, come in.

429
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:25,568
- Your Eminence...
- I make it my business...

430
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:28,168
...to know the king's business.

431
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:32,452
Did you really think you could go to
Orvieto without my knowing about it?

432
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,978
Now, you've been sent
by the king to the Pope...

433
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,647
...with these two bulls, is that correct?

434
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,531
Yes.

435
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:46,609
These are extraordinary documents.
Do you know what's in them?

436
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,528
- Yes, a little.
- And you still agreed to carry them?

437
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:58,974
The first document asks the Pope
to permit him, once divorced...

438
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,771
...to marry any woman he chooses...

439
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:03,015
...even one who would
be forbidden to him...

440
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:06,211
...because of a prior relationship
to one of her relatives.

441
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:08,455
I don't understand that.
The king wrote this.

442
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,731
- What woman is he referring to?
- Mistress Anne Boleyn.

443
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,618
Anne Boleyn?

444
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,255
The king loves Anne Boleyn?

445
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:22,173
Yes, sir.

446
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,569
And what is this prior relationship
he refers to?

447
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:35,011
Surely Your Eminence is aware
that His Majesty...

448
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:38,689
...had carnal relations
with Anne's older sister, Mary.

449
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,579
Perhaps even with their mother.

450
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:46,488
So it is rumoured.
I give it no credence.

451
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:48,371
With regard to the mother.

452
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:52,615
And the second document.
Have you read it?

453
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:56,531
- No, sir.
- Just as well.

454
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,172
I wouldn't like to be the man...

455
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:01,177
...that has to present this
to the descendant of Saint Peter.

456
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:06,573
It asks this: " If no way can be found
to nullify the king's marriage...

457
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:09,577
...then the Pope should
allow him to take a second wife."

458
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:13,656
Do you understand? He's asking
the Pope to sanction bigamy.

459
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,495
Since the king commands it,
you must be on your way, Dr. Knight.

460
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:28,578
But with no hope of success,
or honour.

461
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:44,618
I heard you crawled here like a dog.

462
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:48,689
- Something like...
- Hold your tongue.

463
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:51,855
You were always too useful with it.

464
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,497
Yes, Your Majesty.

465
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,174
Have you come
to beg my forgiveness?

466
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,176
Yes, Your Majesty.

467
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,817
Well, then beg for it.

468
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:17,372
With all my heart. With all my soul.

469
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,376
With every ounce of my being.

470
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,774
My king, my sovereign,
my dread lord...

471
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:24,573
...I beg you to forgive
your miserable servant...

472
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,417
...your humble, worthless,
thoughtless servant...

473
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,536
...who deserves so little...

474
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:33,094
...and by your bounty
and your grace...

475
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:34,778
...was given so much.

476
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,650
Ungrateful wretch that I am.

477
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,048
Unworthy of Your Majesty's love.

478
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:50,858
Come here.

479
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,732
If you can beat me...

480
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,935
...you can come back to court.

481
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:23,938
Ready?

482
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:38,331
Welcome back.

483
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,978
- What was I supposed to do?
- I don't know.

484
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,216
But I agree with you.
It was crude and unacceptable.

485
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:09,298
- I'm disappointed in His Majesty.
- Thomas, I have to ask you this.

486
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:13,335
Will you accept the judgement
of the cardinals?

487
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:15,131
What does it matter now?

488
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,931
The Pope is free.

489
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:20,529
- There is no need for a conclave.
- No, there is more need than ever.

490
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:22,889
The Pope is still
in the power of the emperor...

491
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,533
...unable to exercise any control
over the Church.

492
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,175
So someone else must do so
and I ask you again...

493
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:33,218
...will you accept
the judgement of the cardinals?

494
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,697
More, if you are not for me now,
then you are against me.

495
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:41,807
Stakes have grown higher.

496
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:45,688
Mr. Cromwell tells me that the king
now dines with Norfolk and Boleyn.

497
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:49,414
They are my bitter enemies.
They constantly seek my downfall.

498
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:52,213
And if you do not help me,
then you help them.

499
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,768
Need I remind you of this?

500
00:45:55,979 --> 00:46:00,257
You owe all your advancement
in this world to me.

501
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,577
Thomas, we've known each other
a long time.

502
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:10,856
I know you've often complained
about my methods, my way of dealing.

503
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:15,257
But underneath all of that,
I believe we still share many things.

504
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:18,496
We're still humanists, even though
the world batters our beliefs...

505
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:21,054
...and compromises our actions.

506
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:24,974
Nothing, no earthly thing,
not even a prince...

507
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,135
...will ever compromise mine.

508
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,457
Oh, I see.

509
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,014
You don't want to get
your hands dirty. I understand.

510
00:46:35,179 --> 00:46:37,488
Well, unfortunately,
you don't have a choice.

511
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:41,851
The dyer's hand is always stained
by the elements he works with.

512
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,297
Here is my element.

513
00:46:52,899 --> 00:46:54,935
The spiritual element.

514
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:57,287
The higher element.

515
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,532
Now you tell me...

516
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:05,129
...am I stained by it?

517
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:18,930
Let me know the moment
the cardinals arrive.

518
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,451
Mon cher Wolsey.

519
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:29,897
I expect you heard.

520
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:32,252
The cardinals are not coming.

521
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:37,377
There's nothing I can do about it.

522
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:39,968
They only take orders
from His Holiness.

523
00:48:50,899 --> 00:48:54,255
The wheel turns, my friend.

524
00:48:57,939 --> 00:49:01,693
They flee from me
That sometime did me seek

525
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:06,131
With nak ed foot stalking
In my chamber

526
00:49:08,299 --> 00:49:10,494
Thanks be to fortune,
It has been otherwise

527
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:16,888
Twenty times better
But once in special

528
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:22,134
In thin array, after a pleasant guise

529
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:26,738
When her loose gown
From her shoulders did fall

530
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:30,454
And she caught me
In her arms long and small

531
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:33,253
There with all sweetly did we kiss

532
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:40,012
And softly said,
"Dear Heart, how lik e you this?"

533
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:08,896
Out. Out.

534
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:12,015
Your Eminence,
your blessing on my daughter?

535
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,528
- Blessings, my child.
- Thank you, Your Eminence.

536
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,977
- Your Eminence, please, a moment.
- No, no.

537
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:23,050
- Now, Mr. Cromwell.
- Your Eminence.

538
00:50:23,259 --> 00:50:26,057
- The king awaits you, but...
- What?

539
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,136
He is not alone.

540
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:39,452
Majesty.

541
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:41,092
Well?

542
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:47,619
Majesty, I was hoping that...

543
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:50,134
You can speak freely
in front of Mistress Boleyn.

544
00:50:50,779 --> 00:50:52,337
She knows everything.

545
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:01,410
So. You've come back from Paris.

546
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,093
- Yes.
- Tell us of your triumphs.

547
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,650
Tell us all your news.

548
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,614
We are so eager to hear.

549
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:15,617
Oh, for the love of God, man.

550
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:19,770
Do I have my divorce?

551
00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:32,572
Your Majesty will recall
that I went to Paris...

552
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:34,656
It was no dream.

553
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,578
I lay broad waking

554
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:41,010
But all is turned
Through my gentleness

555
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:44,774
Into a strange fashion
Of forsaking

556
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:47,931
And I have leave to go
Of her goodness

557
00:51:50,419 --> 00:51:54,776
But since that
I so kindly am served

558
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:59,097
I'd lik e to know
what she has deserved
