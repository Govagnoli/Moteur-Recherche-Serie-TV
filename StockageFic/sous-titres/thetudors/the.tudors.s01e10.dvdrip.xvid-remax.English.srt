1
00:00:01,071 --> 00:00:04,427
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:09,623
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,380
His Majesty, the king.

4
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:47,940
My lords and councillors,
there is a great deal of work to do.

5
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:53,107
In the past, those who held
the reins of government deceived me.

6
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:58,023
Many things were done
without my knowledge or my approval.

7
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,747
But such proceedings
will stop in the future.

8
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,022
Your Grace will be appointed
president of the council.

9
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,582
Jointly with the Duke of Suffolk.

10
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,343
Your Majesty.

11
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,025
We shall convene again very shortly.

12
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:21,224
To discuss those matters
which remain close to our hearts.

13
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,024
A word.

14
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,030
Although it pleases me much...

15
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:39,223
...that Wolsey is no longer here
among us, yet...

16
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:44,949
Even in his absence,
does he not cause you disquiet?

17
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,866
How so?

18
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:50,302
He was attaindered,
but not for treason.

19
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:52,990
Which means he still lives.

20
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,230
And so long as he lives, he remains
a danger both to the realm and to us.

21
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,702
He is far away in York. In disgrace.

22
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,469
I think you exaggerate the danger.

23
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,783
And I think
that you don't understand it.

24
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:09,070
The king, as you know,
could easily change his mind.

25
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:13,190
And if he did,
if Wolsey ever returned to this court...

26
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,940
...we would both have cause enough
to fear his vengeance.

27
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:39,103
This is intolerable.
We must have the roof mended.

28
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:42,025
With what and by whom?

29
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:46,429
We have no money
and no bloody servants.

30
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,060
Surely, the king never meant you
to live so wretchedly?

31
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,865
After all,
you are still archbishop of York.

32
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,703
Well,
perhaps it's not the king's fault.

33
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,501
I have had cause
to remember the old prophecy:

34
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:09,191
"When the cow rideth the bull,
then, priest, beware thy skull."

35
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:11,662
You mean that cow Anne Boleyn?

36
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:13,099
Indeed so.

37
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:15,182
Which is why I'm writing her
this letter.

38
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,587
Even if she's the cause
of all our misery?

39
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:24,342
Well, yes, since she's the cause,
she can also be the cure.

40
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:29,144
I just have to persuade her
that I am not her enemy, but her friend.

41
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:33,026
I still have the letter in which
she promises to reward me...

42
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:38,305
...for all my pains and efforts
at such time as she becomes crowned.

43
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,149
I seem to remember at the time...

44
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,660
...you thought her promises
rather amusing.

45
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,981
Well, yes, perhaps I did.

46
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:51,185
Since then
I have rather lost my sense of humour.

47
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:55,623
Sir Thomas, I notice you allow yourself
none of the trappings of your office.

48
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,467
I'm not so vain as to display its power,
Master Cromwell.

49
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:04,459
But I tell you this,
I fully intend to use it.

50
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,230
- May I ask to what effect?
- Here, for example.

51
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:16,547
Here is a report of a sermon
recently given in Cambridge...

52
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,504
...by a certain Hugh Latimer.

53
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,306
A senior member of the university.
And I quote:

54
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:28,022
"Mr. Latimer said that holy scripture
should be read in the English tongue...

55
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:33,225
...of all Christian people
whether priest or layman.

56
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,702
He raged against
the gilding of images...

57
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,860
...the running of pilgrimages,
and superstitious devotion.

58
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:45,422
He said that all men were priests...

59
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:50,421
...and that we had no need
for priests or popes on Earth."

60
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:54,540
Times have changed,
Master Cromwell.

61
00:06:55,671 --> 00:07:00,506
Now I plainly see the risk and danger
involved in such an open-door policy...

62
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,340
...towards these newfangled,
erroneous sects.

63
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:09,750
You condemn all Reformers
as heretics?

64
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,300
Wolsey was far too soft on them.

65
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:17,661
I intend not to be.

66
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,867
Will you burn them?

67
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,144
"This belief that pope and clergy
possess separate power...

68
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,581
...and authority
is contrary to scripture.

69
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,464
The king
is the representative of God on Earth...

70
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:35,582
...and his law is God's law.

71
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,343
The ruler
is accountable to God alone...

72
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:43,067
...and the obedience of his subjects
is an obedience required by God.

73
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:48,790
For the Church and the pope
to rule the princes of Europe...

74
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,984
...is not only a shame above all shames
but an inversion of the divine order.

75
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:58,707
One king and one law in God's name
in every realm."

76
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,744
This book is a book for me,
and for all kings.

77
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,061
And there are other books like it.

78
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,944
Books which detail
the abuses of power, privileges...

79
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,348
...the greed of the clergy
in Your Majesty's realm.

80
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:14,429
Books which Wolsey
deliberately kept hidden from you.

81
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:20,979
I should like to read them.

82
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,629
Now I've taken power unto myself...

83
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:27,062
...I shall work day and night
if necessary to resolve things.

84
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:28,670
Including my annulment.

85
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:33,508
I swear to you now
everything will be different.

86
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,783
His Majesty the king.

87
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,182
- Ambassador Chapuys.
- Your Majesty.

88
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:55,305
I hear you are a very able
and intelligent diplomat.

89
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:00,749
Like me, I'm sure you're aware
of all the new religious controversies.

90
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:05,189
I know of some new heresies that have
sprang up here and there, certainly.

91
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:09,706
If only the pope and his cardinals
could set aside their vain pomp...

92
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:13,745
...start living according to the precepts
of the gospels the and early fathers.

93
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,223
I am well aware Your Majesty...

94
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,786
...is in the midst of an argument
with His Holiness.

95
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,626
I'm not talking about myself.

96
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:26,862
You see, when Luther attacked
the vice...

97
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:30,063
...and corruption of the clergy,
he was right.

98
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,990
Had he stopped, and not gone on
to destroy the sacraments...

99
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:35,830
...and so on, I would have
raised my pen in his defence...

100
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,544
...rather than attacking him.

101
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,983
The need for reformation
in the Church is manifest.

102
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:47,741
The emperor has a duty to promote it.
As do I in my own domain.

103
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,101
I'm glad we've had this opportunity
to exchange opinions.

104
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,820
- Your Majesty.
- Ambassador.

105
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:05,029
- I'm surprised you have so much time.
- To do what?

106
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,665
- To do nothing.
- What are you saying?

107
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,305
Aren't you supposed to be
running the country?

108
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,661
I leave that to Norfolk.
He's had more practise.

109
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,466
In any case, meetings
with ambassadors, infinitely tedious.

110
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:18,980
They're all liars, hypocrites,
and middle-aged men.

111
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:20,829
Would you prefer them to be women?

112
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:23,420
My friend, if all ambassadors
were beautiful women...

113
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:27,146
...l'd be serving my country
day and night.

114
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,186
- Here we are.
- Your Grace.

115
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,865
Let me present my ward,
Miss Catherine Brooke.

116
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,743
- Sir Anthony Knivert.
- Miss Catherine.

117
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:37,101
- Sir.
- Anthony's one of our finest horsemen.

118
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,620
Except for when I fall off.

119
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:41,230
- You enjoying your walk?
- Yes.

120
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:43,820
Good.
Then I shan't delay you any further.

121
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,300
Put your back into it, lads.

122
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:53,381
- Pretty little thing, isn't she?
- Indeed, she is.

123
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:54,950
I'm gonna marry her.

124
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,581
You've been in exile, Mr. Fish?

125
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:02,980
Yes, sir.

126
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:05,944
It was Cardinal Wolsey's pleasure
to keep me in Holland...

127
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:08,460
...for fear I might speak the truth.

128
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:12,261
So why did you try to return?

129
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,747
I thought, sir, that with the cardinal
fallen and sent away...

130
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:19,307
...that circumstances in this country
might be changed for the better.

131
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,024
More tolerant.

132
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,022
Do you have friends in this country?

133
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,109
- Of course, sir, as an Englishman.
- At court?

134
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,544
Do you have friends at court?

135
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:43,740
Do you deny you are the author
of this work...

136
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:46,984
...A Supplication for the Beggars?

137
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,706
No, sir.

138
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:51,666
What is it?

139
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,981
Sir, an appeal to His Majesty...

140
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:57,786
...to redress many of the terrible
and scandalous abuses of the Church.

141
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:00,425
You seem to suggest
that the real aim of the Church...

142
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:05,386
...is to seize all power, lordship,
obedience and dignity from the king.

143
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,310
In fact, you go further.
You claim that the Church itself...

144
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:11,423
...is a source of rebellion
and disobedience against the king.

145
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,064
Don't you, Mr. Fish?

146
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:21,745
And here, Mr. Fish, if I may.

147
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:25,020
You say that the exactions
taken from the people...

148
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:27,540
...are not given
to a kind, temporal prince...

149
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:31,141
...but to
"a cruel, devilish bloodsucker...

150
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:35,863
...drunken in the blood
of the martyrs and saints of Christ."

151
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,223
Shame on you, Mr. Fish.

152
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:42,309
For who are
these cruel, devilish bloodsuckers...

153
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,344
...but the anointed priests
of our holy Church.

154
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,861
Those who show us
the way to heaven.

155
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:52,425
But then, you don't believe in that
either, do you, Mr. Fish?

156
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:59,789
Who are you?

157
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:06,585
I'm a Christian man,
the child of everlasting joy...

158
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:10,023
...through the merits
of the bitter passion of Christ.

159
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:13,099
This is the joyful answer.

160
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,219
It is also heresy.

161
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,861
What is it? What has she done?

162
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:34,944
She is wearing purple.

163
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,663
And purple is the colour of royalty.

164
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,710
You know, I sometimes wish...

165
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,345
...that all Spaniards
were at the bottom of the sea.

166
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,500
Mistress Boleyn...

167
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,544
...you should not abuse the queen's
honour with such language.

168
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,986
I care nothing for Catherine.

169
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:59,627
I would rather see her hanged
than acknowledge her as my mistress.

170
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:13,021
- Is that it?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

171
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,380
Thank God.

172
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:27,187
What is it, Mr. Cromwell?

173
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:29,946
Your Majesty, I...

174
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,139
Mr. Cromwell.

175
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:36,779
I must beg Your Majesty's indulgence,
and forgiveness, before I...

176
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,259
Go on.

177
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:42,741
I had cause, recently,
on a visit to Waltham Abbey...

178
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,101
...to speak to a learned friend there.

179
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:47,905
We spoke about
Your Majesty's great matter.

180
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:52,626
We came to the conclusion
Your Majesty's advisers...

181
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,140
...might not, perhaps,
be approaching the matter...

182
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:57,262
...in the most convenient way
to solve it.

183
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,462
- You mean through the courts?
- Yes.

184
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:03,869
As Your Majesty well knows,
kings are set above the law.

185
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,586
They are answerable to God alone,
who anointed them.

186
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:12,747
So it seems to us that the matter is not,
and never has been, a legal one.

187
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:19,583
It is a theological one.

188
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,100
But in that case,
who should pass verdict upon it?

189
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:26,589
We would suggest...

190
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,828
...that Your Majesty
canvass the opinion of theologians...

191
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:32,226
...at colleges around Europe.

192
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,103
Their sentence
would be pronounced...

193
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,506
...and could be implemented
with little industry.

194
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,179
And by that simple measure...

195
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:43,304
...I trust that Your Majesty's
troubled conscience might be pacified.

196
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:46,425
Will you write a paper
showing your argument?

197
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:51,141
- Lf Your Majesty trusts me to do so.
- No, I command you to do so.

198
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,789
Then I command you,
as a royal agent...

199
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,663
...visit the universities in Europe.

200
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:00,067
I want the opinion of their theological
faculties as soon as possible.

201
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,580
Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.

202
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,624
There's still time
to recant of your heresy, Mr. Fish.

203
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:52,620
If you acknowledge that your opinions
were misguided, evil...

204
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:55,107
...contrary to the law of God...

205
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,826
...then you will be spared the
great pains you must otherwise endure.

206
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,749
I beg of you, acknowledge your sins.

207
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:08,543
God will welcome you back
into his fold.

208
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,183
Recant.

209
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,021
Recant, you still have a moment.

210
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:23,024
The Lord is my shepherd,
I can want nothing.

211
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:28,225
He feedeth me in green pastures,
he leadeth me to fresh waters.

212
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:31,707
Though I should walk now
in the valley of the shadow of death...

213
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:36,622
...yet I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

214
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:41,150
Thy staff and thy sheep,
they comfort me.

215
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:45,380
Thou preparest a table for me,
against mine enemies.

216
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:51,379
My head Thou anoints with oil,
and filleth my cup full.

217
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:58,303
Oh, let thy loving-kindness and mercy
follow me all the days of my life...

218
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:03,388
...that I mayest dwell
in the Lord's house for ever.

219
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,222
I have something
I want to say to you.

220
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:25,303
I have decided
to ennoble you and your family.

221
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:28,704
You are to be created
Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde...

222
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:32,062
...and I am also appointing you
Lord Privy Seal.

223
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,902
George will become Lord Rochford...

224
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:37,261
...and be made a member of council.

225
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:41,186
Your Majesty, I'm lost for words.

226
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,709
Your bounty is unceasing.

227
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:51,668
I also have high hopes
for Mr. Cromwell.

228
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:55,386
I'm glad. He is a friend of the family.

229
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,506
You know his thesis.

230
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,341
I want you to visit the pope
and the emperor at Bologna.

231
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:06,300
I want you to put to them
our new case.

232
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,865
Please tell me
you are not losing hope.

233
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:18,142
It is true, I...

234
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,785
I had always fancied that the king...

235
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:24,347
...after pursuing his course
for some time, would turn away...

236
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:27,782
...would yield to his conscience,
and change his purpose...

237
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,905
...as he has done so often before.

238
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:35,627
I believed with all my heart
that he would return to reason.

239
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:37,867
But now l...

240
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:42,299
Madam, I pray you. Don't give way.

241
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:48,223
No, Excellence.
I shall never give way.

242
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,744
Thank you for what you have done
for my father.

243
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:57,385
For my whole family.

244
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:00,103
There's more.

245
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:06,146
I've made alterations
to Wolsey's old palace at York Place.

246
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,742
You said you liked it.

247
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,981
I am giving it to you.

248
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:20,510
What is it?

249
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:23,150
Have I made you unhappy?

250
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:25,224
No.

251
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:28,982
I would only be unhappy
if you ever stopped loving me.

252
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:33,101
London would have to melt
into the Thames first.

253
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:46,703
It is everything now
for the lady Anne?

254
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:51,151
Sir Thomas, does this not remind you
of a wedding feast?

255
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,426
It seems to me that nothing is wanted
but a priest...

256
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:58,704
...to give away the nuptial rings
and pronounce the blessing.

257
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:01,220
God forbid that should happen.

258
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,747
It's none of my business.

259
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,750
My new job as chancellor...

260
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,627
...will be to do my utmost to contend
for the interests of Christendom.

261
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:14,464
Perhaps the king's Majesty...

262
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:17,390
...is more inclined
towards the Reformers than you know.

263
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:19,070
I don't think so.

264
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,304
I know him better than you do,
Excellence.

265
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,270
His deepest instincts
are traditional and faithful.

266
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,348
He may threaten
to break with Rome...

267
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,460
...but I don't think he will ever do so.

268
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,827
I hope you are right.

269
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,784
The consequences
would be unthinkable.

270
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:43,509
Everything seems to move
in your favour, Your Grace.

271
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,020
I have bad news.

272
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,187
I happen to know that the king...

273
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:53,907
...has sent Wolsey
an intaglio portrait of himself.

274
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:56,424
So?

275
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:59,903
So it is traditionally
a sign of goodwill.

276
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,579
It may presage a reconciliation.

277
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,823
A small gift to ease the king's
conscience is hardly a sign...

278
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:08,989
...that the bishop of York
will be restored to his former glory.

279
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:11,543
Think of it this way.

280
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:14,345
When Satan fell from heaven,
was he ever invited back?

281
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,819
You were.

282
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:25,341
I see that you have accepted patronage
from Mr. Cromwell, Mr. Wyatt.

283
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,510
How very transparent the world is.

284
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,510
But was I wrong to do so, Tallis?

285
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:40,510
I think so. Yeah.
You should be your own man.

286
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,781
Don't be a fool, Tallis. You won't
survive long in this slippery world...

287
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,505
...without the support of a great man.

288
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:50,546
You think Mr. Cromwell
is a great man?

289
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:54,346
No, I think he's a coming man.
Mark my words.

290
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,500
For what it's worth, I did fuck her.

291
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:23,870
What is it, Thomas?

292
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:28,381
I have had a reply to my letter.

293
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:30,542
From Mistress Boleyn?

294
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:33,068
What did she say?

295
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,264
That she will not speak to the king
on my behalf.

296
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,270
Then our hopes are over.

297
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:46,747
No. No, no.

298
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:51,030
I have resolved to write
to another lady...

299
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:58,103
...who is far greater, far greater
than that mischievous whore.

300
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:03,499
And far more likely to be kind.

301
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:18,666
Madam, the king is here.

302
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:35,185
Please. Be seated.

303
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:36,910
Majesty.

304
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,061
I came because I heard
you were unwell.

305
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:44,428
And that it was necessary
for the physician to have bled you.

306
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,623
- How are you feeling now?
- I am very well.

307
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,743
Your Majesty is kind
to show concern.

308
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,583
How is our daughter?

309
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:01,749
She writes to me in perfect Latin
and tells me she dances the galliards...

310
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:05,739
...and can play the lute much to
everyone's satisfaction and joy.

311
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:09,466
- You should be proud of her.
- I am proud of her.

312
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:12,064
You ought to invite her to court.

313
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,148
You could watch her
dancing and playing.

314
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:17,263
- It might please you.
- Catherine, l...

315
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:19,780
I hear that several of your agents...

316
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:23,620
...have been sent abroad to canvass
theological opinion about the divorce.

317
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:28,625
For every scholar
that votes for you...

318
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:32,141
...I could find a thousand
who would vote for me.

319
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,263
My lords...

320
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,147
...every day I'm forced to read
new reports of dissatisfaction...

321
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:58,990
...confusion and delays
throughout my kingdom.

322
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:04,019
My exchequer is empty...

323
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,348
...and we are borrowing money
at a biting rate.

324
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,667
Your Graces
are presidents of this council...

325
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:14,510
...and yet I hear nothing
from you on these matters.

326
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:16,588
Nor any other matter.

327
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:22,180
- Your Majesty must forgive me...
- Yes, I know. I must always forgive you.

328
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,189
But I grow tired of forgiving you!

329
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:30,988
I have given you everything, including
the right to call yourself prince!

330
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,863
And what do I get in return?

331
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:40,747
I used to think the cardinal vain,
self-serving and greedy...

332
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,907
...just as you told me.

333
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:49,386
But now I understand the burden
he carried, uncomplainingly.

334
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:54,782
Your Majesty should not forget
that he also stole from you...

335
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:57,900
...and he served the interests
of the French...

336
00:27:58,151 --> 00:28:00,745
...even above those of England.

337
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,626
Is that what you think, Thomas?

338
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:11,581
It is certainly true that the cardinal
was vainglorious beyond measure.

339
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,390
It did him tremendous harm...

340
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:19,386
...and made him abuse
the considerable gifts God gave him.

341
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:24,582
And yet he is a better man
than any of you...

342
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,988
...for managing
this kingdom's matters.

343
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:38,022
- I will talk to him.
- Yes, you must.

344
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:41,500
Ambassador Chapuys, Your Majesty.

345
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,310
Ambassador.

346
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:51,550
- I have a letter for Your Majesty.
- From the emperor?

347
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:54,942
No. From Cardinal Wolsey.

348
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:59,862
This is so strange.
Do you know what it says?

349
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:03,264
The cardinal is offering
to create a rapprochement...

350
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:06,861
...between you and he,
the emperor, and Rome.

351
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:11,300
The coup would be signalled
by the arrival of a papal edict...

352
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:15,868
...ordering Henry to leave Anne Boleyn
and return to his marriage.

353
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:20,103
The emperor will offer
his financial and moral support...

354
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:23,223
...and insist that Wolsey be reinstated
as chancellor.

355
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,023
Do you think it could work?

356
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:31,383
The cardinal is nothing
if not ingenious.

357
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:35,700
I want you to set up
a new parliament.

358
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,106
Important things need to be done.

359
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:40,347
My exchequer is empty, for one thing.

360
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:42,985
I will do as Your Majesty commands.

361
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,990
But I must warn you
that you may not find this parliament...

362
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:49,228
...as compliant as those before.

363
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:50,580
How so?

364
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,225
Well, though I must confess
to being amongst those...

365
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:56,741
...who called for greater tolerance
and freedom of speech...

366
00:29:57,391 --> 00:30:00,349
...I fear that the freedom so given
by Your Majesty's kindness...

367
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,543
...is now openly abused.

368
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,423
There are many dissenting voices
in the kingdom...

369
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,191
...chiefly on religious matters.

370
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:12,743
There are calls for a reformation.

371
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,706
How many have you burned,
Thomas?

372
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,584
Six.

373
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:34,347
All lawful,
necessary and well done.

374
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,384
Well done?

375
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:38,340
Yes, Harry.

376
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:50,188
What did he say?

377
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:53,389
Well, in so many words...

378
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,384
...he told me that he was inclined
to pardon Wolsey...

379
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:59,264
...and restore him to royal favour.

380
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:04,502
And what did you say?

381
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:09,461
I agreed with His Majesty
that the cardinal had many talents.

382
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:10,985
You did what?

383
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:16,026
I agreed with the king
that His Eminence had many talents.

384
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:22,190
I cannot believe this.

385
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:25,224
Have you not spoken yourself...

386
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:27,820
...of the terrible vengeance
he would exact on us...

387
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:29,749
...if he ever again had the power?

388
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:36,346
Or perhaps you don't think vengeance
to be one of his many talents.

389
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,742
I do indeed.

390
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,019
Which is why I cultivate
the king's good graces.

391
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:52,828
Your Majesty will be pleased to know
that the University of Paris...

392
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:57,149
...the greatest prize of all,
has declared in your favour.

393
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,340
And Italy?

394
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,826
I confess that the universities there
are divided.

395
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,149
But Padua, Florence and Venice
have all declared for Your Majesty.

396
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:16,546
Spain? Catherine's country?

397
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,469
Spain is against.

398
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,509
Are you surprised?

399
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,745
And you, my lord.

400
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:29,545
Did you get to see
the emperor and His Holiness?

401
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,026
How are they?

402
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:35,581
Your Majesty,
the emperor refused to see me.

403
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:37,869
And His Holiness?

404
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:42,504
The pope simply gave me this edict,
to bring to Your Majesty.

405
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,500
What does it say?

406
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,183
The edict instructs Your Majesty...

407
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:01,780
...to order Lady Anne Boleyn
to leave your court.

408
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:05,831
It refuses to allow
Your Majesty permission to remarry...

409
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:09,865
...while the papal curia
is deciding Your Majesty's case.

410
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:21,789
Mr. Wyatt.

411
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:24,027
- I am busy.
- There is someone you should see.

412
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,348
- Not now, Mr. Wyatt.
- It concerns the cardinal.

413
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:33,103
Your Excellency.
What can I do for you?

414
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,427
My Lord, I would ask you
a very great favour.

415
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:36,746
These are troubled times.

416
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:38,828
It seems to me
that in certain quarters...

417
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:42,307
...there is now a blatant
and open hostility to our holy Church.

418
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:45,503
- As we discovered in Germany...
- And what do you expect me to do?

419
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:48,862
I beg you to use the great influence
you have here at court...

420
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:52,825
...to pull England back from the brink
of catastrophe and ruin.

421
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,740
For the love we all bear
for Christ and his apostles.

422
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,669
What apostles?

423
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:02,784
I don't believe Christ had apostles,
not even Saint Peter.

424
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,663
Those men were all charlatans...

425
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:07,988
...who pretended to follow Christ
and speak in his name.

426
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:11,149
And they built a Church
upon their lies.

427
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:16,590
Mother of God.

428
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:22,189
Your Honour, Your Honour, so grateful.

429
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,029
Sir, this is Augustus de Augustinis.

430
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,903
A private physician
to Thomas Wolsey.

431
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,989
Wolsey?
What do you know about him?

432
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:34,663
Sir, I know that Wolsey sought the help
of the emperor and the p...

433
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,220
The pope?
- Yes, your honour...

434
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:40,423
...His Holiness the pope.
Against His Majesty.

435
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:43,344
- They communicated?
- Yes, yes, yes.

436
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,306
And who else?

437
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:48,867
Wolsey conspired
with Queen Catherine...

438
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:52,950
...because he said it was the only way
that he could be...

439
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,340
- Restored to power.
- Yes.

440
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,870
The king must know of this.

441
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:05,901
Now you know the truth,
you must act against him.

442
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:11,022
He and his fellow priests
and prelates...

443
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:13,699
...think they can control
Your Majesty's realm.

444
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,266
That they are higher than you.

445
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,668
And by taking instruction
from the pope...

446
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:23,910
...was not Wolsey acting
as an agent of a foreign country?

447
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:26,309
The presumption of the pope...

448
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:30,663
...thinking he could tell you,
you, what to do.

449
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:49,710
Wolsey, sir.
In the name of the king.

450
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:52,067
- Get up.
- Get out of bed.

451
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:56,105
- No, no.
- He's done nothing.

452
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,305
Thomas Wolsey, you are arrested
by order of the king...

453
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,467
...and charged with high treason.

454
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:05,026
You will be taken to London,
where you will be tried.

455
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:07,910
- There, there, Joan.
- Guards.

456
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:11,865
No tears.
No tears for me, I beg you.

457
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,106
Forgive me.

458
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:19,108
For you have not much
to remember me by.

459
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:25,821
No. I have a life and everything in it
to remember you by.

460
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,624
Guards, shackle him.

461
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:38,070
Well, well, Brandon.

462
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:43,627
If I had served God as diligently
as I served the king...

463
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,267
...he would not have given me up
in my grey hairs.

464
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:55,429
Move on.

465
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,306
Joan.

466
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:07,506
Joan.

467
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:13,305
I regret to have to inform
Your Majesty...

468
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:17,140
...that I can no longer continue
to serve the emperor at this court.

469
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:24,461
There is so much hatred here
for everything that is sacred and true...

470
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:28,381
...that those who speak brazenly of it
have driven me away.

471
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:34,822
You are not to blame.

472
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:40,464
You have always served me
with wisdom and kindness.

473
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,788
I will not forget it.

474
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:45,867
Send my love to my nephew.

475
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:49,990
I will inform His Highness
of your plight...

476
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:54,662
...and of the malice and unkindness
of His Majesty towards you.

477
00:37:57,831 --> 00:37:59,787
Yes, tell him.

478
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:05,189
But this also, for the love I bear
this country as well as him.

479
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:10,390
He must not think to use force
against His Majesty or his people.

480
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:16,225
It would be a sin against
my conscience and against God.

481
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:09,429
Lord, we have not spoken
as long or as often as we should.

482
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,749
I have often been
about other business.

483
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:20,548
If I wanted forgiveness,
I should ask for it...

484
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,300
...but for all that I have done...

485
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:33,345
...and for all that I am yet to do,
there can be no forgiveness.

486
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:44,070
And yet, I think, I'm not an evil man.

487
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:56,025
Though evil men pray louder...

488
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:58,347
...and seek penance...

489
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:04,342
...and think themselves
closer to heaven than I am.

490
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:08,260
I shall not see its gates, Lord.

491
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:13,310
Nor hear
your sweet words of salvation.

492
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:22,700
I have seen eternity, I swear...

493
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:30,982
...but it was in a dream,
and in the morning all was gone.

494
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:44,944
I know myself for what I am.

495
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:51,627
And I throw my poor soul
upon your forgiveness...

496
00:41:53,071 --> 00:41:58,623
...in the full knowledge
that I deserve none...

497
00:41:58,831 --> 00:42:01,391
...at your loving hands.

498
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,945
Welcome to hell.

499
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:39,222
Mr. Cromwell.

500
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,103
Majesty...

501
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,500
Cardinal Wolsey is dead.

502
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,588
I'm sorry to hear that.

503
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,708
I wish he'd have lived.

504
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:14,507
How did he die?

505
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,307
Took his own life.

506
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:30,380
No one must ever know.
Do you understand?

507
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:34,986
No one. Never.

508
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:45,426
I'll finish my game, and we'll talk.

509
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,550
Go.

510
00:44:57,551 --> 00:44:59,064
Go.

511
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:01,943
Go.

512
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:36,260
Sir Thomas, I have just heard.

513
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:39,508
By His Majesty's order,
15 senior clergymen...

514
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,350
...have been arrested
for recognising Wolsey's authority.

515
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:44,900
There is also a statute
before parliament...

516
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:47,671
...which recognizes in matters
temporal and spiritual...

517
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:52,023
...the king is above the law
and shall give account to God alone.

518
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,822
What can be done?

519
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,501
I am reminded of something
Wolsey once told me.

520
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:08,069
That I should only tell the king what
he ought to do not what he could do.

521
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:14,350
"For if the lion knows his own strength,
no man could control him."

522
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:20,105
We're standing
on the edge of the abyss.

523
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:23,591
God knows what shall become of us.

524
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:40,703
I want you.

525
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:39,709
- I'm gonna come.
- No, you mustn't.

526
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:02,744
Perhaps you could imagine a way
to keep his interest more prolonged?
