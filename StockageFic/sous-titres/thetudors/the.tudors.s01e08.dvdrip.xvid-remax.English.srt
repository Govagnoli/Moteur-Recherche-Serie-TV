1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:05,138
You think you know a story
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,617
To get to the heart of the story
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,614
Your Grace.

4
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,891
His Eminence, Cardinal Campeggio.

5
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,854
Lorenzo, my old friend.

6
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,368
My dear Wolsey.

7
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,294
Come.

8
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:31,287
Your Grace must forgive
my incapacity.

9
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:36,175
God has given me gout
as a great trial.

10
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,812
Now, His Majesty is very keen...

11
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,374
...that the legatine court
be set up straight away...

12
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,854
...to determine the case
for his annulment.

13
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,452
Indeed, indeed.

14
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,413
I have the pope's written commission
to decide upon this matter.

15
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:03,294
And from my decision,
there can be no appeal.

16
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,770
And yet...

17
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,458
If Your Grace has some water.

18
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,972
Water.

19
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,334
Mixed perhaps with a little wine.

20
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:18,814
And yet?

21
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,729
You and I are old friends.

22
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,693
And we are both men of the world,
Cardinal Wolsey.

23
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,453
I even have a son
who travels with me.

24
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:30,887
And so?

25
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:36,613
His Holiness wishes to satisfy the king,
however difficult that might be.

26
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,413
But for all our sakes,
would it not be better...

27
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:43,407
...if you and I were to try and persuade
His Majesty to give up his divorce?

28
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:48,894
Surely his passion for this girl
will alter and fade with time...

29
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,653
...as all such passions inevitably do.

30
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,538
I fear Your Eminence may have
proceeded here in ignorance.

31
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,697
Let me make certain things
plain to you.

32
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,212
If you do not grant the king
his divorce...

33
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,537
...papal authority in England
will be annihilated.

34
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,048
You should remember,
the greater part of Germany...

35
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,092
...has already become
estranged from Rome.

36
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,859
The same thing could happen here.

37
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,734
It would mean
the total ruin of the kingdom.

38
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:28,651
Is there any danger that they could
declare your marriage valid?

39
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:32,818
Wolsey has assured me that the pope
has already decided in my favour.

40
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,692
The trial's
just for the sake of appearances...

41
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,572
...a way of appeasing the emperor.

42
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,530
Then we can start planning
the wedding?

43
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,491
Yes.

44
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,449
Yes, my love.

45
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:56,409
Also for the sake of appearances,
there is something else.

46
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,656
For a while,
I shall have to share Catherine's table.

47
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,813
And sometimes her bed.

48
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,288
- Her bed?
- It's nothing.

49
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,097
My lawyers have just advised me that
to do otherwise might risk countersuit.

50
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,859
I could be seen to be acting
against her conjugal rights.

51
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,369
You think it's nothing
to go back to bed with your wife?

52
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,977
What do you think
is going to happen?

53
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,093
What usually happens.

54
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,929
How little you trust me.

55
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,776
I trust you.

56
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,174
I love you.

57
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,009
Catherine is not to blame for this.
Nor am I.

58
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,693
But the fact is, Excellence,
we broke God's law...

59
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,538
...for which there can be
no dispensation.

60
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,733
You understand how deeply
this touches my conscience...

61
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,499
...and how quickly
I need it to be resolved.

62
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,617
I do. I sympathise.

63
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,009
As does His Holiness, naturally.

64
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,853
But His Holiness also suggests
to Your Majesty...

65
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:10,731
...another possible solution.

66
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:16,495
I have already made it plain
to Your Eminence that His Majesty...

67
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,371
No, this is not the same, my friend.

68
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,895
This is a solution which should
very much please His Majesty.

69
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,367
What is it?

70
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,328
His Holiness is aware
of the queen's great piety.

71
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,691
She herself has spoken of it, her love
for the Mother of God, for the saints.

72
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,732
And he wonders if Her Majesty
might be persuaded...

73
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,249
...like Jeanne de Valois,
the sometime wife of Louis Xll...

74
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,608
...to abdicate her marriage...

75
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,373
...and retreat to a nunnery.

76
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,612
What do you think, Wolsey?

77
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,213
Well, it would certainly
expedite matters.

78
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,331
It would save us the pain of a trial.

79
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,137
And since it would be voluntary...

80
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,648
...it couldn't offend her nephew,
the emperor.

81
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:04,570
And moreover, it would afford
Her Majesty an honourable retirement.

82
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,733
You will put this to her right away.

83
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,211
Majesty.

84
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,732
Will Your Majesty
at least consider the proposal?

85
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,499
I will give you my answer
in due course...

86
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,817
...after I have spoken with the king,
my husband.

87
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:29,735
Father, will you hear
my confession later?

88
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,930
Yes, my child.

89
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,737
- Your Majesty.
- Your Eminence.

90
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,736
Your Majesty.

91
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,411
I beg that you yield to the king's will.

92
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,968
- And what is his will?
- As His Eminence proposes.

93
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,216
That you join a religious community
of your choosing...

94
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,535
...and take a vow
of perpetual chastity.

95
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,451
You speak to me of chastity?

96
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,213
Have you not a mistress
and two children, Your Eminence?

97
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,252
Your Majesty is entering
the third period of your natural life.

98
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,575
You spent the first two
setting a good example.

99
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,215
With this single act, you could
put the seal on all your good actions.

100
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,647
Please rise, Your Grace.

101
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,054
It is not seemly
for a man of your dignity...

102
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,456
...to be seen to beg in public,
whatever the cause.

103
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,567
Eminence.

104
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,854
- So you talked to Campeggio?
- Yes.

105
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:45,887
I told him I could not give an answer
without Your Majesty's permission.

106
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,777
And what answer will you give him?

107
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,287
- I will tell him the truth.
- Catherine.

108
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:55,132
All the world now agrees
that your marriage to me was unjust.

109
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,810
Even you must acknowledge it.

110
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:01,051
So unless you agree to take the veil,
I shall have to force you.

111
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,254
Do I have your permission
to talk to Campeggio?

112
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:13,857
I will not speak to him
if you do not want me to.

113
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:32,893
- My lady.
- Lady Anne.

114
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,016
Master Cromwell.

115
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,135
Do you have a message
from the king?

116
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,177
I think we understand each other.

117
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,375
A mutual friend, a Mr. Fish,
now living in exile in Holland...

118
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,171
...has sent me a gift for you.

119
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,815
What is it, Master Cromwell?

120
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,456
The Obedience of the Christian Man
by William Tyndale.

121
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,453
It contains many good criticisms
of the papacy...

122
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,332
...and of the arrogance
and abuses of priests.

123
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,894
You will find it most illuminating.

124
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,489
But always and ever be cautious
as to whom you show this.

125
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,896
You must know it might be
accounted heresy even to possess it.

126
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,613
And Wolsey is still keen enough
to prosecute heretics...

127
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:18,812
...as we are called,
who embrace the true religion.

128
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,491
I will.

129
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,894
And God bless you,
Master Cromwell.

130
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,851
Wait.

131
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,497
Please,
will you give this to the king?

132
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:39,457
With my love.

133
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,811
My lady.

134
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,414
Come here.

135
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,411
Chicken.

136
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,737
Chick...

137
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,137
Good chicken.

138
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,530
Don't run away.

139
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,017
Got you.

140
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,256
You never even told me your name.

141
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:34,092
- Jane.
- Jane.

142
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,251
Why did you leave the court?

143
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:41,768
When your sister died...

144
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:47,691
My sister is still here, Thomas Tallis.

145
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,407
She hasn't left me.

146
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,492
She can't leave me.

147
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,572
You can see her too, can't you?

148
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:19,257
I came all the way from London.

149
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,415
And I really want you
to come back to court.

150
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:22,887
Why?

151
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,533
You liked my sister more than me.
I could tell.

152
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,452
I want to marry you, Jane.

153
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,456
What is it you wish to confess?

154
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,970
Father, I wish to tell you about
my first marriage to Prince Arthur...

155
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,578
...His Majesty's older brother.

156
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:02,775
I know of it. Go on.

157
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,730
He never knew me.

158
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,817
I swear to you,
under the sacramental oath...

159
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:13,168
...I was intacta e incorrupta da lui
comme venne dal ventre di sua madra.

160
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,294
I want to be clear.

161
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:19,811
You say you were untouched
and unviolated by Prince Arthur...

162
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,533
...as when you came from the womb
of your mother?

163
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,732
Yes, Father.

164
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:29,895
So you came to the king's bed
a virgin, intacta e incorrupta?

165
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,097
Yes, Father.

166
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,977
Father, I say in all humility...

167
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,215
...I cannot accede to your request.

168
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,933
I am the true and legitimate wife
of His Majesty.

169
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,891
Therefore your proposal
is inadmissible.

170
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,247
Come what may...

171
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,093
...I will live and die
in that vocation to matrimony...

172
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,096
...to which God has called me.

173
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,567
I understand.

174
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:01,131
Furthermore, I give you permission
to break the seal of the confessional...

175
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,654
...and tell the whole world
what I have told you.

176
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,374
Henry wants you back at court.

177
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,529
You are his sister after all.

178
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,329
How can I return
while he flaunts himself with his slut?

179
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,938
I would be seen to be approving
of his ridiculous liaison.

180
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,495
Margaret, you and I must stay in the
king's good graces or we are nothing.

181
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,407
Let him marry who he wishes.

182
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,332
That was always your philosophy,
wasn't it, Charles?

183
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,089
So very cynical.

184
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,532
Is that why you keep company
with that devil Boleyn?

185
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:53,612
You liked him enough once
when he helped us back to court.

186
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,295
Or were you just being cynical?

187
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,969
I didn't see all of his game.
Now I do, I despise him.

188
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,172
So do I. But I hate Wolsey more.

189
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:07,132
- It's a marriage of expedience.
- Rather like ours?

190
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,092
No. I loved you.

191
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,136
You don't know
the meaning of the word.

192
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,338
You can love...

193
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,935
...perhaps for a year
or a month, a day...

194
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,534
...even for an hour.

195
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,250
And in that hour...

196
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:32,811
...I do believe you love
as well and deeply...

197
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,367
...as any man.

198
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:42,614
But after that hour, you love not.

199
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:46,850
You love another...

200
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,815
...and then another.

201
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:52,809
Your love...

202
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,214
...is most generous
where it is most hurtful.

203
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:02,697
- Margaret.
- Don't play the fool.

204
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,890
Doesn't become you.

205
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,977
Eminence.

206
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,170
I need to see Cardinal Campeggio.

207
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:33,531
Forgive me. My father is indisposed.

208
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,576
In any case, there is nothing further
he can do for the time being.

209
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,337
He has sent some reports to Rome...

210
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:43,417
...and must await the replies
from His Holiness.

211
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,930
And in the meantime...

212
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:51,088
...my poor father needs to rest
and restore his strength.

213
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:09,299
- Lady Anne.
- Good evening, Lady Anne Boleyn.

214
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,329
- There is the Mistress Boleyn?
- Yes, there she is.

215
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,858
The girl for whom the king...

216
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,415
...would sacrifice his marriage
to a most gracious and loving queen.

217
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,575
I have tried to argue him
out of his course.

218
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:25,495
But I swear that an angel descending
from heaven would not dissuade him.

219
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:28,890
Do you think they have taken things
to the ultimate conjunction?

220
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:38,767
I've received a petition from the dukes
of Suffolk, Norfolk and Lord Boleyn...

221
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,971
...saying the divorce has the support
of the people of England.

222
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,170
As Your Eminence
would quickly discover...

223
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:47,735
...if you stepped outside these doors
and saw the people...

224
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,531
...that is a manifest lie.

225
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,771
On the contrary,
the people love their queen.

226
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,334
And they have every reason
to do so.

227
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,018
If you'll excuse me.

228
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,934
- Wolsey.
- Her Majesty has refused the offer.

229
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,248
Are you surprised?

230
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,172
However, Campeggio tells me...

231
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:21,530
...that the pope is prepared
to consider legitimising any children...

232
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:24,094
...that you might have
with Mistress Boleyn...

233
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,096
...whether you are married or not.

234
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,096
Are you mad?

235
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,291
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

236
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,929
Forgive me, Ambassador Mendoza.

237
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,896
I am new to this court.

238
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,130
Who are these men
talking with the king?

239
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,258
Lord Rochford is the father
of Anne Boleyn, Norfolk is her uncle.

240
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,257
Like the Duke of Suffolk,
they are Wolsey's sworn enemies...

241
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:59,057
...and everyone at court knows it.

242
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,295
They would stop at nothing
to bring him down.

243
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:03,410
Yet the king still loves him?

244
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,132
Not so much as before, perhaps.

245
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:09,415
But the cardinal
should never be underestimated.

246
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,815
May I know what you think
of the king's matter?

247
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,734
It is no secret
that the emperor is outraged...

248
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,209
...at the king's behaviour
toward the queen.

249
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:23,493
And I can tell you in strict confidence
that he has written to His Holiness...

250
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,975
...demanding that the matter be settled
in Rome, not here.

251
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,855
He would not seek to interfere
in any other way?

252
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,208
In what way?

253
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:35,013
Well, if the queen
were to be renounced...

254
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:38,655
...might he consider
military intervention on her behalf?

255
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,890
He has not said so.

256
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,693
- Has anyone asked him?
- No.

257
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,248
Not yet.

258
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:51,094
- Your Majesty.
- Margaret.

259
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,209
Not her. She's not worth it.

260
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:00,019
She's a cheap nothing.

261
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:02,853
Open your eyes. Look at her.

262
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,731
Look at yourself.

263
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,049
Look to your own marriage.

264
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,296
How are you?

265
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:20,136
Burning.

266
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,972
Burning with impatience.

267
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,375
My lady, Archbishop Warham...

268
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,656
...and Bishop Tunstall
are here to see you.

269
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,178
My lords.

270
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,695
I understand that you are among
my council for the legatine court.

271
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:33,608
As honourable men whose first duty
is to God and your conscience...

272
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:35,047
...you are welcome.

273
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,492
- Has the king sent you?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

274
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:39,927
We must discuss your brief.

275
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:45,173
I have nothing against His Majesty,
whom I love with all my being...

276
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:47,449
...only against his advisers...

277
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:50,856
...and a certain woman whose ambition
would ruin a kingdom.

278
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,092
Madam, we are not here
to discuss a brief or any such.

279
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,775
- But...
- We came here to report, madam...

280
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:02,335
...that rumours of plots against the life
of His Majesty are abroad.

281
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,408
And plots against
Cardinal Campeggio.

282
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,814
If any such plots
were to be successful...

283
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:11,056
...then clearly both you
and your daughter...

284
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:14,535
...would be suspected
of involvement.

285
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,698
I cannot believe the king
would give credence to such rumours...

286
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:25,130
...since he knows, as you know...

287
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:29,093
...that I value my husband's life
even much more than my own.

288
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,369
Madam,
there is yet another complaint.

289
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:35,370
That you are flippant and show yourself
too much to the people.

290
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:39,453
That you rejoice in their acclaim,
smiling, nodding and waving at them.

291
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:43,487
Therefore,
we suppose that you hate the king.

292
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,695
Why should you suppose that?

293
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:50,137
Because you don't accept that all this
time you've been living in sin with him.

294
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:54,770
Even when the truth has been revealed,
you refuse to accept the king's offer...

295
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:57,334
...offer to retire to a religious house.

296
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,575
That again.

297
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,818
I have answered for that already.
God never called me to a nunnery.

298
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,250
I am His Majesty's
true and legitimate wife.

299
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:12,378
- Madam, for the love of God...
- Yes, for the love of God.

300
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:14,968
As you yourself once professed,
archbishop.

301
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,613
You told people
that you knew my case to be true.

302
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,172
So, what changed your mind?

303
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,087
Was it Wolsey?

304
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,772
Tell me, do you prefer your place
in this earth...

305
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,651
...rather than your place in heaven?

306
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:33,969
- You have not answered the charges.
- Sir.

307
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:40,418
I consider it hard indeed to be charged
and accused by my own lawyers.

308
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,048
Where is the justice in that?

309
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,047
I will speak to you no more,
but you will not act for me.

310
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,291
Catherine.

311
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:44,538
Why do you go on
denying me justice?

312
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:47,134
You're so heartless.

313
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,128
So full of hatred.

314
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,731
I can't persuade myself any longer
that you love me.

315
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,731
I do love you.

316
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:01,772
I have never ceased to love you.
You know that.

317
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,935
I don't know it.

318
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,087
Perhaps you should be kept
away from our daughter...

319
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,528
...in case you start poisoning
her mind against me.

320
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:13,094
How can you say these things to me?

321
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:16,689
After all this time, after all
that we have meant to each other.

322
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,930
I'm only asking you to be reasonable.

323
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:23,858
I am being reasonable.
It is you who will not be reasonable.

324
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,334
What is it you really want, Thomas?

325
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,051
- Want?
- In life.

326
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:46,814
What do you want?

327
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,138
I don't know. Travel, I suppose.

328
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,058
Adventure, if I could.

329
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:57,767
Travel? Where would you go?

330
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,372
Have you not heard?

331
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,651
Sea discoverers
to new worlds have gone.

332
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:08,217
Cabot to Newfoundland,
others to America, the Indies.

333
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:14,369
Some speak of China, Cathay,
the fabled lands of Marco Polo.

334
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:16,058
But where would you go?

335
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:27,135
I'd set out here...

336
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,487
...though the hair is a forest
of ambush and snares.

337
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:37,497
But the brow becalms us
when it's smooth and plain.

338
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:40,657
And the dark pools of the eyes
are dangerous to our ship...

339
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:45,051
...for to be drawn into them
would be shipwreck.

340
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,890
The nose, like the first meridian,
directs us down...

341
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:51,050
...to the Islands Fortunate...

342
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,568
...the swelling lips.

343
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,770
I would anchor here...

344
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,418
...and hear the siren songs.

345
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,770
Then sailing on...

346
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,489
...past the glorious promontory
of chin.

347
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,695
We may encounter survivors...

348
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:17,011
...as we travel down
towards your India.

349
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:20,697
And we pause at the Atlantic navel.

350
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,417
Then the current carries our pilot on...

351
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:26,052
...to another forest...

352
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:28,935
...where many are shipwrecked...

353
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:31,130
...and no further ever get.

354
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:49,528
I have a new motto.

355
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,337
What is it?

356
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:57,728
You'll have to find it.

357
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,811
Where is it?

358
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,211
On a piece of ribbon
hidden somewhere.

359
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,570
Is it here?

360
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,337
No.

361
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:35,976
- Down there?
- No.

362
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:57,337
Is it down here?

363
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:00,859
I can't wait much longer.

364
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:02,890
You won't have to.

365
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:12,208
Your Majesty, there are fresh delays.

366
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,852
No one can see Campeggio.

367
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,852
Where is it? Tell me.

368
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,698
What if someone
is deliberately stalling?

369
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:22,971
Delaying things, making excuses.

370
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:24,967
Campeggio?

371
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:29,331
No. No, someone else,
someone much closer to you.

372
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,295
I'm touching it.

373
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,659
That's how it's going to be.

374
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:12,929
Let them grumble.

375
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,977
Someone much closer to you.

376
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,012
I want to ask you frankly
about Campeggio.

377
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:33,137
Do you trust him?

378
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,608
Do you think he's compromised?

379
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:40,011
Who knows, perhaps he's getting
a pension from the emperor.

380
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,892
As I know it,
Lorenzo is the least prejudicial of men.

381
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:46,136
And he has suffered personally
at the hands of Charles's soldiers.

382
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:48,534
When they entered Rome,
they ransacked his house.

383
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,695
I don't believe he has love
for the emperor.

384
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,617
Then why is he delaying the trial?

385
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:57,656
Well, there are some technical matters
that need to be resolved, that's all.

386
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:00,532
There is nothing for Your Majesty
to be concerned about.

387
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,889
Goddamn it.
It's not Campeggio at all, it's you.

388
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,532
You are the one delaying things.
You've gone cold on this divorce.

389
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,371
Perhaps you never believed in it.

390
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:12,013
You lied to me,
pretending to be on my side.

391
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:15,973
Majesty, I swear before you
and before God on my honour...

392
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:17,851
...I am your most humble servant.

393
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:22,209
And there is nothing on earth I covet
so much as advancing your divorce.

394
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,058
And to bring it to pass
is my continual study...

395
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,658
...and my most ardent desire...

396
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:30,010
...for which I am ready to expend
my life and my body and my blood...

397
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:31,891
...so help me God.

398
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:50,451
Come, Your Grace.
Don't be so dismayed.

399
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,612
You understand my impatience.

400
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:00,454
I know it's not you.

401
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:02,895
I trust you.

402
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,772
I've known you a long time.

403
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,094
Come, let's talk of other things.

404
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:17,052
By God's body, Master More.

405
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:27,329
The anger of the prince
means death.

406
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:34,207
Majesty.

407
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:42,088
I want you to go to Rome,
Mr. Cromwell.

408
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,052
I want you to force
His fucking Holiness into submission.

409
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:48,456
If necessary, telling him that
if he does not grant me my annulment...

410
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,889
...England will withdraw
its submission to Rome...

411
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:53,533
...and I will withdraw
my allegiance to him.

412
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,094
And make sure he knows
this is no idle threat.

413
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,731
I mean it and I will do it
if he does not satisfy me.

414
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:05,970
Send in the Duke of Suffolk.

415
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,613
My Lord Duke,
the king summons you.

416
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,093
Charles.

417
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,738
I have a task for you.

418
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,453
I want you to go to Paris
and seek out King Francis.

419
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:19,536
Question him closely
about Campeggio.

420
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:23,254
Ask him what kind of dealings he's had
with him, what kind of man he is.

421
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,973
Is he honest? Does he have
any ambitions to be pope?

422
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,728
And ask him, does he have
any secret dealings with the emperor?

423
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,213
I'll leave at once.

424
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:33,091
And, Charles...

425
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:38,413
...ask him about Wolsey.

426
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,572
I want to know everything
he knows about him.

427
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:44,298
You understand?

428
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,049
I want to know
whose side Wolsey's on.

429
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,256
Sir Thomas.

430
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:04,935
Most gracious sovereign lady.

431
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,089
I have brought Bishop Fisher
to see you.

432
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,729
I believe he can offer you
true and devoted counsel.

433
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:13,418
Thank you, Sir Thomas.

434
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,656
Majesty.

435
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,536
Please.

436
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,374
Lord Bishop, are you certain
that you wish to act for me?

437
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:36,171
You must be aware of the dangers
and difficulties you may face.

438
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:40,773
I would understand if you
would prefer peace and tranquillity.

439
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,658
Gentle madam, what peace
or tranquillity can there be...

440
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:46,817
...without justice
and the love of God?

441
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,928
I have studied the case against you
very carefully.

442
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,251
They will no doubt press the fact
that the pope's dispensation...

443
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,974
...to allow you to marry the king
was technically faulty...

444
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,407
...and therefore invalid.

445
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:05,208
But the obvious way of resolving
any such technical deficiency...

446
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:08,092
...is not to declare
the marriage null and void...

447
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,296
...but to issue fresh
and more perfect dispensation.

448
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:16,252
In any case,
the continuance of so long space...

449
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,973
...has rendered the marriage honest.

450
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:21,488
And the principle
of supplet ecclesia...

451
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,610
...let the church provide.

452
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:28,057
...has itself made good
any defects in the pope's dispensation.

453
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,329
Then you suppose we may win?

454
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,898
We may win the argument, yes.

455
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,092
But I cannot pretend
that it will avail us much.

456
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,009
We shall still try.

457
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,176
Be of good cheer, madam...

458
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,329
...for we are on the side
of the angels.

459
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,335
Hearts are trumps.

460
00:35:57,259 --> 00:35:58,487
What is it?

461
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:00,367
I've heard from Cromwell.

462
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:05,215
He was eventually allowed access
to the pope but wrote in desperation.

463
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:06,374
Why?

464
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:09,298
He doesn't believe Clement
will do anything for me.

465
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,254
He said, " It might be in his paternoster,
but it's nothing in his creed."

466
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:16,809
The pope might pray
for me to solve my problems.

467
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,250
But he won't personally commit
to doing anything about it.

468
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,618
Show.

469
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:29,094
Show me.

470
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:55,216
We entertained the pope as he passed.
And I spoke personally to Campeggio.

471
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,010
He was very careful.

472
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,978
But even in the few words he spoke,
I thought he dissembled.

473
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,447
In what way dissembled?

474
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:05,452
I think he shows one face
but conceals another.

475
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:09,055
He has been asked to deal
with a matter he secretly despises.

476
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:13,456
So my advice to the king,
my brother...

477
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,735
...is to not put too much trust
in any man...

478
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:17,930
...in case he should be deceived.

479
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:20,695
And would you say the same
of Cardinal Wolsey?

480
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,216
I have nothing against His Eminence.

481
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:29,852
Of course not.

482
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,210
But what do you think
his attitude is towards the divorce?

483
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,687
As I could tell,
he wanted the divorce to go through...

484
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:39,333
...because he has no love
for the queen.

485
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,377
At the same time...

486
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,817
At the same time?

487
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:48,375
It is my impression that he has
marvellous intelligence with the pope.

488
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:51,696
They understand each other.
And also with Cardinal Campeggio.

489
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:54,254
Therefore, if he has
such understanding with them...

490
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,893
...and they are not minded
to advance the matter...

491
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:59,169
...then, to speak frankly to you...

492
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:03,088
...I think the king should take
a closer interest in it himself.

493
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:09,289
That is my advice.

494
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:12,897
Majesty.

495
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,447
Where is he going?

496
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,893
I'm sure to service
his latest mistress.

497
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:29,375
Now, why would he have to do that
when he has such a beautiful wife?

498
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:31,697
You should ask him, monsieur.

499
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,297
Don't you ever want
to pay him back?

500
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:41,134
Of course, always. I'm a woman.

501
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,576
Then go to bed with me.

502
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,367
If you like.

503
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:51,767
But tell me first...

504
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:54,775
...how is your beautiful wife?

505
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,769
- She's...
- She is just like me, non?

506
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,053
You have affairs and she ignores it.

507
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:07,577
To make love for revenge or pain,
what is that?

508
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,738
It hurts the mind.
And the soul, it shrinks.

509
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,169
The soul grows smaller.

510
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:19,847
And perhaps it even dies.

511
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:36,212
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

512
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,777
Leave us.

513
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,172
The trial is coming.

514
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:50,530
Indeed, Your Grace.

515
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,332
I want to make it plain to you again.

516
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:11,135
If you refuse to grant the divorce...

517
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:15,575
...you will provoke a marvellous
opinion against the pope...

518
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:19,454
...against the papal courts,
and against the papacy itself.

519
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:24,329
I am obliged to the Holy Father
to seek truth and justice in this matter.

520
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:27,133
And that, Your Grace,
I will attempt to do...

521
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:28,698
...as God is my witness.

522
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:31,288
You still do not seem to understand.

523
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:33,490
So let me spell it out for you.

524
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,969
If you fail to find
in favour of the king...

525
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:38,653
...you will lose the king...

526
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:42,090
...and the devotion
of his realm to Rome.

527
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:45,530
And you will also utterly destroy me.

528
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,809
And that I cannot allow.

529
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:50,254
I totally understand.

530
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,734
You must have faith,
Cardinal Wolsey.

531
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:00,855
God help me.

532
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:14,972
My lords, it has become obvious
that Wolsey is severely compromised...

533
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,138
...and no longer enjoys the affinity
he used to share with His Majesty.

534
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,337
The king is suspicious
of his first minister.

535
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,535
And we should encourage
those suspicions.

536
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:27,293
It is time to bring him down.

537
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:28,574
Here is a pamphlet.

538
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:33,212
You see, it mocks his period in office
as a time of pride, waste...

539
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:36,895
...repression and ineffectual policies.

540
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,612
It's ready for distribution.

541
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:41,692
We shall call for the arrest
of Wolsey and his agents...

542
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:44,772
...the impounding of their papers
and a thorough examination...

543
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:46,935
...of his administration.

544
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:51,610
His corruption will be exposed
and treason guaranteed.

545
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,329
All that remains, Boleyn, is for your
daughter to prove to the king...

546
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,809
...that all his suspicions
are justified.

547
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,614
And then the cardinal
will be naked to his enemies.

548
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,858
- To England.
- To England.

549
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:38,848
- Christ.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry.

550
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,095
- I'm sorry.
- Stupid dog!

551
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:27,894
- Amen.
- Amen.

552
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:29,054
- Amen.
- Amen.

553
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:32,057
I declare this legatine court...

554
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:36,537
...commissioned by His Holiness,
Pope Clement, is now in session.

555
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,448
And all that is said here
is said under oath...

556
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,889
...and in the presence
of God Almighty.

557
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:48,810
I call upon His Majesty
to speak first as to this matter.

558
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,691
Your Eminences know well
what cause I have to be here.

559
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:05,298
It concerns some scruples I have
regarding my marriage...

560
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:07,495
...which prick my conscience.

561
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:13,255
I have consulted widely
to discover the truth.

562
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:18,254
And I have read in Leviticus
that it was against God's law...

563
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:22,253
...and a sin,
for me to marry my brother's wife.

564
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:24,927
Your Eminences...

565
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:29,172
...I am not the only one who questions
the validity of my marriage.

566
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:31,176
All of my bishops share my doubts...

567
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,655
...and they have signed a petition
to put the matter to question.

568
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:38,459
My Lords, I tell you now...

569
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:41,696
...I never signed my name
to any such document.

570
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:46,016
- And if it appears there...
- Court has not invited you to speak.

571
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:49,569
If it appears there,
then Bishop Tunstall wrote it...

572
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:51,007
...without my consent.

573
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:52,977
The king has the floor. Sit down, sir.

574
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:55,818
- Sit.
- I'm not going to argue with you now.

575
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:00,091
After all, you are but one man.

576
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:05,448
As for the main issue...

577
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:09,891
...if I am asked why I waited so long
to bring this question to trial...

578
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:12,414
...I shall answer truthfully.

579
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:16,254
That it was the great love
that I bore for Her Majesty...

580
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:18,615
...which prevented me doing so.

581
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:23,209
It is I, myself,
who bear all responsibility...

582
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:27,776
...for my conscience which troubles
and doubts me.

583
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:30,331
Gentlemen of the court...

584
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:35,528
...I ask for one thing
and one thing only.

585
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:38,458
Justice.

586
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:49,336
In a moment, the court will call upon
the queen's majesty...

587
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,291
...to reply to the king's statement.

588
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:54,372
But first, I must tell the court...

589
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:58,568
...that the queen has sought,
through her advisers...

590
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:03,131
...to question the competence
of this court to try her case.

591
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:07,818
Further, she questions
the impartiality of her judges.

592
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,619
Finally, she contends
that this matter is in the hands...

593
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:12,775
...of a higher authority,
namely the pope...

594
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,812
...and therefore
can only be tried in Rome.

595
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:18,973
Now, as for the first matter.

596
00:46:19,899 --> 00:46:21,696
Cardinal Campeggio and I
can confirm...

597
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:25,289
...that we have the necessary
authorization from His Holiness...

598
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:27,455
...to try this matter here.

599
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:33,734
Further, we reject any notion
of prejudice on our part...

600
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:38,615
...and will continue to try the case here
as we have been appointed.

601
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:44,576
So I call upon Her Majesty,
Queen Catherine, to address the court.

602
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:01,174
My lord.

603
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:05,648
Sir.

604
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:12,730
I beseech you...

605
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:15,612
...for all the love
that has been between us...

606
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:18,532
...let me have justice and right.

607
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:22,169
Give me some pity and compassion,
for I am a poor woman and a stranger...

608
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:24,728
...born out of your dominion.

609
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:28,249
I have no friend here
and little counsel.

610
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:31,857
I flee to you,
as head of justice in this realm.

611
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:35,095
I call God and all the world
to witness...

612
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:39,178
...that I have been to you
a true, humble and obedient wife...

613
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:42,491
...ever comfortable to your will
and pleasure.

614
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:45,378
I have loved all those
whom you have loved, for your sake.

615
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:46,898
Whether or not I had cause...

616
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:51,172
...whether they be my friends
or enemies.

617
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:57,058
By me,
you have had many children...

618
00:47:57,259 --> 00:48:00,695
...although it has pleased God
to call them from this world.

619
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:03,295
But when you had me at first...

620
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,851
...I take God as my judge...

621
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:10,610
...I was a true maid
without touch of man.

622
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:14,489
And whether or not it be true...

623
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:19,335
...I put it to your conscience.

624
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,816
- Now, what is she doing?
- Shame.

625
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:49,894
Catherine, queen of England,
come back into the court.

626
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:55,569
Come back into the court.

627
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:00,498
Perhaps Your Majesty
should turn back. You are being called.

628
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:03,691
This court has no meaning for me.
Therefore, I will not stay here.

629
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,174
Catherine, queen of England...

630
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:08,569
...come back into the court.

631
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:32,813
She spits in the face of papal law.

632
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:35,732
She holds this court in contempt.
