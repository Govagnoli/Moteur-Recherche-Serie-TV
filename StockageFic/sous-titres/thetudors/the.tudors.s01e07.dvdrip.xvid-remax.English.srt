1
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:05,397
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,672
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,192
Sir William.

4
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,516
- Sir William. What is it?
- Go and fetch the physician.

5
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,187
Go and get him now.

6
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,672
Sir.

7
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,637
Good God, man.
Why did no one wake him?

8
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,909
Sleep in these cases is fatal.

9
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,229
Keep away. Keep away, you fools.

10
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,111
Your master
has the sweating sickness.

11
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,309
You two. You, stay.

12
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:23,232
We must try and treat him.
Poor fellow.

13
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,078
Turn him over.

14
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,195
For the love of God, get on with it.
We may yet save him.

15
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,875
I'm going to cut into his back.

16
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,513
For I heard that it sometimes works.

17
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,392
It draws out some of the toxin.

18
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,798
Hold him now.

19
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,314
- What are you doing?
- May I not meet him?

20
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,430
God, woman, out. Out.

21
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,188
His Majesty the king
and Lady Anne Boleyn.

22
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,073
- Wolsey.
- Your Majesty.

23
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:39,115
Mistress Anne.
You are most welcome.

24
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,518
I must thank Your Eminence...

25
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,994
...for the magnificent brooch
you sent me.

26
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,429
I am so glad you liked it.

27
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,791
It is Italianate.
I thought the craftsmanship superb.

28
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,756
I'm sure Your Majesty
will be pleased...

29
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,076
...with the presents sent by the king
of France. A golden chalice...

30
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,997
...gold silk altar cloths...

31
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,511
...and tapestries worth,
I'm sure, at least 30,000 ducats.

32
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,875
So we are once more allies
with the French.

33
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,355
Indeed. And we are both officially
at war with the emperor.

34
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,352
Good. It pleases me.

35
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,352
As it pleased the emperor to announce
he has just had a son.

36
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,591
By the princess
he jilted my daughter for.

37
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,711
- How is the shrimp, Lady Anne?
- Perfect, Your Eminence.

38
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,594
Thank you. You are too generous,
in everything.

39
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,755
So, what of our personal matter?

40
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:55,309
Your Majesty, I have arranged
to send two of my colleagues...

41
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,352
...two young lawyers,
Stephen Gardiner, my secretary...

42
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,869
...and Edward Foxe, to meet the pope
at Orvieto, near Rome...

43
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,958
...where he still resides,
in wretched discomfort apparently.

44
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,150
What will you have these lawyers do?

45
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,230
They will press upon
His Holiness...

46
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,111
...the necessity for his cooperation.

47
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,749
He must recognise,
in both civil and canon law...

48
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,388
...the invalidity
of Your Majesty's marriage.

49
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,389
I have read countless texts
on the matter.

50
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,548
Sometimes reading well into the night
and giving myself terrible headaches.

51
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,878
But I am more assured now
than ever...

52
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,072
...of the spiritual and legal justice
of my case.

53
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,311
- My conscience is clear.
- As it should be.

54
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,197
And Your Majesty
must rest assured...

55
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,789
...that these two gentlemen,
these two restless lawyers...

56
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:47,787
...will not leave Orvieto
until they have attained satisfaction.

57
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,798
Good.

58
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,557
Very good.

59
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,388
Have you spoken recently
with the king?

60
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,631
No, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,793
Cardinal Wolsey refuses my requests,
and in a most high-handed manner.

62
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,073
It is something I have learned
about the English.

63
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,155
A small advantage makes them
overbearing...

64
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:17,756
...while the slightest adversity
makes them despondent.

65
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,951
I have received a coded letter from
your nephew, the emperor.

66
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,675
He declares his undying support
for you in this ugly matter.

67
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:31,630
You may wait for me here.

68
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,388
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,588
Pray continue.

70
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,676
He has already written a letter
to His Holiness Pope Clement...

71
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,793
...warning him of the king's
brutal intentions.

72
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,868
He has asked Clement to dismiss
Wolsey as official legate...

73
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,753
...and declare you and the king
legally married.

74
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,155
He tells you to be strong.

75
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,270
I try to be.

76
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,628
But so much now is hidden
from me.

77
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,036
Tell him that I trust in him more
than anyone else.

78
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,790
Except in God.

79
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,791
- Mistress Hastings.
- Dr. Linacre?

80
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,272
As soon as he heard the news,
the king sent me here.

81
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,878
Alas to no avail.

82
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,111
Mistress Hastings,
I know you were his common-law wife.

83
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:28,317
He was in every way
a most lovely and loving man.

84
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,113
His Majesty will miss
his companionship a great deal.

85
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,913
- Let me see him.
- There is a grave risk.

86
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:40,317
- About which we know so little.
- Please.

87
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,228
Oh, my poor, sweet darling.

88
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,952
Protect us from evil.

89
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,198
Forgive me.

90
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,516
You must burn all his bedding
and clothing.

91
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,187
He must be in the ground first thing.

92
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,355
Gentlemen, here is a personal letter
from the king to the pope...

93
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,272
...thanking him in advance
for attending to his suit...

94
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,992
...sympathetically.

95
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,275
How is His Holiness
likely to respond?

96
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,312
To be honest with you, Mr. Gardiner,
I am not absolutely sure.

97
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,518
The pope was an abused prisoner
of the emperor's mercenaries.

98
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,513
And even though the emperor reputedly
allowed him to escape to Orvieto...

99
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:53,279
...his condition continues to be
little better there.

100
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:57,597
He leads a most sad life,
locked up in a ruined castle.

101
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,311
In which case, why should the pope
favour the emperor...

102
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,795
...who has caused him nothing
but misery over the king of England...

103
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,955
...who has never caused him
any harm at all?

104
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,434
The trouble is, Your Eminence...

105
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,392
...the swords of the king of England
are much further away...

106
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,191
...than the swords of the emperor.

107
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,948
Diplomacy is nearly always settled
by such proximity.

108
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,837
Spoken like a true lawyer.

109
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,955
If all else fails, use threats.

110
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,317
Tell His Holiness...

111
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,511
...that if the king can't get satisfaction
from the papal court...

112
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:35,507
...he will find other means
to satisfy his conscience...

113
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,153
...and rid himself of his present wife.

114
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,997
Do I make myself clear?

115
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:43,709
Yes, Eminence. We understand.

116
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,435
Godspeed, gentlemen.

117
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,633
The evening after William died,
his servants began stealing his effects.

118
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,991
In his will, he bequeathed
this to the king.

119
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,076
I managed to save it.

120
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,395
William is buried in the churchyard.

121
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,227
So too are the servants...

122
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,715
...who also caught and died
of the sweat in the last 24 hours.

123
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,394
I don't know what to say to you.

124
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,596
- My lord Norfolk.
- Your Eminence.

125
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,108
- What do you want?
- A word with you if I might.

126
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,831
- In private.
- Very well.

127
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:30,708
You are commanded
to return at once...

128
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,707
...to your estates in East Anglia.

129
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,838
Commanded?

130
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,234
- By whom?
- By His Majesty.

131
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,828
In his own hand.

132
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,708
What for?

133
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,076
His Majesty would like you
to supervise...

134
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,191
...grain production
and North Sea trade.

135
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,077
Trade?

136
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,632
Trade?

137
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,076
What do you take me for?

138
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,951
A butcher's son?

139
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,436
As you see, my lord,
these are not my orders.

140
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,593
Poor William. Is this all
that remains of an entire life?

141
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,797
We must see that these jewels
get back to his unfortunate lady.

142
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,472
William died at Warwickshire
which is a long way from here...

143
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,715
...and God willing,
the disease won't spread.

144
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,558
But you should fortify yourselves
against it in any case.

145
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,628
Now, these are plasters
to heal ulcers.

146
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,313
An unguent which
cools inflammation and stops itching.

147
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,268
This helps digestion,
this soothes dry skin.

148
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,836
And this ointment will comfort
your cock if it's sore.

149
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,392
Thank you.

150
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,390
These are called pills of Rasis.

151
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,715
They're named after the Turk
who invented them.

152
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,592
They are said to be good
against the sweating sickness.

153
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,908
But this infusion is even better.

154
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,507
What is it?

155
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,112
It's a mixture of marigold...

156
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,674
...Manus christi,
a very efficacious herb...

157
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,996
...sorrel, meadow plant,
linseed vinegar...

158
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,996
...ivory scrapings,
all mixed with sugar.

159
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:40,315
- Take some.
- Are you sure?

160
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,874
Someone told me taking infusions
was the worst thing.

161
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,592
Trust me.

162
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,713
It'll make you feel sick.

163
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,674
But it's better
than the sickness it prevents.

164
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:58,116
Mistress Hastings.

165
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,758
Bury her beside Sir William.

166
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:27,552
That's so beautiful.

167
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,829
It's just something for a friend.

168
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,987
Forgive me, I can't work unless I'm...

169
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,467
Of course.

170
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,431
Good night, Thomas Tallis.

171
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,028
Wait.

172
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,554
What's your name?

173
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,314
- Joan.
- Stay a moment.

174
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,031
Why me?

175
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,389
Do you think the world judges you
both the same?

176
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,310
Yes. It seems to.

177
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,747
I don't.

178
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,396
I see the differences between you.

179
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,758
When I looked at you,
I saw a light around your head.

180
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,918
A light?

181
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,797
You mean like a halo?

182
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,997
Yes. Like a circle of light.

183
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:37,317
You're weird.

184
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,355
May I kiss you, Joan?

185
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,838
- Good morning, chamberlain.
- Your Majesty.

186
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,076
May I present
His Highness Jean de Bellay...

187
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,715
...bishop of Bayonne,
the new French ambassador.

188
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,193
Your Majesty, I am happy
to present my credentials.

189
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,872
And I am happy to be once more
friend and ally to your master.

190
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,876
Thank him for his precious gifts.

191
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,478
It is a pleasure, Your Highness.

192
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,789
So, Your Excellence, how is the war
against the emperor going?

193
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,229
Your Majesty has no cause
for anxiety.

194
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,237
A French army and
a fleet of our allies, the Genoese...

195
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,317
...have hopelessly besieged
the emperor's soldiers at Napoli.

196
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,396
Sooner or later,
Charles must surrender...

197
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,033
...and leave Italy altogether.

198
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,078
That is truly excellent news.

199
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,829
Your Excellence,
allow me to introduce...

200
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,950
Is this not Mademoiselle Anne?

201
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:09,719
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey,
has told me all about you.

202
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:13,395
He did not tell how beautiful you are.
For a Frenchman, that is a crime.

203
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,149
But Frenchmen tell every woman
she is beautiful.

204
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,112
Is that not a crime too?

205
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,109
- I have a gift for you.
- For me?

206
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,194
For you, sir.

207
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,387
This dog is very fast...

208
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,309
...really formidable.

209
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,991
- What's his name?
- Wolsey.

210
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,516
You ought to be glad, sweetheart.

211
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,232
His Excellence has informed me...

212
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:45,192
...that the emperor is soon
to be driven out of Italy.

213
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:48,836
He will no longer be able to stand
in the way of our happiness.

214
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,673
Go back to your wife.

215
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,107
Halt! In the name of the king!

216
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,349
Did someone say something?

217
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,037
- Hold.
- What is that stink?

218
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,031
It's vinegar. Vinegar, Excellence.

219
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,117
- Your Majesty.
- What's happened?

220
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,674
There has been an outbreak
of sweating sickness.

221
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:28,110
- Three hundred deaths this day alone.
- Fetch Dr. Linacre quickly.

222
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,709
What about my wife, the queen?
What about the queen?

223
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,875
Anne, don't be afraid.
I'll see you soon.

224
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,508
George, take your sister
to her chambers.

225
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,033
I find from experience, Your Majesty,
that in a great many cases...

226
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:22,197
...before any actual
physical symptoms appear...

227
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,108
...the sufferers undergo
a curious mental disorientation.

228
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,072
A quick sense
of fear and apprehension.

229
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,839
A foreboding of pain and death.

230
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,831
Every rumour sends them
into agitated alarm.

231
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,308
Indeed, one rumour can itself
cause a thousand cases of sweat.

232
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,397
So thousands catch the disease...

233
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:50,632
...from fear
who need not otherwise sweat.

234
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,229
Especially if they observe
a good, wholesome diet.

235
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,835
A good, wholesome diet?

236
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:04,474
That is your best remedy, Dr. Linacre?
Not infusions?

237
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:07,074
I hope Your Majesty will trust me
when I tell you...

238
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,077
...that there are countless remedies
for the sweat.

239
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,316
Nearly all of them, in my opinion,
medically useless.

240
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,711
Even to ward it off?

241
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,387
Well, I heard of an interesting theory.

242
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,238
A young gentleman
of my acquaintance swears...

243
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:25,028
...that he can combat
the disease directly...

244
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,799
...by working himself
into a natural sweat...

245
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,115
...by exercise each night.

246
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,070
Thank you, doctor.

247
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,437
Bring out your dead.

248
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,788
My dearest wife and family.

249
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,676
This plague that has come upon us...

250
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,308
...is a punishment from God.

251
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,671
We are all sinners,
and God is displeased with us.

252
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,867
Whether we live or die
is entirely in his hands.

253
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,235
All we can do is pray...

254
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:09,556
...and appeal to his great
and infinite mercy...

255
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,398
...and acknowledge
our sinful natures...

256
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,234
...and our need for his grace.

257
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,517
So, what do you think?

258
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,187
Isn't that the best way
of working up a sweat?

259
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,629
Yes, Your Grace.

260
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:12,755
Get your husband to lick it off.

261
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,667
Child, what is it?

262
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,192
Nothing, madam,
I just felt a little dizzy.

263
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,751
- Well, come here.
- No, I...

264
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,354
I still feel dizzy, I...

265
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,311
That's it. I've caught the sweat.

266
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,953
No, gentle child.
It's just a headache.

267
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,229
- No more than that.
- It's not.

268
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:06,751
I have pains in my stomach.

269
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,757
Yes. Isn't that a sign?

270
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,274
How can you deny it?

271
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,669
- I'm going to die.
- No, you're not going to die.

272
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:17,996
Listen to me.
You are not going to die.

273
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,587
Come here. There.

274
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,629
"My poor maid has this day
caught the sweat and died.

275
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:46,997
I beg Your Majesty, what shall I do?"

276
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,637
I want to see her.

277
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,070
I would counsel against any contact
with infected persons...

278
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:56,747
...or those who have had contact
with infected persons.

279
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,154
You are the king of England.

280
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:01,196
Yes, but what if she?

281
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,270
What if she dies?

282
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,111
All right.

283
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,195
Tell her she must quit the palace.

284
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,355
She must go with her father
back to Hever...

285
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,515
...and by all means,
shut herself up there.

286
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:34,870
I will send her infusions
to fortify herself...

287
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,910
...and I will write to her.

288
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,995
And what of Her Majesty?

289
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:44,518
The queen will join our daughter
at Ludlow.

290
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,711
I pray to God
they will be safe enough in Wales.

291
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,591
And you, Your Majesty?

292
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,233
I will shut myself up here...

293
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,794
...and keep the sweat at bay
with every means.

294
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,668
Then if I may advise Your Majesty.

295
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,790
Keep as few people around you
as possible.

296
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,672
In that way, you can reduce
the risk of contamination.

297
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,918
God bless us both.

298
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,358
Indeed.

299
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,675
I've come to say goodbye.

300
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,078
Are you pleased to send me away?

301
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,918
- You do not want to see our daughter?
- You send me away...

302
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,713
...so that you can be with her.
- No, she's not...

303
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:42,437
- Do you mean Lady Anne Boleyn?
- Yes, I mean Lady Anne Boleyn.

304
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:45,153
You make no secret of her.

305
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,834
No, she's going back to Hever.

306
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:52,033
One of her maids died of the sweat.

307
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:55,675
Your fear of the sweat is greater than
your infatuation with your mistress?

308
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,347
Catherine, she is not my mistress.

309
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:03,197
I do not sleep with her.
Not whilst you and I are still married.

310
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,148
But do you tell her
that you love her?

311
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,789
Do you make promises to her?
Does she make promises to you?

312
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,875
Will you not tell me since,
as you say, I am still your wife?

313
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,796
Catherine, I wish with all my heart...

314
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,559
...you could accept our marriage
was based upon a lie.

315
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,116
And in the meantime...

316
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,709
...I still love you enough
to want to save your life.

317
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,675
Now do as I command.

318
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:37,391
Go to Wales.

319
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,309
When you speak like that, my love...

320
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:45,754
You act as though I had the plague.
As though love itself were a plague.

321
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,712
I shall write to you.

322
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,515
Tell Mary, the king, her father,
sends his love and devotion.

323
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,831
How do you feel?

324
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,992
- I feel fine, Papa.
- You're sure?

325
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,797
What are you saying?

326
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,147
Because of my maid...

327
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,431
...l'm certain to be contaminated?
- No, of course not.

328
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,397
What is it?

329
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,957
I can't breathe.

330
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,751
What?

331
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,309
- What's wrong?
- I can't breathe. Stop the coach.

332
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,589
- I can't breathe. Stop the coach!
- Halt.

333
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,557
Stop the coach.

334
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,278
Anne.

335
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,671
Drive on.

336
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,558
Anne.

337
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,075
Joan, my dear sister.

338
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,270
Father, it is well said and known...

339
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:11,472
...that sickness is a visitation from
God and a punishment for sins.

340
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:19,788
But why, Father, why is my land
so marked out for disfavour?

341
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,478
What have we done that has
displeased Almighty God so much...

342
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,637
...that he brings
this pestilence upon us?

343
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:35,074
Is it my fault?

344
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:45,910
Father, I ask forgiveness
for sins unknown.

345
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,715
And I beg you for your blessing.

346
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:50,830
Not as a king...

347
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:54,555
...but as a man.

348
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,437
Please, Father.

349
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,471
Father?

350
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,517
Father?

351
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,278
Father?

352
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,518
Are you the English envoys?

353
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,558
Come.

354
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,191
My sons.

355
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,878
Holy Father.

356
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,554
You see how I am forced to live?

357
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,313
Can you imagine
Your Father's misery?

358
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,790
The Spaniards are practically
at my doorstep.

359
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,715
Your Holiness knows
why we are here.

360
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,514
We bring a letter from His Majesty,
King Henry...

361
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,917
...the most dutiful and Catholic king
of England, Ireland and France.

362
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,275
His Majesty thanks
Your Holiness in advance...

363
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:40,310
...for your support of his nullity suit.

364
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,837
He knows that you, Holy Father,
will not object to our supplications.

365
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,513
I wish with all my heart...

366
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,032
...to please and satisfy your master.

367
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,514
But I must say to you,
in all honesty...

368
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,428
...as God is my witness,
as I am an honest man...

369
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,551
...that I have been advised that
this suit is prompted solely...

370
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,317
...by the king's vain affection...

371
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,875
...and undue love for this woman,
Anne Boleyn.

372
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,750
It has been said to me...

373
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:23,589
...that the king of England desires
his divorce for private reasons only.

374
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:26,677
And that the woman he loves
is far below him.

375
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:31,111
Not only in rank, but also in virtue.

376
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:34,789
Holiness, who has told you
these things?

377
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:40,157
They say
that Anne is already pregnant...

378
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,919
...and that the king urgently wishes
to make her child...

379
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,347
...his heir to the throne.

380
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,317
Lady Anne is a model of chastity.

381
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,477
Though very apt to procreate
children when the time comes.

382
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,591
Holy Father, she impresses everyone
who sees her or knows her...

383
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:56,916
...with the purity of her life,
her constant virginity...

384
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,472
...her soberness, meekness.

385
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,988
Indeed, of all the women in England...

386
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,032
...she is, by far,
the fittest to become queen.

387
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:07,238
But what of Queen Catherine?

388
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:10,869
His Majesty hopes
that when Your Highness has taken...

389
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,673
...cognisance of the arguments
we have brought with us...

390
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:17,548
...you will write to the queen
to urge her compliance.

391
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,477
Of course.

392
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:26,197
But first, I must read
these arguments, must I not?

393
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,509
Before coming to judgement.

394
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,153
His Majesty also
made it plain to us...

395
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,590
...that if you could not
give him satisfaction...

396
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:38,915
...then he must look
for a judgement elsewhere.

397
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,388
He might be forced to live outside
the laws of the Holy Church...

398
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,432
...and beyond
Your Holiness's authority.

399
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,597
My sons.

400
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,998
Boy?

401
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,916
Keep a look out.

402
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,192
My sons.

403
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,428
- Holy Father.
- Holy Father.

404
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,913
I fear you will be disappointed
in my answer.

405
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,876
I am unable to make a judgement,
here and today...

406
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,876
...concerning the king's case.

407
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,992
Wait, I have not said
it is the end of the matter.

408
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,553
I am resolved it should be settled
as soon as may be, but not here.

409
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,148
For you see how I am here.

410
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:55,752
So I am appointing Cardinal Campeggio
as my official legate.

411
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,110
Once the sickness
in your country abates...

412
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,590
...he will travel to England,
and together with Cardinal Wolsey...

413
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:07,998
...constitute a court to hear and decide
upon the merits of the case.

414
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,515
If your king is as certain
of his rightness as you say he is...

415
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,432
...then no doubt he will welcome
the proceedings...

416
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:18,753
...which can only hasten
the fulfilment of his desires.

417
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,752
Come.

418
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:47,227
Put them there.

419
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,478
Your Majesty should know...

420
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,149
...that, His Grace, the Duk e of Norfolk,
having caught the sweat...

421
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,272
...ask ed to be allowed back to London,
ostensibly to see a doctor.

422
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,309
This permission I refused
on Your Majesty's behalf.

423
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,312
Three of Your Majesty's apothecaries
have also fallen sick...

424
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,194
...while three of your chamber
servants have died.

425
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:20,028
Your mason Redman is also dead.

426
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,396
The disease shows
no sign of abating.

427
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,592
There are now 40, 000 cases
in London alone.

428
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:43,109
Lady Anne Boleyn is also sick,
yet still survives.

429
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:45,913
- Dr. Linacre.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,717
Lady Anne is ill. Lady Anne Boleyn.

431
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:55,316
Go at once to Hever castle.
And for the love of God, save her life.

432
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,512
In my opinion, there is no hope.

433
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,075
The vital signs of life
are weak and worsening.

434
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:47,908
The priest should attend her now,
in extremis.

435
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,429
I'm very sorry.

436
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,717
- Are you not frightened, Papa?
- Of what? Of death?

437
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:21,031
No, no, no.

438
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,716
I have given myself entirely
into the hands of God...

439
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,035
...and I know with certainty
that when I die...

440
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:30,037
...I shall pass into
a far better place than this.

441
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,912
What you see around you
is not the fear of death...

442
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,435
...but the fear of what, for the
unrepentant, must surely follow it.

443
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:43,516
There is a spectre haunting Europe
which I fear far more than the sweat.

444
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,957
A sickness spreading everywhere.

445
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,592
Infecting thousands.

446
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,755
Of what do you speak, Papa?

447
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,597
The disease of Lutheranism.

448
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,590
It spreads among the poor.

449
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,355
Those who see the church
as rich and corrupt and decadent.

450
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:06,478
It has already ignited a peasants' war
in Germany and killed 100,000 people.

451
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:08,627
The contagion has spread...

452
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,070
...to Burgundy, Salzburg,
Montpellier and Nantes.

453
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:15,191
Every day brings more news
of the virulence of this heresy.

454
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,198
Surely it won't come here?

455
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,357
It is already here.

456
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:26,597
We know of secret meetings
here in the city of London...

457
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:30,394
...where the Church is attacked,
infamous books distributed.

458
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:32,948
Let me ask you, my child.

459
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:36,953
Let me ask you, what do you do...

460
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:40,117
...with a house which is plagued
with sickness?

461
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,667
You purge it with fire.

462
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,313
Exactly so.

463
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:48,357
In the same way, the sickness
which is in our house of faith...

464
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,356
...must be purged with fire.

465
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,869
Now, I am against violence,
as you know.

466
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,748
But I believe
that Luther and his followers...

467
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,519
...should be seized right now.

468
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:03,827
And burned.

469
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:29,709
Your Majesty, multitudes
are dying around us.

470
00:45:29,919 --> 00:45:34,276
Almost everyone in Oxford, Cambridge,
and London has been ill recently.

471
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:40,268
Since the cardinal has also been ill,
and Your Majesty is gone from court...

472
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,118
...there is really no government
to the kingdom.

473
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:47,514
There have been
some riots in the city...

474
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,392
...but Your Majesty
should not be alarmed.

475
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,351
Sir.

476
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:53,071
- Come and see her.
- Get the master.

477
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:56,669
- My lord, my lord!
- Papa, come quickly.

478
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,430
George.

479
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,956
Praise be to God.

480
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:12,830
You know what you have done, child?

481
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,030
You have risen from the dead.

482
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,229
Now you can see the king again.

483
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,394
It can be just as before.

484
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,348
Thanks be to God,
my own darling, you are saved...

485
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,072
...and the plague is abated.

486
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,588
The legate which we most desire
arrived at Paris...

487
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:32,027
...on Sunday or Monday last.

488
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:34,918
I trust by next Monday
to hear of his arrival in Calais...

489
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,155
...and then I trust
within a while to enjoy...

490
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,590
...that which I have so longed for.
To God's pleasure and our own.

491
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,552
No more to you now, my darling,
for lack of time...

492
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:46,398
...but that I would you were
in my arms or I in yours...

493
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,272
...for I think it long
since I kissed you.

494
00:47:54,919 --> 00:47:58,116
You have a letter
from Lady Anne Boleyn.

495
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:05,074
"My dear lord,
I am delighted to hear...

496
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,349
...that you have escaped the sweat.

497
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,915
All the days of my life,
I am most bound...

498
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:12,314
...of all creatures,
next to the king's grace...

499
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,271
...to love and serve Your Grace.

500
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,307
I beseech you never to doubt that
my opinion of you will ever change...

501
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,953
...as long as I have
any breath in my body.

502
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:24,392
Your humble servant, Anne Boleyn."

503
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,511
Well, at least she has
a sense of humour.

504
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:32,312
Joan.

505
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,875
Arrange for my pilgrimage
to Walsingham.

506
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,990
I must give thanks to our Lady.

507
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:10,357
Thank you. Thank you, God.
