1
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:06,816
You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

2
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:11,454
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

3
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:27,887
Let's rehearse again, everybody.

4
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:32,255
Shut the gate. Concentrate please.

5
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:36,173
Ready, everybody?

6
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,287
Attack!

7
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:41,851
Well, go on! Attack!

8
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:58,855
That's enough, everybody.
Stop, you idiots.

9
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,808
Stop!

10
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:08,727
Have you any idea
of the cost of this production?

11
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:12,971
Do you truly imagine
His Majesty will be happy...

12
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:17,011
...to spend a small fortune
on such a large shambles?

13
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:21,209
Who fired that musket ball?

14
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,645
I think I did, Mr. Cornish, sir.

15
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,490
What are you trying to do?

16
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:37,929
If you can't entertain the envoys, then
you're going to shoot them instead?

17
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,729
Is that it?

18
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,365
Again.

19
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:48,929
I have some business
for you, Charles.

20
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,809
As you desire.

21
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,815
My sister Margaret is to marry
the king of Portugal.

22
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,815
I want you to escort her
and her dowry to Lisbon...

23
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:58,450
...and give her away in my name.

24
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:00,415
Why me?

25
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,687
I need someone I can trust.

26
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,569
You trust me with a beautiful woman?

27
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:09,211
With my sister, of course I trust you.

28
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,448
Why shouldn't I?

29
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:16,052
In any case,
you're already betrothed to?

30
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:19,169
What's her name? I can't keep up.

31
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,810
Elizabeth Grey.

32
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,848
She's a cousin
of the marquess of Dorset.

33
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,809
Exactly.

34
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:29,852
I'm honoured by Your Majesty's trust,
but there's still a difficulty.

35
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:32,810
I'm not important enough
to give away the sister of a king...

36
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,894
...let alone the king of England.

37
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,452
That's why I'm making you a duke.

38
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:42,333
Duke of Suffolk.
How does that please your grace?

39
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:48,213
Come on!

40
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:52,656
The emperor
sends his best wishes to the king.

41
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,770
We are most grateful to you, Mr. More,
for coming to welcome us in person.

42
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,530
No, it's my honour.

43
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:02,252
His Majesty regards your visit
as a thing of great moment.

44
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:05,091
When shall we have
an audience with His Majesty?

45
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,208
Let me advise
Your Excellencies on this...

46
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,056
...there's only one way
to reach the king's ear...

47
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:13,055
...and that is through the good offices
of Cardinal Wolsey.

48
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,935
We heard some rumours, Mr. More...

49
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,697
...that the cardinal
advocates French interests.

50
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:19,973
Only when he considers them
to be in ours.

51
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,567
Tell me,
what is the emperor's attitude...

52
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:26,735
...to the rise of the Lutheran heresy
in some of his territories?

53
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:29,047
My friend Erasmus tells me
that in Germany...

54
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:31,049
...it's spreading like a forest fire.

55
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:34,255
His Highness does everything
in his power to suppress it.

56
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,732
But, as you know,
Luther himself is the guest...

57
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,935
...of one of the German princes
unfortunately beyond his control.

58
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:44,176
My king is writing a pamphlet
demolishing Luther's arguments...

59
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:47,210
...defending the papacy and our faith.

60
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:51,814
You mean, he is writing it himself,
with his own hand?

61
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:54,127
No.

62
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:58,489
There are a great many things
that my king can do.

63
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:07,254
The envoys from the emperor,
Your Eminence.

64
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:10,729
Your Excellencies.

65
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,013
This is indeed a happy day.

66
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:17,853
We have planned many festivities
in honour of this most welcome visit.

67
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,372
And it is my devout hope and wish...

68
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:23,330
...that together we can finalize
the details of a treaty...

69
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:27,166
...which will bind your master
and mine in perpetual friendship.

70
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:30,215
That is very much our hope too,
Your Eminence.

71
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:32,732
Good, please.

72
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,648
Not you, Thomas.

73
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:43,456
I don't want to waste
your time or mine.

74
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,091
So before we drink, tell me...

75
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:51,496
...is the emperor
in fact sincere about this treaty?

76
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:54,609
- Of course he is.
- Good.

77
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,250
Then I propose to cement it...

78
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:59,017
...we also announce
the betrothal of the emperor...

79
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,856
...to the daughter of the king,
Princess Mary.

80
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:05,413
It is our understanding that she
is already betrothed to the dauphin.

81
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:09,292
But now,
she will be betrothed to Charles.

82
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:11,965
Unless you have
some other objection?

83
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,895
On the contrary.

84
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:17,373
Good. Then we are agreed.

85
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:29,936
The Emperor told us
to inform Your Eminence personally...

86
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:35,450
...that he wishes to bestow upon you
a very generous pension.

87
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:43,286
He will also throw his weight
behind your ambitions to be Pope.

88
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:50,447
Let us drink to the success
of Your Excellencies' visit.

89
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,807
By all means.

90
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,812
You have found means
to put my niece before the king?

91
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:01,008
Yes, Your Grace. It's already arranged.

92
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:05,735
Anne is to appear in the pageant
for the Spanish envoys. As is the king.

93
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:08,212
She will find a way
to draw his attention.

94
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,736
Good.

95
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,495
Once she opens her legs for him...

96
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,495
...she can open her mouth
and denounce Wolsey.

97
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:20,416
They do say that the sharpest blades
are sheathed in the softest pouches.

98
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,776
His Eminence, Cardinal Wolsey...

99
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:34,169
...and the Spanish ambassadors,
Mendoza and Chapuys.

100
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:14,965
Who are those ladies?

101
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,777
They are the graces, Excellence.

102
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:22,932
They have names like Kindness,
Honour, Constancy, Mercy and Pity.

103
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:25,454
They are prisoners in the castle.

104
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:28,694
The figure to the left
under the broken hearts...

105
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:32,606
...is His Majesty's sister,
Princess Margaret.

106
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,173
Who is keeping them prisoner?

107
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:41,616
Danger, Jealousy, Unkindness, Scorn,
Disdain, Strangeness, et cetera.

108
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,891
Is the king there?
Which one is the king?

109
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:59,455
The men represent Youth, Devotion,
Loyalty, Pleasure, Gentleness, Liberty.

110
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:02,296
And, yes,
His Majesty is hid amongst them.

111
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:11,972
As Ardent Desire,
I demand you release your prisoners.

112
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:16,256
As Lady Scorn,
I laugh at your desires.

113
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:19,569
These men are noble lords.

114
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,411
No, they're just men dressed up.

115
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,209
I say it again, release these fair
damsels that you keep so cruelly.

116
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,645
Never.

117
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:36,606
Then you give us no choice but
to attack and breach your defences.

118
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:40,251
No knight shall ever breach mine.

119
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:48,132
Lady, Desire overcomes all.

120
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:52,130
Attack!

121
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,449
Perseverance,
you are my prisoner now.

122
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:20,808
- Sister.
- Brother.

123
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:01,689
And now all shall be unmasked.

124
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,889
I must speak to you.

125
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,657
I trust you have settled
all your affairs here, Margaret?

126
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,085
Yes, but...

127
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:51,174
The king has written
of his love for you...

128
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,574
...and his eagerness to set eyes
on you, having seen your portrait.

129
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:02,411
I plead with you, as your sister,
don't make me marry him.

130
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,255
He's an old man.

131
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,248
And who are you?

132
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:22,006
I'm Anne Boleyn.

133
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:55,768
Thank you, Master Cornish.
I'm very grateful to you.

134
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:59,133
Sir Thomas.

135
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,412
May I see your mistress?

136
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:23,457
A gentleman, my lady.

137
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,887
Mr. Brandon.

138
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,290
You are not yet invested
a duke, I think.

139
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:35,176
Aye, madam.

140
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:40,015
I shall be taking with me to Portugal,
a company of 200 persons.

141
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:43,209
They shall include my chamberlain,
my chaplain, my laundress...

142
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,169
...all of my ladies.

143
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:46,810
Yes, madam.

144
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:50,333
Should you have anything to discuss,
you may do so with my chamberlain.

145
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:51,765
Yes, madam.

146
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:57,011
I'm surprised my brother chose a man
without noble blood to represent him.

147
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:00,408
Even Norfolk would have been better.

148
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:16,330
The queen is ready.

149
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:19,605
I will announce you to the queen.

150
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:24,734
Her Majesty, Catherine of Aragon,
Queen of England.

151
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,814
Your Majesty,
the envoys from Spain.

152
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:38,370
I know you have an audience
with the king.

153
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,171
I just couldn't let you pass
without seeing you.

154
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:42,412
Majesty...

155
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:46,132
...your nephew the emperor
sends you his love and filial regards.

156
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:47,372
Always.

157
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:50,051
Tell him, if he loves me...

158
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,531
...he should write to me more often.

159
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:55,569
But I am happy from the bottom
of my heart...

160
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:57,574
...that you are here...

161
00:14:57,777 --> 00:15:00,894
...and that there is going to be a treaty.

162
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:07,455
Just beware the cardinal.

163
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:15,934
His Majesty will receive you now.

164
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:24,970
Gentlemen, welcome to my kingdom.

165
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:29,415
I know you will succeed in your efforts
to negotiate a successful treaty.

166
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:33,166
You may trust everything
Cardinal Wolsey says.

167
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:37,734
He speaks for me directly
in all matters.

168
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,054
As for my part, I should like to invite
the emperor to visit here...

169
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,213
...as soon as can be arranged.

170
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:48,127
The visit would give pleasure
both to me and to my queen.

171
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,250
Your Majesty.

172
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:07,451
- When's he coming?
- At the end of this month.

173
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,295
So soon?

174
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:13,052
If he needs allies for his attack on
the French, he intends to do so shortly.

175
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:16,408
Indeed. The envoys told me
in confidence...

176
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:20,132
...that the emperor will strike first
against the French occupation in Italy.

177
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,009
He has a claim to the duchy of Milan.

178
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,415
And then?

179
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:27,774
Then having driven them out of Italy
with your help...

180
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,445
...he will invade France itself.

181
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:36,890
I want you to prepare
all our forces for a joint invasion.

182
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,970
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- And I want another warship.

183
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,209
Your Majesty, we have
only just launched the Victory.

184
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:47,255
Then order another one.
A greater one.

185
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:52,250
What we lack in men,
we can more than make up for in ships.

186
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:54,448
We're an island race, cardinal.

187
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,012
We have the best
and bravest sailors in the world.

188
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,607
- I will have the greatest navy.
- Ships are expensive.

189
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:03,371
My father was a careful man.

190
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:08,048
A shrewd man. A business man.

191
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:11,294
He left me a great deal
of money, Your Eminence.

192
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,249
I intend to spend it.

193
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,975
Good.

194
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,407
Sir Thomas Boleyn.

195
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:35,530
Sir Thomas.

196
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:37,654
Majesty.

197
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:42,453
Come. I feel I've been a little remiss.

198
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:46,093
I never showed my gratitude to you
for the diplomatic efforts you made.

199
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,015
Your Majesty had no need.

200
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:51,852
I'm simply content to serve you
in whatever capacity I can be of use.

201
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:55,049
Nevertheless,
I wish to show my gratitude.

202
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:58,855
It pleases me to make you
a knight of the Garter.

203
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:02,015
I'm also appointing you
comptroller of my household.

204
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,045
I believe Your Majesty...

205
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:09,215
...has a greater opinion
of my talents than I have.

206
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,652
I shall be the judge of that.

207
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:15,005
We shall talk more later.

208
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:20,134
Oh, I almost forgot.

209
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:23,415
Your daughter.

210
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:25,568
The one who performed
in our masquerade.

211
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:27,529
- Anne.
- Yes.

212
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:34,291
As a matter of fact,
she's soon to come to court...

213
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,772
...as a lady in waiting to Her Majesty.

214
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:02,728
And will you leave me thus?

215
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:05,895
Say nay, say nay, for shame

216
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:10,648
To save you from the blame
Of all my grief and grame

217
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,654
And will you leave me so?

218
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:16,167
Say no, say no

219
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,014
And will you leave me thus?

220
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:22,129
And have no more pity
Of he that loves thee?

221
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:26,815
Alas, your cruelty!

222
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,493
And will you leave me thus?

223
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:33,007
Say no, say no

224
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,614
Well, do you like it?

225
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,615
Should I like something
that accuses me of being cruel?

226
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,447
- You are cruel, Mistress Anne.
- Am I?

227
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,847
You have no claim on me,
Master Wyatt.

228
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,886
I have the same claim
as every other lover...

229
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,406
...to whom a woman's heart
has been freely given.

230
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,376
You are a poet, as I am a woman.

231
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,853
Poets and women are always free
with their hearts, are they not?

232
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:16,965
Anne...

233
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:22,495
Stop it, Tom. You mustn't.

234
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,888
Then I was right.

235
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:37,807
You are leaving me.

236
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:46,688
- Why don't you answer me?
- You're married.

237
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:52,006
Yes. But I'm separated.

238
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,572
I'm going to divorce.

239
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,696
I mean, who isn't married?

240
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,776
You must never ask to see me again.
Do you promise?

241
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:09,368
Why should I?

242
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,772
When I have just learned
what promises are worth.

243
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,530
Is it another? Is that it?

244
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,007
Do you love another?

245
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:24,725
Never ask of me...

246
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,370
...and never, if you value your life,
speak of me to others.

247
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,249
Do you understand?

248
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,972
Have you no pity?

249
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:47,334
Can you imagine? Lmagine
what he's gonna be like now.

250
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,813
I'll wager he's already ordered
a bigger codpiece.

251
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:54,015
Yes, Your Grace. No, Your Grace.

252
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:58,005
Let me bottle up your farts
and sell them for nectar, Your Grace.

253
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,811
I don't wanna think about it any more.

254
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,894
It makes me ill.

255
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,050
So, what shall we do?

256
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,970
Find women.

257
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,455
Even if she was a complete Venus...

258
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:18,569
...I couldn't satisfy her
in my dejected state.

259
00:22:21,777 --> 00:22:24,735
- Let's just drink more, then.
- All right.

260
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:29,089
Here. To His Grace.

261
00:22:29,337 --> 00:22:33,410
- Here's to Charles.
- His Grace.

262
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,331
Did the envoys leave in good cheer?

263
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:42,137
They were in excellent spirits.

264
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,494
The treaty is agreed.

265
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:47,928
And my nephew will come?

266
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:53,092
We wait for news.
Wolsey will find out.

267
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:01,845
I had a dream.

268
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:08,692
In my dream, you came to me again
and held me in your arms...

269
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:11,934
...and you whispered
that all would be well.

270
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:15,174
And all manner of things
would be well.

271
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:21,089
Henry.

272
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:25,129
Sweetheart. Husband.

273
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:33,055
You must believe me.
I never knew your brother in that way.

274
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,048
He was so young. And he was ill.

275
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:48,088
I have never known another man,
nor ever want to.

276
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,416
I love you.

277
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,331
The king.

278
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:55,169
The king would like you
to come to his chambers.

279
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,855
Mary.

280
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,696
My darling daughter.

281
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:29,133
- Have you said your prayers?
- Yes.

282
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:51,489
My Lord...

283
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:58,172
...how like you this?

284
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:21,807
Has the king sent any message
or sign that he might visit me tonight?

285
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:26,647
- No, my lady.
- No.

286
00:26:45,657 --> 00:26:48,455
I'm worried about you, my love.

287
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:54,176
You work too hard.

288
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:56,692
I know that.

289
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:01,967
It will kill you.

290
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:09,411
I know that too.
What am I supposed to do?

291
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,531
Stay alive.

292
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:29,047
- Aren't you coming?
- What's happening?

293
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:32,932
The queen's new ladies have arrived.
Come on.

294
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:44,892
- Beautiful hair, mistress.
- Things are looking up.

295
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,413
Mistress. Mistress.

296
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:51,131
The way she carries herself.

297
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:54,215
"What serpent was ever so venomous...

298
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,647
...as to call the holy city of Rome
'Babylon'...

299
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:59,735
...and the Pope's authority 'Tyranny'...

300
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:03,247
...and turn the name
of our Holy Father into 'Anti-Christ'?"

301
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,808
It's very good.

302
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:10,974
- Strongly worded, but it's very good.
- You're sure?

303
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:14,175
Well, you might think of toning down
the polemic, just a little.

304
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:18,005
For example, where
you describe Luther as this weed.

305
00:28:18,217 --> 00:28:19,855
Where is it?

306
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:24,733
Here, "This dilapidated,
sick and evil-minded sheep."

307
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:26,805
Tone it down?

308
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:31,255
Well, yes, for diplomatic purposes.

309
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,413
No, never.

310
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:36,012
No language can be strong enough
to condemn Luther...

311
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:39,289
...nor gracious enough
to praise His Holiness.

312
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:46,295
I will dedicate a copy to him
and you will take it to him in Rome.

313
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:47,765
Why me?

314
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,572
If there is anything true and good in it,
it is due to you.

315
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:56,886
I could never have written it,
or anything else, Sir Thomas More...

316
00:28:57,097 --> 00:29:00,009
...without your guidance
and unfailing honesty.

317
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:02,489
Why did you call me Sir Thomas?

318
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,369
A knighthood is the least I could do.

319
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:07,608
It's a great deal more than I deserve.

320
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:09,848
Now, don't be too modest, Thomas.

321
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:13,211
You're not a saint.

322
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:17,367
There is something else
I want you to do for me.

323
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:22,246
Seize all the copies
of Luther's works you can find...

324
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:24,925
...and burn them.

325
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:28,216
Burn them all.

326
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:42,573
From France.

327
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:11,255
Well, King Francis
has already discovered...

328
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:14,210
...our rapprochement
with the emperor.

329
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,770
He feels betrayed and angry...

330
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:19,367
...and is making threats
against our interests.

331
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:22,368
Who told him?

332
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:19,015
My lords and ladies,
His lmperial Highness...

333
00:31:19,217 --> 00:31:23,369
...Charles, Holy Roman Emperor,
King of Aragon, Valencia, Naples...

334
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:26,569
...and Sicily,
Duke of the Burgundian Territories...

335
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:29,655
...Archduke of Austria.

336
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,410
Your Eminence, a moment.

337
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:46,085
Move away, Mr. Pace. Move away.

338
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:48,367
Yes, Eminence.

339
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:51,216
Your Highness.

340
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:54,407
Your Majesty.

341
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:59,414
I did not expect...

342
00:31:59,657 --> 00:32:01,648
I could not sustain the anticipation.

343
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:05,054
I had to come straight down
and welcome you myself.

344
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:06,969
Then I am truly honoured.

345
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:10,809
Tonight, we shall dance and feast.

346
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:14,254
And tomorrow,
you shall come see my ships.

347
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:17,927
Gentlemen. Music. Let's celebrate.

348
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,775
Come.

349
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:26,371
Remove that man.

350
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:37,011
Wait. No, wait. Wait.

351
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:41,885
Mr. Pace.

352
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:46,405
You knew, of course...

353
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:50,166
...that His Majesty was going to make
this surprise visit, did you not?

354
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,329
Well, yes. As his secretary,
I would obviously know.

355
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:54,970
Yes, of course, you did.

356
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:57,253
And you also knew, of course...

357
00:32:57,457 --> 00:32:59,652
...that the imperial envoys
had come privately...

358
00:32:59,857 --> 00:33:02,166
...to make a treaty with His Majesty.

359
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:05,369
But then, of course,
you speak Spanish, don't you?

360
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:07,408
Almost as well as you speak French.

361
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:12,731
L... I don't understand, Your Eminence.

362
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:15,127
I think you do, Mr. Pace.
I really think you do.

363
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:18,852
Because you see,
I think you not only spy for me...

364
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:22,453
...you also spy for the French.

365
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,016
No. It's not true.

366
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,246
You are removed
from all your positions.

367
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:31,015
No, wait, wait, wait.
I swear to you.

368
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,129
I swear by everything
that's holy, it's not true.

369
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:36,532
His Majesty is held dear in my heart.

370
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:40,053
It is treason
to plot against His Majesty.

371
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:43,496
Wait. What are you saying?

372
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,648
Wait, Your Eminence, please.
Don't do this.

373
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,973
You know it's not true,
Your Eminence, please.

374
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:50,645
I beg you.
You know it's not true, Your Eminence.

375
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:52,085
Please! Please!

376
00:33:52,337 --> 00:33:56,046
This is my flagship, The Mary Rose.

377
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,976
She's the largest warship afloat.

378
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:03,216
She displaces 700 tons,
fires 91 guns...

379
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,895
...and has a company of 400 men.

380
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:12,169
I have nothing like this.

381
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,887
You have vast armies.

382
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:20,216
Together, we shall be invincible.

383
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:22,649
How could the French withstand us?

384
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:27,851
With you beside me,
there is no boundary...

385
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:33,768
...or frontier
or world we could not conquer.

386
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,408
I like you already.

387
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:43,529
Except for the chin,
what is there not to like?

388
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,647
Prisoner to the steps.

389
00:35:06,177 --> 00:35:08,213
You must believe me,
I'm an innocent man.

390
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:11,215
I don't know why
I have been brought here.

391
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,845
I'm innocent!

392
00:35:16,737 --> 00:35:18,295
No, no, no.
I've done nothing wrong.

393
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,727
I've done nothing wrong!

394
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:26,529
You know, you and I are united
by an indissoluble tie.

395
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:31,015
Since you married my mother's sister,
you are really my uncle.

396
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:39,768
It's an affinity which both delights
and pleases me, nephew.

397
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:44,975
Your Highness, your aunt awaits.

398
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:51,769
Your Majesty, His lmperial Highness,
Charles, Holy Roman Emperor.

399
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:16,573
Majesty, I ask for your blessing,
as a nephew to an aunt.

400
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:20,690
I give you my blessing freely,
my dear Charles...

401
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:24,212
...as I give you my love.

402
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,373
Your Highness...

403
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:34,455
...allow me to present
my daughter Mary, your future bride.

404
00:36:39,337 --> 00:36:42,488
Bravo! Come.

405
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,295
Now, we must wait
to be married.

406
00:36:51,457 --> 00:36:53,925
Do you think you have the patience?

407
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:58,528
I have a present for Your Highness.
Do you want to see it?

408
00:36:58,777 --> 00:37:02,406
I love presents. Show me.

409
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:06,965
There. Look.

410
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:12,125
- Are they for me?
- Do you like them?

411
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:17,536
They're the best presents I've ever had.
Thank you, Your Highness.

412
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:43,934
As soon as possible,
you must both come and visit me.

413
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:47,408
I want to show you especially
the treasures of Montezuma...

414
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:51,007
...the king of the Aztecs,
that General Cortes...

415
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:53,685
...recently discovered in Mexico.

416
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,694
- We should love that.
- Yes.

417
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:58,331
We've heard a little
about the lands across the sea...

418
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,095
...they call the Indies.

419
00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:04,410
I tell you, I swear to you,
that is where the future lies.

420
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,689
So much undiscovered land.

421
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:11,606
So much wealth of gold and silver...

422
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:15,008
...of minerals and salts.

423
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,855
Madam.

424
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,649
Sweetheart.

425
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:42,125
Put yourself in his way.

426
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:46,969
How are your preparations going?

427
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:49,572
We are recruiting
more German mercenaries.

428
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:53,213
But everything is going well.

429
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:58,008
- I shall take Milan by next spring.
- And then?

430
00:38:58,257 --> 00:39:03,251
And then, together,
we shall invade France...

431
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:08,525
...and bring to an end the adventures
of that libertine monarch...

432
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,170
...King Francis.

433
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,214
That will make me very happy.

434
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,533
It will also make you king of France.

435
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:19,209
Yes.

436
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:33,369
Will you dance, Your Highness?

437
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:37,252
With Your Majesty's permission.

438
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,854
Granted.

439
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:55,489
Excuse me.

440
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:02,493
The king of Portugal,
I've heard he also has gout.

441
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:08,134
They say his spine is deformed.
He walks like a crab.

442
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:13,890
Promise me something, brother.

443
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:18,016
I'll agree to marry him
on one condition.

444
00:40:18,217 --> 00:40:23,655
When he's dead, which can't be long,
I can marry whom I choose.

445
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:28,534
Agreed?

446
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,690
Not drinking today, Charles,
or should I say, Your Grace?

447
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:43,891
You should definitely call him
by his real name...

448
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,894
...which is cunt or villain.

449
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:49,368
- Why?
- We're supposed to be friends, Charles.

450
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:54,735
- Aren't we still?
- Not if you don't show us favour.

451
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:58,247
It's within your gift to ask His Majesty
to give us some titles...

452
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,856
...or at least some land.

453
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:03,094
It seems that everything the king has
to give, he's given to you.

454
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,930
- Jealous?
- Naturally.

455
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,645
As you rise, so too should we.

456
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:15,014
So, what can we do for you,
Your Grace?

457
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:17,975
Show me some respect.

458
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:35,810
I am so glad to see you.

459
00:41:36,017 --> 00:41:38,372
It is often lonely here.

460
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:40,169
Lonely?

461
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:44,086
Things are not well between us,
His Majesty and I.

462
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:50,452
But I saw with my own eyes
how attentive he is to you.

463
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:54,093
He looks at you with such devotion...

464
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:57,733
...it seems, with such love.

465
00:41:57,937 --> 00:42:02,965
I fear that is for your benefit.
Henry is a good masker.

466
00:42:03,177 --> 00:42:04,656
I don't wanna hear this again.

467
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:13,167
Lady Anne.

468
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,931
Yes, Your Majesty.

469
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:20,967
I think sometimes
he will ask me for a divorce.

470
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,372
A divorce?

471
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:27,126
No. That's impossible.

472
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,771
Is it?

473
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:31,776
Forgive me.

474
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:49,489
Anne.

475
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:54,047
No. Not like this.

476
00:43:55,697 --> 00:43:58,211
- How?
- Seduce me.

477
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:03,093
Write letters to me.
And poems. I love poems.

478
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:07,296
Ravish me with your words.
Seduce me.

479
00:44:21,377 --> 00:44:23,686
Majesty?

480
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:25,615
It's all right.

481
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,169
She's gone.

482
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,576
For Your Majesties to sign...

483
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:43,055
...between you this treaty
of perpetual amity and concord...

484
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:46,930
...and to confirm with your seals
and before these witnesses...

485
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:50,015
...the betrothal of Charles,
Holy Roman Emperor...

486
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:54,808
...and her Highness, Princess Mary,
upon her reaching the age of 12.

487
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:56,285
I say to you again...

488
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:59,569
...in my power as papal legate
and Chancellor of England...

489
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:02,934
...that you should sign this treaty
of friendship, one to another...

490
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:05,207
...and never break it,
so help you God.

491
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:40,012
I swear to you
my honour and allegiance.

492
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:44,651
You must always trust in me.
Always.

493
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:52,134
Where is Mr. Pace?
He should have been here.

494
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:56,330
Your Majesty,
I have discovered, shamefully...

495
00:45:56,537 --> 00:45:59,370
...that Mr. Pace was not deserving
of Your Majesty's trust.

496
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:01,727
I have removed him from his offices.

497
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:04,574
You're sure?

498
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,495
The French were paying him
a pension.

499
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:18,808
I see. I trust you will find me
a replacement.

500
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:26,652
Well, how do our affairs proceed?

501
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:28,535
Very well, Your Grace.

502
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:30,967
The king makes
no obvious declaration of interest.

503
00:46:31,177 --> 00:46:34,089
But it's possible to detect it
in the way he glances at her...

504
00:46:34,297 --> 00:46:38,131
...as if, in his mind,
he could see her naked.

505
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,692
Yes, well, he looks
at most young women that way.

506
00:46:40,937 --> 00:46:43,405
But it is a start.

507
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:47,929
A beginning at least to the end
of that insufferable prelate.

508
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:50,846
All in good time.

509
00:46:51,097 --> 00:46:52,769
One thing will follow another.

510
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:55,655
Perhaps it would be a good idea...

511
00:46:55,857 --> 00:46:57,973
...to include
the Duke of Suffolk in our plans.

512
00:46:58,177 --> 00:47:01,886
Charles Brandon?
He is barely a gentleman.

513
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:03,849
He's the king's closest friend.

514
00:47:04,097 --> 00:47:06,372
And I believe hates Wolsey
as much as we do.

515
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:12,254
He would be a natural ally,
at least for a time.

516
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:27,616
Attack!

517
00:47:28,217 --> 00:47:30,572
Two points for Mr. Anthony Knivert.

518
00:47:47,377 --> 00:47:51,529
Mr. Heys, do you have those pieces
I asked for?

519
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:54,092
Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:47:57,217 --> 00:47:59,970
One, rubies set in circlets of gold.

521
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:06,046
A second, a precious stone
upon a bed of gold and pearl.

522
00:48:06,257 --> 00:48:11,456
Third, small and large drops of pearl,
with gold and purple...

523
00:48:11,657 --> 00:48:14,296
...and the detail of a lion's head.

524
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:20,254
And lastly, feathers of silver,
gold and amber.

525
00:48:22,657 --> 00:48:26,775
Jewels fit for a queen, Your Majesty.

526
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:13,287
It was Wolsey! It was Wolsey!

527
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:14,976
Not me! Listen to me!

528
00:49:15,177 --> 00:49:17,213
It's Wolsey
who has a pension from the French.

529
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,736
It's not me. Listen to me.

530
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:20,734
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.

531
00:49:20,937 --> 00:49:23,895
It was Wolsey. Wolsey. Wolsey.

532
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:27,169
Just ask him! Ask him!
It was Wolsey!
