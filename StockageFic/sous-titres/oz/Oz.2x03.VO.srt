00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,522
RECEIVES HIS G.E.D.
IN PRISON,

347
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:45,531
HE IS FAR LESS
LIKELY TO COME BACK.

348
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:47,032
ANYBODY WANT TO
READ OUT LOUD ?

349
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:51,532
W.E.B. DUBOIS,
LET'S HAVE KENNY...

350
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:53,981
IF THAT SAME KID MANAGES
TO GO TO COLLEGE

351
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:55,990
WHILE HE'S INSIDE,

352
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,493
HE'LL ALMOST
DEFINITELY NEVER SEE
A PRISON CELL AGAIN.

353
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:00,992
JUST PICK ANY
PAGE YOU WANT.

354
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:03,732
LAST YEAR, ONE
STATE, CALIFORNIA,

355
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,230
SPENT MORE MONEY
ON ITS PENAL SYSTEM

356
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,231
THAN IT DID ON
HIGHER EDUCATION.

357
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,231
THESE ARE THE
FACTS AND FIGURES.

358
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:11,742
YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE THAT
SMART TO ADD THEM UP.

359
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:21,780
I'D FUCK DR.
NATHAN IN A SECOND.

360
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,181
ME, TOO.
HOW ABOUT
WITTLESEY ?

361
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,183
SHIT, YEAH.

362
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:27,180
ME, TOO.

363
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,193
YOU KNOW WHO
I THINK IS SEXY ?

364
00:23:30,228 --> 00:23:32,192
SISTER PETER MARIE.

365
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:34,143
YEAH.

366
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,283
THAT'S DISGUSTING,
SHE'S A NUN.

367
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,283
WASN'T
ALWAYS A NUN.

368
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:39,280
SHE WAS MARRIED.

369
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:41,783
WHAT ?
NUNS CAN'T
BE MARRIED.

370
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:43,282
ST.
THEY'RE THE
BRIDES OF CHRI

371
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:47,250
BEFORE SHE BECAME A
NUN, HER HUSBAND DIED.

372
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,722
SHE TOLD M
E ONCE IN PASSING.

373
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,720
?
I WONDER HOW H
E DIED, HER HUSBAND

374
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,192
SHE DIDN'T SAY.

375
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:55,202
AN ACCIDENT,
I HEARD.

376
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:57,632
FELL OFF THE BACK OF A
TRUCK, BROKE HIS NECK.

377
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:59,632
THAT'S TRUE, BUT IT
WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

378
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:01,081
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE WORKS HERE ?

379
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,093
HER HUSBAND WAS
PUSHED OFF THE TRUCK.
HE WAS MURDERED.

380
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,393
PETER, PETER MARIE...

THIS IS PROOF

450
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:49,120
.
THAT THE TRUTH
CANNOT BE SILENCED

451
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,291
THE ANNOTATED CODE.

452
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,723
YOU GIVING UP GOD
FOR THE LAW ?

453
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:07,142
GOD'S LAWS ARE
CLEAR TO ME.

454
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,643
IT'S THOSE OF MAN
THAT ARE NOT.

455
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:14,030
I'VE BEEN STUDYING LEGAL BOOKS
FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS,

456
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,881
TRYING TO SEE IF GOD'S LAW
S AND THOSE OF THE WHITE MAN

457
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:18,253
HAVE ANYTHIN
G IN COMMON.

458
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,763
WHAT HAVE YOU
DISCOVERED ?

459
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,260
THAT THESE ARE NOTHING
BUT WORDS ON A PAGE.

460
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:30,712
D.
THE ANNOTATED CODE EXI
STS SOLELY TO BE CIRCUMVENTE

461
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:33,222
WITHOUT LAW, WE
HAVE ANARCHY.

462
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:37,221
.
YOU SHOULD READ YOUR
MORNING PAPER, OLD MAN

463
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:39,723
.
WE HAVE
ANARCHY ANYWAY

464
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:42,230
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
AFTER THE RIOT

465
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:44,131
YOU WOULD
HAVE LEARNED.

466
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,131
YOU CAN'T OVERTHROW
THE SYSTEM.

467
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,130
D,
OH, I LEARNE

468
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:50,630
.
AND I HAVE NO INTERE
ST IN SEEING MORE MEN DIE

469
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:52,503
NO.

470
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:57,012
I INTEND TO USE
THE TOOLS THAT WERE
USED AGAINST ME.

471
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:00,012
I INTEND TO MAKE THE LAW

472
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:03,010
DEVOUR ITSELF.

473
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:05,620
Judge Richard Kibler
was sentenced today

474
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:07,621
to 16 months in prison.

475
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:11,221
The 12-year veteran of The
State Criminal Court was
convicted of taking bribes

476
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,421
in exchange for leniency
in three murder cases
he presided over...

477
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,432
YOU HEAR THIS ?

478
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:19,233
COCKSUCKER KIBLER
WAS THE JUDGE AT
MY FUCKING TRIAL.

479
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:20,033
FOR REAL ?

480
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:22,430
SHIT, YEAH.

481
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,830
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
THE MOTHERFUCKER
WAS UP FOR BRIBES,

482
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:28,040
I'D HAVE PUT MY
TWO DOLLARS DOWN.
SHIT AIN'T FAIR.

483
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,642
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S NOT.

484
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,641
?
YOU KNOW WHAT YO
U OUGHT TO DO, HILL

485
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:32,841

486
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:34,040
ID.

488
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,803
.
THAT KIBLER TOOK
BRIBES IN NOVEMBER

489
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,802
E
YOU WEREN'T APPROACHED
BY HIM OR ANYONE ELS

490
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:45,213
ABOUT TAKING
BRIBES ?

491
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,710
( Augustus )
NOBODY SAID
DICK TO ME.

492
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:49,213
DID HE TALK TO
YOUR LAWYER ?

493
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:55,221
IF THEY DID, HE NEVER
SAID WORD ONE TO ME.

494
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:59,702
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD, I
THINK WE HAVE A CASE.

495
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,210
A CASE ?

496
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:03,710
AH.
YE

497
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:05,712
IAL
YOU WERE DENIED YOUR
RIGHT TO A FAIR TR

498
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:08,213
E.
BY AN IMPARTIAL JUDG

499
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:12,223
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
WE COULD GO TO COURT

500
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:14,280
AND HAVE THE VERDICT
OVERTURNED ?

501
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:17,290
MY FRIEND,

502
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:22,291
.
YOU HAVE A REA
L SHOT AT GOING FREE

503
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:30,722
-
NOW LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT-

504
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,223
JUDGE KIBLER DID
NOT TAKE A BRIBE
IN HILL'S CASE ?

505
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,723
THAT IS CORRECT.

506
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,221
( Glynn )
HE DIDN'T ASK
FOR A BRIBE  ?

507
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:37,722
THIS IS ALSO CORRECT.

508
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:40,080
THEN WHAT EXACTLY ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT ?

509
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,082
S,
THE JUDGE WAS LENIENT WI
TH THOSE WHO DID GIVE BRIBE

510
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:45,533
SO HE MAY HAVE BEEN HARSH
WITH THOSE WHO DID NOT.

511
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:47,532
Y
LOOK, ALL WE ASK I
S FOR THE OPPORTUNIT

512
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:49,541
.
TO EXPLORE THE
MERITS OF THE CASE

513
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:52,191
WHAT OPPORTUNITIES
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ?

514
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:53,591
AND FOR HOW LONG ?

515
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:57,090
S.
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE TIME FOR VISITATION

516
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,952

WHY I'M SAYING, YOU SH

535
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:49,752
NOW YOU KNEW OTHERS
WERE GIVING BRIBES.

536
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:53,753
I HEARD STUFF IN
THE COURTHOUSE
HALLWAYS, THAT'S ALL.

537
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:56,021
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU JUMP,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER ?

538
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,601
CALL ME NAIVE.
I THOUGHT I'D GET
A NOT GUILTY

539
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,111
BASED ON THE STRENGTH
OF THE CASE.

540
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,113
N,
IF YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING O

541
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,113
WHY NOT GO TO
THE STATE JUDICIAL
COMMISSION ?

542
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:06,151
COME ON, I GO TO THE
STATE COMMISSION ?

543
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:08,531
AND NOTHING HAPPENS,
EXCEPT THE NEXT TIME,

544

I'M PLEADING A CASE

?
WELL

546
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:18,440
MARILYN CRENSHAW,

547
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:21,442
THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT
ATTORNEY WHO
PROSECUTED KIBLER,

548
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,453
SHE WILL MEET
WITH US TOMORROW.

549
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,453
!
OH, COOL

550
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:25,950
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH,

551
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:28,952
THE LAWYERS WHO GAVE B
RIBES WON'T TAKE MY CALLS.

552
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,951
THE SECRETARIES SAY,
"I'LL GET BACK TO YOU".

553
00:33:30,997 --> 00:33:32,963
I SAY, "YOU CAN'T
GET BACK TO ME".

554
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,963
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD
DO ? WE SHOULD CHECK

555
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,962
IF ANY OF THOSE THREE
MURDERERS ARE DOING
THEIR TIME IN OZ.

556
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:39,461
I DID,
THEY'RE NOT.

557
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,962
THEY'RE IN
DIFFERENT PRISONS.

558
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:42,971
SO WHAT
DO WE DO ?

559
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:45,473
E.
I'M GONNA WRITE TO
EACH ONE, BUT I DO
N'T EXPECT ANY RESPONS

560
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:47,972
SO WE'RE FUCKED ?
NO.

561
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,971
R.
GOOD THINGS DON'T
COME EASY, MY BROTHE

562
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,982
YEAH.

563
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,481
( guard )
COUNT... !

564
00:33:56,987 --> 00:33:58,982
.
UNTIL TOMORROW

565
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:01,481
ASALAAM ALAIKUM,
BROTHER.

566
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,472
CE
WHEN YOU WERE
GATHERING EVIDEN

567
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:18,973
TO PROSECUTE
JUDGE KIBLER,

568
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:21,920
DID YOU EVER HEAR
AUGUSTUS HILL'S
NAME MENTIONED ?

569
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:23,592
NO.

570
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,482
IN REFERENCE TO THE THREE
MURDER CONVICTIONS THAT
KIBLER WAS LENIENT WITH,

571
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,410
DID YOU PERCEIVE ANY
SORT OF PATTERN ?

572
00:34:29,665 --> 00:34:30,663
NO.

573
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:33,603
SO NOTHING ABOUT THESE
THREE MEN WAS CONSISTENT ?

574
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,600
THEY SHARE THE SAME
STYLE OF MURDER,

575
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:38,523
SAME LAWYER,
SAME SKIN TONE ?

576
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:41,961
L.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO TURN THIS
INTO SOMETHING RACIA

577
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,740
THAT IS NOT
MY INTENTION.
BULLSHIT !

578
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:45,750
THE ONLY ELEMENTS
THAT ARE SIMILAR

579
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:48,450
IN THESE MURDERS IS
THEY WERE MEN AND
THEY WERE GUILTY.

580
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,282
SO THE BRIBES
WERE RANDOM ?
YES.

581
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:51,781
WOULD YOU
TESTIFY TO THAT ?

582
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:53,790
I NEVER SAID THAT
I WOULD TESTIFY,

583
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,663
.
TRY TO COMPEL ME,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO COURT

584
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,621
WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT ?

585
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:59,661
YOU'RE AN ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY,

586
00:34:59,696 --> 00:35:01,162
SWORN TO SEEING
JUSTICE DONE.

587
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:03,602
NOW DOESN'T YOUR DEFINITION
OF JUSTICE EXTEND

588
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:04,902
TO MY CLIENT ?

589
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,401
YOUR CLIENT ?
PLEASE !

590
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,300
THE ONLY PLACE THAT
YOU ARE A LAWYER

591
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:09,801
IS IN YOUR
OWN HEAD.

592
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,313
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
STRUTTING AROUND,

593
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,312
THUMBING YOUR NOSE
AT THE SYSTEM,

594
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,632
THUMBING YOUR NOSE
AT EVERYTHING THAT
I BELIEVE IN.

595
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:21,130
IT'S NOT HIM THAT I
WON'T HELP, IT'S YOU.

596
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:24,482
YOU COULD
WIN THIS CASE.

597
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:28,813
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME
FREE LEGAL ADVICE,

598
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,173
YOU KNOW
THAT WOMAN ?

599
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,672
WHY DO YOU ASK ?

600
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,123
.
YOU TWO SEEMED
AWFUL FAMILIAR

601
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:46,092
?
THAT'S NOT THE BITCH T
HAT PROSECUTED YOU, IS SHE

602
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,143
MARILYN AND I,

603
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:52,151
BEFORE I FOUND ALLAH...

604
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,153
WE WERE ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED.

605
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:06,292
I NEED MORE ACCESS TO PHONES.
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET CALLS

606
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:07,790
AS WELL AS MAKE THEM.

607
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:10,801
WELL, WHY DON'T WE
JUST RUN A SWITCHBOARD
INTO YOUR POD ?

608
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:15,301
OH, ANSWER A LEGITIMATE
REQUEST WITH SARCASM.

609
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:16,803
LEGITIMATE REQUEST ?
YES.

610
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:19,313
SAID, YOU'RE AN
INMATE IN A MAXIMUM
SECURITY PRISON.

611
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,811
NOW IF I SAY
YES TO YOU,

612
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:23,810
WHAT'S TO STOP NEXT GUY FROM
ASKING FOR THE SAME THING ?

613
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:26,311
THESE ARE SPECIA
L CIRCUMSTANCES.
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

614
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:28,313
I HATE TO BREAK
THE NEWS TO YOU PAL,

615
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:30,821
BUT IN HERE,
YOU'RE NOBODY SPECIAL.

616
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,820
YOU DESERVE NO MORE
THAN THE NEXT MAN.

617
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,821
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT ?
IS THIS BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LIKE WHAT I SAID

618
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,333
ABOUT YOU
IN MY BOOK ?

619
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:43,212
NO, THIS IS ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU ALWAYS ASK FOR HELP

620
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:46,652
RN.
AND YOU'RE NEVER WILLING TO
DO ANYTHING FOR ME IN RETU

621
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,652
WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE
A TRADE, A NEGOTIATION ?

622
00:36:49,696 --> 00:36:52,641
I THOUGHT THAT DOING
WHAT'S RIGHT WOULD
BE ENOUGH FOR YOU.

623
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,072
NO GO, HUH ?

624
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,863
MN.
OH, DA

625
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,862

00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,873
Y ?
NOTHING GO

627
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,371
IT
LIFE IN PRISON
IS SOME TOUGH SH

628
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,350
TO WRAP YOUR
MIND AROUND.

629
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:28,860
BUT SEE, I DID LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THIS CUM HOLE,

630
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:31,860
I SETTLED IN,
I SETTLED DOWN.

631
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:37,372
BUT THEN WHEN YOU SAID
THE WORD "FREE" TO ME,

632
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,870
SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
STIRRED, YOU KNOW ?

633
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:49,883
FREEDOM, I WANT
MY FREEDOM.

634
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:54,481
AND YOU SHALL
HAVE IT, MY BROTHER.

635
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:57,490
I SWEAR TO YOU
BY ALMIGHTY GOD,

YEAH, WELL, I HAD THIS
NATURAL CURIOSITY

640
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,190
.
ABOUT MY
FELLOW MAN

00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:28,082
DON'T DANCE DOCTOR,
JUST GIVE IT TO

00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:30,591
OKAY.

644

THE LUMP UNDER YOUR
NIPPLE IS A STAGE TWO
BREAST CARCINOMA.

645
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:38,360
.
UH-HUH

646
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,363
STAGE TWO MEANS THAT WE
CAUGHT IT RELATIVELY EARLY

00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,373
SO YOUR CHANCES FOR
SURVIVAL ARE GOOD.

648

UH-HUH

DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS ?

00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,012

663
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:27,460

00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,852
WHAT, YOU THINK O'REILY
WILL TRY TO ESCAPE ?

682
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:37,851
I'LL BE ASSISTING
DR. SOPHIE POWELL.

683
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:40,353
SHE'S THE TOP BREAST
CANCER SURGEON
IN THE STATE.

684
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:41,853
( Glynn )
THIS SOUNDS EXPENSIVE.

685
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,851
IT AIN'T GONNA COME CHEAP.
WILL OUR INSURANCE
COVER IT ?

686
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:47,861
NO, AND THE CLAIMS
ADJUSTER INSISTS O'REILY
HAVE A LUMPECTOMY.

687
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:49,862
THAT'S WHERE THEY
REMOVE THE TUMOR

688
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,862
T.
BUT NOT THE BREAST, RIGHT ?
RIGH

689
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:54,863
IF WE CAN SPARE THE BREAST
AND SAVE SOME MONEY,
WHY DO A MASTECTOMY ?

690
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:57,372
WELL, LUMPECTOMIES
AREN'T ALWAYS EFFECTIVE.

691
00:40:57,406 --> 00:41:00,291
THEY OFTEN HAVE TO
BE FOLLOWED UP WITH
RADIATION OR CHEMO.

692
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:03,221
THEN THE PRISON'S
FOOTING THE BILL FOR
THIS WHOLE WING-DING ?

693
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:05,122
AND HOW MUCH
IS THAT ?

694
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,630
THE SURGEON, STAFF
AND EQUIPMENT,

695
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,632
IN ALL, $18,000.

696
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,931
WOW.

697
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,363
AND A LUMPECTOMY
COSTS WHAT ?

698
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:14,483
ABOUT HALF THAT.

699
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:18,042
.
WELL, GIVE HIM
THE LUMPECTOMY

700
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:20,990
A PATIENT SHOULD BE
ABLE TO CHOOSE HIS
OWN MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

701
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:23,492
NO, NOT AT THESE PRICES,
NOT IF HE'S A CON.

702
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,953
LOOK, RYAN O'REILY'S
GOING THROUGH ENOUGH SHIT

703
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,752
DEALING WITH BEING A MAN
AND HAVING BREAST CANCER.

704
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:31,230
HIS SURVIVAL DEPENDS
AS MUCH ON THE
POSITIVE OUTLOOK

705
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:32,740
AS IT DOES ON
THE SURGERY.

706
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:35,242
WE CAN DO AN AWFUL LOT
WITH THAT $18,000, GLORIA.

707
00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:39,110
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND COLD,
BUT WHETHER O'REILY
LIVES ANOTHER TWO MONTHS

708
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:41,110
OR ANOTHER 20 YEARS
MEANS DICK TO ME.

709
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,451
LEO, THE BALL'S
IN YOUR COURT.

710
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:45,883
GIVE HIM THE
LUMPECTOMY.

711
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:46,883
NEXT ITEM.

712
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:01,951
YOU KNOW,

713
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:04,453
IF YOU DIE,

714
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:06,451
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER ?

715
00:42:21,728 --> 00:42:22,721
HEY, BRO.

716
00:42:22,758 --> 00:42:24,223
HEY, CYRIL,

00:42:29,736 --> 00:42:31,730
HEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER ?

718
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:33,230
WHY ARE YOU
SO TENSE ?

719
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:35,230
I'M NOT TENSE.

720
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,731
.
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE BODY'S AL
L STIFF AND SHIT

721
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:42,742
WELL, IT'S THE GATES
AND THE GUARDS.

722
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:45,743
THIS PLACE IS SCARY.

723
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,751
YEAH, YOU GOT
THAT RIGHT.

724
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,751
?
WHY DO YOU
LIVE HERE

725
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:53,251
BECAUSE I WAS
BAD, REMEMBER ?

726
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:54,752
AH.
OH, YE

727
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:57,252
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
NOT BAD ANYMORE, RIGHT ?

728
00:42:57,756 --> 00:42:58,753
T.
RIGH

729
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:01,841
WHEN YOU
COMING HOME ?

730
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:05,341
NOT FOR A WHILE YET.

731
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:07,752
K,
I'M A LITTLE BIT SIC

732
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:12,251
AND I GOTTA HAVE
AN OPERATION.

733
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:14,251
NO OPERATIONS.

734
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:16,261
CYRI
L.
NO OPERATIONS.

735
00:43:16,298 --> 00:43:18,262
MAMA DIED IN
AN OPERATION.

736
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,760
MAMA DIED IN
A HOSPITAL.

737
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,342
NO, NO, CYRIL,
STOP IT.

738
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:30,352
LOOK, I'M GONNA
BE FINE, OKAY ?

739
00:43:32,357 --> 00:43:33,862
BUT IF I'M NOT,

740
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:39,333
SHANNON, SHE'S GOT
TO LIVE HER OWN LIFE,

741
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,753
SO IF SHE TELLS YOU TO
MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE...

742
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,750

WHO ARE MORE
LIKE YOU.

746
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:58,181
SO IF SHANNON TELLS

a stay of execution
