1
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,515
( Augustus )
SO THERE USED TO
BE THIS TRIBE,

2
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:40,016
THE AZTECS,

3
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,503
WHO BELIEVED THAT
THE UNIVERSE WAS
CREATED BY VIOLENCE.

4
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,955
EVERY YEAR WHAT WAS THEIR
VERSION OF CHRISTMAS,

5
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,957
THEY WOULD CUT OUT
SOMEONE'S HEART

6
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,459
AND OFFER IT UP
TO THE GODS.

7
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,212
THESE PEOPLE WERE CONVINCE
THAT WITHOUT THIS SACRIFICE,

8
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,714
THE SUN WOULD FALL
FROM THE SKY

9
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,533
AND THE WORLD WOULD
COME TO AN END.

10
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:58,033
THEN THE
SPANIARDS LANDED,

11
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:00,637
WIPED THE AZTECS OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

12
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,258
TURNS OUT
THEY WAS RIGHT.

13
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,254
THE WORLD DID
COME TO AN END,

14
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,252
FOR THEM.

15
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:09,263
WELCOME TO OZ.

16
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,260
10 MONTHS AFTER
THE WORLD ENDED.

17
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,653
(McManus )
ALRIGHT.

18
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:38,590
A LOT OF PEOPLE
THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
REOPEN EMERALD CITY

19
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:40,592
BUT AFTER
ALMOST A YEAR,

20
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,093
A LOT OF POLITICING,
BALL-BUSTING,

21
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,730
AND SOME BACK UP
FROM THE WARDEN,
HERE WE ARE.

22
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,230
IT'S A NEW
DEAL, GENTLEMEN.

23
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:50,673
IT'S A BETTER DEAL,
IT'S A FAIR DEAL.

24
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:54,602
NOW I HAVE
IDENTIFIED
10 GROUPS.

25
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:56,500
THE MUSLIMS,
THE GANGSTERS,

26
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,271
THE LATINOS,
THE ITALIANS,

27
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:01,030
THE IRISH,
THE ARYANS,

28
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,242
THE BIKERS,
THE CHRISTIANS,

29
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,910
THE GAYS, AND ONE
CALLED THE OTHERS.

30
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,921
EACH GROUP WILL
HAVE FOUR PRISONERS
LIVING AT EM CITY.

31
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,422
NO MORE, NO LESS.

32
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:14,343
EACH GROUP WILL BE EQUAL,
EACH INDIVIDUAL, EQUAL.

33
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:15,313
BULLSHIT.

34
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,693
NO, IT IS
NOT BULLSHIT,

35
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:19,183
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S NOT

36
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,180
I'M ALSO
ESTABLISHING
A COUNCIL

37
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:24,622
TO AIR GRIEVANCES,
TO ADVISE ME.

38
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:28,120
EACH GROUP WILL HAVE ONE
MEMBER SERVE ON SAID COUNCIL.

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,621
ANY QUESTIONS ?

40
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:32,270
YES, GIVEN ALL
THAT'S HAPPENED,

41
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,740
WHY DID YOU
COME BACK ?

42
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:37,212
WHY DO YOU STILL BELIEVE
EMERALD CITY WILL WORK ?

43
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,211
WELL, THE
TRUTH IS THIS.

44
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,580
WE EITHER LEARN TO CHANGE
OR WE REPEAT OUR MISTAKES.

45
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:45,040
WE EITHER BECOME A
PART OF OUR COMMUNITY,

46
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,043
OR WE REMAIN
ISOLATED FROM IT.

47
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:50,540
IN EITHER CASE
THE SUCCESS OF OUR
LIVES DEPENDS ON US.

48
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:55,051
I AM NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
TO MAKE EM CITY WORK.

49
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,630
IT'S YOU TOO.

50
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:00,721
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ?

51
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,670
( buzzing )

52
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,111
BE
KAREEM, YOU SHOULD

53
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,111
OUR REPRESENTATIVE
ON THE COUNCIL.

54
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,110
THAT'S ASSUMING
THAT WE PARTICIPATE.

55
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:12,613
YOU SAYING WE SHOULDN'
T ?
NO, I'M SAYING
THAT WE WAIT.

56
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,621
OUR ABSENCE MAY SPEAK
LOUDER THAN OUR PRESENCE.

57
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:18,850
( Adebisi )
FIRST THING, WE START
TO SELL TITS AGAIN.

58
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:20,863
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT O'REILY ?

59
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:22,362
I'LL HANDLE O'REILLY.

60
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,333
I'LL HANDLE ADEBISI.

61
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,330
WHAT WORRIES ME IS
THE SICILIANS COMING IN.

62
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,330
I DON'T SEE
NINO SCHIBETTA
ANYWHERE.

63
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:31,832
SCHIBETTA'S DEAD.

64
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:34,342
IT'S HIS SON WHO'S THE
HAIR ACROSS OUR ASS NOW.

65
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,520
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
BACK THE DRUG TRADE

66
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:40,022
AND FIND OUT WHO HURT
MY FATHER AND THEN....

67
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:42,531
SHIT.

68
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,533
THE REST OF THESE
COCK MOTHERFUCKERS.

69
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,032
THEY GONNA
LEARN, BRO.

70
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,033
THEY CAN'T SHIT
ON US NO MORE.

71
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,491
HOW THE FUCK DID I GET
TO BE AN OTHER ? ON THE
STREETS I WAS SELLING DOPE.

72
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,493
I WAS AS BAD AS ANY
OF THOSE HOMEBOYS. I
FUCKING KILLED A COP !

73
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,493
WHAT AM I DOING
HERE WITH YOU GUYS ?

74
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,990
YOU'RE DISABLED.

75
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,990
THE REST OF YOU
ARE CERTIFIABLE.

76
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,730
WHO ARE YOU ?

77
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:06,681
AGAMEMNON BUSMALIS
, A/K/A THE MOLE.

OZ.
I'M GONNA DIG

BEECHER BIT OF

00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,543

MONTHS AGO.

86

AY.
OH YEAH, WELL,
THEN THAT'S OK

87
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,540
YOU GOT US SHARING
A POD, McMANUS.

88
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,543
N.
I GOTTA SLEEP
WITH ONE EYE OPE

89
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:34,051
SISTER PETER MARIE

R.
I CALL THIS FIRST
MEETING OF THE EMERA
LD CITY COUNCIL TO ORDE

93
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:29,671
WE'RE GONNA NEED A
RECORDING SECRETARY.

94
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,140
ANYONE KNOW
HOW TO WRITE ?

95
00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:33,142
I'LL DO IT.

96
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:35,112
I'M FAMOUS FOR
MY PENMANSHIP.

97
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:36,612
HERE YOU GO,
WATCH OUT.

98
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:42,610
NOW A LOT OF YOU MEN HAVE
HAD RAW DEALS GROWING UP.

99
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:47,622
ABUSIVE PARENTS,
SHITTY HOUSING, NO JOBS.

100
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,253
NOW MY GOAL
IS MAKE CLEAR

101
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:51,761
THAT EACH OF YOU HAS
AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

102
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,262
ND.
TO TURN YOUR
LIVES AROU

103
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,262
?
OH YEAH ? AND HO
W YOU GONNA DO THAT

104
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:58,752
INITIALLY WITH
EDUCATION.

105
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:01,673
.
OVER HALF THE INMATES IN O
Z NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL

106
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:06,121
THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM HAS
MANDATORY EDUCATION PROGRAMS
IN PLACE SINCE 1982.

107
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:08,573
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THE SAME REQUIREMENTS
IN EMERALD CITY.

108
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,043
.
THERE'S ALREADY
A PROGRAM.
IT'S NOT MANDATORY

109
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,041
WHO CARES, MAN ?
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS

110
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:15,050
WE START BRINGING
BACK THEM CONJUGALS.

111
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,520
HOW ABOUT SOME
FUCKING CIGARETTES ?

112
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:24,020
ONE THING AT
A TIME, GU
YS, EDUCATION FIRST.

113
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:27,022
SINCE IT'S MANDATORY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
MORE STUDENTS,

114
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:29,533
THEREFORE,
WE'RE GONNA NE
ED MORE TEACHERS.

115
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:32,032
,
AND SINCE OUR BUDGET
FOR THIS THING IS SO SMALL

116
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:34,673
.
I'M ASKING
FOR VOLUNTEERS

117
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,283
( Adebisi
) O'REILLY.
YEAH.

118
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:39,750
COUSHAINE, I SAW IN YOUR
FILES YOU USED TO TEAC
H HIGH SCHOOL BRIEFLY.

119
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,743
YEAH.

120
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,290
HOW ABOUT HELPING
US OUT HERE ?

121
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:44,790
OKAY.

122
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,300
.
WHAT A TROOPER

123
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,423
SAID...

124
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,152
THE MUSLIMS WEREN'T
REPRESENTED AT THE
COUNCIL MEETING.

125
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,160
IF THIS COUNCIL
HAS REAL POWER,

126
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:58,663
THEN WE WILL
PARTICIPATE.

127
00:07:58,698 --> 00:07:59,911
WELL,  HOW DO
YOU MEAN ?

128
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:03,911
DO WE GET TO MAKE
POLICY OR DO WE SIMPLY
RUBBER-STAMP YOURS ?

129
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:05,412
THIS IS A PRISON,
NOT A DEMOCRACY.

130
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,423
OH, I KNOW THAT
ONLY TOO WELL.

131
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:10,130
I MEANT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT A SECOND CHANCE.

132
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:12,142
I WANT TO DO IT
RIGHT THIS TIME.

133
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:15,141
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
PARTICIPATE, FINE. JUST
DON'T GET IN MY WAY.

134
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:18,880
McMANUS, YOU WANT
US TO BE ALLIES,

135
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:20,881
EN.
BUT THAT W
ILL NEVER HAPP

136
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,382
BETTER FOR YOU TO TRANSFER
ME BACK TO GEN-POP

137
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:24,383
AND BE DONE WITH ME.

138
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:34,282
BED
YOU KNOW WHEN
I WAS LAYING IN
THAT HOSPITAL

139
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:36,282
AND I WAS AFRAID
I WAS GONNA DIE,

140
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,781
G.
I STARTED PRAYIN

141
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,282
G,
I'M NOT SAYING I HAD A
NY GREAT SPIRITUAL AWAKENIN

142
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,280
T
BUT I DID COME
TO REALIZE THA

143
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:44,292
MY GOD AND YOURS
AREN'T SO DIFFERENT.

144
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,797
THEY BOTH EXPECT
THE BEST FROM US

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,298
.
AND FOR US TO FIND
THE BEST IN EACH OTHER

146
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,804
I'VE WRITTEN ANOTHER
BOOK, McMANUS,

147
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,802
IT COMES OUT NEXT MONTH,
IT'S ABOUT THE RIOT.

148
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,802
AND WHEN I WAS
WRITING I LOOKED
FOR THE BEST IN YOU.

149
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:01,801
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I FOUND ?

150
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:04,311
A CONFUSED,
FRIGHTENED
LITTLE MAN.

151
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:06,813
WELL, I WAS FRIGHTENED
AND I WAS CONFUSED

152
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:08,810
BUT YOU TAKE A
BULLET IN THE CHEST,

153
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,813
YOU SEE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.

154
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,811
ID.
PEOPLE CAN
CHANGE, SA

155
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:14,323
EVEN ME.

156
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:16,323
EVEN YOU.

157
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:29,951
KENNY.

158
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,451
McMANUS, YOU'R
E FUCKING UP MY FLOOR.

159
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:32,953
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

160
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,593
.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO MOP IT UP AGAIN

161
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:37,021
YOU WENT TO CLASS WHEN
YOU FIRST GOT TOSSED

162
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,523
BUT THEN YOU
DROPPED OUT.

163
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,033
I HATED
THAT SHIT.

164
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,842
SO YOU PREFER
MOPPING FLOORS ?

165
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:46,350
I PREFER TO BE CHILLING
WITH SOME CHICKS AND SOME
HENNY, BUT I CAN'T, CAN I ?

166
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:48,320
WHAT ABOUT WHEN
YOU GET OUT ?

167
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,822
HOW YOU GONNA GET A JOB
WITHOUT AN EDUCATION ?

168
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,301
I GOT A JOB
WHEN I GET OUT.

ARE YOU GONNA
TEACH HIM TO READ

284
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:46,621
O,
150 YEARS AG

285
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,632
IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW
TO TEACH A SLAVE TO READ

286
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,131
BUT SOME DID BECAUSE
THEY HAD A THIRST FOR IT.

287
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,633
WELL, THE REVERSE
IS ALSO TRUE.

288
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,633
YOU CANNOT FORCE
SOMEONE TO LEARN.

289
00:15:58,126 --> 00:15:59,121
I CAN TRY.

293
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,141
ONE NIGHT MONTEZUMA SAW
THIS FLAMING EAR OF CORN

00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:24,632
SHOOT ACROSS
THE SKY.

295
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,612
A COMET.

296
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:30,573
MONTEZUMA SAW THIS
COMET AS AN OMEN,

297
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:33,072
THE SIGN OF HIS
OWN DOWNFALL.

298
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:36,571
SO HE SURRENDERED
HIS EMPIRE TO THE
SPANISH CONQUISTADORS

299
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:37,572
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

300
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:38,582

MOST OF THE TITS W

WORKING IN THE
PSYCH OFFICE,

I HAVE ACCESS TO
ALL THE FILES FOR
THE WHOLE PRISON.

514
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,383
I CAN CHANGE THOSE FILES
TO READ ANY WHICH WAY.

515
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,383

AWAY INFRACTIONS
OR ADD THEM.

HE'S A BUG,
WITTLESEY.

523
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:21,151

KEEP MOVING.

530
00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:36,190
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR KID TOO
AND YOUR MOM BEING SICK.

531
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:38,540
YOU CAN USE SOME
EXTRA CASH, RIGHT ?

532
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:40,492
KEEP FUCKING MOVING.

533
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:43,192
YOU DO BEECHER LIKE YOU
DID ROSS, I'LL PAY YOU.

534
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:45,203

IF I GET OUT,
WHAT I KNOW

00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,313
I WOULD NEED THE
MONEY UP FRONT.

539
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:55,261

OKAY.

SOON AS I
GET VERIFICATION,
BEECHER'S DEAD.

542
00:30:01,748 --> 00:30:04,713
WHEN THE AZTECS FIRST SAW
THE SPANIARDS ON HORSEBACK,

543
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:07,721
THEY THOUGHT THE
MAN AND THE HORSE
WERE ONE CREATURE

544
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,720
AND THE AZTECS
KNELT DOWN

545
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,220
AND WORSHIPED THIS
CREATURE AS GOD.

546
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:16,730
SOMETIMES,
WHAT YOU SEE

547
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:18,231
IS NOT WHAT IS.

548
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,990
YOU SEE THAT SHIT
LAST NIGHT BETWEEN
WITTLESEY AND BEECHER ?

00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,001
PROBABLY FUCKING.
SHE DIDN'T LOOK TO

550
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:46,502
WITTLESEY
WAS HELPING
BEECHER ESCAPE.

551
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,970
HE PAID HER TO
GET HIM OUT OF OZ.

552
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,472
I JUST HEARD

553
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:53,972
BEECHER WAS GONNA TELL

00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,481

SO SHE GRABS BEECHER.

YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING QUITE YET.

861
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,522
THIS LUMP UNDER
YOUR LEFT NIPPLE,
IT'S A TUMOR.

862
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:23,930
I NEED TO DO WHAT
WE CALL AN ASPIRATION.

863
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:26,430
E
DRAW A SMALL AMOUNT OF
FLUID OUT OF THE NIPPL

864
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:27,402
AND EXAMINE IT.

YOU MAY HAVE
BREAST CANCER.

THAT'S FUNNY.

869
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:39,761

00:51:41,238 --> 00:51:42,730
BREAST CANCER ?

871
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:46,211
GIRLS GET
BREAST CANCER.

872
00:51:46,258 --> 00:51:48,223
MEN DO TOO.
IT'S RARE.

873
00:51:48,257 --> 00:51:50,721
ESPECIALLY AT YOUR AGE
, BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

BULLSHIT ! YOU'RE TELLING
ME I HAVE A CHICK'S DISEASE.

880
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:04,150
MEN HAVE BREASTS

00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,620

00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:20,670
YOU GO BACK INSIDE
YOUR MEDICAL BOOKS,

00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,603
YOU SUCK OUT MORE
OF MY BLOOD.

889
00:52:24,648 --> 00:52:27,610
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA

ANOTHER VERDICT.

890
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,612
YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

891
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:32,091

LOOK, I'M A G.P.

898
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:04,891
IT'S NOT THE KIND
OF THING I COME
ACROSS EVERY DAY,

899
00:53:04,936 --> 00:53:07,403
BUT I CALLED A
FRIEND OF MINE
WHO'S AN ONCOLOGIST,

900
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:08,902
RAN THE SPECIFICS DOWN.

901
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,903
HE'D BE HARD PRESSED
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE
THE SYMPTOMS INDICATE.

902
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,401
DO THE NEEDLE
ASPIRATION.

903
00:53:13,435 --> 00:53:15,903
.
O'REILY SAYS NO,
HE'S IN DENIAL

904
00:53:16,408 --> 00:53:18,413
IF HE DOES HAVE IT
, HE'S GONNA NEED OUR HELP

905
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,911
TO ACCEPT THE REALITY OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM,

906
00:53:20,946 --> 00:53:22,410
SE.
TO FIGHT THE DISEA

907
00:53:22,448 --> 00:53:24,911
I HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH
HIM. I'LL TALK TO HIM.

908
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,922
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I SHOULD.

909
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:29,420
HE'LL FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT
IT WITH ANOTHER GUY.

910
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:31,873
ER.
HE'LL BE EMBARRASSED.
SEE HIM TOGETH

911
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:33,871
THEN HE'LL THINK WE'RE
GANGING UP ON HIM.

I GOT THE PERFECT
SOLUTION HERE.

913
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,243

I DON'T NEED EVERY
ASSHOLE IN HERE KNOWIN
G ABOUT MY BUSINESS.

923
00:54:07,668 --> 00:54:09,621
R.
WE GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO EACH OTHE

924
00:54:09,668 --> 00:54:11,630
NATHAN'S GOT THIS WHOLE
THING SCREWED UP.

925
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:14,110
MAYBE, BUT THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA KNOW FOR SURE

926
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:16,113
IS IF WE DO THE BIOPSY.

927
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:22,602
.
LET'S JUST SAY FOR
THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
, THAT'S SHE'S RIGHT

928
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:24,111

AS I DO ANY WEAKNE

931
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:35,623
ANY WEAKNESS AT

932
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:38,621
LOOK, IF YOU DO HAVE...

933
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,081
IF YOU'RE SICK AND YOU
DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

934
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,083
YOU'RE DEAD ANYWAY,
DON'T YOU SEE THAT ?

935
00:54:46,118 --> 00:54:48,581
IF THIS SHIT SPREADS
THROUGH YOUR BODY,

936
00:54:48,616 --> 00:54:50,580
THEN EVERYBODY'S
GONNA KNOW THE TRUTH.

937
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:55,340
AND BY THEN IT
WILL BE TOO LATE
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

938
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:08,853
I'M SORRY.

939
00:55:25,186 --> 00:55:27,193
( Augustus )
SO HERE'S THE
FUNNY PART.

940
00:55:27,228 --> 00:55:29,191
THE SPANIARDS
ACTUALLY EXTERMINATED

941
00:55:29,698 --> 00:55:31,192
THE AZTECS BY ACCIDENT.

942
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,613
YEAH, THEY HAD THE
HORSES AND THE CANNONS,

943
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:37,613
BUT THEY ALSO BROUGHT
OVER SMALLPOX.

944
00:55:39,468 --> 00:55:42,353
IT WAS A DISEASE THAT
FINALLY FINISHED THE JOB.

945
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:45,351
A DISEASE THE SPANISH
GAVE THE AZTECS

946
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:46,862
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING.

947
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,870
IN OZ WE DO WHAT
WE CAN TO SURVIVE,

948
00:55:56,908 --> 00:55:59,371
BUT ULTIMATELY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
