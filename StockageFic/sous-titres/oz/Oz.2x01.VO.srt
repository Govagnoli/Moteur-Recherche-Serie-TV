6
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,639
( Augustus )
THE UNIT KNOWN
AS "EMERALD CITY"

7
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,841
WAS OVERTAKEN
BY ITS PRISONERS.

8
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,544
THE GOVERNOR ORDERED
HIS TROOPS TO RECAPTURE IT

9
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,147
BY ANY MEANS
NECESSARY.

10
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,511
( gunshots )

11
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:27,967
WHEN THE SMOKE
CLEARED LITERALLY,

12
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,468
SIX PRISONERS AND
TWO CORRECTIONAL
OFFICERS WERE DEAD,

00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,924
34 OTHERS

00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:43,693
SOME FROM
THE BEATINGS,

16
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,111

RIFLE WOUNDS.

17
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:52,902
( gunshots )

18
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,820
AMONG THOSE SHOT,
TIM McMANUS,

19
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,321
WHO INVENTED
EMERALD CITY,

20
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:03,831
AND SOME SAY, RAN
IT INTO THE GROUND.

21
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:14,143
THE REST OF THE PRISONERS
WERE MOVED TO GENPOP,

22
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,113

23
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,453

YEAH, RIGHT.

28
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:01,650
LET ME JUST SAY
THIS ABOUT THAT.

29
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,912
I'VE ALREADY STARTED TO PUT
TOGETHER A GUBERNATORIAL
COMMISSION

30
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,411
TO INVESTIGATE, ONE:
THE CAUSES OF THE RIOT,

31
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,280
TWO: THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES
OF THOSE PRISONERS INVOLVED,

32
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,912
AND THREE: THE
APPROPRIATENESS OF
THE RESPONSE TO IT

33
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:13,920
BY WARDEN GLYNN.

34
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,422
GOVERNOR, WHO WILL
CHAIR THE COMMISSION ?

35
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:20,422
I'VE JUST SPOKEN TO ALVA
H CASE, DEAN OF FERBER
UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL.

36
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,420
HE'S AGREED TO LEAD
THE INVESTIGATION.

37
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:25,433
TO MY MIND THERE'S
NO MORE RESPECTED
JURIST IN THE STATE.

38
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,552

WHAT ? AM I
ASKING SO MUCH ?

42
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:37,361
YOU WANT ME TO COME
OUT ON YOUR SIDE,

43
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:39,861
YOU WANT TO CLOSE DOWN
EMERALD CITY PERMANENTLY,

44
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:42,863
YOU WANT ME TO SAY
THAT THE PRISONERS ARE
GUILTY OF EVERYTHING,

00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:48,200
AND YOU WERE JUSTIFIED
IN BRINGING IN
THE S.O.R.T. TEAM.

46
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,200
OF THE BLOOD OF
THOSE EIGHT DEAD.

MY HANDS ARE CLEAN

00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:56,792
THEN BACK OFF AND LET ME DO
WHAT YOU APPOINTED ME TO DO.

00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,291

IT.
BULLSH

I WANT TO ASK

139
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,321
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

140
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:58,833
GOVERNOR IS BUSY PICKING
THE OTHER MEMBERS

141
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,802
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M DOING
SOME PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS.

142
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,802
I HAVE

ULTIMATELY IT'S GO

IF EM CITY

146
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,084
I HAVE
NOTHING TO SAY.

147
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:28,993
MINISTER SAID ?

148
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:32,991

00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,503
ALVAH CASE.

150
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:40,481
I'M HERE TO INTERVIEW

151
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:43,842
?
IS THAT INTERV
IEW OR INTERROGATE

152
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,341
I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU'RE GUILTY OF.

153
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:48,332
T.
THERE WAS NO RIO

154
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,830
OH, REALLY ?

155
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,832
LE
THERE WAS A
RIGHTEOUS STRUGG

156
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:54,333
AGAINST REPRESSION
AND INJUSTICE.

157
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,583
RIGHTEOUS OR NOT,

158
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:59,092
THERE ARE STILL
EIGHT BODIES

159
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,691
ROTTING IN
THE MORGUE.

160
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:06,181
I GRIEVE
THEIR DEATHS.

161
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,010
DO YOU MIND ?

162
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:11,523
PLEASE.

163
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,443
I UNDERSTAND THAT FROM
THE MINUTE YOU CAME TO OZ

164
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,443
YOU STARTED ORGANIZING
OTHER MUSLIMS,

165
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,042
CONVERTING STONE-COLD
KILLERS,

166
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:27,352
ALL THE WHILE SOWING
SEEDS OF DISCONTENT.

167
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:28,850
I SPOKE THE TRUTH.

168
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,301
THEN SPEAK IT NOW.

169
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,300
OH, COME ON, SAID.

170
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,313
YOU TALK A GOOD GAME
ABOUT THE TRUTH.

171
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,812
BUT HOW COME IT DOESN'T
INCLUDE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

172
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,531
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE ?
I DIDN'T FIRE
THOSE RIFLES.

173
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,112
DID YOU CREATE A SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES

174
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:45,321
THAT CAUSED THE
RIFLES TO BE FIRED ?

175

HEY, CAN I A
SK YOU A QUESTION ?

197
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,020
OT.
TWO PRISONERS
GOT RELEASED ON THE RI

198
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:13,640
EUGENE DOBBINS
, JACKSON VAHUE.

199
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,592
?
DOBBINS WAS HURT
PRETTY BAD. YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM

200
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,593
MY QUESTIONS
FIRST, HILL.

201
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,102
SO TELL ME IN AS MANY
WORDS AS NECESSARY

202
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,610
WHAT YOU THINK
LED TO THE RIOT.

203
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,642
THEY'RE VIOLENT,
ALL THEY KNOW
IS VIOLENCE.

204
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:40,100
THE C.O.s, MAN, THEY
TREAT US LIKE SHIT.

205
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,602
SOMETIMES
THE INMATES
GET BORED.

206
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:45,091
. 
THEY TOOK AWAY CONJUGALS
. THEY TOOK AWAY SMOKING

207
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,070
NO, IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

208
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:50,572
YOU  DENY A MAN HIS FREEDOM,
HIS FAMILY, HIS PRIVACY,

209
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:53,581
HIS DIGNITY, THEN ALL HE
HAS LEFT IS TIME TO SIMMER.

210
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:57,460
THEN EVENTUALLY THE
SIMMER BECOMES A BOIL.

211
00:13:57,505 --> 00:14:01,002
WE'VE BEEN HEARING
WHISPERS THAT THE MUSLIMS
WERE GONNA START TROUBLE.

212
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,001
THE ARYANS
ARE PARANOID.

213
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,813
( Augustus )
WHAT CAUSED THE RIOT ?

214
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:08,613
TWO BRAIN-DEAD
CRACK-HEAD MOTHERFUCKERS
PLAYING CHECKERS.

215
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:12,861
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE WORLD IMPLODED.

216
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,533
FUCKING COCKSUCKER !

217
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:16,982
WE TREATED THE
HOSTAGES GOOD.

218
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,440
THEY TREATED
US LIKE SHIT.

219
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:19,941
WE TRIED
TO NEGOTIATE.

220
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:21,813
THEIR DEMANDS
WERE RIDICULOUS.

221
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,312
AND THEN THE
LIGHTS WENT OUT.

222
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:25,812
AHHH !

223
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,413
THERE WAS
TEAR GAS.

224
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:28,801
GUNS.

225
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:30,800
TIM McMANUS GOT
SHOT IN THE CHEST.

226
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,732
I SAW THE SIDE OF RODRIGO'S
HEAD GET BLOWN OFF.

227
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,673
K.
HUNT AND NOWAKOWSKI
WERE BOTH HIT IN THE BAC

228
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:42,593
WHAT ABOUT
SCOTT ROSS ?

229
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,212
WHAT ABOUT HIM ?

230
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:46,713
WELL, ACCORDING
TO THE AUTOPSY

231
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:48,722
HE WAS SHOT
THREE TIMES.

232
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:51,223
ONCE IN THE HEAD,
ONCE IN THE HEART,

233
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,172
AND ONCE IN
THE TESTICLES.

234
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:55,072
YE
AH.
I WAS CURIOUS.

235
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,581
BULLETS FLYING RANDOMLY
EVERY WHICH WAY

236
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:04,082
AND HE GETS SHOT THREE TIMES
IN THREE VERY PRECISE PLACES ?

237
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,590
.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT

238
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:10,722
( Augustus )
THEY SAY CURIOSITY
KILLED THE CAT.

239
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:12,721
WHAT THE FUCK
WAS THE CAT SO
CURIOUS ABOUT

240
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,222
THAT GOT
HIM KILLED ?

241
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:16,360
( singing )

242
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,461
( Augustus )
SOLITARY SUCKS, MAN.

243
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:39,473
IF YOU REALLY WANT
SOME COMPANY,

244
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,973
YOU JUST GOTTA GO
THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

245
00:15:56,937 --> 00:16:00,342
JUST WHAT I LOVE, MY
PRISON IN LOCKDOWN,

246
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,511
CRAWLING WITH OUTSIDE
INVESTIGATORS
AND TV CAMERAS.

247
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,011
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID WE'LL FIND ?

248
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:10,752
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'LL FIND BUT
THE WAY YOU FIND IT. THESE
QUESTIONS STIR THINGS UP.

249
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:13,751
AND GOD KNOWS EVERYONE'S
STIRRED UP ENOUGH RIGHT NOW.

250
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:16,750
LEO, WHO WAS
SCOTT ROSS ?

251
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,142
ROSS ?

252
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:22,641
WELL, HE WAS A
BIKER, DRUG DEALER,

253
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,140
THREE STRIKES LIFER, WHY ?

254
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:26,861
WELL,
I'M NOT SURE YET

255
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:29,871
BUT ROSS MAY HAVE
BEEN MURDERED.

256
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:31,793
WHAT ?

257
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,352
DURING THE SORT
TEAM'S ATTACK

258
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:35,863
HE MAY HAVE BEEN
KILLED DELIBERATELY.

259
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,690
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT ?

260
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:42,952
HE WAS SHOT THREE TIME
S, ALMOST EXECUTION STYLE.

261
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,451
s,
AND THE BULLETS IN
ROSS' BODY WERE 9mm'

262
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:47,951
S,
NOT DOUBLE-OUGHT

263
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:49,891
.
WHICH WERE
IN SORT RIFLES

264
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,793
THE SORT TEAM USES
9mm IN A HANDGUN.

265
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:53,790
RIGHT.

266
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,331
SO SORT TEAM MEMBER A,

267
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,292
HE ENTERS THE COMMON
ROOM IN EM CITY,

268
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:59,800
LOWERS HIS RIFLE,
ROSS COMES AT HIM
FROM OUT OF THE DARK,

269
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:02,983
HE RAISES HIS HANDGUN,
FIRES, THAT'S NOT MURDER.

270
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,021
YOU THROW A BULLET
IN SOMEONE'S BRAIN,

271
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,020
YOU PRETTY MUCH
FIGURE HE'S DONE.

272
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,960
MAYBE HE SHOT HIM
IN THE HEART FIRST,

273
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:10,423
G.
OR THE BALLS A
ND ROSS  KEPT COMIN

274
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:12,891
YEAH, BUT THE BULLET
FROM ROSS' BRAIN

275
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:15,903
WAS IN THE WALL BELOW THE
COMMAND CENTER BY A TV.

276
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,400
AND THE ONE THAT WENT
THROUGH HIS HEART

277
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,471
WAS EMBEDDED
IN THE FLOOR.

278
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:21,972
SO UNLESS HE DIED
FALLING UPWARDS...

279
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:22,973
IT'S MURDER.

280
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,720
( grunting )

281
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,811
( blowing whistle )

282
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,780
( Augustus )
IN ALL THAT CHAOS,

283
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,901
WHAT A PERFECT
CHANCE TO OFF ROSS,

284
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:34,832
AND GET AWAY WITH
IT, SCOTT-FREE.

285
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,803
THAT'S HIM
OVER THERE.

286
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,560
OFFICER HEIM ?

287
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:56,040
THE BULLETS THAT
KILLED ROSS

288
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,042
CAME FROM THE
SAME BOX

289
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,042
AS THE ONES THAT YOU
PUT IN YOUR HANDGUN.

290
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:04,551
SO ?

291
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:07,403

00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:14,741
I DIDN'T.

295
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:15,743

303
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,902
IT DISAPPEARED.

304

357
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:53,541

358
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:56,991
AHHH !

359
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,101
YOU STILL ON

360
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:17,101
YEAH.

361
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,451
SO ARE YOU.

362
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,440
WELL, WE HAD A COUPLE
OF INCIDENTS TONIGHT.

363
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,943
ANYTHING I SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT ?

364
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,440
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE ?

365
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:35,431
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE
THIS ROSS THING THROUGH.

366
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:37,430
EFT
THERE WAS
SIX HOSTAGES L

367
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,892
D.
WHEN THE S
ORT TEAM ATTACKE

368
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:44,393
McMANUS, WITTLESEY
, MUKADA, D'AGNASTI, HUNT,

369
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,390
.
AND NOWAKOWSKI

370
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:49,902
NTS
NOW HUNT AND NOWAKOWSKI
DIED DURING THE FIRST MOME

371
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,380
,
OF THE ASSAULT AND
McMANUS WAS SHOT

372
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:57,843
SO THERE'S LESS OF A CHANCE
THAT HE KILLED ROSS.

373
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,341
WHAT MAKES YOU SO
SURE IT WAS A C.O. ?
WHY NOT A PRISONER ?

374
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,280
ROSS WASN'T EXACTLY BELOVED
BY HIS FELLOW INMATES.

375
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,783
HT.
OH, THAT WAS
MY FIRST THOUG

M,
BUT AFTER TALK
ING WITH OFFICER HEI

379
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:16,640
WHO BY THE WAY, LEO, I

380
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:22,151
N.
I REALIZED HE'D

382
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,132
D'AGNASTI.

383
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:27,133
OR WITTLESEY.

384
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:29,643
OR MUKADA.

385
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:31,640
NOW STOP !

386
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:34,642
FATHER MUKADA
WASN'T INVOLVED.

387
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,143
YOU NEVER KNOW.

388
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:41,153
( Case )
HOW DID ROSS
TREAT EVERYONE ?

389
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:43,653
HE WAS A CONDESCENDING
LITTLE PRICK.

390
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:47,650
DID HE DO ANY HARM TO YOU,
PERSONALLY, PHYSICALLY ?

391
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:49,663
NOPE.

392
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:52,161
WHAT ABOUT OFFICERS
WITTLESEY OR D'AGNASTI ?

393
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,660
I DON'T REMEMBER.

394

( Mukada )
THROUGH IT ALL,

402
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:23,273
THROUGH THE TEAR GAS AND
THE GUNFIRE AND THE

00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,283
FEAR AND THE ADRENALINE
IN OVERDRIVE,

TO USE FORCE AT
OSWALD REMAINS HIGH.

554
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:59,230
EVEN AS A GUBERNATORIAL
COMMISSION SEARCHES
FOR ANSWERS.

555
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,153
GUYS, HELP ME
OUT HERE.

556
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,652
WHAT THE FUCK IS
TAKING SO LONG ?

557
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,523
YOU WANT THIS DONE
RIGHT OR FAST ?

558
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:07,521
BOTH !

559
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:10,470
I WANT ANOTHER PRESS
CONFERENCE, GIVE
THEM AN UPDATE.

560
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:13,481
I'M TIRED OF SAYING
BE PATIENT, AND I AM
TIRED OF TELLING THEM

561
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:16,351
THAT I HAVE ABSOLUTE
FAITH IN YOU, 'CAUSE
FRANKLY I DON'T.

562
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:20,273
WE'D BE MOVING A LOT FASTER
IF ALVAH COULD JUST STAY
FOCUSED ON THE BIG PICTURE.

563
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:23,071
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
HE'S OFF SOLVING
A MURDER

564
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,941
THAT ISN'T A MURDER.
IT'S MURDER.

565
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:28,360
WELL, IF IT IS,
IT IS ONLY A SMALL PART
OF OUR OVERALL MISSION.

566
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:29,362
I DISAGREE.

567
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,962
I THINK IT'S ENDEMIC OF
THE WHOLE PROBLEM HERE AT OZ.

YOU'VE HANDED DOWN
FROM THE BENCH,

571
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:39,971
YOU'RE THE EXPERT
ON FULL OF SHIT.

572
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,471
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN
?
DON'T FUCK WITH ME.

573
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:43,813

THAT'S FINE, FORGET
IT, I'LL RESIGN !
NO, I'LL RESIGN !

575
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:48,083
NO ONE IS
RESIGNING !

576
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:51,583
THE LAST THING I NEED IS
FOR THE MEDIA TO HEAR THAT
THE COMMISSION IS FIGHTING.

577
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:52,980
BACK TO YOUR CORNERS

578
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:54,433
AND BACK TO WORK.

579
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:56,393
THE SOONER WE

YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME I HAD
A WOMAN TIE ME DOWN LIKE THIS,

585
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,020
I MARRIED HER.

586

595
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:51,481
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR ?

596
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,811
YOUR IMPRESSIONS
OF ROSS.

597
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,323
YOU'RE A TEACHER,

M.
I SPEND LESS AND L
ESS TIME IN THE CLASSROO

AFFECTION FOR THEM ?
OH, YEAH.

602
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,083
I COULDN'T WAIT FOR ROSS
TO LEAVE THE OFFICE.

603
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,530
U ?
DID HE FRIGHTEN YO

604
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:15,993
THAT AND HE
HAD A TERRIBLE
HYGIENE PROBLEM.

605
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:19,890
DID HE EVE
R MENTION HAVING A

606
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:22,341
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
ANYONE ON THE STAFF ?

607
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:26,852
AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE FILES,
HE SAID A LOT OF THINGS.
HE WAS A COMPULSIVE LIAR.

608
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:28,850
DO YOU EVER COUNSEL
STAFF MEMBERS ?

609
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:30,352
SURE.

610
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,353
DID ANYONE EVE

EVERYBODY.

614
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,590
CAN YOU BE A LITTLE
MORE SPECIFIC ?

615
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:44,011
COME ON, YOU KNOW A NUN
DOESN'T REVEAL THE CONFIDENCE.

616
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:48,022
YOU'RE NOT
A PRIEST.

617
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,523
.
THE SILENCE OF
THE CONFESSIONAL
DOESN'T APPLY HERE

618
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:54,971
AS A PSYCHOLOGIST,
IT DOES.

619
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:59,932
.
THEN WE MAY HAVE TO LE
T A COURT DETERMINE THAT

620
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,873
WELL, THAT'S FINE.

621
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:05,371
I WANT THOSE FILES BACK WHEN
YOU'RE THROUGH WITH THEM.

622
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,322

POSSESSION
OF A DEADLY WEAPON,

629
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:29,391
VIOLATION OF PAROLE.

630
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,392
THAT'S AN
AMAZING LIST
OF CRIMES.

631
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:34,362
YEAH WELL, YOU KNOW,
I APPLIED MYSELF.

632
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:37,333

00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,841
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A
HARD TIME ADJUSTING
TO LIFE IN OZ.

634
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:44,321

I'M LIKE THE LORD
OF THE FUCKING DANCE.

638
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:52,771
I GOT MOVES.

639
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:55,101

00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:02,112
YET THE OTHERS
INCLUDED YOU

643
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,110
IN ALL T
HE DECISION MAKING.

644
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,603
I HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE RIOT.

645
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,570
OH, I GUESS
I WAS MISINFORMED.

646
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,071
I GUESS YOU WERE.

647
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:16,061
E

A RELIABLE SOURC

648
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:21,561
THAT YOU AND
ROSS WERE CLOSE.

649
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:25,511
CLOSE, NO ?

650
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:27,471
.
THAT YOU AND
HE WERE LOVERS

651
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:30,470
NOW, WHO THE FUCK
TOLD YOU THAT ?

652
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:33,921
E.
ROSS POURED HIS HEART
OUT TO SISTER PETER MARI

653
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:36,892
HEY, LOOK, I'M
NO FAG, PAL.

654
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,332
BUT IF I WERE,

655
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:41,810
I WOULDN'T PUT MY
DICK ANYWHERE NEAR
ROSS'S SCUM HOLE.

656
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:44,700
THAT COCKSUCKER WOULD
FUCK ANYTHING ON
TWO OR FOUR LEGS.

657
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,202
YEAH, WELL
WHAT ABOUT C.O.s,

658
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:49,190
DID ROSS EVER
FUCK ONE OF THEM ?

659
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:51,691
HOW ABOUT SOME
HELP GETTING ME

WELL, THEN HOW

663
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:07,143
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

WHEN I'M DONE
PUFFING ON THIS,

00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:11,643
I CAN SUCK ON MY OWN
SECONDHAND SMOKE.

00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:13,650
,
SO

667
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:18,623
ROSS HAD A THING

00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,620
YEAH.

670
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:25,593
HE CLAIMED THEY KNEW
EACH OTHER ON THE
OUTSIDE. IT MAKES SENSE.

671
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:28,562
THEY WERE ALWAYS
SNEAKING OFF AND
WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER.

672
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:32,553
?
WHAT'S THE MATTER

673
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:35,552

00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:38,353
WHY ?

675
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:40,112
YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

676
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:43,093
HE'LL DO HIS INQUIRY,
HE'LL BE GONE.

677
00:39:44,597 --> 00:39:45,092
YUP.

678

00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:50,300
YEAH, I GUESS.

680
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:55,540
THEY ALSO SAY IF YOU REPEAT
A LIE OFTEN ENOUGH,

681
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,541
IT BECOMES THE TRUTH,

682
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,542
OR AT LEAST YOU
CONVINCE YOURSELF

683
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:01,043
IT'S THE FUCKING GOSPEL.

684
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:06,582
YOU RUN THE ARYAN
BROTHERHOOD, MR.

SCOTT ROSS.

696
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,542
POOR SON-OF-A-BITCH.

697
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:33,991
SO YOU WERE FRIENDS ?

698
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:34,882

RE.
SU

702
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:48,671
.
ROSS AND WITTLESEY'S E
X WERE IN THE SAME BIKE CLUB

703
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:54,732
ROSS SAID HE NAILED HE
R BEHIND HER HUBBY'S BACK,

704
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:57,231
BUT THEN AGAIN,
ROSS WAS SOMETIMES
A LYING SACK OF SHIT,

705
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,691
SO WHO KNOWS
IF IT'S TRUE.

706
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:02,322
DID ANYTHING GO ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM

707
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:04,321
SINCE HE CAME TO OZ ?

708
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,910
S,
ACCORDING TO ROS

709
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,991

HE WAS BANGING
HER PRETTY REGULAR

710
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:10,003
YOU THINK HE WAS
LYING ABOUT THAT ?

711
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:14,700

00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:19,662
Y.
THANK YOU FOR GETT
ING ME PERMISSION TO

713
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:21,663

714
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,610
OH, NO PROBLEM.

715
00:41:23,645 --> 00:41:26,610
THEY TELL ME YOU
KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON IN OZ.

716
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:29,623
THEY EXAGGERATE.

717
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,620
DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA, IF ANYTHING,

718
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:36,121

OFFICER WITTLESEY

719
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,121
CIGARETTES.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

720
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,633
CIGARETTES WAS WHAT WA
S GOING ON BETWEEN THEM.

721
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:43,130
WITTLESEY SMUGGLED
THEM IN, A CARTON A DAY.

722
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:46,130
SHE GAVE THEM TO ROS
S TO SELL. EVERYTHIN
G WAS GOING SMOOTHLY

723
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:47,630
UNTIL McMANUS
FOUND OUT.

724
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:50,142
HE MADE WITTLESEY SHUT
DOWN THE OPERATION.

725
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:55,070
SO ROSS HATED
McMANUS FOR THAT.

726
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:58,442
AND BECAUSE WITTLESEY
AND McMANUS STARTED
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

IN THE HEAT OF THE RIOT,
MAYBE SHE JUST LOST IT.

744
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:07,230
T.
NO, IT HAD TO BE A MORE
SPECIFIC REASON THAN THA

745
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:12,230
ROSS HAD TO HAVE DON
E SOMETHING AT THAT MOMENT

746
00:43:12,278 --> 00:43:13,743
TO GET HER TO
PULL THE TRIGGER.

747

759
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:02,002

WOULD YOU EXCUSE

SO I HEARD

764
00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:27,880
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID ?

765
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:29,830
WELL, I'VE GOT
MY PANTS ON.

766
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:31,833

00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:36,793
I USED TO BE A LAWYER,

768
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:37,791

UH-HUH

769

00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:47,212
RAH, RAH, CRIMSON...

I'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT
OF STRESS LATELY.

I HAVEN'T BEEN
BEHAVING VERY NICELY,

00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:01,040
LIKE THIS BITING THING.

775
00:45:02,988 --> 00:45:05,403
BUT I'M USING
MY TIME IN HERE

776
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:07,903
TO TURN MY
HEAD AROUND.

777
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:17,912
WHEN I GET OUT OF
HERE, I'M GONNA BE
A BETTER PERSON.

778
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,452
THIS WHOLE
BITING THING

779
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:26,450
JUST ISN'T WORKING
FOR ME, YOU KNOW ?

780
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:34,333
SO AS A SIGN THAT I'M ON
THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW,

781
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:39,331
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
MY LITTLE SECRET

782
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:42,841
AND THEN I'LL BE ON
THE ROAD BACK, RIGHT ?

783
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:46,271
YEAH, YEAH.

786
00:45:57,657 --> 00:45:58,650
CHECK THE BULLETS.

787
00:46:01,155 --> 00:46:02,653

KILLED ROSS ?

788
00:46:06,168 --> 00:46:06,660

789
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,631
CHECK THE BULLETS
IN McMANUS.

790
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:17,853

YOU HAD A SIG-SAUER
IN YOUR POSSESSION.

803
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:12,571

NOW I KNOW HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOU

00:47:23,028 --> 00:47:24,390
TO BE AMONG
YOUR PEOPLE,

810
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,892
LEADING, GUIDING,
NURTURING THEM.

811
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:30,390
THAT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DO
THROUGH EIGHT TONS OF STEEL.

812
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:33,850
YOU'RE AN
ACADEMIC, RIGHT ?

817
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:50,133
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,632
AT THE COMMAND STATION
HOLDING THAT GUN.

819
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:54,632
WHEN THE SORT TEAM
MEMBER CAME IN

820
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:56,641
AND STARTED
TO BEAT ME,

821
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:58,643
AND IN NOT WANTING
TO KILL ANYBODY,

822
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:03,140
.
I MIGHT HAVE THROW
N THAT GUN OVER THE SIDE

823
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:05,962
WHERE SOMEONE ELSE
PICKED IT UP.

824
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:11,400
THEORETICALLY

YOU ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING ?

856
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,090
YES, YES, I AM.

857
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:58,592
YOU, YOU KILLED
SCOTT ROSS.

858
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:02,562
ME ? HOW DID I DO THAT ?

859
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:06,063
N.
ROSS PICKE
D UP SAID'S GU

860
00:50:06,106 --> 00:50:10,551
HE FIRED INTO
McMANUS'S CHEST, BANG !

861
00:50:10,597 --> 00:50:13,562
YOU TOOK OFFICER HEIM'S
PISTOL AND SHOT ROSS.

862
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:18,491
BANG, BANG, BANG.

863
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:21,500
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
MY HANDS WERE TIED
BEHIND MY BACK.

864
00:50:21,538 --> 00:50:23,981
NO, THEY WEREN'T.

865
00:50:24,027 --> 00:50:26,953
YOU MANAGED TO LOOSE
THE BINDS BEFORE IT
ALL CAME DOWN.

866
00:50:27,456 --> 00:50:31,963
YOU TOLD ME THAT
AFTER McMANUS FELL
TO THE GROUND, YOU,

867
00:50:33,937 --> 00:50:37,911
QUOTE, "I CRADLED HIM
IN MY ARMS," END QUOTE.

868
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:46,240
HOW COULD YOU
CRADLE HIM

869
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:48,241
WITH YOUR ARMS
BEHIND YOUR BACK ?

870
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:52,181
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN IN A RIOT ?

871
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,181
NO.

872
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:55,660
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S INVOLVED.

873
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:58,671
THE IDEA OF BEING
A HOSTAGE, THE
MOB MENTALITY,

874
00:51:00,675 --> 00:51:02,671
YOU GET CARRIED AWAY,
YOU STOP BEING HUMAN.

875
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,672
YOU BECOME PART
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

876
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,100
I HAVE MADE EVERY
MISTAKE THERE IS.

877
00:51:11,608 --> 00:51:14,521
I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THE WRONG MEN,

878
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,020
I HAD A BABY
OUT OF WEDLOCK,

879
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:19,022
I DRANK TOO MUCH,
I SNORTED TOO MUCH.

880
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:21,021
I HAVE DONE THINGS
TO MAKE MONEY,

881
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:22,521
INCLUDING THIS JOB,

882
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,530
WHICH MAKE ME DREAD
GETTING OUT OF BED.

883
00:51:24,566 --> 00:51:26,532
BUT EACH TIME I
MADE THE CHOICE.

884
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:30,030
I CHOSE TO DRINK,
I CHOSE TO STOP.

885
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:33,033
WHEN MY HUSBAND GOT
ABUSIVE, I CHOSE TO WALK.

886
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:35,540
I REFUSE TO BE
ANYBODY'S VICTIM.

887
00:51:38,546 --> 00:51:41,043
THESE MISTAKES I'VE MADE,
THEY ARE A PART OF ME.

888
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:42,542
THEY ARE LIKE MY SKIN.

889
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:46,553
AND I DO NOT REGRET
WHAT I'VE DONE.

890
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:49,050
DO YOU HEAR ME ?

891
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:51,553
NO REGRETS,
NO REMORSE.

892
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:53,053
I JUST KEEP GOING.

893
00:51:58,437 --> 00:51:59,910
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ?

894
00:51:59,945 --> 00:52:01,413
WHEN I KNOW,
YOU'LL KNOW.

895
00:52:05,928 --> 00:52:09,870
SHE HAS A YOUN
G DAUGHTER, A MOTHER
IN AND OUT OF CHEMO.

896
00:52:09,906 --> 00:52:11,372
SO WHAT, LEO,
SO WHAT ?

897
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:12,873
TH,
SO IF YOU
EXPOSE THE TRU

898
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:15,380
YOU DESTROY THIS WOMAN'S
LIFE AND HER DAUGHTER'S.

899
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:17,383
AND FOR WHAT, SCOT
T FUCKING ROSS ?!

900
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:18,881
E.
COME ON ALVAH, PLEAS

901
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:20,883
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY, LEO ?

902
00:52:20,925 --> 00:52:24,393
TO SAY THAT ROSS DIED
LIKE THE OTHERS,

903
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:26,893
M
FROM BULLETS FIRED BY
A MEMBER OF THE SORT TEA

904
00:52:26,928 --> 00:52:28,972
IN THE PERFORMANCE
OF HIS DUTY.

905
00:52:29,475 --> 00:52:32,492
I JUST READ THE PRELIMINARY
DRAFT OF YOUR REPORT.
WHAT'S WRONG ?

906
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:35,961
YOU RECOMMEND NOT FILING
CHARGES AGAINST SAID
AND THE RIOT LEADERS ?!

907
00:52:36,008 --> 00:52:38,932
FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT,
THE EVIDENCE IS
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

908
00:52:38,975 --> 00:52:40,632
FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT,
IT'S LAUGHABLE.

909
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:46,391
LOOK, GOVERNOR
, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,

910
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:47,893
WHATEVER THEY
DID CAME ABOUT

911
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:49,860
AS A DIRECT RESULT
OF YOUR ACTIONS !

912
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:51,862
.
YOU'VE EXONERATED ME.
OH, YEAH, YEAH

913
00:52:51,908 --> 00:52:54,851
YOUR COMMISSION BEHAVE
D LIKE GOOD LITTLE BOYS.

914
00:52:54,886 --> 00:52:56,852
S.
BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE IT BOTH WAY

915
00:52:56,898 --> 00:52:59,840
IF THE PRISONERS ARE
GUILTY, SO ARE YOU.

916
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:06,331
THIS IS NOT THE KIND
OF ATTITUDE I EXPECT

917
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:08,333
FROM AN
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

918
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:11,830
YEAH, WELL, I'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

919
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:15,843
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

920
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:18,342
I WANT TO BE GOVERNOR.

921
00:53:19,827 --> 00:53:21,291
WHAT ?

922
00:53:21,336 --> 00:53:23,261
I'LL SEE YOU
ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL, DEVLIN.

923
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:29,272
NOW, I'VE GOT A PRESS
CONFERENCE TO DO.

924
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:43,010
IT IS THE CONSIDERED
OPINION OF THIS COMMISSION

925
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:46,383
THAT THOUGH
THE RIOT ITSELF

926
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:50,270
AND THE DEATHS THAT
FOLLOWED ARE TRAGIC,

927
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:54,642
NO ONE IN PARTICULAR
IS AT FAULT.

928
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:57,153
( reporter chatter )

929
00:53:57,186 --> 00:54:00,031
WE DO FEEL THAT THERE
ARE CERTAIN MEASURES

930
00:54:00,065 --> 00:54:03,650
THAT CAN BE
TAKEN TO INSURE

931
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:08,110
THAT AN EVENT LIKE THIS
DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

932
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:23,411
BITCH.

933
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:31,903
( Augustus )
SO, AS IT TURNS OUT,

934
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:35,401
NO ONE WAS TO
BLAME FOR THE RIOT.

935
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:40,412
IN FACT, IF NO
ONE WAS TO BLAME,

936
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:42,372
THAT MEANS NOTHING
BAD HAPPENED.

937
00:54:44,387 --> 00:54:46,883
NOTHING AT
ALL HAPPENED.

938
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:50,882
SO LIFE CAN PRETTY MUCH
GO ON AS IT HAS BEFORE.
