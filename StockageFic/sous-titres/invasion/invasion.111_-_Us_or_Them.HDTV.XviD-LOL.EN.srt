1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on "invasion"...</i>

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,800
there's this storm brewing inside me

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,000
that is more powerful than any hurricane.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,500
What really happened to you that night in the water?

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,100
Do you know?

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,700
Mariel's not like you and me, father.

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,100
She's afraid of losing her children.

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,400
And you're afraid of losing her.

9
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,500
you did see a body,

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,400
- but it wasn't you.
- Aah!

11
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,700
I was counting on your loyalty,lewis.

12
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,700
But i'm loyal to god, sir.

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,100
Lewis?

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,300
Lewis!

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,900
do you know what happened to you last night?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My arm came back, sir.

17
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,900
It's a miracle.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,600
what happed to him is wrong.

19
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,000
They'll want to dissect all of us and i cannot let that happen.

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,500
There are people out there who may be killing themselves

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,500
and their children.

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,300
i've been reconstructing this skull.

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,300
It's almost 10 years old.

24
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,700
This isn't god's plan, sir.

25
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,100
He gave me a gift.

26
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,800
That's right, lewis,

27
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,800
so why do you want to go against him?

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,500
The morning after the hurricane,

29
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,900
when they pulled me from the water...

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
i felt like i had a secret to tell,

31
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,100
but i didn't know who to tell it to.

32
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
People don't like it when y change.

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,500
They say they do,

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,700
but they really don't,

35
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
because it forces them to change, too,

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,100
and that's why i'm so grateful i found you,

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,700
because i know that you understand

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,200
and i know that you accept me...

39
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,400
<i>and to those who don't,</i>

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,600
well, adios.

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,300
Yeah, well, you stop by anytime, mariel.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm giving out free haircuts to members of the group.

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Oh, that's really sweet of you, roger.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,900
Well, we gotta take care of our own, right?

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,100
alma!

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,800
Alma!

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,700
Alma.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,900
Excuse me.

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,100
Damn it, alma,

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,300
i've been lookin' all over for you.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
We got two sick kids at home

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
and you're hanging out with these losers again!

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,300
They're not losers!

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm tellin' you, we don't need these people.

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
You need to calm down, son.

56
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
What...get in the car.

57
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,800
Get in the car.

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,100
get that guy!

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,200
Hey, leave her alone.

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,000
get him!

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,500
Stop it!

62
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,400
Let me through.

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,400
Let me through.

64
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,600
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
Somebody call 9-1-1.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,100
He needs an ambulance.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Call 9-1-1.

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,900
Somebody call 9-1-1.

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,700
And the good news is if you need a doctor,

70
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
she's right across the hall.

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Hey, come on, come on.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Don't be shy.

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,300
I really would be more comfortable in my apartment, sir.

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Nonsense, nonsense.

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,500
After what you've been through,

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,000
the least we can do is help nurse you back to health, okay?

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,700
All right? Kira?!

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,700
Dad?

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,700
Hey, sweetheart.

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,700
Deputy sirk here had a really bad accident yesterday.

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,100
He was shot in the arm,

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,300
and as you know,

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
he never had much of an arm to begin with,

84
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,300
so he needs our help.

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,500
Would you mind looking after him for the next couple of days?

86
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,700
You want me to look after him?

87
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,400
Sir, that really isn't necessary.

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,000
No, no, no.

89
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,900
We'll put him in rose's room

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,900
while she's out of town.

91
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,700
Um, dad...

92
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,500
uh, do me a favor.

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,000
We left his overnight bag in the car.

94
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Can you get that for us?

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Thanks, honey.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,700
Right... yeah.

97
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,900
Oh, my g...

98
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,000
hey.

99
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,200
What are you doing here?

100
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,300
What's wrong?

101
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Are the kids okay?

102
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Yeah, they're still with larkin up north.

103
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I need you to come with me.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Where?

105
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,500
To my house.

106
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,300
There's something i have to show you.

107
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,100
I'm working.

108
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,300
It's important.

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,400
What's this about?

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,000
You.

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
Sir, this doesn't feel right.

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
You have to stop arguing with me, lewis.

113
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,200
I know what's best for you.

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,700
Why'd you tell your daughter i'd been shot?

115
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Because the truth is just a little too complicated.

116
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,400
I really don't feel comfortable lying, sir.

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
You didn't lie. I did.

118
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,800
Now just get undressed, please.

119
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,600
How long do i have to stay here?

120
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,800
Until you're recovered.

121
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,400
The doctor said that could be weeks.

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
The doctor's wrong.

123
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,900
How do you know?

124
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,200
I know.

125
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,000
This really hurts.

126
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,100
Yeah, i'll bet.

127
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
We gotta get you some stronger meds.

128
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
I don't mean physically,sir.

129
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
When i lost my arm in the war,

130
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,600
i figured it was god's will,

131
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,900
and the other night when i was in the water,

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,200
i thought god had given me my arm back to help me swim.

133
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm not so sure that was the reason.

134
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,200
Well, either way,

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
i'm having a difficult time with this

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,100
because I-i feel like i've gone against him.

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,800
No, no, no, no.

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
God must have helped you make the decision to cut off your arm

139
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,500
because he knew how difficult things would be for you otherwise.

140
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
I don't understand, sir.

141
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Change scares people, lewis.

142
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,900
You couldn't just show up into town,

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
flailing around a new arm like you were captain of the swim team.

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,300
I mean, folks would be wildly unnerved.

145
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,100
They would start poking and prodding at you,

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,100
trying to look for a rational explanation for the...

147
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,000
the thing,

148
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,700
and there just isn't one.

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,500
That's why we need to keep this between us.

150
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,600
I guess you're right, sir.

151
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,000
Of course i am.

152
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,100
Besides,

153
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
i think one arm suits you.

154
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,900
Gives you an edge.

155
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,700
Where do you want it?

156
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
Right by the door, honey.

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,300
That's great.

158
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,800
Come in, jess.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's too cold.

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
Can you throw me some quarters?

161
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,000
Uh, i don't really have any quarters.

162
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Larkin, do you have any quarters?

163
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Uh, yeah...

164
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,700
yeah, i think there's a few in there. Here.

165
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,300
You hungry?

166
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,900
Uh, no.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,900
Still recovering from the chocolate corn dog.

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,700
Hmm.

169
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Yeah, not so good, huh?

170
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,900
Any food on a stick is not to be trusted.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,700
Okay, rose...

172
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,700
throw them in the deep end!

173
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,600
You got it.

174
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,700
Sorry.

175
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,300
Watch me.

176
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,200
It's too deep.

177
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,900
Can you get them for me?

178
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,500
Jess?

179
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,200
Jess?

180
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,400
Hold on a second, rose.

181
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,500
hey, jess?

182
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,200
What?

183
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
I think i'm gonna go try to track down a salad.

184
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,000
Can you watch rose for me?

185
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Yeah.

186
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll see you back at the room, okay?

187
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,500
All right.

188
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
She's good.

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Yeah.

190
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,900
Hey.

191
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,000
Did you tell her yet?

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,500
No.

193
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,900
You sure you want to?

194
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,200
Hey, mariel.

195
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,400
Hey.

196
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
So?

197
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Look, i want you to know the only reason

198
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,100
that i'm doing this

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,700
is because if i tried to explain it,

200
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,000
I-i couldn't.

201
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,400
St show me.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,700
What is that?

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,700
A skeleton...

204
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
your husband's skeleton.

205
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,800
The head's under my bed.

206
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,900
We didn't think that you'd want to see that.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,100
- Is this a joke?
- No.

208
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,500
This is tom,

209
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
or at Ist,what used to be tom...

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,700
and this...

211
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
this larger carcass that's wrapped around it,

212
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,900
i think this is the remains of an invasive species

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that's moved into the glades.

214
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,900
Russell and i found it at the plane crash site of '96,

215
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
the one that tom survived.

216
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,100
We think that he may have lived through the initial impact,

217
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700
only to be attacked by this thing,

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,100
but tom is not who you think he is, mariel.

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Hell, he may not be who he thinks he is.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Then who is he?

221
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,900
We think that these creatures take people's d. n. a.,

222
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,900
add their own poison to the mix

223
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
to basically create a new being,

224
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
like a hybrid, you know?

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,300
Half us, half them.

226
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,900
It's okay if you're confused right now

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,100
'cause a lot of people are confused right now,

228
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
like all the survivors at your church group.

229
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,400
We heard about this morning.

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
They beat that guy really badly, didn't they?

231
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,600
Like a pack.

232
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,100
Mariel...

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,700
look, if you can just look at the science of this thing...

234
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,900
"the science"?

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
What are you trying to do here?

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
Protect our kids.

237
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,800
- I can't have them living in a house...
- oh, my god,

238
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
you son of a bitch.

239
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,100
I can't let them stay with you.

240
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,200
It's not safe.

241
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm their mother!

242
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,100
Are you sure?!

243
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,100
He told me that you saw your body in biscayne cove.

244
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,500
That was a girl from florida city.

245
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,100
The girl they pulled out may have been,

246
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
but who was in charge of that operation?

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Tom.

248
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,900
Look, the night of the hurricane,

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
i think tom saw you you after you left here,

250
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,000
and i think he knows exactly what happened to you

251
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,800
because the same thing happened to him

252
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,500
almost ten years ago,mariel.

253
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,700
If i don't have my children back to me by 6:00 tonight,

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
i will have a hundred lawyers in this driveway.

255
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,600
Ask him.

256
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,600
Just see what he says.

257
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
I can't believe you're doing this.

258
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,400
I can't believe you'd want to hurt our family this badly.

259
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm just telling you the truth.

260
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,700
No, you're telling me your truth!

261
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
excuse me,mr. Deputy?

262
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,100
Lewis.

263
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Oh, uh,

264
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
where would you like this?

265
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Um, you can just put it right here.

266
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Um, kira?

267
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm sorry about all this.

268
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,000
It's okay.

269
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I'd really rather be back at my place.

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
How did you get shot?

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,100
Hey, i thought you were gonna rest.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hope you like the soup.

273
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm gonna go out for a little bit.

274
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,200
You gonna be all right here?

275
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm very confused, sir.

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,300
The arm wasn't the only thing different about me, was it?

277
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
I'm different all over now, aren't i?

278
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,100
Yeah, but in time,

279
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
you'll come to realize

280
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,000
that it's all for the good.

281
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,700
Hey...

282
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,300
it's all good.

283
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,500
Baby steps, lewis,

284
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,500
baby steps.

285
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,400
I've never seen anyone stay underwater that long.

286
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,800
I've never seen anyone like her, period.

287
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,200
You think she's a mermaid?

288
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
I think she's smokin'.

289
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
Hey, rose,

290
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,600
you, uh,

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
you want to go into town with me?

292
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,200
Are you going to buy more baby stuff?

293
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>No, i was thinking about buying more rose stuff.</i>

294
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay.

295
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
- Bye, jess.
- See you later, jess.

296
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,100
Hey.

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,100
What's up?

299
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,700
Nothin'. You're, just...

300
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,200
you're a really good swimmer.

301
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,800
Thanks.

302
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,000
You staying here?

303
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,100
No.

304
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I just like the pool.

305
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Have you been in yet?

306
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,100
No.

307
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm more of an ocean guy.

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,300
Chlorine kinda bugs me.

309
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,600
We're kind of far from the ocean here, aren't we?

310
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Yeah.

311
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
I live down south,

312
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,700
like the homestead area.

313
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,800
My aunt lives there.

314
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,600
Yeah?
- Yeah.

315
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,100
My family and i got stuck down there during the hurricane.

316
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,900
It was crazy.

317
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,700
Yeah.

318
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,300
Look like you got through it okay.

319
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,400
What's your name?

320
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,200
Jesse.

321
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm emily.

322
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,700
Hi. Good to meet you.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,100
So was that your girlfriend?

324
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
My girlfriend?

325
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,000
The brunette?

326
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,000
The brunette.

327
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,500
What, the little one?

328
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,900
No, the big one.

329
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
No, that's...

330
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,900
that's my dad's wife.

331
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,900
Oh.

332
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,800
I thought she was your girlfriend.

333
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,600
She doesn't look much older than you.

334
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,600
Well, she's not.

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Well, where did she go?

336
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,900
She went shopping with my little sister.

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,600
Hmm.

338
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Do you have a room here?

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,600
Yeah.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
We're staying here.

341
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Does it have a bathtub?

342
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,100
Yeah, i'm pretty sure it does.

343
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,600
Why?

344
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
I just can't believe she reacted that way.

345
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,900
Well, how did you think she was gonna react?

346
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,300
You just told her that she's the bride of frankenstein

347
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,300
and that you're gonna take her children away, russ.

348
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,300
What are you looking for?

349
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,500
An old phone book.

350
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,900
Russell, when are we gonna tell the world

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,800
what's going on down here?

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,300
When i know it's not gonna hurt my kids.

353
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,500
Your kids are outta town.

354
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,500
Their mother's not.

355
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,300
Wait, what?

356
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,000
You're protecting mariel?

357
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
She's the mother of my children, dave.

358
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>She was the mother of your children.</i>

359
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
If i can find a way to stop this without destroying her,

360
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,700
that's what i'm gonna do.

361
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,100
She might destroy herself.

362
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,300
Healy said that the cubans and brazilians, these hybrids,

363
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,100
- they were killing themselves and their children.
- And would you just stop calling them hybrids?!

364
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,800
Why?That's what they are, russ.

365
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,700
Okay.

366
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,700
Damn it.

367
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,100
What about the other mother of your children?

368
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,100
Have you talked to her lately?

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,500
No.

370
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,500
Well, do you think maybe you oughta give her a call?

371
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,500
Not yet.

372
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,100
Why not?

373
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,300
Because i don't know what to say.

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,400
"Sorry, honey, but you know this perfect, little town

375
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,900
"i asked you to spend the rest of your life in,

376
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,500
"well, it's been overrun by aliens

377
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,300
"and one of them happens to be my ex-wife"?

378
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,700
And the sheriff and e head of the news station...

379
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,500
and the priest.

380
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
He's the guy i need to talk to.

381
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,500
Here, if larkin radios,

382
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
just don't say anything about any of this, okay?

383
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,500
Tell her to stay put and i'll be in touch.

384
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,100
Where are you going?

385
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,500
To see the priest.

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,600
Russell!

387
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,900
how did this happen?

388
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,200
He wanted to take his wife home and our group wouldn't let him.

389
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,500
So they did this?

390
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,300
I think they liked it.

391
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,500
<i>Mariel, uh,</i>

392
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,700
i believe you called me down here.

393
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400
What do you want, babe?

394
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,400
Answers.

395
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,800
I want to know exactly what happened to me the night of the hurricane.

396
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,400
If you care about our marriage,

397
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
you'll tell me everything you know.

398
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Who have you been talking to?

399
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,500
That doesn't matter.

400
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,500
I want the truth.

401
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know everything.

402
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,600
But you know more than what you've told me.

403
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,200
If i've ever withheld anything from you, it's because...

404
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,900
i love you.

405
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,800
Well, why don't you try giving me a little less love

406
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,800
and a lot more truth,

407
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,200
and we'll see where we land?

408
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Tell me what happened the night of the hurricane.

409
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,300
I'll do better than that.

410
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,300
I'll show you.

411
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,700
sorry about this mess.

412
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,500
It's okay.

413
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Nice.

414
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,800
Uh-huh.

415
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
It's a quality tile.

416
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,100
So, wanna take a bath?

417
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,600
What, together?

418
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,900
There's no chlorine.

419
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,600
I don't know.Maybe we should watch tv first or something...

420
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,400
what? The electricity's out at home

421
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,400
and i don't get to watch it that much.

422
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,900
Oh! sorry.

423
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Larkin and her porn.

424
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,200
So how come you don't want to take a bath?

425
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,500
'Cause i don't know.

426
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't really know you.

427
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Do you ever really know anybody?

428
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,200
Yeah.

429
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,500
Who do you think you know?

430
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,700
My family, mom, dad.

431
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,300
Bet you're wrong.

432
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,800
Bet you don't know 'em at all.

433
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,900
Whoa. You're weird.

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,700
So they tell me.

435
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
What, do you always walk over to strange guys

436
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,600
and ask them if they want to take baths?

437
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
No, they usually ask me.

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Where do you live, emily?

439
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,500
I was in gainesville,

440
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,300
t not anymore.

441
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,800
You go to school there?

442
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,500
Mm-hmm.

443
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,400
U.f. I was a gator girl,

444
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,000
a phi gamma gator girl.

445
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,800
Cool.

446
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,200
You graduate?

447
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,400
Come on, jesse,

448
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,100
if you're not getting in, i am.

449
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
lewis?

450
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,900
Um, i'm finished.

451
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay.

452
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,200
You all right?

453
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,200
Yeah.

454
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,400
I just, uh...

455
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,900
i thini should sit down.

456
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,300
thanks.

457
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,100
Yeah, you probably shouldn't be walking around by yourself.

458
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,100
I guess not.

459
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,900
Whew. Wow.

460
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,300
- Crazy couple days...
- yeah.

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But i guess we've all been tested, huh?

462
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,200
what?

463
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,400
You lost your mom when you were a litt girl, didn't you?

464
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,200
Yeah.

465
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,800
Must have really tested your faith when you lost her.

466
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,700
Faith in what?

467
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,300
God?

468
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,100
You believe in god,don't you?

469
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
Um, i guess.

470
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I mean, i believe there is something bigger than us.

471
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,600
Shoot, trees are bigger than us,

472
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,100
but god's who lives in your heart.

473
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,200
God gives you the courage to face each day.

474
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,000
God... god is everything.

475
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm sure your dad taught you that.

476
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,700
Actually,i think he'd rather have people believe he was everything.

477
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,900
Oh, no, don't say that.

478
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,700
Kira, wait a minute.

479
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,000
I know your father is a man of faith.

480
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,500
He's counseled me so many times.

481
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,300
About what?

482
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,100
Um, my life,

483
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
choices i've made.

484
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,600
Yeah, well, he doe"t talk to me much about anything,

485
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,200
so, uh,

486
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,100
for all i know,

487
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
he could be the dalai lama.

488
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
The dalai lama's a buddhist.

489
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,100
Whatever.

490
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,800
Oh, no, no.

491
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,600
I could never follow someone that didn't have a deep faith.

492
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,700
It would go against everything i...

493
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,400
oh, lord.

494
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,200
What... what is it?

495
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,600
Um...

496
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,700
i think i should go now.

497
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,700
Why?

498
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,600
I just think i need some time by myself.

499
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm a little confused right now.

500
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,600
Do you want me to leave?

501
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
No, no.

502
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,700
It's not about you.

503
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,900
It's just, uh, um,

504
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,000
i don't know who i am right now.

505
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,100
Yeah.

506
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,900
Yeah, i don't know who i am.

507
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,100
I've lost my way, kira.

508
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,200
- I've been following a blind man.
- Lewis...

509
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,000
uh...

510
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,000
i'm sorry.

511
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm sorry that you he to see me like this.

512
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,500
It's all right.

513
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
I've sinned, kira.

514
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,900
I've committed a terrible sin.

515
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
God gave me the most beautiful gift

516
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,400
and i threw it away.

517
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,500
May i...

518
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,000
confess my sins to you?

519
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,900
father?

520
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,100
Russell.

521
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,600
We, uh,

522
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,300
we had an incident this morning.

523
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,000
I heard.

524
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,400
What can i do for you?

525
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
I wanted to talk to you about your church group...

526
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,900
these survivors.

527
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,200
Oh, it's not affiliated with the church.

528
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
It's something separate.

529
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,500
You meet at the church.

530
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,100
Only because it's convenient.

531
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,200
Fact is our meetings are getting so big,

532
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,200
we may have to move.

533
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
Are you thinking about joining us?

534
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,600
I'm not sure that i'm qualified.

535
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Does what happened this morning concern you?

536
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,500
Of course.

537
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, why do you think it happened?

538
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't know.

539
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,500
Father, you know mariel and i have two children.

540
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,300
I need to know if they're safe in her home,

541
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
with tom, with her.

542
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,400
Are they safe?

543
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,500
You saw what happened out there this morning.

544
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,200
Mariel saw it, too.

545
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,100
Why didn't anyone do anything to stop it?

546
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,800
She did.

547
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,500
Mariel protected the man.

548
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,100
I...

549
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,100
and the others...

550
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,300
we all just watched...

551
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,500
but she...

552
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
she protected him.

553
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,600
i couldn't have walked all this way by myself in the storm.

554
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,200
You weren't by yourself.

555
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,100
You re with me.

556
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,000
How did i end up with you?

557
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,300
The last thing i remember was leaving russell's house to go looking for rose.

558
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,100
I called you in your car.

559
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,100
I told you to meet me up by the main road,

560
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
by the melaleuca trees.

561
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,700
Why?

562
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,000
I wanted to show you something.

563
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,800
The last thing i remember when my plane went down

564
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,800
were the lights...

565
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,400
orange lights in the water.

566
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
For a long time, i thought maybe it was burning fuel,

567
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,800
but i was wrong because the night of the hurricane,

568
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,100
i saw those same lights right here in the sky...

569
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,400
and i wanted you to see them, too.

570
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,500
What are they?

571
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,200
I don't know.

572
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,800
Have they done something to us?

573
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,900
Kept us alive,

574
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,500
as far as i can tell,

575
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,600
made us stronger.

576
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,300
We came right down here in this raging storm,

577
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,500
and we saw those lights...

578
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,300
come right down into the water,

579
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,300
and one minute, you're by my side,

580
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
and the next minute, you're not.

581
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,000
And you just let this happen to me?

582
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,300
There was nothing i could do.

583
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,200
I wanted to stop it, but i couldn't.

584
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,900
I couldn't.

585
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,100
I don't believe you.

586
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,000
I don't believe...

587
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,000
you wanted to stop it and you couldn't.

588
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,400
What i wanted was to trust you.

589
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,700
I wanted to be...

590
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
your wife and a good mother to jesse and rose,

591
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,900
and you have taken that away from me.

592
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,900
- No, i haven't.
- Yes, you have!

593
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,600
No, i haven't.

594
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
Yes, you have!You did this to me.

595
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,400
Mariel...

596
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,700
whatever is happening to me,

597
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
i am gonna fight it.

598
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,600
I swear,

599
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
you are not gonna do this to me, tom.

600
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,300
I'm leaving.

601
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,200
You can't leave.

602
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,200
I'm leaving.

603
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,100
You can't leave me now!

604
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,700
Damn.

605
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,100
Are you kidding me right now?

606
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
How do youo that?

607
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,700
I don't know,

608
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,200
but i think i'm ready for the olympics.

609
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
God, you're so...

610
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,400
- weird.
- Weird.

611
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,700
Yeah.

612
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,700
But weird's cool.

613
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm cool with weird.

614
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
Thanks for coming in with me, jesse.

615
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,700
Yeah, it's no problem.

616
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,700
Have you ever been with a girl before?

617
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,900
I mean, like this?

618
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,700
Unh-unh.

619
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
Have you ever been with a girl at all?

620
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, sure.

621
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,400
I've walked and i've talked with 'em,

622
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,100
but i've never been naked in a bathtub with them.

623
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,800
It's fun, right?

624
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,800
Yeah.

625
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,700
Huge fan, huge fan.

626
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,600
A few weeks ago,

627
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,500
none of the people i used to hang out with

628
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
wanted to be my friends anymore.

629
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,400
You know sororities,

630
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,400
they can be so cliquey anyways, you know?

631
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,600
I mean, their whole thing is based on "us" and "them,"

632
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,700
so if you change,

633
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,300
you're no longer an "us," you're "them. "

634
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Yeah.

635
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,200
I've never really felt like an "us. "

636
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:23,800
I've...

637
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,800
pretty much always been a "them. "

638
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,200
Nice to meet you.

639
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,000
jesse?

640
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, god.

641
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,300
Jesse, you in there?

642
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,400
Hey, uh,

643
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,700
can you go out this way?

644
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,500
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

645
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,000
- Thanks.
- Are you gonna be okay?

646
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

647
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,800
Thank you.

648
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,000
For what?

649
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,300
For being a "them. "

650
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:58,900
Okay.

651
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,100
I'm comin'!

652
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,800
What are you doing in there?

653
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,100
Hey, guys.

654
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,900
What were you doing?

655
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,400
Takin' a bath.

656
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,300
I like baths.

657
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,000
And you wouldn't get in the pool with me?

658
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,800
Nope.

659
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
I hate chlorine.

660
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,600
Mariel?

661
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,200
Mariel?

662
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,000
Lewis?

663
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,300
Lewis?!

664
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,500
Kira, where is everyone?

665
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,800
Who's "everyone"?

666
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,400
Your stepmother, lewis?

667
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,500
Um, i haven't seen mariel,

668
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,900
but, uh, lewis left.

669
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,900
Left for where?

670
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,000
He didn't say.

671
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
You were supposed to be looking after him.

672
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
<i>I did look after him.</i>

673
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,300
I listened to his confession.

674
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,700
You what?

675
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,300
Yeah.

676
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,900
He told me the story of abraham and isaac.

677
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,700
Have you ever heard it?

678
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,900
As a test of faith,

679
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,500
god asks abraham to sacrifice his only child,

680
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,100
but in the end,

681
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
god spares the kid

682
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
because his father had so much faith.

683
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,700
I think lewis thought you were like abraham, dad,

684
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,400
and then he found out you were just a guy.

685
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,700
I mean, he lost it.

686
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,100
I don't know what happened,

687
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,800
but he's lost his faith in you.

688
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,800
Oh, god.

689
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,700
Ted, come in.

690
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,200
Ted, are you there?

691
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,400
yeah, tom, what's up?

692
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,300
You know that thing we were talking about?

693
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,700
I'm ready.

694
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,000
Roger that.

695
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,100
She'll be waitin'.

696
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,100
Mariel?

697
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,500
Mariel.

698
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,800
Mariel.

699
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,700
Rose needs this for her cat.

700
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,700
Are you planning a trip?

701
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,000
Are the kids back yet?

702
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,500
No.

703
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,200
Are they going to be?

704
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,200
Not today.

705
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
Don't touch me!

706
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,500
Hey, listen to me,

707
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,200
listen to me.

708
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,900
- Hey!
- Don't!

709
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,200
- I know how hard this must be for you.
- No, you don't!

710
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,500
- Yes, i do, mariel!
- No, you don't!

711
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,800
I want to help you!

712
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,000
You want to take our children away from me.

713
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
You actually think i would hurt them?

714
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,100
Whatever has happened to me,

715
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,300
part of me is still here,

716
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,400
the part of me that loves my kids,

717
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,800
the part of me that once loved you is still here.

718
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,800
Hey, where you been?

719
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,300
I didn't, uh,

720
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,500
i didn't know what to do with the skeleton in there,

721
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,900
so i wrapped it up and put it in my crawlspace.

722
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,500
Is that okay?

723
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,600
Well, you know, maybe we should bury it.

724
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Bury it?

725
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
That's the only proof we have that underlay's a...

726
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,500
that underlay's not what he says he is.

727
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,400
Right now, i'm not even sure what that means, dave.

728
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,400
<i>*... use myself a beautiful dream *</i>

729
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,300
surprise.

730
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,400
What are you doing here?

731
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,500
We came home early.

732
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,900
I don't think that place ias cool as you remember it, honey.

733
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Where are the kids?

734
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,700
I just dropped them off at mariel's.

735
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,100
Tom called,

736
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,100
said they have plans.

737
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,700
What?

738
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,000
No.

739
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,600
