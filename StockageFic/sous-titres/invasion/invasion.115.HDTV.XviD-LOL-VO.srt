Previously on "Invasion"...

2
00:00:01,348 --> 00:00:03,088
Is this your baby?
No.

3
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:04,918
Why did you kill your mother-in-law?

4
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,567
If she wanted the baby,
she could have had it.

5
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:09,752
She was forcing it on me.

6
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:11,545
What really happened to you
that night in the water?

7
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:12,368
Do you know?

8
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,351
Well, you have children, too,

9
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:15,595
don't you think you, at least,
owe it to them to find out?

10
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:17,420
I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.

11
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,420
She's not your type.

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,233
What does he know?

13
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,681
You have a lot to learn.

14
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:22,485
There's a little work camp
down in the glades.

15
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,798
I'm gonna send you there
for a while, all right?

16
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:27,021
I think you're in a lot of denial.

17
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:29,551
You're just trying to control everything,

18
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:32,382
trying to manage everyone, but you can't.

19
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:34,619
You bastard!

20
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,752
So you two work everything out?

21
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,280
She's a very special girl, sir.

22
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:39,219
Yes, she is. She's also a very young girl.

23
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,430
In many ways, she's a very naive girl.

24
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,860
What happens in the water?

25
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:44,212
I don't know.

26
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:45,936
Why hasn't it happened to me?

27
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,677
Welcome to camp, darlin'.

28
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:49,689
You're on the island of misfit toys, honey.

29
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,543
Once we go through basic training,

30
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,513
I'm comin' back with a vengeance.

35
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:17,779
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

36
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,480
Stevie caught me sneaking out
of the bunkhouse.

37
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,901
The current's moving north.

38
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,851
If we leave now, we could be home
by morning.

39
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:25,132
Who wants to go home?

40
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,737
Me.

41
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,834
I hate this place.

42
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,326
I feel like a prisoner.

43
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:32,210
Oh, come on.

44
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:35,300
It's just temporary until the sheriff says
we're ready to go back.

45
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,555
Back for what?

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,611
They keep telling us how special we are

47
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,524
and how we have to function as a team.

48
00:01:41,525 --> 00:01:42,847
A team for what?

49
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,223
What is the big plan?

50
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,174
Survival.

51
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:55,155
But if our bodies...

52
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:58,629
if they really are different...

53
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,191
uh-huh, they are.

54
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,658
Then there has to be a purpose.

55
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,240
Why won't they tell us our purpose?

56
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:09,178
What the hell do you think you're doing?

57
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,449
Damn you, stevie, you got no right
tellin' us what to do.

58
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,440
They aren't my rules, Derek,
they're szura's!

59
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:14,649
Szura's in charge!

60
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:17,268
Whatever he says goes-

61
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:24,533
- What'd you do that for?
- 'Cause I'm tired of this crap.

62
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,529
He look's bad, chris.

63
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,534
It's his fault.

64
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:28,805
Dumb ass.

65
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,350
Someone's been telling me
what to do all my life.

66
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:35,969
No more. No more.

67
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:37,688
I'm gettin' out of here.

68
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,168
Chris, wait for me.

69
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,792
Wait for me, chris!

70
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,229
Were you just planning on never talking
to me again?

71
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:00,633
Kira...

72
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,769
I called you ten times tonight.

73
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:04,729
I know. I'm sorry.

74
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,952
I just-things are kinda crazy right now.

75
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:11,087
Crazy because my father told you
to stay away from me?

76
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,229
I just came from the water, lewis.

77
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:18,203
I almost went in.

78
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,001
I still may.

79
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:22,559
I don't think
you oughta do that.

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,356
Why not?

81
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,210
What is this big secret
that everybody's keeping?

82
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:29,562
You, my dad, my stepmother,

83
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:31,419
you all went into the water
and came out different.

84
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,655
Yeah, but I don't think
that's such a good thing.

85
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,991
It kinda messed me up.

86
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,796
But it's something that you share...

87
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,534
that you all share together
that makes you closer.

88
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,265
I just want to know what that feels like.

89
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:48,256
Will you come in the water with me?

90
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:51,762
And you can just watch
and let me know what happens.

91
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,411
No.

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,314
But I want it so bad, lewis.

93
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:02,243
I just don't want to do it alone. Please.

94
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,141
Please.

95
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:10,835
I can't.

96
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,794
I'm sorry, kira.

97
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,572
You're not my friend.

98
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,852
You're not my friend!

99
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:48,977
Daddy?

100
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,034
Hey, what are you doing up?

101
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:53,841
I couldn't sleep.

102
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,740
What are you doing?

103
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:57,357
Nothing.

104
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,629
Are you looking for monsters?

105
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,093
No, honey.

106
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,271
There's no monsters.

107
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,531
It's okay. I'm not afraid,

108
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,718
as long as they stay in the water.

109
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:13,029
I offered to put her to bed,
but she wanted you.

110
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,967
Oh, it's okay.

111
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:15,484
Hey, dad,

112
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,720
if I'm gonna be living here full-time now,

113
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,675
can I get a phone in my room, like at mom's?

114
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:22,148
Uh, you know what?
Can we talk about this in a second?

115
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:24,728
All right.

116
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,099
Do you brush your teeth?

117
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,724
Yep.

118
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,870
All right. Say good night to your brother.

119
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,842
- Night, Jess!
- Night, Rose!

120
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:36,244
- Good night, Rosie.
- Good night, Larkin.

121
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:39,767
Can we call mommy?

122
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,130
Um, you know, I think she's still at work.

123
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,499
I miss her.

124
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:48,711
Ohh, I know, honey.

125
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,700
I liked it better when I lived at her house,
too,

126
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,133
when we shared.

127
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:59,836
Why doesn't she want us there anymore, dad?

128
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,081
She does.

129
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:02,838
She loves you very much.

130
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,787
Then why aren't we there?

131
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,437
I have to tell them the truth.

132
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,307
I can't keep dodging
their questions.

133
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,178
They miss their mother.

134
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,963
They don't understand why they're not with her anymore.

135
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:18,584
Well, what can you say?

136
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,725
"Sorry, kids, but mom has been cloned

137
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:22,638
"by alien light creatures,

138
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,062
think she might try to kill you"?

139
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,130
I don't know.

140
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:28,964
Maybe I could just tell them that she's sick.

141
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,151
You know, she...

142
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,657
she got infected by something.

143
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:36,381
I think that would just scare them.

144
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,782
I think the truth would scare them even more.

145
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,553
Yeah, well, we don't even know what the truth is.

146
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:46,317
You know...

147
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:48,823
Mariel's a doctor.

148
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,198
Has she ever run any tests on herself?

149
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,278
I don't know.

150
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:55,302
I think you should insist that she have some tests run

151
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,101
so we can at least know what we're dealing with here.

152
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:59,280
Where, at the hospital?

153
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,806
That'll raise too many questions.

154
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:03,503
You could have her come to your station.

155
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:04,496
You could do it.

156
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,380
You wouldn't have a problem with that?

157
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:14,454
Oh, honey. It's okay. I've accepted my new jean size,

158
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,106
and I'm feeling much more secure.

159
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,573
You can hang out with your ex-wife as long as you want to,

160
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,578
just so long as you come home to me.

161
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:30,278
And me.

162
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,988
Excuse me. Hey, baby.

163
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:50,727
No breakfast?

164
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:52,710
Nobody called me.

165
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:55,911
Well, we don't usually hand out formal invitations.

166
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:57,654
You know, you pop down to the kitchen, pull up a-

167
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,599
you told lewis not to talk to me anymore, didn't you?

168
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:02,524
No, I-I mentioned that you were 17.

169
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:04,393
I'm not looking to date him, dad,

170
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,201
and I don't really think that's the issue, anyway.

171
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:08,733
I mean, Derek was my age,

172
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,096
and as soon as he came back from the water,

173
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:12,871
you told him to stay away from me. Why?

174
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,108
Because I knew...

175
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,555
he'd never be right for you.

176
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,428
Because he'd been changed, like you, like Mariel,

177
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:22,934
like half this town, for all I know.

178
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,843
Kira, kira.

179
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,048
You are perfect the way you are.

180
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:27,742
No, I'm not.

181
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:32,580
Kira, come here.

182
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,124
Russell, I can't come there now.

183
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,463
Because I'm on my way to work.

184
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,117
I understand the kids have questions, but-

185
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,524
kira, wait, I want to talk to you.

186
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,502
Of course I care.

187
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:43,603
I'm just-

188
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:45,769
listen-Mariel, would you talk to her, please? Kira!

189
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,501
Derek.

190
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,251
Well, hey, there, girlfriend.

191
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:04,907
What's up?

192
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:08,247
Christina, this is kira.

193
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,910
oh, this is gonna be fun.

194
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,261
There's no sign of her out here, lewis.

195
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,571
Check logan's bay and I'm gonna head up the coast a bit,

196
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:29,165
then I'll meet you back at the station, all right?

197
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,897
roger that, sir.

198
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,349
the sheriff is your daddy?

199
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,190
Oh, if I'd have known you were banging her,

200
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:36,858
I would have gotten us off that island a week ago.

201
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:37,579
Yeah, right.

202
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,255
Ooh, could I borrow your hoodie?

203
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,253
Where have you been?

204
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,428
Uh... just away.

205
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,046
Away where?

206
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:48,684
Derek was a bad boy and your daddy sent him

207
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,453
to devil's island, and that's where he met me.

208
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,250
And who are you?

209
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:54,803
Christina.

210
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:57,028
He calls me "Chrissie. "
Isn't that sweet?

211
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,545
So what were you doing in the water, daddy's girl?

212
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,123
My name's kira.

213
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,740
Okay.

214
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,716
I wanted to know what was out there.

215
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:08,654
Besides us?

216
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:12,589
- You got a car?
- Yeah.

217
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,418
Where?

218
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:15,187
Up there.

219
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:17,288
I didn't want my dad to know I was here.

220
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,103
Good thinking.

221
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,001
Well, kira...

222
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:25,914
we could use a ride,

223
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:27,859
and you look like you could use some fun.

224
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,701
Um, yeah, we-we can't go anywhere with her.

225
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:31,439
Why not?

226
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,725
Uh, because if her dad finds out-

227
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,470
and what is he gonna do, arrest us?

228
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,177
Not if he wants to keep his little operation on the downlow.

229
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:40,121
But he could send us back, chris.

230
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,020
Maybe not...

231
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,834
not if we have kira here to protect us.

232
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,160
You really want to know what "different" means?

233
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:52,320
Yes.

234
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,109
Then stick with us.

235
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,584
We'll give you the whole show.

236
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,067
Derek, we could use some clothes.

237
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,504
How about you take us girls shopping?

238
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:03,686
What do you think, kira, little shop-a-thon to kick the day off?

239
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:05,688
All right.

240
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:08,572
All right! Two hungry shoppers, ready to roll.

241
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:29,713
I, um...

242
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,342
I called the hospital and told them
that I'd be in after lunch.

243
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:35,944
I thought about what you said on the phone,

244
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:37,838
and maybe this is a good idea.

245
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,508
I'm glad you changed your mind.

246
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:41,416
What do you want to do?

247
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:45,042
Well, I think we should start with blood work.

248
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,979
I know when jesse was at the hospital,

249
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,049
there was some confusion in the lab about your blood.

250
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,696
Mm-hmm, well, there's no confusion now.

251
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:51,966
It's definitely changed.

252
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,394
It has much higher levels of hemoglobin.

253
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,790
I think that's why I can stay underwater for so long.

254
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,950
I didn't know that you could.

255
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:03,834
But none of this is really what you're concerned about, is it?

256
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,105
You want to know if there's something inside me

257
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:08,410
that's gonna hurt our kids.

258
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,153
I just think we owe them an explanation

259
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,631
as to why they're not with you anymore,

260
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:14,305
and since we don't have all the answers yet...

261
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:17,167
I don't want them to be afraid of me, russell.

262
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:18,739
Are you afraid of what we'll find?

263
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:20,869
M aybe.

264
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:29,481
What is that?

265
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,822
That is part of one of the light creatures from the water.

266
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,575
I pulled it out of a dead alligator.

267
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:39,369
It's got human D.N.A.

268
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:43,659
I was hoping to compare its tissue with yours.

269
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,055
Wow.

270
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:53,893
All right.

271
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:03,157
Oh, my god, this is cute.

272
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:09,401
God, do you believe what they charge for these things?

273
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:13,314
- Hell, they make 'em for a nickel in china.
- That's why I never shop here.

274
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,804
- It's way overpriced.
- Seems almost illegal.

275
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:23,920
I like that one...

276
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,454
for you.

277
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,782
hey, maybe next time,
you can put it in my pants.

278
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:34,509
Shut up.

279
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:37,982
Hey, what are you doing?

280
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,444
What are you, a size 2

281
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:46,890
I love this.

282
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:50,025
there.

283
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,869
Now we can be twins.

284
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,531
They're not gonna let him out of here like that.

285
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,521
Sheriff's daughter.

286
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,568
I bet you've had to be a good girl all your life.

287
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:00,758
Come on.

288
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:02,576
It's fun...

289
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:05,692
and that's a big part of being different, kira,

290
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,171
having fun.

291
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,764
Look, my buddy actually told me that they order extra crap

292
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:15,729
because they know it's gonna get jacked.

293
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:17,904
It's kind of expected.

294
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:18,516
Right.

295
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,780
It's like company policy.

296
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,303
that's cute, that's cute.

297
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:37,211
I like that.

298
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,817
There... it feels good, doesn't it?

299
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:50,968
Yeah, actually, it kinda does.

300
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,570
I used to beg my husband to take me to places like this,

301
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:55,862
but he never would.

302
00:15:56,526 --> 00:15:59,178
He just wanted to lock me in the double wide and make babies.

303
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:00,917
Wait, you're married?

304
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,433
Not anymore.

305
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,627
Any news about your daughter, sir?

306
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:15,475
No.

307
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:18,652
When was the last time you saw kira?

308
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,209
Last night.

309
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,068
She came here to talk to me.

310
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,794
She was upset 'cause I haven't returned any of her phone calls.

311
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,388
I hope none of this is happening because of me.

312
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:30,749
She can't be like us.

313
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,131
She can never be like us.

314
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,292
I wish she could.

315
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,079
Have you ever really talked to her, sir?

316
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,922
I mean, about your experience, after the plane crash?

317
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,599
I- I know she was really young,

318
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,354
but I think one of her problems is that

319
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,223
she doesn't feel like she knows you.

320
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:56,985
You're her dad, and she doesn't know you.

321
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,848
That's gotta be painful for her.

322
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:10,097
What do you got?

323
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:13,891
Yeah, put her through, put her through.

324
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:15,016
Someone's seen her.

325
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,237
Hey, Ellen, what's up?

326
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:17,794
You saw kira?

327
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:20,699
With who?

328
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:23,517
You are gonna love this place,

329
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:25,753
beach action right on the sand.

330
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:27,908
Oh, shoot.

331
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,933
My friend forgot to leave me the key.

332
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,566
Doesn't look like anyone else is here.

333
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:35,153
Derek, do you think you could break this little window?

334
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,233
Break it?

335
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,715
Oh, sure.
We'll get it fixed.

336
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,442
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

337
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,434
- Who is this guy?
- Oh, he's just a friend of mine.

338
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:43,483
He's out of town right now.

339
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:44,992
Does he know you're coming?

340
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:47,063
Sure, he lets me use his house all the time.

341
00:17:58,989 --> 00:17:59,853
Wow.

342
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:02,647
Yeah. It's nice, right?

343
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:04,621
What does this guy do?

344
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:05,464
Farmer.

345
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:06,671
A farmer?

346
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:10,676
Yeah, his family owns, like, 10,000 acres of avocado groves or something.

347
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,620
Derek, do you want to put some music on?

348
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:13,629
Yeah.

349
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,040
Who wants guacamole and margaritas?

350
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,205
Mmm. Me. Good.

351
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:28,921
Kira, do you want to try that dress on, see how it fits?

352
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:30,391
Okay.

353
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,087
Um, where's the bathroom?

354
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:36,399
Uh... right there.

355
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,882
do, uh... you really know who lives here?

356
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:53,762
Sure.

357
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:55,897
He's that fat son of a bitch

358
00:18:55,898 --> 00:19:00,912
I used to work for at the plant who used to pinch my ass all the time.

359
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:03,268
- So he doesn't know you're here?
- Hell, no.

360
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:06,467
- You always been like this?
- Like what?

361
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:09,608
- Insane?
- Never.

362
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,034
I used to be the perfect daughter.

363
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:17,289
I was the perfect wife and the perfect mother...

364
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,150
until I wasn't.

365
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:25,950
Do you have any idea where your baby is?

366
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:27,689
Nope.

367
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:30,311
And you're okay with that?

368
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,089
It wasn't my baby anymore, Derek.

369
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,159
When I came out of the water, my body was brand-new...

370
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:42,538
and much perkier,
I might add.

371
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:43,841
I agree.

372
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:50,905
oh, what the hell?

373
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:51,940
It's okay.

374
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,538
Mr. Moldiva.

375
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:55,069
Hey.

376
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,069
Do you remember me?

377
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,544
What the hell are you doin' in my house?

378
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,497
Christina, from the plant.

379
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:01,918
Yeah, this is my house!

380
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:05,761
I know. It's-it's really-

381
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:06,556
it's nice.

382
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:07,258
Yeah.

383
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,157
So...

384
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:09,717
what do you think?

385
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:12,081
Oh, my god!

386
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,101
What are you doing?!

387
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,562
Welcome home, mr. Moldiva.

388
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,220
Maybe you'll be nicer to your employees in the next life.

389
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:28,290
Christina...

390
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,259
so...

391
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,464
let's get this party started.

392
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,081
Tthe security guard was going to call the police,

393
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:42,846
but I told him I wanted to handle this personally.

394
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:44,543
I appreciate that, Ellen.

395
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,854
I recognize this boy.

396
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,612
I think heas in heather's science class,

397
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:51,144
but I don't know the girl.

398
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:57,046
Sir, isn't that the woman we arrested-

399
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,406
it's okay, lewis.

400
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,776
- I'm sorry to have to show you this.
- No, that's all right, Ellen.

401
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,671
- May I have that tape, please?
- Of course.

402
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:05,518
I'll make sure that I get it back to you,

403
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,630
and if there's any damage, of course-

404
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,812
I don't care about that.

405
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,529
- I'm just concerned about your daughter.
- Yeah, me, too. Thanks.

406
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,038
I'm certain I recognized that young woman, sir.

407
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:16,753
I'm gonna share something with you, lewis,

408
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,917
but you've gotta promise that it stays between us.

409
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:22,430
The girl you saw in the videotape
is the one who killed her mother-in-law,

410
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,464
and the boy is a kid named Derek culie.

411
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,261
He used to be a friend of kira's.

412
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:29,627
He started messing around with me,

413
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:32,526
so I sent him to a little work camp that I set up down in the keys.

414
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:36,428
It's a place for people like us
who've gone through a transformation,

415
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,138
but who haven't quite... adapted yet.

416
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:41,477
Did you send the girl there, too?

417
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:42,589
Christina Conrad?

418
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,155
Yeah.

419
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,748
I- I thought she was turned over to the F.B.I.

420
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,858
The law clearly states she s-

421
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:51,335
the law does not apply here, lewis,

422
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,536
because there's no precedent for our existence.

423
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:56,148
If I'd allowed that girl to enter the prison system,

424
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,480
the world would think that we all behaved like her,

425
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:03,096
and we'd be vilified, and I cannot let that happen.

426
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,259
I must protect my people.

427
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:12,623
And your daughter, sir, how do we protect her?

428
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:14,173
We find her.

429
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:21,505
baby, would you get me one of those limes?

430
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:23,751
We can't stay here, chris.

431
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:24,842
Why not?

432
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:26,200
Because that guy is dead.

433
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:28,771
Are you afraid he's gonna stink?

434
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:30,233
There's a swimming pool out back.

435
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:31,554
You should dump him in there.

436
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:32,877
Stop her.

437
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,288
You stop her.

438
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:39,322
- Sit down!
- I want to leave.

439
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:43,170
I said sit down!

440
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:48,396
Goddamn it! Look what you made me do!

441
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,168
- You're crazy.
- Right.

442
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:53,579
- Please just let me go.
- No.

443
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,229
Derek...

444
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,237
come on, Christina, she doesn't have to be here.

445
00:22:58,238 --> 00:22:59,648
Yes, she does.

446
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,036
I won't tell anyone what I saw, I promise.

447
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:04,542
I don't care if you tell anyone, dumb ass,

448
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:07,477
but I'm not goin' back to the island,

449
00:23:07,748 --> 00:23:10,142
and right now, you are all I have to trade

450
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,356
if your daddy becomes a problem.

451
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,203
Derek, will you please take mr. Moldiva out to the pool?

452
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,475
You want me to touch him?
I...

453
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,564
oh, my god.
Chris, he's dead.

454
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:28,629
You killed him.
He's dead.

455
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,657
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

456
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:34,609
I don't know.

457
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,401
She-she probably has a cell phone.

458
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:42,315
Just take it from her,

459
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:45,293
and don't you dare let her out of your sight. Ow.

460
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:46,791
Okay, okay, comen, come on.

461
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,952
Come on.

462
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:49,811
Get away from me! Ow!

463
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:55,519
Hey, chrissie?

464
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:57,261
Chrissie, you all right?

465
00:23:57,262 --> 00:23:58,702
<i>Get away!</i>

466
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,135
It's kinda like
freshman year at U.M.

467
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:39,090
Except is my blood we're testing,
not some poor lab rat's.

468
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:41,988
When was the last time you had your blood tested?

469
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,531
When tom was in the hospital

470
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:47,661
he needed blood, so I gave him mine.

471
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:51,429
How are things between the two of you now?

472
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:54,395
Better.

473
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:58,579
Things were pretty intense for a while,

474
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,922
but they've settled down...

475
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:02,362
for the moment.

476
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:06,477
Your white count's very high.

477
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:08,160
Lymphocyte count, too.

478
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:10,205
Is it higher than the last time you tested?

479
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:11,013
Yeah, much.

480
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:13,848
Could be an infection.

481
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:16,993
I don't have a fever.

482
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,015
Sed rate is 50.

483
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,130
Oh, my god.

484
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,165
After all I've been through, I'm sick now?

485
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,930
Look, this could be a lot of things.

486
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:40,052
Red cells have settled pretty fast.

487
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:44,414
I have felt...

488
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,810
a pressure in my abdomen lately.

489
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:51,846
It's not pain.

490
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,266
It's just pressure.

491
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,402
If I were the doctor treating this patient,

492
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,424
I would order an M.R.I.

493
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:02,849
Then that's what we'll do.

494
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,350
Where, at the hospital, the place where nobody's

495
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:09,796
supposed to know what happened to me?

496
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:10,736
We'll find a way.

497
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:19,298
Come on, Mariel.

498
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:22,312
We have to do this.

499
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:29,969
I just really don't need any more surprises right now.

500
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:36,746
The red cross guy who found Christina conrad after the hurricane

501
00:26:36,747 --> 00:26:39,132
said that she'd been wandering on the beach
near king's rock.

502
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:40,865
She'd gone to see some guy she used to work for,

503
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,465
but he wasn't home or he wouldn't let her in

504
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:44,521
or something, guy wasn't clear.

505
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:45,525
All right, when we get in the car,

506
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:47,401
I want you to find out the name of her former employer.

507
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:48,583
You think that's where she's at?

508
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,456
We all go back to the place we were born, lewis.

509
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,456
Hey, um, are you sure you don't want anything?

510
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,140
You know, anything at all?

511
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,278
My dad was right about you.

512
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:03,970
When he said he didn't want us hanging out anymore,

513
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,735
I thought it was because he thought you were too good for me

514
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:08,875
or something.

515
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,426
That's not it at all.

516
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:16,310
He was trying to protect me.

517
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,254
Look, kira, I didn't want any of this.

518
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:21,755
Then why don't you leave?

519
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:24,181
Right now, get up and walk out of here.

520
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:25,885
- I can't.
- Why not?

521
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,373
I- I don't know.

522
00:27:28,374 --> 00:27:29,966
She's a psychopath, Derek.

523
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,239
Was she like this before,

524
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,135
or is this something that happens to you in the water?

525
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:35,629
- I didn't know her before.
- Are you crazy now, too?

526
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,753
No, no. No.

527
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:39,281
It's not like that.

528
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,743
- Well, then, what is it like?
- I-I feel like myself, you know?

529
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:44,903
The way I was before, just...

530
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:47,315
more.

531
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,015
Okay, so then if she was a little unstable before,

532
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,878
she's a complete nut job now.

533
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:53,526
You shouldn't call her that.

534
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:56,401
Why are you sticking up for her?

535
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:02,270
I just feel this connection with Christina.

536
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,881
It's, like, very powerful,

537
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,755
like the way your dad feels about your stepmom.

538
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:09,363
You know, protective, that's-

539
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:11,092
that's how I feel about Christina.

540
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,906
Do you think she'd protect you?

541
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,260
No way.

542
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,181
I don't-I don't think...

543
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:20,305
Fine.

544
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,571
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

545
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:23,969
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

546
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,390
Damn it, kira, get back here.

547
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,293
You want to leave?
Okay, let's leave.

548
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:33,895
Derek, get her keys.

549
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:34,803
No...

550
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:36,712
scratch that.
We'll walk.

551
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,984
Where are we going?

552
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,923
To the beach.

553
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:44,078
We're going to do a little science experiment,

554
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:45,787
and if you try to run,

555
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:48,773
I will do to you what I did to him.

556
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:51,859
Derek, please stop this.

557
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,890
He can't.

558
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,411
He is my boyfriend now.

559
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:58,069
He'll do exactly what i want.

560
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,869
And what I want is to take kira for a swim.

561
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:03,983
How about that?

562
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:08,475
Kira, you said you wanted to know what was in the water.

563
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:22,500
We only have about an hour
before the tech gets back from dinner.

564
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,019
Okay.

565
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:46,613
You're gonna have to show me how to use this thing.

566
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:47,913
Pretty straightforward.

567
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:54,188
Once I'm down, just hit "rotate anterior,"

568
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:57,011
and that'll move the bed into the scanner...

569
00:29:58,435 --> 00:30:03,056
Then press "image," which will start the imaging process.

570
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:14,874
Ready.

571
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:16,629
Oh, my god.

572
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,637
Uh, 211, we're gonna need an ambulance at-

573
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,764
He's dead, lewis.

574
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:28,808
Call the coroner.

575
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,626
211, inform the coroner of a homicide at 2010 edgecliff.

576
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:47,156
The red cross guy said that Christina walked to this house

577
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,071
the morning they found her.

578
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,851
Yes, sir.

579
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:50,995
That means her birthplace must be somewhere down the beach.

580
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:53,130
Get the car, follow me on the sand!

581
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,303
It's a tumor.

582
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,253
Right there.

583
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:10,051
Well...

584
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:14,895
now I know why my blood count's so messed up.

585
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:17,989
Oh, my god.

586
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:21,767
We don't know that it's cancerous.

587
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,124
Hell, we don't even know that it's a tumor.

588
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,315
Everything in your body is completely different.

589
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:29,044
This-this could be something entirely new.

590
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,752
We're gonna have to take a needle biopsy,

591
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,971
which we can do in my office.

592
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:37,295
There's an ultrasound machine in emergency you can wheel in there.

593
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:39,373
I'm not gonna be able to handle the needle myself,

594
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:40,741
so if I talk you through it...

595
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:45,754
Sure.

596
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,437
How are we gonna tell the kids about this?

597
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,855
We could have gotten matching bathing suits,

598
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:09,729
but I think this is much more elegant, don't you?

599
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,562
I'm not going in.

600
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:15,186
Oh, yes, you are.

601
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:18,974
You see, we've only been told what happens.

602
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:21,435
We've never actually seen the process.

603
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,993
Besides, I thought this is what you wanted,

604
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,720
to be different.

605
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:29,071
It really doesn't hurt, kira.

606
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:30,640
Hold on.

607
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,977
I think this is the place.

608
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:39,954
Yeah. I think this is where it happened.

609
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:41,386
It's okay, kira.

610
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,656
This is a lot better than...

611
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:45,170
anything else.

612
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:49,711
And when we're done...

613
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,649
you can tell your daddy that you're just like him now.

614
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:58,413
I think he's gonna be so proud.

615
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:04,688
We've been told that you're supposed to see

616
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,733
some kind of orange light in the water.

617
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:10,702
It's supposed to be kind of pretty.

618
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:15,204
I don't have to be like you.

619
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:17,576
What?

620
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:21,611
Even if I'm changed, I don't have to be like you.

621
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:24,378
I won't be.

622
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:17,689
When we get a clear shot at the mass,

623
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,965
you should be able to guide the needle right into it.

624
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:22,990
You want cells from the periphery, right?

625
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:26,709
Yeah, but just make sure it's a good sample.

626
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:37,318
Russell...

627
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:40,310
if this biopsy shows that it's malignant,

628
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:41,914
I want you to take jesse and rose.

629
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:43,743
Hey, look, I don't want to talk about this right now.

630
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,496
Listen to me-I want you to take them,

631
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:48,351
and I want you to leave homestead.

632
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:51,124
Why?

633
00:35:53,658 --> 00:35:55,195
'Cause I don't want this to happen to them.

634
00:35:58,028 --> 00:35:59,882
Well, I don't know if it could, but regardless,

635
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:02,289
if you're sick, they're gonna want to be with you...

636
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:05,674
and so will I.

637
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:08,779
You're their mother.

638
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:17,782
Okay, just right here.

639
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,058
Okay. Listen, hey, try to relax.

640
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:23,413
With alligators, I'm pretty good,

641
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,730
but with ex-wives, I get a little shaky.

642
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:53,864
Where's my daughter?

643
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:56,282
We dropped her off in town.

644
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:57,413
No, you didn't.

645
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:58,478
No, you didn't.

646
00:36:58,992 --> 00:36:59,859
What are you doing?

647
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,000
Where is she?

648
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:01,893
Let go of her, man.

649
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:03,748
Where is she?!

650
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:06,426
She's still out there in the water,
come on, man!

651
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,492
Lewis, lewis, go!

652
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:09,883
You know, I never pegged you for stupid.

653
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,656
Reckless, maybe, trash, definitely,

654
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,780
but I thought you were way smarter than this.

655
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,691
You can't do anything to me.

656
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,801
No one can!

657
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:20,703
If any harm should come to my baby,

658
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:22,363
No!

659
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:25,628
- No, you're hurting her now!
- No, I'm not.

660
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:29,968
Sir, I found her!

661
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,199
What? What, baby?
Tell me!

662
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,641
I don't know.
It's happening again!

663
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:37,567
Tell me what's wrong. What?

664
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,635
Ow! I think I'm pregnant, you son of a bitch

665
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,415
Get me out of here, now!

666
00:37:42,742 --> 00:37:43,685
We need to get the car.

667
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:45,844
Kira...

668
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,748
all right, kira.
Come on.

669
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,276
Oh, god.
Oh, god, kira.

670
00:37:52,548 --> 00:37:53,954
Get up.
Come on, baby. It's okay.

671
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:55,376
It's okay. All right.

672
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:56,407
All right, here we go.

673
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:57,502
Here we go.

674
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,030
It's all right, baby.

675
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:01,279
It's okay. Here we go.

676
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:26,097
It's not cancer.

677
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:28,662
Those are eggs.

678
00:38:42,246 --> 00:38:43,340
This isn't a tumor.

679
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,551
It's like it's some kind of giant ovary.
