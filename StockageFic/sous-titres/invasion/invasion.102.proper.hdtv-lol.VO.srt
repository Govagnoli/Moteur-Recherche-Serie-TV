Previously on "Invasion"...

2
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:05,341
There's a huge storm coming,
and he's still not home.

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,310
How was I ever married to this person ?

4
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:08,977
As a storm gathers...

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,954
My pregnant wife shouldn't be covering hurricanes.

6
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:11,786
Talk to your brother ?

7
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:13,233
He's with your kids at the house.

8
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,220
- I've been through hurricanes before.
- Not like this one, you haven't.

9
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:17,438
These families prepare...

10
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,350
I have a right to know my children are safe.

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,450
They're our children !

12
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,850
Rose isn't here.

13
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,800
Rose !

14
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,407
Why don't you go home and
worry about your new husband

15
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:26,810
and leave us alone ?

16
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,653
But can this family survive...

17
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:31,441
Rose !

18
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:33,862
What lies ahead ?

19
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:35,611
Mariel ?

20
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:37,601
What's happening to me?

21
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,143
Did you see the lights ?

22
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:41,468
Where'd you see them ?

23
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:43,429
Will you tell me what's going on here ?

24
00:00:44,364 --> 00:00:45,099
Mommy ?

25
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:47,337
You smell different.

26
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:51,558
First days are the toughest.

27
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,287

31
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:28,463
Yeah ?

32
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,241
Hi, daddy.

33
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,664
Hey, honey.

34
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:33,071
What are you doing ?

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,662
Feeding carlita.

36
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:36,817
What are you doing ?

37
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,472
Nothing. I, um...

38
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,069
I'm just getting ready to go out back to work.

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,331
Mommy and daddy Tom aren't home yet,

40
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:47,701
and Kira and Jesse are making dinner.

41
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:49,380
So I thought I'd ask you.

42
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:51,037
Yeah, go ahead. Ask me what ?

43
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,204
Are there monsters ?

44
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:03,024
No.

45
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,462
Are you sure ?

46
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,576
'Cause you know those lights I saw in the sky

47
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:11,571
during the hurricane,
the ones that went into the water ?

48
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:12,421
Yeah ?

49
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,285
I thought they might be monsters.

50
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,304
They weren't monsters, Rose.

51
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,846
Then what were they ?

52
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,670
How do you explain the unexplainable ?

53
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:29,815
One family's devastated while
another gets through this without a scratch.

54
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,205
Hurricanes kind of havea mind of their own.

55
00:02:32,888 --> 00:02:34,692
We didn't ask to be hit this hard.

56
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,326
Frankly, we didn't expect to be.

57
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,205
But we're grateful the damage
is nothing like what we saw

58
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,578
with andrew back in '92.

59
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,054
Uh, Mr. Mayor, we heard rumors of a quarantine.

60
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,284
We're still working on all this.

61
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:46,741
Aside from the damage to the hospital,

62
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:50,555
we've received reports of chemical and fertilizer plants opening up

63
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:52,674
as well as contaminants found in the water supply.

64
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:55,177
Now when you consider that
we still have hundreds of people missing--

65
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:58,804
no one has authorized an actual quarantine yet--

66
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,190
just a few checkpoints here and there.

67
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:02,990
Russell ?

68
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:05,286
Yeah, Dave ?

69
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,833
Have you checked out that skeleton I found yet ?

70
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,436
I'm on my way to do it right now.

71
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,399
Oh, you moved it ?

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,500
No, I took your car.

73
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:12,842
Out into the hurricane slop.

74
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,074
Dave, who cares ?

75
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,807
I do, Russ.

76
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:16,915
It's a collectible.

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,352
Good-bye, Dave.

78
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:23,327
Would you support a quarantine, doctor ?

79
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,222
Doctor ?

80
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,431
I was the one who originally suggested it.

81
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:35,369
Sheriff, will your office be coordinating the relief effort--

82
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,877
search and rescue, military ?

83
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:38,686
Everyone will be working together on this,

84
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,294
but my office will run point, yes.

85
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:41,223
Over here.

86
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,123
So you'll be in charge ?

87
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,815
God's in charge. I just handle the paperwork.
Yeah ?

88
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,454
Sheriff, when can we expect to have
electricity and running water again ?

89
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:50,870
You'll be the first to know.

90
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,152
Hey, your dad likes being on tv, doesn't he ?

91
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:55,983
He always says, "presentation is everything."

92
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:58,803
Rose, do you want some more juice ?

93
00:03:58,804 --> 00:03:59,932
No, thanks.

94
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,305
Dr. Underlay,

95
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:04,544
We understand that you went through
quite an ordeal the night of the storm--

96
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,218
13 hours in biscayne bay ?

97
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:07,835
That's right.

98
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:08,800
How are you feeling ?

99
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,902
Under the circumstances, pretty fortunate.

100
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,197
Rose, aren't you hungry ?

101
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:13,744
I miss mommy.

102
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:16,996
She's right there, rose.

103
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,570
...operation center set up...

104
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,347
No. She's not.

105
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,440
Pretty scary night for you, too, sheriff.

106
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:26,661
Your wife's very lucky.

107
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,244
She's a survivor.

108
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:30,906
Dr. Underlay ?

109
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,524
- What is the extent of the damage in the hospital ?
- Larkin ! Larkin !

110
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,597
Stay back behind the yellow tape.

111
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,547
Dave, I'm working.

112
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,209
This quarantine will kill us.
We'll be completely cut off.

113
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,624
It hasn't even happened yet, okay ?

114
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,279
And even if it does, the hurricane relief groups
will still have access, all right?

115
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,716
The hurricane is not our problem.

116
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:51,950
Dave, you're my brother--

117
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,554
and I love you, but I am tired,

118
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,397
I'm pregnant, and you're medicated.

119
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:57,889
Will you please go back to your room ?

120
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,496
No.

121
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,950
Nurse, could you make sure he gets back to his room, please ?

122
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:01,672
You suck.

123
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:03,411
Russell will be here to pick you up in the morning.

124
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:04,621
Fight the power, Larkin.

125
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:06,833
Fight the power !

126
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:13,219
.. major roads and some major highways will have their lanes reversed

127
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,343
to handle the evacuation traffic.

128
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:18,222
State officials hope to avoid a repeat of the mess

129
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:21,242
that occurred with hurricane Floyd in 1999.

130
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:28,319
- You know his name ?
- No

131
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,430
- Any I.D. ?
- None that I could find.

132
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,479
- What was he doing at your place ?
- I have no idea.

133
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,300
Coming through ! Right over here.
Follow me. Come on.

134
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,027
Our temp E.R.Is right over here.

135
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:38,848
Coming through !

136
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:45,721
One, two, three.

137
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,178
How did this happen ?

138
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,749
Hey, Russell ?
Baby, you there ?

139
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:41,748
Hey, honey.

140
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:42,698
Where are you ?

141
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:43,823
I'm at the hospital.

142
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:45,258
Why ?

143
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:47,954
I just found some guy in my station who was...

144
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,810
who was cut up real bad.

145
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,180
Who is he ?
Is he gonna be okay ?

146
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm not sure.

147
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:54,335
Listen, is the generator in the shed ?

148
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:56,419
Don't...

149
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,223
- Don't go to the shed.
- Why not ?

150
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,840
Because it's dark down there.
I just don't want you by the water.

151
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,364
It's dark in the house.
I need power. I need to work.

152
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,489
Can you just grab a flashlight
and go in the bedroom ?

153
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,870
I'll be home as soon as I can.

154
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:10,839
Flashlight's not gonna run my computer.

155
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,516
- Why do you need your computer ?
- Why are you being so weird ?

156
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,939
No, no. I'm not being weird,
I'm just being protective.

157
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,112
Well, if you really want to be protective,

158
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,249
don't introduce my brother to any more alligators.

159
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:21,846
I gotta go, honey.

160
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:23,907
She still thinks I was attacked by a gator ?

161
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,131
- Let me see your leg, Dave.
- What for ?

162
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,261
- Just let me see it.
- Ow ! All right.

163
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:31,689
Okay, easy.

164
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,599
- Why haven't you told Larkin the truth yet ?
- I don't know what the truth is.

165
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,079
Yes--yes, you do.
I was attacked by an E.B.E--

166
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:43,748
- an extraterrestrial biological entity.
- We don't know that.

167
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,258
Oh, okay. I was sucked under water by a bright,

168
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,576
orange sea blob and had my flesh branded.

169
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:51,053
Yeah, that's more plausible,right ?

170
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,021
What ?

171
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,391
What, Russ ?

172
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,115
Let me see that.

173
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:12,615
Oh, man.

174
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:15,756
Who is this ?

175
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:17,374
It's a guy I found in my station today.

176
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,148
This guy has the exact same wounds as me.
He's been prodded.

177
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:22,564
This is definitely the work of an E.B.E., Russ.

178
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:25,473
- I could show you hundreds--
- I can show you hundreds of pictures of weird fish

179
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,795
being tossed up by a tsunami.

180
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:29,972
- It's not a f--
- Just because something's unfamiliar doesn't mean it's an alien.

181
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:33,710
Okay. So it was a fish that I found
wrapped around that skeleton ?

182
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:37,318
Were those just fins shooting through the guy's skull and rib cage ?

183
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:39,490
Taken the time to study that ?

184
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,796
I was going to, till I got a little way laid by a man bleeding to death.

185
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:47,836
What's a guy in a wet suit doing

186
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,696
swimming around the everglades in the middle of a hurricane ?

187
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:50,492
I don't know.

188
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,433
You'd better find out before
someone else decides to take a little dip.

189
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,285
You did really great out there.

190
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,128
No, I didn't.

191
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,129
I mean, I'm trying, but I really...

192
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,917
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here. Come here.

193
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:17,065
After what you've been through ?
You did great.

194
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:21,909
What's up ?

195
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,526
I think I lost my wedding ring in the storm.

196
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,216
I've looked everywhere for it.

197
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,500
We didn't lose you.

198
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,189
Hey, Russell ?

199
00:12:58,803 --> 00:12:59,725
Hey, Russell ?

200
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:01,997
Yeah, Dave ?

201
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,479
Hey. So what did you find out ?

202
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:06,422
- I haven't checked the skeleton yet.
- Why not ?

203
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:08,448
I'm trying to figure outwhat happened to the guy.

204
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,049
You know what happened to the guy.

205
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,578
He was attacked like me, like the skeleton.

206
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,024
Why are you in such denial here ?

207
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:15,577
Dave, you need to give me some time.

208
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,301
Yeah, while the mother ship is landing ?

209
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:18,924
Will you please just hurry up

210
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,174
and take a look at the damn thing ?

211
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:22,766
And try not to scratch my car.

212
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,431
We're gonna turn off the generator now.

213
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,847
And you got your flashlight and your water.

214
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,847
And we're gonna be right in the next room, okay ?

215
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,430
Why hasn't mommy called ?

216
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,650
Well, the phones are out, Rose.

217
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,263
She could call on the radio.

218
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,805
Even when she works late,
she always calls.

219
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:40,708
Yeah, I know. But it's different tonight.

220
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,125
Hurricanes make everything different.

221
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:45,211
I don't want things to be different.

222
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:48,769
Okay.

223
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:52,406
Hey, Kira ?

224
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:53,621
Okay.

225
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:57,329
Night, Rose.

226
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:01,323
Are you allergic to any medication ?

227
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:03,016
No.

228
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,307
Deep breath.

229
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,137
The nurse told me that I was in the water all night.
Is that true?

230
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,136
That's what I understand.

231
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:17,654
And again.

232
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,639
I hear you had a similar experience.

233
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:24,678
Yeah.

234
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:28,104
Guess we both must be pretty good swimmers, huh ?

235
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,416
Oh, well, that's just it--

236
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,198
I don't know how to swim.

237
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:40,353
Come on, bring it through !

238
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:41,937
All right.

239
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,383
Don't pitch that too close to the landing zone, boys !

240
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,448
We don't want the choppers giving us haircuts.

241
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,448
Sheriff,we've got U.S. 1 cleared,

242
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,247
and we're almost done with Krome avenue.

243
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,204
Good job, Lewis. Turnpike still closed ?

244
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:52,966
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:53,840
Keep it that way.

246
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,913
5-mile radius !

247
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,553
Tom ?

248
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:59,783
Hey, Russ. What brings you out of the jungle at this hour ?

249
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,578
Did you authorize the military to enter the park ?

250
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:03,074
Why would I do that ?

251
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:05,188
A military vehicle passed by my place tonight,

252
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,373
and I just found a guy out there that was pretty messed up--

253
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,006
Air Force. I found his dog tags.

254
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:10,344
I don't control the military, Russ.

255
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:10,905
Yeah, I know.

256
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,851
But you are working with them now, aren't you ?

257
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,875
The guy's name was Paxton.

258
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,432
He was in a wet suit when I found him.

259
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:20,911
- He was in a wet suit ?
- Yeah.

260
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,509
- Did he say anything ?
- He was unconscious.

261
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,177
Do you have any idea why he might have been out there ?

262
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:29,785
No.

263
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,588
Well, as soon as he's awake, I'm gonna talk to him.

264
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:37,690
- If you hear anything, let me know.
- Will do.

265
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:43,899
Lewis ?

266
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:45,104
Sir ?

267
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,718
Get General Dearing, Patrick Air Force base.

268
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:49,306
You got it.

269
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,184
Hey, Mrs. Varon.

270
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,349
Where have you been ?

271
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:46,023
Oh, missing you.

272
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,127
I see you went down to the shed.

273
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:52,834
So ?

274
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,156
Thought I told you not to.

275
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:57,771
Are you my boss or my husband ?

276
00:18:59,327 --> 00:18:59,950
Honey...

277
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:12,811
Baby ?

278
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,841
You stink.

279
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:17,844
Sorry.

280
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:20,397
No water, no shower.

281
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:21,945
Wrong.

282
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,070
How's our baby ?

283
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,429
Hungry.

284
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:39,881
Did you sleep okay ?

285
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,901
No. I was worried about you.

286
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:45,831
Why were you gone all night ?

287
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,251
Just following upon that guy I found.

288
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:50,602
Is he gonna be okay ?

289
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:52,542
I think.

290
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,270
I called the hospital a few hours ago,

291
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:57,084
and they said he was stabilized.

292
00:19:58,038 --> 00:19:59,595
Did you get in contact with his family ?

293
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,691
I tried, but the D.O.D. wouldn't tell me anything.

294
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:04,379
The D.O.D.?

295
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,275
He's in the Air Force.

296
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,336
Well, when I get into the office, I can check

297
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:15,078
and see if anything's come in over the wires about a missing airman.

298
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:18,846
What do you think happened to him, Russ ?

299
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,253
Baby ?

300
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:27,558
Guys.

301
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,126
Oh, boy.

302
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:33,074
You guys walked all the way from your mom's ?

303
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:34,898
Well, I carried her part of the way,

304
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,234
but she really wanted to see you.

305
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,002
Is that right ?

306
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,334
Really ? You miss your daddy, huh, Rose ?

307
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,202
Mommy didn't come home last night.

308
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:47,378
What ?

309
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,407
She's fine.

310
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,653
Tom called this morning and said
that they both just got caught up at work.

311
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,581
But she didn't call, so... it kind of sucks.

312
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:58,717
Well, to tell you the truth,

313
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:01,632
I didn't come home last night either.

314
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,706
But if you guys want to hang around today,

315
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:07,174
maybe tonight you can help daddy do some replanting.

316
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,716
Replanting what ?

317
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,348
These were all growing on the property.

318
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:15,246
But I brought them in before the hurricane
so they wouldn't get hurt.

319
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,071
- You remember what this one is ?
- Not really.

320
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:21,900
It's a Butterfly Orchid.

321
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,940
And this one, this one's called a Turk's Cap.

322
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:29,116
And that one over there, that's a little pond Apple tree.

323
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:32,813
That's gonna grow up to be a very, very bigpond Apple tree.

324
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:38,872
And this one right here is a little Rose...

325
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:44,881
who's gonna grow upway too fast.

326
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:48,136
No, I won't.

327
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:50,276
You won't?

328
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,130
Hey, did you hear that, Jesse ?

329
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:54,998
She said she's never growing up.

330
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,512
Never, ever, ever.

331
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:06,896
She in yet, Reed ?

332
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:09,494
No. Eve hit her pretty hard.

333
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,408
She said she might be in this afternoon.

334
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,151
Could you get somebody on the satellite for me ?

335
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:13,211
What do you need ?

336
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:16,382
Officer in charge of public affairs
at the department of defense.

337
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:17,900
You got it.

338
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:19,125
Thanks.

339
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:46,215
Hey, buddy.

340
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:24,528
Just don't let them in.

341
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:27,634
Don't let them in !

342
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:30,497
What ? What ?

343
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:31,976
What ?

344
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,980
Don't let who in ?

345
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,883
Don't let who in ?

346
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:42,117
What are you doing ?

347
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:55,509
Got a minute ?

348
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:57,539
Hey, Russell.

349
00:24:00,163 --> 00:24:00,946
How are you feeling ?

350
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:02,747
All right.

351
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,667
Wanted to give you these.

352
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:10,944
They belong to the guy I brought in last night--
Paxton.

353
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:13,828
How's he doing ?

354
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,416
Well, I think he'll recover.

355
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,384
Is there something else ?

356
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:20,319
No.

357
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,896
This is a tissue fragment I removed from his head.

358
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:36,101
It's mostly cartilage,but it's covered with tiny,
geometric spores.

359
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,065
They're not fungal, not bacterial.

360
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,386
This was not a part of him.

361
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:44,088
I'm thinking maybe a lampreyor a jelly stinger,

362
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:46,906
but this is your area of expertise, not mine.

363
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,232
It was still moving when it came out.

364
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,568
I think it may have been ingurgitating fluids.

365
00:24:57,228 --> 00:24:58,422
Like a feeding tube.

366
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,536
Do you mind if I take this with me
so I can run a few tests ?

367
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:03,687
No, please.

368
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:06,797
Dr. Underlay, you're needed in I.C.U. Ten.

369
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,060
I'll be right there.

370
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,129
You know, Mare, when you get a chance,

371
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,540
you really should radio the kids.

372
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,987
Why ?

373
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:19,191
They were pretty upset this morning.
They came by my house.

374
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:21,960
Your house ? Why did they do that ?

375
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,653
Because you didn't come home last night.

376
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,002
I'm sorry, Russell. I have to go.

377
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:53,165
Do you remember when
we lived here with mommy, Jess ?

378
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:55,857
I sure do, Rose.

379
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,330
Was I a baby ?

380
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:01,063
You were pretty little, yeah.

381
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:04,811
Was mommy different then ?

382
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:07,946
What, like, different how ?

383
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:11,745
More different than since the hurricane.

384
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:15,522
Why do you think she's different now, Rose ?

385
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,772
I don't know.
She just doesn't look the same.

386
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,098
Yes, she does.

387
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:26,736
Maybe on the outside, but not in.

388
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:31,339
Well, how do you know what she looks like on the inside ?

389
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:42,371
It's not that I didn't call the kids.

390
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:47,607
It's that I didn't even think about calling them.

391
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:52,339
They weren't even in my mind.

392
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:56,283
Russell had no right to come in here and lay this on you.

393
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:58,991
This isn't about Russell. This is about me.

394
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:05,211
I don't know what's happeningto me, Tom.

395
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:11,370
It's like part of me is here, but...

396
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,727
another part...

397
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:20,328
a different part...

398
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,821
is pulling me away.

399
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:32,295
Honey, honey, you've been up for,
what, almost 36 hours ?

400
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:33,717
Let me take you home.

401
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,918
Hey, how are you gonna take care of others

402
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,260
if you don't take care of yourself ?

403
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:49,001
Did you ever feel like this with Kira, after her mom died ?

404
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,874
Did you ever feel like a part of you was abandoning her ?

405
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:01,913
I don't remember.

406
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,881
Sorry, ma'am,you've gotta turn around.

407
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:17,157
Oh. I'm with channel 7.

408
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:19,598
Okay, I see that.

409
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,020
The sheriff doesn't want anyone on this road.

410
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:24,627
- Has the quarantine gone into effect ?
- Not yet.

411
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:28,326
- Then why can't I get through ?
- It's for your own protection, ma'am.

412
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:30,125
Safety circle. 5-mile radius.

413
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,395
Yeah, I know, but I have to see somebody in cutler ridge.

414
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,152
I'm very sorry.

415
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:43,010
Listen, I'm married to the sheriff's wife's ex-husband.

416
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:43,749
So...

417
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:49,075
whatever.

418
00:28:56,307 --> 00:28:58,124
Sorry, Sir. You've gott ahead back.

419
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:15,050
Why was Underlay in Paxton's room?

420
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:17,738
I don't know. Maybe the military got to him.

421
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,852
He took my camera, the bastard.

422
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,481
Could have used the better photos.

423
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,777
- For what ?
- For evidence.

424
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:24,320
What do you think ?

425
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:26,074
Russ, do you not see what's going on here ?

426
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:28,089
This hurricane was just a cover

427
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,982
so the aliens could land undetected.

428
00:29:30,456 --> 00:29:31,925
Then the Air Force sent out their welcome party.

429
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:33,469
Boom ! They were attacked.

430
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:35,945
"Don't let them in," Paxton kept saying.

431
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,613
"Don't let them in." Who do you think they were talking about--

432
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:38,674
the Cubans ?

433
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,201
Okay.

434
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:44,864
We gotta do this quick.

435
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:47,813
What are you gonna examine first ?

436
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:49,612
- The antennas or the prods ?
- There's no antennas, Dave.

437
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,919
- How do you know ?
- Because I've seen the thing.

438
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:53,822
Well, they could be retracted.

439
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:55,331
I'm gonna examine the skeleton

440
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:56,686
and whatever's wrapped around the skeleton

441
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:58,918
and see if it compares to the tissue fragment Mariel gave me.

442
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,016
Good. Ohh !

443
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,299
And then we're gonna take this whole thing to the coroner.

444
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:04,259
No souvenirs, you got that ?

445
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,394
Fine. Unless there's antennas.

446
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:16,035
Dude.

447
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,055
I appreciate you coming by, father.

448
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:22,689
I know how busy you must be.

449
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,134
Anything for you, Tom.

450
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,162
- He's conscious ?
- Yeah.

451
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:36,267
But my wife assures me that he won't make it till morning.

452
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,343
- Are you certain ?
- Absolutely.

453
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:50,135
David, I'm father Scanlon.

454
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:51,732
I'm here to help you.

455
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:54,817
If there's anything you'd like to tell me at any time,

456
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,362
you feel free to go ahead and say that.

457
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,173
Sheriff ?

458
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,966
Say a prayer, Adrienne.
Say a prayer.

459
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,045
Through this holy anointing,

460
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,438
may the Lord, with His love and mercy...

461
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:07,910
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

462
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:11,194
May the Lord who frees you from sin

463
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,336
save you and raise you up.

464
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,411
may the Lord who frees you from sin

465
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:18,670
save you and raise you up.

466
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:36,605
Uh, yes ?

467
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:39,103
Miss paxton. My name's Larkin Groves.

468
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,187
I'm sorry to come all the way out here without calling,

469
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:42,428
but your phones are out.

470
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:44,644
I got your address fromt he public affairs office.

471
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:46,794
If you're looking for my husband, he's not here.

472
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:47,985
He's overseas.

473
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:51,130
What ?

474
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:52,888
Is there anything I can help you with ?

475
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:00,068
Miss paxton, I'm sorry if I'm the one to tell you this,

476
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:02,616
but y-your husband's in the hospital.

477
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:05,419
He's just south of here.

478
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:09,247
I think you're mistaken.

479
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,985
I wish I were.

480
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:13,427
David's overseas

481
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,633
on a mission.

482
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,174
What kind of mission?

483
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,034
I don't think I should be talking to you.

484
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,099
Listen, I-I could take you to see him if you want.

485
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,178
- They're blocking most of the roads, but--
- No, I want you to leave.

486
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,771
- Ms. Paxton, please.
- Now.

487
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,323
He's at homestead hospital.

488
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:51,172
Underlay said there was a lot of looting going on.

489
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:53,784
People steal food and appliances, Dave,
not human remains.

490
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,156
Then it had to be the military.

491
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,302
You said you saw them out here checking things out, right ?

492
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:59,187
Patrolling the area, looking for Paxton maybe.

493
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,819
- Maybe they looked in the trunk of my car.
- Maybe they did.

494
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:04,126
I gotta talk to Paxton. Paxton's the key.

495
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:05,307
Look, I'm gonna check on the kids,

496
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:06,612
and then I'm goin'right back to the hospital.

497
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:07,669
All right, what if they don't let us in ?

498
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,552
Who, Mariel ?

499
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,406
Underlay.

500
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:10,567
I don't take orders from him.

501
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:12,968
Well, he is the sheriff, Russell.

502
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:14,651
Yeah, the sheriff who's working with the military.

503
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,426
And the sheriff who's sleeping with your ex-wife.

504
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:20,750
I'm just sayin' that you might not be as objective

505
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,062
about the guy as you should be, okay ?

506
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,111
Where the hell did he come from ?

507
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:34,211
Did you know he was gonna be here ?

508
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:35,436
No.

509
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,753
What the hell ?

510
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:43,661
What's goin' on ?

511
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:44,953
We're picking up the kids.

512
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:46,230
You didn't call me.

513
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,626
I talked to you at the hospital.

514
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,218
Yeah, and ?

515
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,536
- Hey, guys--
- No, wait. Hold on.

516
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,170
You left 'em last night, Mariel.

517
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,705
They're here because you left them alone

518
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:58,168
so they shouldn't have to go now.

519
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,836
- It's okay, dad.
- No, it's not okay.

520
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,513
Mariel, she was very upset.

521
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:12,918
Rose, it's okay. Tell her.

522
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,184
But I wanna go, daddy.

523
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:17,130
I miss Carlita.

524
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,474
We really appreciate you being here for them.

525
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,559
I'll drop them off on wednesday, okay ?

526
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:34,673
Go give your daddy a kiss, sweetheart.

527
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:43,405
I love you.

528
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,406
I love you, too, daddy.

529
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:57,173
Reed.

530
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:58,601
Did you get in touch with Val ?

531
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:01,226
Yeah, I ran your story by her.
She wants to talk to you.

532
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:02,320
Great.

533
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:04,822
Val.

534
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:06,763
Larkin.

535
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:10,067
Reed told you about this missing airman ?

536
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:13,218
Val, his wife didn't even know he was down here.

537
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,786
It sounds to me like the military is covering something up.

538
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:18,295
She thought he was ona mission overseas.

539
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,196
I-I told her that he was here in the hospital

540
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:23,406
and I offered to bring her down here,

541
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,934
but she seemed so scared.

542
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:28,999
Larkin, the man is dead.

543
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:30,310
What ?

544
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:31,813
I just talked to the hospital.

545
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:34,960
That's not the story I want to tell.

546
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:39,046
I-I want our viewers to see how we're coping, adapting.

547
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,478
How did you get out of town ?

548
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,885
I thought there were roadblocks.

549
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:43,347
I went around them.

550
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:44,929
You could've been arrested.

551
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,834
Since when do you care how I get a story ?

552
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,297
Val ?

553
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,320
This man was obviously down here
on some kind of classified mission.

554
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:54,987
Now he's dead, and no one's talking about it.

555
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:57,446
And you're concerned about my driving record ?

556
00:35:58,491 --> 00:35:59,828
I don't want this story, Larkin.

557
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:01,636
Not this story.

558
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:18,410
Dave !

559
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:19,847
What ?

560
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:21,606
Paxton's dead.

561
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,018
- Give me your keys.
- What ? Why ?

562
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,932
Just give me your keys.

563
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:29,791
Uh... how do you know he's dead ?

564
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,012
Larkin just called.

565
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:34,016
She said Paxton's wife knew nothing
about him being down here.

566
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,432
And apparently the Air Force just swooped in
and took his body away.

567
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:40,969
Well, then how do you know he's dead ?

568
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:43,953
I mean, did anybody actually see him dead, Russ ?

569
00:36:47,864 --> 00:36:48,360
Call me crazy...

570
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,962
I don't care if you're crazy, Dave.

571
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,709
I care about how all this affects my family.

572
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,986
If there's something going on here,

573
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:00,903
something bigger than the hurricane...

574
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,176
how can I protect my kids
when they're not with me ?

575
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,106
They're with you, Russ.

576
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,195
They're in the town.

577
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,193
But right now the town may need your protection

578
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:15,233
just as much as they do.

579
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:29,120
What are you looking for ?

580
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,356
Hair, nails, teeth--

581
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:33,451
anything to pull some D.N.A. from.

582
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:35,059
Okay.

583
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,334
Is this yours ?

584
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,411
No.

585
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,738
"Two become one."

586
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:57,747
That's the inscription.

587
00:37:58,461 --> 00:37:59,034
What ?

588
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,487
Any idea who this belongs to ?

589
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:14,960
Will you marry me ?

590
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,256
Why'd you do this ?

591
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,082
'Cause you're my wife.

592
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:32,344
How's it fit ?

593
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,323
Pretty good.

594
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,201
Where'd you get it ?

595
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:40,714
Stole it off a looter.

596
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,290
Mommy.

597
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,369
Mommy, I'm ready for bed.

598
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,269
I'll be right there, honey.

599
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:57,082
Hi.

600
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,259
- You brush your teeth ?
- Yep.

601
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,690
- You want Mobat ?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:18,543
- I'm sorry I didn't call you last night, honey.
- It's okay.

603
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,762
No, it's not.

604
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:26,047
I want you to know

605
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:30,198
I'm gonna try very hard not to let that
happen ever again, okay?

606
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,654
I was just kinda worried.

607
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:35,766
I know.

608
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:38,860
And you know what ?

609
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:42,406
You're not gonna lose me.

610
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,537
Ever. I promise.

611
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,687
Even when you die ?

612
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:55,998
Well, you know, that's not gonna happen

613
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:59,982
for a very, very, very long time.

614
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,280
I've been wanting to tell you something, mommy.

615
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:08,129
Hey, Mare.

616
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:10,310
It's the hospital.

617
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:18,370
Can you save it till tomorrow ?

618
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:28,385
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Night, mommy.

619
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,968
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

620
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:43,518
This is dr. Underlay.

621
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:50,301
- You feelin' okay now, Rosie ?
- I guess.

622
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:52,512
Hey...

623
00:40:54,513 --> 00:40:56,199
is there somethin' you wanna tell me ?

624
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,548
- Okay.
- Okay.

625
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:15,390
During the hurricane, I saw lots of lights.

626
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:17,058
They were beautiful.

627
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:21,730
They fell out of the sky and into the water.

628
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:24,333
And then...

629
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:27,387
they swam away.

630
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,887
Can you keep a secret, honey ?

631
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:49,363
I saw them, too.
