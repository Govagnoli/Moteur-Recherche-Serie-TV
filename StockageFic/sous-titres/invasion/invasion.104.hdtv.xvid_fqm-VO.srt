Do you think anyone's inside ?

00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:04,705
Kira, you gotta see this.

4
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:06,409
Dr. Underlay ?

5
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,626
I'm looking for Dr. Underlay !

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,437
I saw something in the water, dad.

7
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:10,967
Who are they ?

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,769
Military ?

9
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:12,743
Why no markings ?

10
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,632
I'm gonna find out why
the Air Force is down here

11
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:15,867
and if there's a cover-up,
who's involved.

12
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:18,985
If I tell you what's really goin'on,
I'm gonna put you right in the crosshairs.

13
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:19,958
Mariel...

00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:22,879

18
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,451
There are no accidents, Lewis.

19
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,262
Everything happens for a reason.

20
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:17,371
Look at our town.

21
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:19,002
Yeah, it's a shame.

22
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,408
On one level, maybe.

23
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:22,409
But I think it's an opportunity, too.

24
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:25,762
It's an opportunity to grow.

25
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,658
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right ?

26
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,134
Hey, sheriff.

27
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,972
You're doing a terrific job.

28
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,333
Thank you, Roger.
How's the shop ?

29
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,695
Took a few lumps,
but we'll be back.

30
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:48,939
I know you will.

31
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:51,886
You see ?

32
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:53,084
He's a survivor

33
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,331
like all the folks that are gonna take us
to the next level.

34
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:11,387
In the aftermath of hurricane Eve, it seems
as if all of South Floridais taking stock.

35
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,658
But here in homestead,
taking stock means waiting...

36
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,118
waiting for loved ones
who are still missing.

37
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:18,362
And for many people, waiting in line

38
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:20,174
for the most basic necessities...

39
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:23,508
Ice, food, gas, water...

40
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:24,617
medicine.

41
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,429
All are in very short supply.

42
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,277
I'm here with Terrence Gale from
the Florida Department of Health.

43
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,587
Can you tell me, in situations like this,

44
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:34,360
should we expect things to get
worse before they get better ?

45
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,748
Well, with so much displacement,

46
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,452
we're always concerned about disease.

47
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:40,453
But that's why these relief
centers are so important.

48
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,490
Because they can
provide a ration of hope

49
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:44,635
for families who have been
forced out of their homes

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,961
and allow them to get food or medicine
or whatever they would require.

51
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:49,610
How do you keep up with demand ?

52
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,719
Access is the greatest challenge.

53
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,910
- I've visited most of these places... 
- You're one of them.

54
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,236
You're one of them !

55
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:00,589
Help ! Help !

56
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm pregnant. Stop ! I'm pregnant.

57
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,184
She's one of them !

58
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:13,966
Mona, I'm coming in with another load.

59
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,032
I have no idea where
we're gonna put'em all.

60
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,022
Here, take this little guy.

61
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,637
Be careful. He's a little scrappy.

62
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:33,286
Come on.

63
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:34,823
It's okay. It's okay.

64
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,037
How come you're playing Noah's ark ?

65
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:41,012
'Cause I can't use my truck. The
sheriff's got all the roads closed

66
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:42,778
Weren't closed for him.

67
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,132
He had no problem getting
Larkin to Key Largo.

68
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:47,115
What are they doing down there ?

69
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,516
She was following upon a story.

70
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,345
We have an E.T.A. On
when we're getting water ?

71
00:03:58,443 --> 00:03:59,391
I've heard six weeks.

72
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:00,437
Six weeks ?

73
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,385
That's what they tell me.

74
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,020
The sheriff has water now.

75
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,655
How do you know ?

76
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:07,336
Because when I dropped the kids off at
his house, your ex was taking a bath.

77
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,034
That's how I know.

78
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:09,767
That son of a bitch !

79
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:10,977
No one has water.

80
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,481
Well, I guess it pays
to be the man, huh ?

81
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:14,312
Hey, Russ !

82
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:20,011
Where earlier today, Wnkw's Larkin
Groves was attacked on camera

83
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,496
by a deranged woman at the E.O.C.

84
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:24,925
But now the question remains...

85
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,116
Why did this woman attack her ?

86
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:28,424
Oh, no.

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,428
Do you know how they get in ?

88
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:40,031
They're in.

89
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,772
I saw her. I saw her

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,075
She was there.

91
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,612
She was there.

92
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,377
I'm not crazy.

93
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,751
I'm not crazy.

94
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,412
They get in. That's all

95
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:57,916
That's what they do. They're in

96
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,616
She was one of them.

97
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:00,695
She was.

98
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:01,578
She was one of what ?

99
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:05,675
One of them.

100
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,435
One of the...

101
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,312
television...

102
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:13,261
people.

103
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,002
They're everywhere.

104
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:18,782
5 milligrams of haldol.

105
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:23,032
You want a latte with that, Janie ?

106
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,092
Dr. Bates.

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,282
Looks like somebody
forgot to take their meds.

108
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:31,916
How long have you been treating her ?

109
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:34,256
Six years

110
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:36,207
She's schizophrenic.

111
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:39,067
When she's on her thorazine,
we don't have a problem.

112
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,277
Why did she stop taking it ?

113
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,227
It was not available
at the relief center.

114
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:44,787
- Should it have been ?
- Yes.

115
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,867
But the distributor
couldn't get into town.

116
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,687
He was turned away at
one of the roadblocks.

117
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,898
- When did you hear about this ?
- I just heard about it.

118
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:55,058
I was seeing a patient who's normally very
responsible, and she didn't take her meds

119
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,566
and it's because she couldn'T.
She couldn't get them. I see.

120
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,721
Was this medicine specifically
marked for paloma middle school ?

121
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:01,680
Yes.

122
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:03,872
And has this been an ongoing problem ?

123
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:06,667
Earlier today, I spoke with Terrence
Gale of the Department of Health

124
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:09,137
and he told me that he's been
to all of the relief centers,

125
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,347
and none of them have
the proper supplies.

126
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:15,052
I'm gonna get right
on this. Just hold on.

127
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,513
Okay, folks,
I'd like...

128
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:21,436
Hold it up !

129
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,801
Hold up ! Hold up !

130
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,287
I just need to know when
the grid's gonna be back up.

131
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:28,847
I can't give you a definitive answer.

132
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,057
Our crews are working. Listen up !

133
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,657
Our crews are working 24/7,

134
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:37,492
but we're talking about a very large
area here with very limited access.

135
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,248
Okay. A week, two weeks ?

136
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,133
Maybe six to eight.

137
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:44,773
Mayor ?

138
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,041
Power means nothing if
you don't have a roof.

139
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:52,397
But what we're hearing is that construction
materials are being doled out very selectively,

140
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,671
and some people are being
shut out all together.

141
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:55,257
That's not true.

142
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,478
If you go to a supply center
and get in line...

143
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,151
You may live to see another day.

144
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,782
My wife was just attacked at a center.

145
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:04,032
A mentally ill woman hadn't gotten her
medication because the truck carrying it

146
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,733
was turned away at a roadblock.

147
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,896
Now I thought this lockdown, or
"safety circle," as you called it, Mayor,

148
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:11,522
was supposed to protect our community,
not make it more dangerous.

149
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:12,562
Good morning, Russell.

150
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,162
I'm sorry about your wife.
I hope Larkin's all right.

151
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,752
The system isn't perfect, and I realize that
our checkpoints may becausing an inconvenience.

152
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:22,572
But we are safer for them.

153
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:25,107
They're helping us to enforce a curfew

154
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,448
- marginalize looting.
- They're choking us, tom.

155
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,828
And I don't really see who they're serving.
Half the checkpoints are in the town itself.

156
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,631
On roads that have already been cleared.

157
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,841
Nobody wants to be cut off. But we are.

158
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:37,832
And the business community can't
repair itself without supplies.

159
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,002
If you...

160
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:44,527
Mayor, if you just open up the roads that
are secure, it'll speed things up for us.

161
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:46,672
Then we need to lose the
perimeter. It's not helping anybody.

162
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:49,597
You're all missing the point.

163
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:52,393
We're still in the
containment stage here,

164
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:55,578
with so many people from
our town unaccounted for.

165
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,144
Chemical and fertilizer plants
that are damaged...

166
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,361
Those are all C.D.C. Issues.

167
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:02,157
- Our main water supply may be contaminated.
- Then why are you using it ?

168
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:04,887
Excuse me ?

169
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,447
You have water at your
house, right, Tom ?

170
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:09,112
- How'd you manage that ?
- We have a well.

171
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:10,347
Your development has a well ?

172
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:11,907
No,

173
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:14,117
I have a well.

174
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,148
Tom,

175
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:21,931
we all understand your concerns

176
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,077
but maybe we've gone too far here.

177
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,587
If people can't get to
us, we can't rebuild.

178
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,667
That'll be bad for everyone.

179
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:36,947
All right.

180
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:38,768
Let's open the doors.

181
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,433
And see what comes through.

182
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:59,458
You sure you're gonna be
able to carry all that stuff ?

183
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,123
I'm not carrying anything. She is.

184
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,959
I'm just working in
a management capacity.

185
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,429
I'm working in a management capacity.

186
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:12,342
- You're hammering.
- Oh, no, she's hammering.

187
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:13,968
Oh, oh, you want hammering ?

188
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:15,333
No, no,

189
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:17,868
no, no.

190
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,403
Aah, not the bag. Not the bag.

191
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:22,938
Underlay.

192
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,603
Are you fondling your brother again ?

193
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,073
- What do you want, Derek ?
- You.

194
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:30,284
When do I get my ration of you ?

195
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,494
Go away.

196
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,484
Going to Biscayne tonight,
to a little bonfire.

197
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,057
You should come.

198
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,918
I think I'll have other plans.

199
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,162
He can come, too.

200
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:58,351
So today was the big showdown, huh ?

201
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:01,787
Big public mano a mano ?

202
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:02,678
It wasn't that big.

203
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,145
You kicked his ass, right ?

204
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:08,389
Guess I kind of did.

205
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,390
That's awesome.

206
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,381
That guy needed a good ass kicking.

207
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:12,534
So no roadblocks, right ?

208
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:13,425
No.

209
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,517
Cool. Okay, first thing tomorrow. I
want Larkin to take us down to Key Largo.

210
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:17,093
Why ?

211
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,011
'Cause I want to see what she saw.

212
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,465
- I'm sure it's all gone by now, Dave. 
- No, we don't know that.

213
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,478
Larkin said Underlay told her that they
were looking for some downed helicopter.

214
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:29,811
He told her that the Air Force was
looking for some missing weather airplane.

215
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:33,427
When they got there, they both saw soldiers
loading some mystery box into the back of a truck.

216
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,173
Wouldn't you like to know
what was in that mystery box ?

217
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:40,201
- I'd rather know why Underlay was showing it to her. 
- You know why.

218
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:41,222
Control.

219
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,078
Guys like Underlay thrive on control.

220
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,410
He definitely knows there's aliens here.

221
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,118
Oh, Dave...

222
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,134
Air Force knows it, too.

223
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:52,326
He just has to control the information
or risk blowing his entire alliance.

224
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,872
What alliance ?

225
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,104
With the aliens.

226
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,192
Why are we stopping here ?

227
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:01,659
Because

228
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:02,786
we're returning to Earth.

229
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:13,824
What is this place ?

230
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,606
It's one of our research facilities.

231
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:17,283
They've been out of
radio contact all day.

232
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,718
What do they do here ?

233
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,045
They study animals, tropical diseases.

234
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,146
Shawn, you here ?

235
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,928
All the researchers left
before the hurricane,

236
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,317
but I know the care taker's been back.

237
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,077
It's Russell !

238
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,259
Oh, no.

239
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,056
the primates are gone.

240
00:11:59,158 --> 00:11:59,682
What ?

241
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:00,914
How did they get out ?

242
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:02,669
Hurricane, I bet.

243
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,661
No, the care taker
said they were all here.

244
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:05,761
Yeah, well

245
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,359
they're not now.

246
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:10,456
Dave...

247
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:33,231
Dave ?

248
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:35,458
Dave, you home ?

249
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,315
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,040
I waited outside, but the
mosquitoes were killing me.

251
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:04,964
How did you...

252
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,244
I didn't see your car.

253
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,082
I parked in the back.

254
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,575
I didn't mean to startle you.

255
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,056
Russell's not here.

256
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:17,109
I know. How you doing ?
I heard about what happened.

257
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:17,869
I'm all right.

258
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:19,991
Just a little unnerving.

259
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:20,961
I'll bet.

260
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,345
Everything all right with the baby ?

261
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:25,625
Yeah.

262
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,009
Everybody's

263
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:29,233
okay.

264
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,031
Good.

265
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,821
I was curious if you'd learned
anything more about that box.

266
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:37,290
Oh.

267
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,102
No.

268
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:40,748
Haven't had the chance
to follow up on it yet.

269
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:43,132
You ?

270
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,301
Well, I called my
contact at the Air Force.

271
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,782
He's former C.I.A., So...

272
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,978
you never really know when
you're getting a straight story.

273
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:57,284
- I thought you said you trusted him.
- I do.

274
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,005
But sometimes he with holds.

275
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,030
- You really want to push this thing ?
- Yes.

276
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,991
If the military is working
on something secret down here

277
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,506
I want to know about it.

278
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:14,708
Okay.

279
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:17,904
But if you end up with a story,

280
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:21,551
you just can't tell anyone
that I helped you get it,

281
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,573
not even your husband.

282
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:24,590
Russell already knows you helped me.

283
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:25,900
Larkin.

284
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:29,888
What I showed you was
highly confidential.

285
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:31,224
Yeah, from the news.

286
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:34,002
- I didn't think you were talking about my family.
- From everyone.

287
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:37,177
I went out on a limb for you.

288
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,915
You wanna be a good wife ?
Talk to your husband.

289
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,933
But if you wanna be a
good reporter, talk to me.

290
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:48,606
Just don't tell anyone you're doing it.

291
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:53,466
It was feeding time.

292
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:56,086
The guy either opened every
cage at once because he's stupid,

293
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,309
or he opened one, maybe
two, apes got spooked,

294
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,483
broke out their buddies
and ripped the guy apart.

295
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,611
They weren't apes.
They were gray baboons.

296
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,358
And they didn't kill him,
at least not intentionally.

297
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,379
How do you know ?

298
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,235
Because his wounds were superficial.

299
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:13,123
He was bleeding from the nose and mouth.

300
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:14,302
You think he was poisoned ?

301
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,551
I think he contracted
an infectious disease.

302
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:20,407
These are all the test
regimens of the baboons inside.

303
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,424
Any or all of'em could
have been carriers.

304
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:23,001
Of what ?

305
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,233
I'm hoping he can tell us.

306
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,298
Any of you touch anything in there ?

307
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:30,084
No.

308
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:31,237
Good.

309
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,076
They're testing his blood now.

310
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,251
His blood's on my foot. I'd wash it.

311
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:36,587
What about the baboons ?

312
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:37,793
They'll have to be found.

313
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,553
Even if the disease isn't airborne

314
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,514
if they're carriers, anything
they touch will be contaminated.

315
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,374
Those the regimens ?

316
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,339
Can I see these ?

317
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:48,939
Start putting a team together.

318
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,606
All right, Dave, as soon
as you get the all clear,

319
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,070
I want you to go home and make sure
Larkin and the kids stay inside.

320
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,956
Don't let them out
until you hear from me.

321
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:58,036
Yeah, okay.

322
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,745
If the baboons are found quickly,
we may be able to contain this.

323
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:14,609
But if not...

324
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,247
Dispatch, this is Ranger Varon.

325
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,211
We're gonna need six
teams out here A.S.A.P.

326
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,758
To start tracking downthese primates.

327
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,431
Put wild life in charge of
three. I'll oversee the others.

328
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,317
Let's just start working the grid

329
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,418
and then we'll head east
towards homestead, roger ?

330
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:40,755
Roger that.

331
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:48,065
You owe me so big. I never
work this hard at my house.

332
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:50,200
Well, then this is
invaluable training, Kira.

333
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,694
- Jess ?
- What ?

334
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,228
Have you heard from your Dad lately ?

335
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:54,198
I don't have a radio.

336
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,556
Yeah, I tried radioing
him. He's not answering.

337
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,076
Well, he might be out of range.

338
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,041
You guys want dinner ?

339
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:02,608
Rose might, but Jesse
and I are going out.

340
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,392
We are ?

341
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:08,165
Out where ?

342
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:08,945
Bonfire.

343
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:10,046
What about the curfew ?

344
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,321
Oh, well, we'll be back before then.

345
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,181
I don't know, I think you guys
oughta wait and ask your father.

346
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,920
Well, can't we ask you ? I mean...

347
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,220
you do have some authority
around here, don't you ?

348
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:28,246
All right, but... don't be too late.

349
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:33,542
Nice play on the stepparent guilt.

350
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,062
Yeah, it's pretty effective.

351
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:38,866
You could try it with my dad...
if he actually felt guilt.

352
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,216
When did this come in ?

353
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,313
Five minutes ago.

354
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:45,280
Did you let everyone know ?

355
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,614
Absolutely.

356
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:53,990
Everything's opened up.

357
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:56,318
Route 1, krome
avenue--just let it bleed.

358
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:57,404
I'll be back in 20.

359
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,671
<i>Roger that.</i>

360
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,953
- Hello, mrs. Underlay.
- Hello.

361
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,366
Brought you lunch.

362
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,787
How you doing ?

363
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm keeping my head above water.

364
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,332
Is that a joke ?

365
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:12,478
Yeah.

366
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:21,090
The woman who attacked
Larkin this morning...

367
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:23,845
she's schizophrenic.

368
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:28,544
Her doctor told me thats
he was abused as a child,

369
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:32,360
and as a result of that
abuse, she disassociated.

370
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:36,019
She still can't come to terms
with what happened to her.

371
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,422
You're not schizophrenic, mariel.

372
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:40,923
I know.

373
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:44,260
But I am different since the hurricane.

374
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,928
You're different because you survived.

375
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,792
Not everyone can say that.

376
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:57,164
But why did I survive ?

377
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,918
What's that ?

378
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,629
It's a...

379
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:24,017
warning from the health department.

380
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,751
Some baboons escaped from a
research facility in the glades.

381
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,291
They may be carrying
an infectious disease.

382
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:36,756
Dispatch ?

383
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,925
Dispatch, you there ? Over.

384
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,038
Tom, what the hell ? I almost hit you.

385
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:03,749
I understand there are primates out here

386
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,008
with some kind of killer disease.

387
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:05,791
Why wasn't I called ?

388
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,513
- We're in the glades.
- Oh, and what makes you think

389
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,341
this thing is gonna stayin the glades ?

390
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,131
There's a town just
north of here with people.

391
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,555
A notice went out from
the health department.

392
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,442
Yeah, I read the notice. You
tracking these things alone ?

393
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:15,540
No, our team just split up.

394
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,060
If I still had my lockdown, I might
have been able to contain this.

395
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,637
- You wanna help ?
- I don't have a choice.

396
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:48,570
Larkin ? hey, it's me. It's Dave.

397
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:51,375
- Dave.
- Hey, where are the kids ?

398
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:52,708
They're in bed.

399
00:20:52,738 --> 00:20:55,120
No, no, no, Rose is here. She's
sleeping, but where's Jesse ?

400
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,255
Is he out with Kira somewhere ?

401
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,944
- It's past 11.
- Yeah, I know.

402
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:02,907
- Where are they ?
- They went to a park, but they said

403
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:05,892
that they would be
back here before curfew.

404
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,352
A park ? Where ? What park ?

405
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:10,000
What's wrong ?

406
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:15,405
We found a guy today who was
exposed to some kind of virus

407
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,027
that they think might have
killed him in less than 48 hours.

408
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,326
- What ?
- Yeah, it may be passed onby baboons.

409
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,012
- Baboons ? What are you talking...
- Russell's been out there hunting them all day.

410
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,967
But if Jesse and Kira
are still out there...

411
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,779
- Oh, my god !
- Larkin, where are you going ?

412
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,779
Hold on. Do you know where they are ?

413
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:32,731
- No, but I have to find them !
- Well, how ?

414
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:34,334
They said they went to a park !

415
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,899
Larkin, the entire everglades is a park.

416
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:39,255
I don't care ! Russell is gonna kill me.

417
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:41,551
- Mariel is gonna kill me.
- They're not gonna kill you. Listen !

418
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,341
Stay here with Rose, okay, and have
them radio me when they get back.

419
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:46,169
Larkin, I...

420
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:48,731
Stay !

421
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,484
Like I was sayin'before, if you want
it, you gotta go and get it, you know ?

422
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:22,618
Okay. Yeah.

423
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:26,293
- All right, man.
- Yeah, right.

424
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,491
Hello, girls. How are you ?

425
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:35,027
Dude, you want the worm ?

426
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,630
- I'm cool.
- You sure ?

427
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,592
Yeah. All right.

428
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:41,536
I was just wondering if maybe
I could steal this young lady ?

429
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:47,087
You know, my dad's a
ranger, too, you know ?

430
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:48,630
- I know.
- I think we even, like,

431
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,817
used to play together as kids and stuff.

432
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,712
Back when your dad was
married to that other babe.

433
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,978
That other babe's my mom.

434
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,131
Oh.

435
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,558
Cool.

436
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,877
So what's with the arm ?

437
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:04,978
Oh, I, uh...

438
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:08,817
- I got in an accident.
- Yeah, I guess you kinda did.

439
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,045
She's so hot. Man.

440
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,690
You're not related to her, are you ?

441
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:26,461
You know what time it is, man ?

442
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:28,633
No, man, sorry.

443
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,060
All right.

444
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:31,963
Later.

445
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,394
Hey, Kira.

446
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:37,768
Hey, I think we should get going.

447
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,302
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

448
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:48,165
Wait for me.

449
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,828
How many are we looking for, sheriff ?

450
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:06,161
I don't know. Ask him.

451
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:08,910
Seven, one male, six females.

452
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:11,322
Do you know how they got out ?

453
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:13,543
The care taker was probably
exposed during the hurricane,

454
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,109
got disoriented, let
them out by accident.

455
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:20,191
Shouldn't we be checking the trees ?

456
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,832
Hamadryas baboons spend most
of their time on the ground.

457
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,334
What's that ?

458
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,851
It's hearts of palm... baboon food.

459
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:38,652
Want a bite ?

460
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:41,019
No. Knock yourself out.

461
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,128
You talk to the kids ?

462
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:45,476
Not today.

463
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:49,124
Can I borrow your radio ? Mine's dead.

464
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:51,525
Channel 4 is your house.

465
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,663
You keep our frequency ?

466
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:54,791
Only as long as we share children.

467
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:02,562
Honey.

468
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:06,600
<i>Honey, you there ?</i>

469
00:25:09,854 --> 00:25:11,985
<i>- Yeah. Hey, baby.
- Hey.</i>

470
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,349
Did Dave tell you what was going on ?

471
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:17,184
Yeah, yeah, he did. Are you all right ?

472
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,484
Yeah, still out here
looking. Tom's with me now.

473
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:23,023
The kids okay ?

474
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,532
<i>Larkin ?</i>

475
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:30,405
Yeah.

476
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:32,308
Everybody's gonna be all right.

477
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,019
Good. I'm gonna be out here pretty late.

478
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:37,690
I just wanted you to know. I love you.

479
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,570
Okay, I love you, too.

480
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,660
You guys are really cute.

481
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,491
Like a couple of newlyweds.

482
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:53,154
We are newlyweds.

483
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:58,678
Yeah, well, so are Mariel and
I, but we're not... as cute.

484
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:07,315
it could be an allergic
reaction, maybe an infection.

485
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,386
Her fever shot up pretty
quick. She's coughed up some blood.

486
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,203
I need to take a listen
to your lungs, honey.

487
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,360
Just take a deep breath.

488
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:16,824
And again.

489
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:23,802
Call the C.D.C.

490
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:29,053
This is torture.

491
00:26:29,113 --> 00:26:30,416
It's merely a test.

492
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,888
A test of what ?

493
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:33,641
See if you're worthy.

494
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:36,746
- Close your eyes.
- No way.

495
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,573
Close your eyes...

496
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:41,502
and open your mouth.

497
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:46,390
You open your mouth.

498
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,203
Okay.

499
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:57,611
Now you.

500
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,915
****- What art ...****
- Shut, they're close.

501
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:19,812
Kill the flashlights.

502
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,854
Lewis.

503
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:35,568
Lewis ?

504
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,220
They're close.

505
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:54,704
Yeah.

506
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:57,669
Based on the first victim's blood test,

507
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,514
the C.D.C. thinks it may
be a strain of asian flu

508
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:03,214
that hasn't been seen since 1957.

509
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:05,702
I've ordered up the vaccine, but
they don't have any stored,

510
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,533
so it has to be synthesized.

511
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,059
They won't have it down
here for at least two days.

512
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:11,974
What does that mean for our girl ?

513
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:13,702
Not good.

514
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,148
Where did she come from ?

515
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:17,199
She's local.

516
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:19,890
Her father's the minister
at the first baptist church.

517
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:23,537
Did her family say anything
about encountering a baboon ?

518
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:26,336
No, but she's been
around a lot of people.

519
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,974
Her church has been
acting as a relief center.

520
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,458
That's the male.

521
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,519
So...

522
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:29,829
tell me why you took
Larkin down to Key Largo.

523
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:32,077
Now ?

524
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,880
Good a time as any.

525
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:39,580
I think you ought to shock the monkey.

526
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,120
If we wait, we'll have'em all.

527
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:45,519
If we capture the dominant male, the
females won't try to escape.

528
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,800
So why'd you do it ?

529
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,768
'Cause she was badgering
the hell out of me.

530
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,951
So that's the only reason ?

531
00:29:56,373 --> 00:30:00,073
You know, Russell, if
you trusted me more,

532
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:05,026
it really would make
life easier for everyone,

533
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:10,068
and we'd both probably be home
right now, in bed with our wives.

534
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:19,876
What the hell ?

535
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:25,998
Kira.

536
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:28,805
I've been lookingfor you guys all night.

537
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,664
- I...
- Where's Jesse ?

538
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,138
Did I wait long enough ?

539
00:32:57,162 --> 00:32:58,824
Jesse, you promised
me you would be home.

540
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,345
What was I supposed
to do, just leave her ?

541
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:03,411
Look, it's my fault,
Larkin. I'm really sorry.

542
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,927
Come on, let's just go.

543
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:20,246
Way to go, Derek !

544
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,533
Dude.

545
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:58,716
How many cases now ?

546
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:02,068
Three. Two more came in this morning.

547
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:10,613
- Good news or bad ?
- Both.

548
00:34:10,711 --> 00:34:13,021
We've examined all the
baboons, none are carriers.

549
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,514
- What ?
- That's the good.

550
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:17,322
Your care taker, the little
girl, the two new patients ?

551
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:21,402
If you don't find a common thread
between all of them very quickly,

552
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,998
you'll have a hundred cases
before the end of the week.

553
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,265
You have to stop this, now.

554
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:28,946
- Quarantine ?
- Absolutely.

555
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:42,455
Lewis.

556
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:43,525
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

557
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,169
Safety circle's back on.

558
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:47,032
I want full quarantine protocol now.

559
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,032
Increase perimeter to 10 miles.

560
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,873
Two officers at every checkpoint.

561
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:51,713
Lock it down.

562
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:52,680
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

563
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,201
The care taker, the little
girl, the two new victims,

564
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:59,154
it's the same flu. There's
no common carrier.

565
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,469
No, but you know what ? There
is a pattern developing.

566
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,938
With the exception of your care taker,

567
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,539
all of the cases have
broken out at relief centers.

568
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,657
One of the new victims is from here.

569
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:09,774
That's bright water park.

570
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,422
And that little girl practically
lived at the first baptist church.

571
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,234
And the other
one's from here...

572
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,892
paloma middle school.

573
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:17,206
That's where Larkin was attacked.

574
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:20,206
I don't know if it's a coincidence
or by virtue of the fact

575
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:22,488
that so many people are
passing through these places.

576
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:23,643
We should talk to Terrence Gale.

577
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:24,441
Who's that ?

578
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:28,323
Department of health. He's the one that's
been running point at all these centers.

579
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,399
I mean, that's the person that
Larkin interviewed this morning.

580
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:34,422
He was first on the scene when
I put in the call about the care taker.

581
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:37,455
Thanks, Russ. We'll take it from here.

582
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,558
I'll talk to him.

583
00:35:42,863 --> 00:35:44,572
Why don't you both talk to him ?

584
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,126
Mr. Gale ?

585
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,305
Yes ?

586
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:01,028
I'm Russell Varon. We met yesterday.

587
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:03,356
Stay there. Don't touch anything.

588
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:06,652
Why not ?

589
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,291
What do you want ?

590
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,065
To talk to you.

591
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:15,093
The disease seems to be connected
to all the relief centers.

592
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:19,741
You're here to arrest me ?

593
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:22,562
You're the carrier, aren't you ?

594
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,539
Mr. Gale ?

595
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,412
But I'm not sick.

596
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:44,501
God, you know, I was
exposed over a week ago.

597
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:45,933
I should be dead by now.

598
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,464
I'm not even sick.

599
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,906
Why am I not sick ?

600
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:05,587
How were you infected ?

601
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:08,498
I went to the research
facility the day after eve hit.

602
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:13,700
I asked the care taker
to show me what vaccines

603
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:16,761
that they had in case
that we needed more, and...

604
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:20,794
I'd had kind of a rough night.

605
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:21,681
I was shaky.

606
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,644
Did you contaminate yourself on purpose ?

607
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:26,822
No. What... why
would I do that ?

608
00:37:28,784 --> 00:37:30,193
It was an accident.

609
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,850
I dropped one of the samples.

610
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,766
It spilled on my hands.

611
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,367
It was this flu.

612
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,921
I immediately called
to order up the vaccine.

613
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,892
But when I didn't get sick, I...

614
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,146
I thought it, the tube
was just mislabeled.

615
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,705
But when you saw the
care taker had died ?

616
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:54,658
I began to...

617
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:57,202
wonder if it might be me.

618
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:00,132
I'd shaken hands with
the man when I left.

619
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:04,057
Somehow my body has
resisted the infection.

620
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:07,583
And I've spread it to
all these other people.

621
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,536
It's miraculous.

622
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:12,216
Miraculous ?

623
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:16,263
Lewis, we're gonna need an
ambulance and a hazmat team.

624
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:16,982
<i>Roger that.</i>

625
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,559
You knew you were exposed, but
you still went out anyway ?

626
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,629
I didn't show any symptoms.

627
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:24,930
Did you touch my wife ?

628
00:38:26,446 --> 00:38:27,207
Did you ?

629
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:28,277
Russ.

630
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:30,244
No. No.

631
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,230
Thank you, Mr. Gale.

632
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:32,493
The ambulance will be here in a minute.

633
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:33,179
Thank you.

634
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,672
Come on, Russ.

635
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:38,883
Good call.

636
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:40,615
We're gonna contain this thing.

637
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:42,601
Why isn't he sick, Tom ?

638
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:45,775
I don't know, but we
won't have to quarantine.

639
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:47,442
The vaccine's are coming tomorrow.

640
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:49,935
We'll get them to everyone
this guy's been in contact with.

641
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:51,456
Just keep the safety circle.

642
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:53,282
No quarantine ?

643
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:56,798
Maybe next time you give me
the benefit of the doubt, huh ?

644
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,023
Why isn't he sick ?

645
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:05,182
You take care. Drive safe.

646
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,844
Lewis.

647
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,060
Mr. Gale.

648
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,981
I think something happened
to you during the hurricane...

649
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:36,779
something maybe you don't understand.

650
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,281
We should talk.

651
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,812
What are you doing ?

652
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,131
Hey, I'm contagious.

653
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:51,378
Not to me.
