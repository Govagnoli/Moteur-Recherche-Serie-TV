00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,331
Hey, hey, hey,
what you doin'?

5
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:49,954
Getting movie times.
The theater is open.

6
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,763
Gonna take Jesse and Rose...

7
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,514
if I'm still allowed
to see them.

8
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,504
Why wouldn't you be allowed
to see them?

9
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,644
Because you threw them out.

10
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:06,090
Kira, we're just letting them stay
with their dad for awhile.

11
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,372
It's not a big deal.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,383
It's a big deal to me.

13
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,687
It was a big deal when
you and Mariel got Married.

14
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,022
You made a real big deal
about my new brother and sister,

15
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:17,131
and then you just send them away
without even asking me how I might feel.

16
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,864
Dad?

17
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:23,612
Dad?

18
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:33,178
- Lewis left a note in our mailbox.
- Lewis your missing deputy?

19
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:34,320
He sounds crazy.

20
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:37,041
He thinks I betrayed him.

21
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,264
Isn't that what the guy
that called last night said?

22
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:41,493
He said more than that.

23
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:47,403
- What is wrong with everybody?
- That's the question of the day.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,945
Has Lewis gone through
any changes lately?

25
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:53,512
What kind of changes?

26
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:55,321
You know what kind.

27
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:01,772
Oh, I see.

28
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,360
So he's one of us now, is he?

29
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:05,378
Oh, god.

30
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,620
- A hybrid?
- A hybrid?

31
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,061
That's what dave calls us...

32
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,021
Hybrids.

33
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:13,045
Half human, half... whatever.

34
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,633
Fish, alien.

35
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:16,953
Lightbulb, I don't know.

36
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,678
Maybe Lewis is upset you didn't
give him the rule book...

37
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,368
I don't have a rule book.

38
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,732
You know, on how to harness
our super powers.

39
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,535
I can stay underwater almost half an hour
without taking a breath,

40
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,222
so if I can do that,

41
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,981
I must be able to do
other things as well,

42
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,785
besides giving up my children.

43
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,932
I didn't make you
give up your children.

44
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,877
No, you didn't.

45
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,186
You just made it very clear you
wanted Russell out of our lives,

46
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,369
so either I give him the kids
or you get rid of him permanently.

47
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,372
- I didn't say anything like that.
- You didn't have to.

48
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:54,819
I hate you for this, Tom.

49
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:56,573
You've lied to all of us
far too long!

50
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:57,517
I never lied to you.

51
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:59,819
I told you everything I knew
when I knew it.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Nine years ago,
nobody gave me a rule book.

53
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:04,568
I didn't have anything
keeping me alive but you.

54
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,235
A lot of people have changed
since the huicane, Mariel,

55
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,283
some for the good, some not,
but what does it all mean?

56
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:10,269
I have no idea.

57
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,761
All I know is that I love you.

58
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,474
How do I get you
to remember that?

59
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,081
Maybe you could start
by telling me

60
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,927
what you've got locked
in our hall closet.

61
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,222
I'm leaving,
if anyone cares.

62
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:28,884
Good night, Kira.

63
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,917
Hello?

64
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,637
- Hello ?
- Is everything all right, sir?

65
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,792
No.

66
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,203
Do you know where you are?

67
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,246
Homestead...
Homestead Hospital.

68
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,523
And what day is it?

69
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:38,401
Wednesday.

70
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:42,431
What day is it?

71
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:48,084
How long have I been here?

72
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:49,264
Can you tell me
your name, sir?

73
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,957
I need to see my wife.

74
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:54,955
Your name?

75
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,339
Tom Underlay.
Where's my wife?

76
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:02,629
Wait... wait...

77
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:04,352
What are you doing?

78
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:05,908
Your doctor will be in
to see you shortly.

79
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,629
No, wait. Wait.

80
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,162
Most of the cellular towers
are operational again,

81
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,276
and florida power and light
reports that

82
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,031
95% of all homestead residents
now have power back.

83
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:31,008
Since the hurricane,
many, many people complained

84
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,445
that the government officials
were slow to respond,

85
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,043
But folks have to be breathing a
collective sigh of relief right now.

86
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:55,793
Hello? Somebody.

87
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,080
<i>Somebody.</i>

88
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,083
Hello?!

89
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,377
Mr. Underlay, I'm dr. Feld.

90
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:09,802
Who are those guys?

91
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,724
It's all right,
mr. Underlay.

92
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:14,796
What's all right?

93
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:16,928
How are you feeling?

94
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,881
You've been through
quite an ordeal.

95
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,489
You're lucky to be alive.

96
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,176
Good.

97
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:35,050
Now can you tell me, please,
what is three plus four?

98
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:35,431
What?

99
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,506
It's just a routine test.

100
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,355
Can you tell me
what three plus four is?

101
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:38,356
Seven.

102
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,401
G ood.

103
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:49,262
Just testing your response
to pain.

104
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,171
Are you allergic
to any medications?

105
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,131
No.

106
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:55,381
Now, mr. Underlay,
if you would, please,

107
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,205
Repeat these three words-

108
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,426
"Snail, razor, napalm. "

109
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,888
Who are those people?

110
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,708
They're from the government.

111
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,082
They'd like to ask you
some questions.

112
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:14,828
- The government?
- Yes.

113
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:17,536
Where's my wife?

114
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:20,891
Where's my wife?

115
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,785
We've tracked down
your daughter.

116
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,413
She's on her way here now.

117
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:25,995
I need to see my wife!

118
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,193
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

119
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:28,870
Why not?

120
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:34,408
Because your wife is dead,
mr. Underlay.

121
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:47,260
Can I call mommy and daddy Tom
To say good night?

122
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:51,093
Can I, daddy?

123
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:54,371
Ohh... you sure can.

124
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:55,157
Here...

125
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:57,454
Just sit down right here.

126
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:58,957
Go ahead and call them, okay?

127
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,815
So does she know her mother
is not who she thinks she is anymore?

128
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:10,641
No, and neither does Jesse.

129
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:12,992
Are you going to tell them?

130
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,323
Not yet.

131
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:17,814
Why not?

132
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,025
Because I promised Mariel
I wouldn't.

133
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:22,849
You promised Mariel?

134
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:24,406
Yeah.

135
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:29,285
So we're supposed to just
pretend everything's normal?

136
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:32,461
Larkin, did you put the napkins
in a different place?

137
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,760
Second drawer on the left.

138
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:37,010
I'm just saying,

139
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,559
until we know exactly
what we're dealing with here,

140
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,980
I- I think we should...

141
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:41,448
we should take this slowly.

142
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:44,930
Did you know that in a lot
of other places this happened,

143
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,363
the hybrids killed themselves?

144
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,480
Daddy, there's no answer.

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,903
Why don't you go ahead
and leave a message?

146
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,397
Hi, mommy,
it's me, Rose.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,471
I just wanted
to s good night.

148
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:57,803
So good night.

149
00:10:58,194 --> 00:10:59,638
And good night, daddy Tom.

150
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,108
And see you soon, Kira.

151
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:04,062
- Maybe they went to dinner.
- Yeah, maybe so.

152
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:07,878
Didn't these...

153
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,108
whatever they are...

154
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,712
didn't they also
kill their children?

155
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,039
Yeah, some, but that
hasn't happened here.

156
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,013
Yeah, this guy Healy thinks there's
something special about homestead,

157
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,309
something that's helping
the hybrids to thrive.

158
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:21,966
What if they stop thriving?

159
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,894
Russell, we have to tell
people about this,

160
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,443
forget about the fact
that it's my job.

161
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:27,498
We have a moral obligation.

162
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:31,100
And how can you even think about letting
the kids be with Tom and Mariel now?

163
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:32,470
They're not with them anymore.

164
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:33,524
They're with us now.

165
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,351
I know, but they're going to
be with them again one day.

166
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,046
What about our baby?

167
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,055
Russell,
we're having a child.

168
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:49,360
Do we want our child to
grow up in a place like this?

169
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:51,002
If it's not safe,
of course not.

170
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:54,741
I just don't know enough
about this yet.

171
00:11:58,752 --> 00:11:59,545
I'll get it.

172
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:02,793
Hello?

173
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:04,603
<i>Rose, is Jesse there?</i>

174
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,061
<i>Kira, what's wrong?</i>

175
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:08,110
Just put Jesse on the phone,
okay?

176
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,319
Kira.

177
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:22,552
Daddy?

178
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,055
Ohh.

179
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,703
Oh, my god.

180
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,995
I'll leave
you two alone.

181
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,167
Uh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for dr. Feld.

182
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,719
I'm dr. Varon.
I'm dr. Feld's associate.

183
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:15,786
I'm Tom and-And this is
my daughter Kira.

184
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,607
Hi.

185
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:24,227
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

186
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:32,013
And if you need anything,
we're here all night.

187
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,324
Doctor?

188
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:41,424
Hey, baby, I have to ask
the doctor a question.

189
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,283
C- Can you wait for me
right outside? Okay?

190
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,211
Okay.

191
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:45,991
Right there.

192
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:55,023
May I see your paper?

193
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,729
Do you have any idea
how you survived?

194
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:23,621
I met you.

195
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,190
- Met you.
- Tom.

196
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,339
Don't let me die.

197
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,227
You're gonna be okay.

198
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:45,487
Keep talking to me.

199
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:46,152
Look at me, Tom.

200
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:46,935
Look at me.

201
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:47,779
Just keep talking.

202
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,060
You're gonna be fine.

203
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:00,346
I'm right here, baby.
I'm right here.

204
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:01,617
Dr. Underlay!

205
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,002
- Where are we taking him?
- Exam one is ready.

206
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,440
We're having a temporary
power outage.

207
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,026
Main power should be
back up soon.

208
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,389
Okay, I'm here, Tom.

209
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,882
- Russell!
- Yeah?!

210
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,276
- Daddy, I want to go, too!
- We're gonna be pretty late!

211
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:15,002
- Why don't we all go?!
- Okay!

212
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,012
I'll take them with me!

213
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,245
- Yeah?
- It's Healy.

214
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:25,290
Where are you?

215
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:26,114
Healy?

216
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:27,706
I'm on my way to the hospital.

217
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:28,827
I'm with my son.

218
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:30,204
Then all you have to do
is listen.

219
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:34,513
He's got three
G.S.W.S to the abdomen.

220
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,562
His pulse is thready. He's been
in and out of consciousness.

221
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:37,657
Keep looking at me, Tom.

222
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:38,658
Stay with me.

223
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:41,567
C- Spine, cst, abdomen
and pelvis.

224
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:42,681
All right, guys,
line him up.

225
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:43,829
- I'm right here.
- My count,

226
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,109
One, two, three.

227
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,216
I'm right here.

228
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:50,728
Start a central line
and give a bolus of 2 liters of saline, wide open...

229
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:51,180
Tom.

230
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:52,818
And type and cross
2 units of blood.

231
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:53,446
Right away.

232
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,817
Uh, no, on the blood.

233
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:58,440
Dr. Underlay...

234
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:01,698
Type and cross.

235
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,106
Give him o-Neg.
He's o-Neg.

236
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:03,663
Are you sure?

237
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:09,771
Yes.

238
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,448
Okay, do it. Hang a bag.

239
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:13,662
Hurry, over here.

240
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:17,027
What?

241
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,102
I need... I need you.

242
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:24,920
I know. I'm right here.

243
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,247
We're gonna get through
this together, okay?

244
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:26,990
Just stay with me.

245
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,819
Just keep talking to me, Tom,

246
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,959
Okay, baby? I'm right here.

247
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,817
Mr. Underlay, the men out there
would like to have a word without-

248
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:56,709
I don't want to talk to them.

249
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,216
But they're from
the national transportation-

250
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,558
I- I know where they're from.

251
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:02,321
I'll talk to them later.

252
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:03,389
Maybe Tomorrow.

253
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,945
All right.

254
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,164
Do you mind if I change
your dressing?

255
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,084
No.

256
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:20,907
There's a lot
of press outside,

257
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,832
a lot of people are eager
to see you.

258
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,647
Where's your little girl?

259
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:34,940
With her aunt.

260
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,074
It's gonna be rough
for her.

261
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,767
We're gonna have a lot
to work through...

262
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,912
All of us...

263
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,433
But everything happens
for a reason, right?

264
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:59,236
I wouldn't be here
unless I wasn't supposed to...

265
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:04,974
be... here.

266
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:09,726
You're healing
reMarkably fast.

267
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,800
These stitches should be able
to come out in just a few days.

268
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:21,258
Do you know
how this happened?

269
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,448
Well, I assume in the crash.

270
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:27,492
No. It must have been after.

271
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,848
I know you were bleeding when
they pulled you from the water.

272
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,470
Then I must have cut it
on some wreckage.

273
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,929
How do you think
I survived this?

274
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,432
Do you have any idea?

275
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:49,365
No.

276
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,435
Me either.

277
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,653
You know, you say some things
that are very unsettling.

278
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,722
I'm sorry. I just feel like
I know you,

279
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,591
like I've been
in this situation before.

280
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,387
You ever felt like that?

281
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:11,848
You know, when you met someone

282
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,457
you just knew you were destined
to be in their life forever?

283
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:19,049
That's how I felt
when I met you.

284
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,352
May I have that,

285
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:39,062
the-the vase?

286
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:43,043
Sure.
Yeah.

287
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,565
You give me hope, Mariel.

288
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,752
Mariel. Hey, excuse me.

289
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:09,915
Russell. Uh...

290
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:13,371
I'm working.

291
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:14,632
I'm sorry, honey, I know.

292
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,465
I just, uh,

293
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,081
I called your office-

294
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,881
Um, mr. Underlay,
this is my husband Russell.

295
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:21,931
How do you do?

296
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,438
H- How do you do?

297
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,714
You've been working search
and recovery at the crash site, am I right?

298
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:35,587
That's right.

299
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:38,602
Would you take me there?

300
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,877
- Um, mr. Underlay...
- Tom, please.

301
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,516
Tom... I don't think...

302
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,320
I know the N.T.S.B. People
would like...

303
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,127
- Tom.
- Tom.

304
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:56,740
Um, I think the N.T.S.B. Men
would like to talk to you.

305
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,775
I don't really want
to talk to those guys,

306
00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:59,277
but your husband here
could help me.

307
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:00,964
How about it, Russell?

308
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,410
Would you take me there
Tomorrow?

309
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:07,085
And then afterwards, I'll tell the
N.T.S.B. People everything I know.

310
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,034
I'll be working,
mr. Underlay.

311
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:10,922
Oh. Right.

312
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,611
How about you, doc?

313
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:19,665
Would you mind taking me out
to the crash site Tomorrow?

314
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,920
I don't think
that's a good idea.

315
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:24,519
Why not?

316
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:26,986
The N.T.S.B. Wants answers,
so does the press.

317
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:28,321
I mean,
as a medical professional,

318
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:31,370
aren't you curious
about how I survived this?

319
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:35,401
Would you help me out here?

320
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:42,806
Hey, Russell, could you
ask your wife to help me out?

321
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,524
Help me.

322
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,298
You're going into surgery.
You're gonna be okay, Tom.

323
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,583
Mariel, I have to talk
to you.

324
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:58,107
Now?

325
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:00,774
I'll be
right back, Tom, okay?

326
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,000
It'll be okay. I'll be
right back. Be right back.

327
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:04,120
What?

328
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:04,999
How is he?

329
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:07,283
He's terrible.

330
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,139
He's bleeding to death.

331
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,350
We're about to take him
into surgery.

332
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:10,387
You can't let him die.

333
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,919
I've talked to somebody
who knows far more about this than you do.

334
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:14,459
He told me in other places
where people like you

335
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,896
have been changed
during a hurricane,

336
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:17,781
entire communities
have turned in on themselves.

337
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,125
There's been mass murders,
suicide...

338
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,464
Well, who is this person?

339
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,604
Somebody who's seen it,
who's seen the worst.

340
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:24,318
Baby.

341
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,548
He thinks Tom may be what's
making the difference here

342
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,507
because he's had so many years
to adapt,

343
00:22:28,508 --> 00:22:31,392
he may be acting like a
stabilizing force for the others.

344
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,457
That's crazy.

345
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:33,412
What isn't crazy?

346
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,927
He's not living in the body
he was born in, neither are you,

347
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,004
but he has survived, far longer
than anyone else we know of.

348
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,014
Please, Mariel, even...

349
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:40,804
even if I'm wrong,

350
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:41,779
until we know
more about this,

351
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,437
then you have to do everything
you can to save his life.

352
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:44,310
He's my husband, Russell.

353
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:45,410
What else would I do?

354
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:47,451
What else would I do?

355
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:56,000
So is Underlay gonna make it?

356
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:56,839
I don't know.

357
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:58,611
Did you tell Mariel
what Healy said?

358
00:22:58,612 --> 00:22:59,189
Yeah.

359
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:00,199
And?

360
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,610
I have to go to work.

361
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:02,781
Val just called.

362
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,158
She wants me to do a profile
on Tom at the 11:00.

363
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,424
What are you gonna say?

364
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:10,955
What I know.

365
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:12,694
You know a lot.

366
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,567
Well, what if Tom got shot
because of what he is?

367
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:15,985
What if that means that
there are other people

368
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:17,097
that are in danger now, too?

369
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,849
Mariel might not want
her secret out,

370
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,593
but I'm thinking about
the whole community.

371
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,025
So am I.

372
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,180
Then let me go on television
and tell the truth.

373
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,275
It could be that that's
what's best for everyone.

374
00:23:26,276 --> 00:23:27,215
What about them?

375
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:29,907
We're talking about
their mother, Larkin.

376
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,322
They have to find out
at some point.

377
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,281
You know, Larkin
might be right, Russ.

378
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,562
This could be too big
to keep quiet.

379
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,899
Hell, I mean,
Kira could be one of them.

380
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,801
One of what?

381
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,166
What are we talking about, here?

382
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:53,104
What?

383
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:54,531
Come on, Dave, yeah, fine.

384
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:55,766
These people have changed, okay?

385
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,827
But what have they done?

386
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:58,821
Until I know for sure
that they're a threat to us,

387
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:00,203
I'm not gonna start
hanging everybody.

388
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:01,599
All right.

389
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:05,673
Listen, can you stay here
and watch the kids?

390
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:06,416
Where you going?

391
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:07,873
Healy wants
to see me in person.

392
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:10,775
What? Hey, what if Tom
doesn't make it?

393
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,396
Well, then maybe
none of this will matter.

394
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,580
His temperature's
spiking.

395
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:19,624
It might be better
if you waited outside.

396
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,830
No, I want to stay here
with him.

397
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,041
Pulse ox is 80.

398
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,322
He's having a reaction
to the blood.

399
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:24,137
Pressure's dropping.

400
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:24,899
Stop the transfusion.

401
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,176
He's not getting
enough oxygen.

402
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:26,818
No!

403
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:27,844
It's not-Not-

404
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:29,582
We can try autologous

405
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,569
transfusion with a cell saver.

406
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,266
No! No! No! No!

407
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,687
Give him my blood.

408
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:35,788
Yours?

409
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,129
We're the same type.

410
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,921
But what difference-

411
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:40,277
Please. Just do it.

412
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,869
- I- I really have to go.
- No, Mariel, please.

413
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:45,906
Please, wait.

414
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:48,407
When are you coming home?

415
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:50,588
When I can.

416
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:53,470
You've been here
for almost 16 hours.

417
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,216
Your son misses you,
I miss you.

418
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,409
Just tell me what's wrong.

419
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,901
I have told you. I've been
telling you for so long,

420
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:01,956
but you're
just not hearing me.

421
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:03,671
I know. You're unhappy, okay?

422
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,796
I'm sorry. I'm unhappy.

423
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,294
But we can work this out.

424
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,131
Killing yourself at work
isn't the answer.

425
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:11,859
If you would just-Hey-

426
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,678
Come on, come on. Come with me.

427
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:18,667
Let's talk
to father Scanlon. Okay?

428
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:27,212
I love you, Russell, and I love
our little boy more than anything,

429
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:32,065
but I haven't been happy
for a really long time.

430
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,186
And right now, I would
just really rather be here,

431
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:35,086
I'm sorry.

432
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:56,177
When I first heard the news, I
thought you might be the shooter.

433
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,786
Wouldn't be the first time
the ex-Husband

434
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,638
has gone after the new guy.

435
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:09,993
You want some coffee?

436
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:11,260
No, thanks.

437
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,368
What happened to her?

438
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:18,444
She's dead.

439
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,449
You know who killed her?

440
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:28,372
His name is Eli Szura.

441
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:32,480
He used to do contract work
for the C.I.A. With me.

442
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,588
We were sent down to cuba
right after hurricane Charley

443
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:37,362
to find out about these
lights in the water

444
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,027
and see how we might
manage them.

445
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:40,731
Manage them how?

446
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,103
For national security.

447
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:43,565
So the government knows?

448
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:46,061
Of course, and I'm sure th're
aware of what happened here.

449
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,605
Well, why aren't they doing
anything to stop it?

450
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,855
That's a good question.

451
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:52,449
Szura and I were hired so that the
military could keep their hands clean.

452
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,905
It's like they want to keep
tabs on this.

453
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,103
They want
to stay on top of it,

454
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,175
but if it blows up
in their faces,

455
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:58,733
then they don't have
to take responsibility for it.

456
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,155
That's the reason why I think
Underlay is so important.

457
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,742
Now he seemed to have found
a way to take care of things,

458
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:04,953
to control things-

459
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:08,230
He's kept his wife at bay, he
started that survivors group,

460
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,776
he might have even convinced
the military that they need him.

461
00:27:10,777 --> 00:27:12,183
But if this turns into cuba
or brazil...

462
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:13,871
then a lot of good people
are gonna be dead,

463
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:15,477
but the government'll
still have deniability

464
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:18,338
because they didn't do it,
the aliens did.

465
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,969
Oh, my god. I've gotta
get my family out of here.

466
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,050
Where are you gonna go?

467
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,116
You think this is gonna end
here in homestead?

468
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,814
If these hybrids become
the majority,

469
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:28,115
this is just the beginning.

470
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:31,023
No, as far as I see it,
you have only one choice-

471
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,238
Your choice is to stay here
and fight this.

472
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:34,902
You kill these things
in the water,

473
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,776
stop this from growing and find out
what the military's real agenda is.

474
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:42,981
What about my ex-Wife?

475
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:43,820
What about her?

476
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,890
What, are you suggesting
I kill her, too?

477
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,558
Russell, I don't think
you're hearing me.

478
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,708
We're in a fragile
situation here.

479
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:51,989
That could explode
at any time,

480
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:53,600
and if Szura has his way,

481
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:55,295
that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

482
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:56,595
Well, whose side is he on?

483
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:59,330
His own. He got taken
when we were in cuba

484
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,862
and he's been hunting me ever since.

485
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:04,595
He'll kill anybody he views
as a threat to his own safety,

486
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,506
that may even include
Underlay.

487
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:07,439
But Underlay's a hybrid.

488
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,030
So? Doesn't mean
they're the same.

489
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:12,009
Szura was a sociopathic
son of a bitch

490
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,190
before he got taken
and this h only empowered him.

491
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,085
If Underlay is Saddam,
Szura is Zarqawi.

492
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:18,975
He's not gonna sit back
and let the military run things.

493
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:20,336
He's gonna
want to take charge.

494
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:24,304
How is it that you
weren't taken?

495
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:26,504
I got spit out.

496
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,429
I'm not a well man, Russell.

497
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,801
I haven't been for a long time.

498
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,499
They don't take you
when you're sick.

499
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:37,850
Survival of the fittest.

500
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,579
My wife is about to go
on the news at 11:00

501
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,123
to blow the whistle
on this whole thing.

502
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:49,857
Then you need to find a way
to stop her...

503
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:50,511
before szura does it for you.

504
00:28:57,998 --> 00:28:59,564
I don't want to play this
like an obit.

505
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:00,920
I want us to find something

506
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:03,469
that underscores Tom's
commitment to the community

507
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,071
and his years of service.

508
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:08,126
We have a lot of footage
going all the way back to '96.

509
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,412
This is his first
press conference

510
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:11,805
right after
the plane crash.

511
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,487
I thought you wanted me live
outside the hospital.

512
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:14,049
I do.

513
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,457
We'll run a hero piece

514
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,611
and then you can do
the wrap up from there.

515
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:18,963
He should be out
of surgery by then.

516
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:21,581
You're very close to Tom,
aren't you?

517
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:23,942
He's helped me tremendously.

518
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:26,102
Since the hurricane?

519
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:29,474
I can put someone else
on this

520
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,549
if you don't think
you can be objective.

521
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:33,377
No. I can be objective.

522
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,784
I'll want to see it
before it runs.

523
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,187
Thank you
for bringing me here.

524
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:40,384
I have to go.

525
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:41,444
I know.

526
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:45,887
I want you to remember this.

527
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,826
No matter what happens
in the future, remember this.

528
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,121
Remember how it was
when we first met.

529
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:57,669
Tom...

530
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,124
There's gonna be a lot
of rough days ahead,

531
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,305
a lot of changes.

532
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:02,525
The only way that
we'll get through it...

533
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:06,615
is if we remember.

534
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:34,467
Hi.

535
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:39,913
You're here?

536
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:42,044
So are you.

537
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:46,958
You saved me...

538
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,102
again.

539
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:51,700
You saved you.

540
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:55,106
The doctors say they've never seen
a body fight so hard to live.

541
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,157
You're already healing, Tom.

542
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,057
You gave me your blood?

543
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:05,525
How did you know
that's what I needed?

544
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:07,616
I didn't.

545
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,350
Where's my clothes?

546
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:17,157
They're in my office.

547
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:18,317
My keys...

548
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:20,318
Should be with them.

549
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,804
Get my keys...

550
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:24,336
and go home.

551
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:26,704
Why?

552
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,607
'Cause I want you
to get me something...

553
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:32,014
from the closet.

554
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:33,641
What's in it?

555
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:36,345
Everything.

556
00:33:50,223 --> 00:33:52,550
Their report is two minutes,
and then we go live!

557
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:56,197
All right! Hey, he made it,
you know? Underlay.

558
00:33:56,486 --> 00:33:58,368
Just came over the wire,
he made it through surgery.

559
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,914
I think you might want
to lead with that...

560
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:00,563
Yeah.

561
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,161
Larkin!

562
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,215
Go set up,
I'll catch up to you.

563
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:07,234
Look,
you can't do this.

564
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:08,908
I have to.

565
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,461
No, I just got back
from Healy's.

566
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:12,576
Russell, I don't even know
who this Healy person is.

567
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:13,378
Okay, it doesn't matter,
all right?

568
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,047
The botTom line is
if you go public with this,

569
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:16,002
no one's gonna believe you

570
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:17,515
because no one's gonna
back the story.

571
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:18,675
You were right all along.

572
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:19,917
The military is involved.

573
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,337
So you're not gonna be
saving any lives

574
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:23,639
by talking now, Larkin,
but you might be killing us.

575
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,392
Russell.

576
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:26,281
There's a guy out here that
doesn't want this story told.

577
00:34:26,282 --> 00:34:29,588
I understand how important it is
to you to protect Mariel, I do.

578
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,863
No, it's not
about Mariel anymore.

579
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:32,239
But I can't
worry about her anymore.

580
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,425
I have to worry about us
and our baby.

581
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:41,012
And I'm sorry if this means that
the kids are going to get hurt.

582
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,407
It's gonna hurt all of us,
not just the kids, Larkin.

583
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,378
I have to do this.

584
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:10,649
I'll be right outside.

585
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:11,916
Thank you.

586
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:31,798
I was so scared, daddy.

587
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:33,270
I know. I'm sorry...

588
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:35,762
for everything.

589
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:37,259
You look amazing, Tom.

590
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,071
I can't believe you were shot.

591
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,852
I appreciate you guys
hangin' around,

592
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:42,363
but it's gettin'
kinda late, you know?

593
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,774
Maybe you oughta
be gettin' home.

594
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:48,331
Sheriff, mr. Varon
would like to see you.

595
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:49,910
Send him in.

596
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:54,080
Hey.

597
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:55,798
We tried to find you.

598
00:36:58,211 --> 00:36:59,817
Can you guys
give us a minute?

599
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,305
Everybody was just
taking off.

600
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:02,802
All right, good night.

601
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,210
I'll see you all soon.

602
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:07,841
Good night, babe.

603
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:08,463
Good-Bye, Jess.

604
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:09,433
Good night, Tom.

605
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,315
Tom, I need you to do
something for me.

606
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:22,792
My wife's about to go live
with a story

607
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:24,185
i don't think you want told,

608
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,615
a story bigger than
your shooting.

609
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,735
And for now, it's a story
I'm willing to keep to myself,

610
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:31,158
but I'm gonna
need your help.

611
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:41,905
Is that
the background you want?

612
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:43,421
- Yeah, this looks great.
- All right.

613
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,330
And so we're good,
two minutes or so.

614
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,461
Larkin.

615
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:48,666
Did you hear Tom's
gonna be all right?

616
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,340
Yeah, it's great news.

617
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,254
Larkin, look...

618
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,516
he's a good man.

619
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:04,156
I know you've probably heard
a lot of strange things

620
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,879
about both of us lately,
but he's a good man.

621
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:11,647
90 seconds.

622
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,043
Yeah.

623
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,059
- Russell still here?
- Uh, he's inside.

624
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:18,337
Mariel?

625
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:22,272
I was going through
some video footage tonight,

626
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:23,163
and I...

627
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:25,845
and I saw you...

628
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:29,182
here,
about nine years ago...

629
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:31,945
with Tom.

630
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:36,567
I didn't realize you two
went so far back.

631
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:44,225
You were still Married
to Russell then, weren't you?

632
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:50,353
I was.

633
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,810
He's a good man, too.

634
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:56,733
Yeah.

635
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,903
You know I had a secret
about who I am,

636
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:03,125
I begged him
to keep for me...

637
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,038
but he wouldn't do it.

638
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:09,906
He told you because
you were more important.

639
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,501
Hey, Larkin.

640
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:21,867
We're gonna go live
in about ten seconds. I'm sorry.

641
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,172
In eight, seven,

642
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,383
six...

643
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,551
five...

644
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:38,174
four, three, two, one.

645
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:06,375
Russell came by and asked me to call Val
at the news station to try to get me to...

646
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,856
convinceer to pull the plug
on Larkin's big...

647
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:13,508
Story.

648
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,588
I couldn't reach her.

649
00:40:22,926 --> 00:40:24,503
Did you find the box?

650
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:26,733
Yeah.

651
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,799
I don't suppose
you opened that, did you?

652
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,727
I did.

653
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,607
And what did you find?

654
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,343
Hope.

655
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:03,522
In recent weeks, since hurricane
eve has hit us all so hard...

656
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,058
turning so many lives
upside down.

657
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:09,751
We've all had to reassess...

658
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,715
reassess what's
really important,

659
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:15,880
and what's really important
is family...

660
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,235
and the people we love.

661
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:22,875
And maybe that's what Tom
Underlay understood all along.

662
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,703
And maybe that's what got him
through all these years.

663
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:30,419
This is Larkin Groves
with the channel 7 I-Team,

664
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:32,490
reporting live
from homestead hospital.

665
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:34,418
And we're clear.

666
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:42,965
Hey.

667
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,551
I love you.

668
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,687
I don't know if I can
stay here, Russell.

669
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:57,137
I don't have to
tell the story,

670
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,892
but I don't know
if I can stay here.

671
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,443
It's okay.

672
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:05,252
It's okay. Come on.
Let's go home.
