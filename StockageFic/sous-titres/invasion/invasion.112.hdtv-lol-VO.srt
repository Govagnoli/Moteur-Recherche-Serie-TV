1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,409
previously on "invasion"...

2
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:02,387
What's wrong ?

3
00:00:02,388 --> 00:00:03,464
I don't trust her anymore.

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,367
I'm not sure she trusts herself.

5
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:07,735
Well, you're not married to her.

6
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:09,302
You have a lot to learn.

7
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,976
There's a little work camp down in the glades.

8
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,533
I'm gonna send you there for a while, all right ?

9
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:15,742
I think yore in a lot of denial.

10
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,413
You're just trying to control everything.

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,150
What is that ?

12
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,003
Your husband's skeleton.

13
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,687
I wanted to be your wife and a good mother

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,011
to Jesse and Rose, and you have taken that
away from me.

15
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:30,191
No, I haven't.

16
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:31,067
I'm leaving.

17
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:32,709
You can't leave me now !

18
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,806
Even though we've all been through the same experience,

19
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,212
none of us are the same.

20
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:37,591
How do you know so much ?

21
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:39,995
He's taken them. Tom's taken the kids.

22
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:41,502
- Where ? - I don't know.

23
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:43,400
Invasion 1x12-

24
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:47,326
RaceMan Ez, Keno83, RonanaSplit & Lucile76

25

www. forom. com

26
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:53,534
Your problem, christina,

27
00:00:53,897 --> 00:00:55,940
is you're just not gettin' with the program.

28
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:59,293
Sheriff talked to you after you abandoned
your baby...

29
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:02,262
told you how to behave...

30
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:05,085
but you didn't listen.

31
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,212
You just went home and killed your mother-in-
law.

32
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:12,551
That was not good.

33
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,323
Why are we stopping ?

34
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:51,534
No !

35
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:53,628
No ! No !

36
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,162
You bastards !

37
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:09,596
How long have the kids been missing ?

38
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,202
I don't know. I just got home.

39
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:13,260
I thought you guys had power.

40
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,840
We did. Tom must have taken the generator.

41
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,751
- Why would he do that ?
- I don't know.

42
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:22,638
Same reason he took the kids, maybe-to prove
a point.

43
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,475
All of Rose's sweaters are still here.

44
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:26,872
What does the note say ?

45
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,591
"Mariel, the children and i are going on a little adventure.

46
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:34,844
"Should be good for everybody. Talk to you soon. "

47
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:36,428
- Was he planning a trip ?
- Not that I know of.

48
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,115
Did you guys have a fight ?

49
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:42,054
Huh ?

50
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:44,836
Mariel...

51
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,294
Why didn't you radio and tell me you were gonna drop the kids off ?

52
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,244
I didn't drop them off-

53
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:49,890
Larkin did, and only because Tom called

54
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,264
and said you two had plans.

55
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:52,674
- He called her ?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,974
So did she tell him you think we're aliens ?

57
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,822
Come on, I didn't say that.

58
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,457
You showed me a skeleton you claimed was my
husband

59
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,682
and told me you don't think I'm in my own
body anymore.

60
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,007
Did you say any of that to Tom ?

61
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,773
No, not yet.

62
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,548
Well, what did you say ?

63
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:15,744
Will you stop walking away from me ?!

64
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:24,176
I told him that I was leaving him... with
the kids.

65
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:25,435
Why ?

66
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,443
Because of what he did to me.

67
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,309
He took me to the water the night of the
hurricane.

68
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,527
He said he wanted to show me the lights.

69
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,253
Now if I have changed, he's the reason.

70
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,566
- He admitted this ?
- Yeah.

71
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,615
- Does he know that I know ?
- No.

72
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,577
- Does he know that...
- that I kissed you ?

73
00:03:57,694 --> 00:04:01,530
No. Our secret is safe.

74
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,288
Aren't I a good ex-wife ?

75
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:04,784
Where's your radio ?

76
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,904
That's what I'm looking for.

77
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,541
So how many people know about me besides
your brother-in-law ?

78
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,515
None.

79
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,483
Not even your wife ?

80
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,839
No.

81
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,647
Have you called your divorce lawyer yet ?

82
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,042
Why would I do that ?

83
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,267
To get full custody of Jesse and Rose.

84
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:20,601
You should have a good shot now.

85
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,760
There aren't a lot of alien rights groups in this state.

86
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,991
Hey, whatever's happened to you,

87
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:29,053
you're still their mother.

88
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,718
Then promise me you won't tell anyone about me

89
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,028
until I know what I am.

90
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,566
I don't want people speculating,

91
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,143
and I certainly don't want my children to be afraid of me.

92
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,879
You promise me that ?

93
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,097
When I know the kids are safe.

94
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:57,513
Damn it.

95
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,837
His office is locked.

96
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,022
How about a window ?

97
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,157
There isn't one.

98
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:04,540
His office has no windows ?

99
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,733
Maybe he's a vampire, too.

100
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,700
Looks like it's just your house.

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,576
You got phone service ?

102
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,444
We didn't.

103
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:54,939
Mariel ?

104
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:56,846
I can't find the phone.

105
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:58,711
Where are you ?

106
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,463
In the bedroom.

107
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,105
You only have one phone ?

108
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,737
There's another in Tom's office.

109
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,029
I found it !

110
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:19,788
Hello ?

111
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,084
Hello ?

112
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,238
What's in here ?

113
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,212
I think it's where Tom keeps his guns.

114
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:29,467
You think ?

115
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,443
Well, I've never actually been in there.

116
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,377
What if he keeps his radio in here, too ?

117
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,409
I don't have keys for it.

118
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,471
Do you have a key for the office ?

119
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:49,935
Maybe.

120
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:51,694
- Can I see the phone ?
- Why ?

121
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,700
'Cause I want to make a phone call.

122
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,655
Larkin, it's the phone !

123
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,994
Hey, the phone's ringing !

124
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:05,604
I know.

125
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,343
The phone is ringing.

126
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,592
Hello ?

127
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:10,676
Honey ?

128
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:11,957
Russell.

129
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:13,037
We got power back yet ?

130
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,540
Uh... no, no power.

131
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,075
Where are you ?

132
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,489
I've been trying to radio you.

133
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,377
You left without saying good-bye.

134
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,832
I'm at Mariel's. I was just worried about
the kids.

135
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,280
I told you, I just dropped them off.

136
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,144
I know, but Tom took them someplace.

137
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,198
Russell.

138
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,210
Is there a problem ?

139
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,199
No. No, there's no problem.

140
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,152
I was just-

141
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:36,680
I just wanted to see them, that's all.

142
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,429
Well, if they aren't there, are you coming home ?

143
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,394
Yeah. I'll be home soon.

144
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,700
- Russell, what's going on ?
- Nothing. Everything's okay.

145
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,223
I'll see you in a little bit, okay, honey ?

146
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,065
Okay.

147
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,428
All right.

148
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,342
I can't lie to my wife.

149
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:18,640
You're not lying.

150
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,789
You're just not telling her about me or Tom

151
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,199
until I have some answers.

152
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,011
- She's my wife.
- She's also a reporter.

153
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,428
She has an obligation to tell the truth,

154
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,967
especially if it has greater ramifications
for the town.

155
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,235
Well, maybe she should.

156
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:32,968
You may be fighting this thing, but the
other people,

157
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,083
the people in the survivors' group-what are they planning ?

158
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:39,124
What do you mean ? They plotting to
overthrow the world ?

159
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:40,921
I don't know. Do you ?

160
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:47,064
Honestly, I don't think they realize what's
happened to them.

161
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,814
I didn't.

162
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,864
Maybe they're waiting for your husband to tell them.

163
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,852
- Russell... - Okay, wait.

164
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,428
Hello ?

165
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,172
Hello ?

166
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,426
<i>Where's your husband ?</i>

167
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,173
Who is this ?

168
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:21,491
<i>You've poisoned my house. You've poisoned my
house.</i>

169
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,409
<i>The number you are...</i>

170
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,252
Give me the key.

171
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:12,970
Who's his decorator ?

172
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,020
He's been collecting this stuf for a long time.

173
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:30,553
Tom ? Tom, it's Russell. Are you there ?

174
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:37,618
Hello ?

175
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,012
<i>Mariel.</i>

176
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,363
Tom. Where are you ?

177
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,519
I'm with the kids.

178
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,067
Didn't you get my note ?

179
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:44,897
You didn't tell me where you were going.

180
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,984
Why am I on the speaker, honey ?

181
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,053
We have phone service again.

182
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,280
Power, too.

183
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,508
Yeah, how about that ?

184
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,055
Did you make this happen ?

185
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,241
With a little help from our friends.

186
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:03,605
But we're the only house with electricity, Tom.

187
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:06,001
<i>Probably just a touch for me.</i>

188
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:07,781
I'm sure a lot of areas have power now,

189
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:09,527
and I know cell phones are workin'.

190
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,415
- Where are you ?
- I'm with the kids.

191
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:14,108
<i>Can I speak to them ?</i>

192
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,465
Not right now.

193
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,802
Tom, come on.

194
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:18,704
<i>I'll have them call you later.</i>

195
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:20,066
Why are you doing this ?

196
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,144
Because I think you need some time

197
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:23,380
to think about what's really important in your life.

198
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,225
- Tom
- I'll see you soon, baby.

199
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,168
<i>Tom, listen, don't hang-</i>

200
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:52,669
Who's ready for dinner ?

201
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,929
Me !

202
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,674
Yeah ? Hot dogs, hamburgers and more comin' up.

203
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,029
Yay !

204
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,487
This is a really cool idea, dad.

205
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:02,962
Yeah. Kinda different, huh ?

206
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:04,368
Who owns this place ?

207
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,287
Friend of mine.

208
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,584
Downstairs-pool table, music, video games.

209
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,035
Rosie, there's a karaoke machine right in the closet over there,

210
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,566
all right, baby, if you want to sing later.

211
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,459
You're gonna do karaoke ?

212
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,329
You never heard my version of "my way" ?

213
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,492
No.

214
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,882
I can't believe that.

215
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,523
- Here you go, Tom.
- Thanks, Jess.

216
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,338
Chilly out here tonight, huh ?

217
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,274
There you go, buddy.

218
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,903
Did you guys find a movie you want to watch ?

219
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:48,024
Uh... we were thinking "the shining. "

220
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,229
Might be a little intense for Rose.

221
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,522
She wants to do karaoke with you.

222
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,808
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just watch her.

223
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,960
So... why are we really here, Tom ?

224
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:06,889
What do you mean ?

225
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:09,572
Did you and mom get in a fight or something ?

226
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:15,366
You just hustled us out of the house pretty
fast, so...

227
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:19,577
you know, she's not here.

228
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:23,768
Look, Jess, you know your mom had a rough
time after the hurricane,

229
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,252
and it's definitely put a strain on our relationship,

230
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,714
so I just figure why not give her a little
break, you know ?

231
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:31,654
So you just...

232
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:36,725
called your friend on a dime and asked if
you could borrow his cabin ?

233
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:42,292
Yeah. He's a big developer up north, hardly uses the place.

234
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,876
If he's a developer, then...

235
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:54,029
why does he have a boat from the sheriff's department ?

236
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:02,226
Let me know if you need anything else, Tom.

237
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:15,326
He won't hurt the kids.

238
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,357
How do you know ?

239
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:18,819
Because he's not angry at them, he's angry
at me.

240
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,573
yeah, but he's using them to punish you.

241
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:23,286
He's not going to hurt them.

242
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,186
No, Russell. If it's Tom, he'll know you're here.

243
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,242
I don't care.

244
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,717
- Hello ?
- Hey, Russ, it's me.

245
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:38,121
- Who is it ?
- It's Dave.

246
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:39,992
Tell him not to say anything about this.

247
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,019
I'm gonna go call Tom's station,

248
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,607
see if they know where he is.

249
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,916
What's up, Dave ?

250
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,518
Hey, you gotta tell Larkin what's goin' on.

251
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:48,230
Why ?

252
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,724
Why ? 'Cause she thinks you're spending too
much time with Mariel.

253
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,051
She doesn't understand why it's such a big
deal that Tom took his kids.

254
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:54,778
Did you say anhing to her ?

255
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,400
What, that Underlay's a walking corpse,

256
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:58,642
that sometimes these creatures are known to
eat their young ?

257
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,294
No, Russ, I didn't think that was my place.

258
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:02,587
Well, you're right, it's not, so don't say anything yet.

259
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:04,122
Man, I don't think you're hearing me here.

260
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:06,374
She's worried that something's going on
between you and Mariel.

261
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,154
Get it ?

262
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,087
Did she say that ?

263
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:11,327
Yeah. Yeah, she said she came home early
from her trip 'cause she missed you.

264
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,894
She's waitin' in the bedroom all lingeried
and pregnant,

265
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,324
and you just blew her off.

266
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:15,253
Hold on a second.

267
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,070
No, no, Russ, no, no, no. I can't hold on. Russ !

268
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:24,373
Russ ! Russ !

269
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,551
all right, who wants turkey ?
Who wants beef ?

270
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,303
- I want turkey.
- You got it, honey.

271
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:11,950
Beef.

272
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,398
- All right. Sweetheart ?
- I'll just have salad.

273
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,633
No, come on. You gotta eat something.

274
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,236
- You're gettin' too skinny.
- No, I'm not.

275
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:19,323
Yeah, yeah, you are.

276
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,523
You're beautiful, but you're gettin' skinny.

277
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:22,160
You know what ? I forgot the sodas in the
car.

278
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,403
Um, lettuce, Tomatoes on the table. Help
yourself, all right ?

279
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:31,760
Does any of this seem weird to you ?

280
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,602
What do you mean ?

281
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,800
Since when does he care about hangin' out with us ?

282
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,173
It's a vacation.

283
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:39,204
Yeah, but when are we comin' back ?

284
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,295
Who cares ? We don't have school.

285
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:46,636
- Are you not surprised that our mother's not here ? - She needed some time.

286
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,180
- Now who told you that ?
- Daddy Tom.

287
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,632
Mommy and daddy have been having some
problems,

288
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:59,404
so daddy Tom thought it would be best to
give them some time.

289
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:03,406
And since when does daddy Tom know about our
dad's problems ?

290
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,178
And why does he care ?

291
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:36,015
Do you think we should go look for games
after we finish eating ?

292
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,190
The ocean's so cool.

293
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,814
And there's a boat down there.

294
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:44,446
Really ? Maybe if you give my dad...

295
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,026
What happened ?

296
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,127
Oh, my god. What happened ?

297
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,682
I'm gonna grab a towel.

298
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,480
Answer it.

299
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:16,825
Hello ?

300
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:17,801
Mariel, Mariel.

301
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:18,494
<i>Dave.</i>

302
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,910
Hey, is Russell still there ?

303
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:20,705
It's Dave.

304
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,079
No.

305
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,381
- Can he call you back ?
- No. No, I gotta
tell him something right now.

306
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:25,076
It's kind of important, please.

307
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:28,532
- He'll call you back, Dave.
- Mariel ! Damn it !

308
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:30,527
Who did this to you ?

309
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,771
There was two guys outside.

310
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:33,716
They were watching the house.

311
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:34,777
One of them had a cell phone.

312
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:35,927
I think he may have been calling.

313
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,151
We gotta get you to the hospital.

314
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:39,315
No, no.

315
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,779
Just get me some ice.

316
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,786
What's going on here, Russell ?

317
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:49,962
Why is this happening to us ?

318
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,922
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

319
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:58,597
We're all gonna be fine.

320
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:23,566
What happened ?

321
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,469
I'm gonna go grab some ice.

322
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:28,652
Here.

323
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:32,958
Russell, what happened to you ?

324
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,007
I got into a fight.

325
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:34,582
With who ?

326
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,825
I don't know.

327
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,343
Hey, close the door.

328
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,285
Lock it. Hurry.

329
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:48,138
What are you doing here ?

330
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:49,931
I was worried about you.

331
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:52,809
Here's the ice.

332
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,297
I'm gonna go get the first aid kit.

333
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:12,369
These cuts are deep.

334
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:17,438
Sweetheart, it's gonna be fine, okay ?

335
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,269
Everything's gonna be okay.

336
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,385
I know. That's what you just told her.

337
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:32,526
<i>Regrets, I've had a few</i>

338
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:38,133
<i>But then again, too few to mention</i>

339
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:44,502
<i>I did what I had to do</i>

340
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:47,019
<i>and saw it through</i>

341
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:51,107
<i>without exemption</i>

342
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,131
<i>I plan...</i>

343
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,744
I need to talk to you.

344
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,026
Um, meet me downstairs in two minutes.

345
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,137
<i>... One more much more than this</i>

346
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:12,464
<i>I did it my way</i>

347
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,255
If Tom called and said everything was okay,

348
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:17,654
then why are you so worried ?

349
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,669
Because we don't know where he went.

350
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:22,545
Did you ask him ?

351
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,147
He wouldn't tell me.

352
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:32,022
We got into a fight.

353
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,281
I'm gonna go get another ice pack.

354
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:48,647
What is going on here ?

355
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:50,302
I told you, I came by to see the kids.

356
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:52,956
But the kids aren't here, and they haven't
been here.

357
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,225
Russell, what did Tom and Mariel fight about
?

358
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:57,736
Honey...

359
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:00,631
is Tom angry because you're spending too much time with his wife ?

360
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:07,793
No.

361
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,679
- No, Larkin, don't get that.
- Why not ?

362
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,322
- Don't !
- What is everyone hiding here ?

363
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:11,923
Hello ?

364
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,369
What ?

365
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,334
Someone just said I betrayed them.

366
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:20,781
Give me that.

367
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:22,880
- Who is this ?
- Put it on speaker.

368
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,396
Who is this ?

369
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:26,348
What do you want ?

370
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:27,546
<i>for this to be over.</i>

371
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,540
Yeah, well, so do we.

372
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,406
<i>I know what you two are doing,</i>

373
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,276
<i>and I am not gonna let it happen.</i>

374
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,744
<i>You betrayed us all.</i>

375
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:35,061
Listen, you son of a bitch !

376
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:46,383
- I have to go.
- No, Larkin, wait.

377
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,988
I have to tell her.

378
00:22:58,609 --> 00:22:59,528
Larkin.

379
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:02,600
Russell, I'm sorry, but this is all just a little bit too much for me.

380
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:03,468
Please...

381
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:04,210
Who was that ?

382
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,413
I don't know.

383
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:08,631
The reason I'm so concerned about Tom being with the kids

384
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:11,591
is because he may not be human anymore.

385
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:18,237
After his plane crash, one of these creatures

386
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:22,014
in the water got ahold of him, and he's been changed.

387
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:25,292
He's not who he was, and he may be driven to hurt the kids.

388
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,700
This is crazy.

389
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:29,181
Yeah, I know, but it's real, and it's
happened before.

390
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:31,430
In other parts of the world, where these
lights have shown up in the water,

391
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:35,036
the people
who've come in contact with them, they've
been cloned or replicated.

392
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,109
Somehow, they've been given new genetic information,

393
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,682
and many of these people have killed their
own children.

394
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:42,823
My god.

395
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,135
Mariel is one of them, too.

396
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:49,750
She's fighting it, and I am trying to support her,

397
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,645
but it's obviously very difficult.

398
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,964
She begged me not to tell you.

399
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:57,144
Why ?

400
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:00,355
She was afraid that you'd go public.

401
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,022
Well, I think she would be worried about
more than that.

402
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:06,015
She is.

403
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:07,347
We both are, believe me.

404
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:09,512
Well, you both seem to be coping pretty well.

405
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,143
Honey-

406
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:10,825
I have to go.

407
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,411
Okay, honey...

408
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:18,350
I promise you that I wildo something about
this,

409
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:21,535
but I have to make sure that my children are
safe.

410
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:27,787
Me, too.

411
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:43,530
What, Kira, I told you what I saw,

412
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:45,155
and are you not concerned ?

413
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,930
What you saw sounds like luggage.

414
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,777
No, no.

415
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:53,503
A big black duffel bag.

416
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,185
Big.

417
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,680
So ? What does that mean ?

418
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,284
It means that I want to know what's inside of the thing.

419
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,637
What do you think is inside of it ?

420
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,061
I don't know.

421
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,142
But this whole trip is crazy. I
don't believe we're here on vacation.

422
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:16,875
and I think that there's something more going on here.

423
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,900
Your dad says that this place is owned by a
developer,

424
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:24,367
but then, there's a sheriff's department
boat outside.

425
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:25,652
So what ?

426
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,525
Look, maybe you take a lot of trips with
your parents,

427
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,569
but I'm lucky if my dad even talks to me,

428
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,400
so I'm not gonna start complaining.

429
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:35,847
I like this.

430
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:39,774
I like this movie, too.

431
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,338
You'll ruin the surprise.

432
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:30,368
What are you doing here, Jesse ?

433
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:35,053
I, um, I-I was curious about what was in
this bag.

434
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:37,377
- Curious ?
- Yeah.

435
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,884
You saw me bring that bag in here, didn't you ?

436
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:45,362
Daddy Tom, can we do another song ?

437
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:48,048
Yeah, dad, where did you put the, um, the...

438
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:52,469
Jesse ?

439
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:56,167
I didn't want to do this now, but...

440
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:59,025
guess I don't have a choice.

441
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,647
- Open it.
- Open it ?

442
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:09,239
Yeah, open it. Help him out, guys.

443
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:27,838
Presents ?

444
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:29,981
Presents.

445
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:32,382
That one in the middle there, that's for you, rosie,

446
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:34,759
and the one with the red bow, that's for you, honey.

447
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,230
The other one's for you, Jess.

448
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:37,680
What's the occasion ?

449
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:39,965
It's been exactly a month since the hurricane.

450
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,458
This is my way of showing you guys how proud
I am

451
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,654
for the way that you've handled everything.

452
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:50,637
- A book ?
- "Robin hood. "

453
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,771
- Wow.
- That was my mom's.

454
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,698
She used to read that to me, and I used to
read that to Kira.

455
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,232
That was your mom's.

456
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:16,205
And that's my favorite picture of her.

457
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,043
We took that the day that she found out

458
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:20,817
that she was gonna have a baby.

459
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,485
Dad...

460
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,354
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, honey.

461
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,196
It's a gun.

462
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:42,483
That's a colt 76.

463
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,496
My dad gave me one when I was just about
your age,

464
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,019
and when you're ready, I'll teach you how to
use it,

465
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,229
with your dad's permission, of course.

466
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:54,156
It's really cool, Tom.

467
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:55,310
Thanks.

468
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,441
You're welcome, Jesse.

469
00:28:58,564 --> 00:28:59,818
Now if you guys would give me a minute,

470
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,332
I'll meet you upstairs, and we'll all call
your mom

471
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,965
and say good night, all right ?

472
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:06,486
Okay ? All right.

473
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:16,775
Hey, Tom ?

474
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:19,025
Yeah ?

475
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:22,151
I'm sorry I scwed up your surprise.

476
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:26,045
It all worked out, right ?

477
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,292
Yeah.

478
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,471
All right, I'm gone.

479
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,488
What ?

480
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:15,739
Tom's office is sending someone over to take a report.

481
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,608
Does anyone know where he is ?

482
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:20,845
No.

483
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:23,971
Sorry about Larkin.

484
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,710
I'm sorry that she left.

485
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:30,418
Yeah, I don't think she trusts me anymore.

486
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:32,871
You haven't given her any reason not to trust you.

487
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes, I have.

488
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:39,459
Has Tom read all these books ?

489
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:42,469
I don't know.

490
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:45,861
Well, he sure looks like a guy plotting to
take over the world.

491
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:53,675
- Hello ?
- It's me.

492
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,199
Oh, my god. Tom...

493
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,724
Look, I know you've got company.

494
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,749
But I need to talk to you.

495
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,954
Alone.

496
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,251
Give me the phone.

497
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:05,064
- He has to talk to me alone.
- I don't give a damn.

498
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,019
Russell.

499
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,047
Just get the door !

500
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,782
<i>Bring my kids back !</i>

501
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:15,473
You gotta tell me what's going on, Tom.

502
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:18,392
<i>What do I have to do to get your ex-husband
out of our lives ?</i>

503
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:31,922
- You Mr. Varon ?
- Yeah.

504
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:34,781
I'm deputy Munger, this is deputy Palmateer.

505
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,533
I understand we had a little problem here
tonight.

506
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:40,536
You tangled with a prowler ?

507
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:46,177
What happened to you ?

508
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:50,304
Mr. Varon, would you like to file a report
with the sheriff ?

509
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:54,800
I have a feeling the sheriff knows
everything he needs to know already.

510
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:56,718
All right, then.

511
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:57,977
You have a good night,

512
00:31:57,978 --> 00:32:01,354
and be sure to give our regards to ms.
Underlay.

513
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,528
He's gonna bring the kids back here first thing in the morning.

514
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:35,789
- Where have they been ?
- His friend's cabin.

515
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,910
- And he's bringing them back for sure ?
- Yes.

516
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:39,306
Well, what did you say ?

517
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:43,307
That I wanted them home, so he's bringing them.

518
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:44,830
Hold on a second.

519
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,891
He put us through hell, and he did it for a
reason.

520
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,754
Why is he suddenly backing off now ? What
did you say ?

521
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:52,652
I said that...

522
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,140
I loved him.

523
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:02,297
What else did you say ?

524
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,684
I have to go to bed now, Russell.

525
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,468
You're welcome to sleep on the couch if you want

526
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:07,360
or go home, whatever you want to do.

527
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,953
Mariel, what else did you say ?

528
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:19,747
Nothing.

529
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,642
Come on there, children.

530
00:34:51,851 --> 00:34:53,405
Home, sweet home.

531
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,481
Daddy !

532
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:04,156
- Daddy, what happened ?
- I got into a
little accident. I'm okay.

533
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:06,090
It was so cool.

534
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:08,134
We fished and sang karaoke,

535
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:10,093
and daddy Tom bought us all presents.

536
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:12,173
Yeah ? That's great.

537
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,736
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

538
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:15,524
How you doin' ?

539
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:17,000
- You look messed up.
- No, I'm okay.

540
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:17,724
Hi, honey.

541
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:18,524
Are you sure ?

542
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,804
Yeah.

543
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,887
Ohh. I missed you.

544
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:22,941
Hey, Kira.

545
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,599
Hi, honey.

546
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,847
Morning. Hey, mar.

547
00:35:37,848 --> 00:35:38,481
Hey.

548
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:42,215
You got great kids, Russ.

549
00:35:42,738 --> 00:35:44,776
Thanks for letting me steal them for a while.

550
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:47,688
Hey, guys, would you give us a minute ?

551
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,069
- Why ?
- So the adults could talk.

552
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,286
- Yeah, you guys go inside.
- All right.

553
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,243
Russell, I'm sorry if I worried you,

554
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:07,903
but I did it for a reason.

555
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,916
I know your reason.

556
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,775
I know all about you, Tom.

557
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:17,700
Well, then you know how much I love your
children,

558
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,558
and you know how we always try to do what's best for them,

559
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:26,438
so Mariel and I have decided that we're gonna let them stay with you for a while.

560
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,785
- You're giving me custody ?
- For now, yeah.

561
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,191
Did you agree to this ?

562
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:40,827
Is that what you talked about on the phone ?

563
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,444
Yeah, I think it's best for everybody.

564
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:49,170
Hey, no matter what our differences are,

565
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,943
we're always gonna have the kids in common,

566
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:57,232
and we never want to put them in a situation
where they could get hurt...

567
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:00,862
do we ?

568
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:04,368
Mariel...

569
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,285
What's the matter, Russ ?

570
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:13,677
Isn't this what you've always wanted ?

571
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,727
- You hungry ?
- Yeah.

572
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:19,934
Yeah ? Me too.

573
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,632
Jesse, Rose, um...

574
00:37:29,596 --> 00:37:31,941
your dad is gonna take you to breakfast,

575
00:37:32,227 --> 00:37:34,036
and you're probably gonna stay with him tonight.

576
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:37,315
Why ? It's your night.

577
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,869
I know. I just thought...

578
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,251
mom...

579
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:44,694
thought maybe we could try something new
tonight

580
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,876
and maybe Tomorrow night, too.

581
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:46,777
Mom...

582
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:48,033
It's okay.

583
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,497
Everything's gonna be okay.

584
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:50,701
You're crying.

585
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:53,828
It's because I love you.

586
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:06,940
You gonna get that, babe ?

587
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:13,686
I think you should get it.

588
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:48,214
let's go, let's go. Stevie !

589
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:05,323
Well, I see you've got another load, too.

590
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:10,292
Welcome to camp, darlin'. Did you have a good swim ?

591
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:13,007
Careful of her, Derek. She's a little prickly.

592
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:18,067
Yeah, yeah, I can see that. We like that.

593
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:22,568
Let's see what santa got us.

594
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:25,808
Let me get that for you.

595
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,236
Jeez !

596
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:32,257
Aw, check this out !

597
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:34,432
Oh, look here.

598
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:37,086
Merry christmas.

599
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:38,518
This looks like your size.

600
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,219
What's going on here ?

601
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:52,891
You're on the island of misfit toys, honey.

602
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:55,178
Once we go through basic training,

603
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:58,853
we're comin' back with a vengeance.

604
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:04,188
Let's go.
