1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:04,728
There's a huge storm coming, and he's still not home.

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:06,550
How was I ever married to this person ?

3
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:08,095
As a storm gathers...

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,337
My pregnant wife shouldn't be covering hurricanes.

5
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:12,737
- Talk to your brother ?
- Yeah. He's with your kids at the house.

6
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,391
- I've been through hurricanes before.
- Not like this one, you haven't.

7
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:16,708
These families prepare...

8
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:19,812
- I have a right to know my children are safe.
- They're our children !

9
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:21,521
- Rose isn't here.
- Rose !

10
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,038
Why don't you go home and worry about your new husband

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,309
and leave us alone ?

12
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,363
Can they survive...

13
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:30,273
Rose !

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,855
What lies ahead ?

15
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,562
What's happening to me ?

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,461
- Did you see the lights ?
- Where'd you see them ?

17
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:44,490
- There are no aliens.
- Then will you tell me what's going on here ?

18
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:45,996
Mommy ?

19
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,238
You smell different.

20
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,436
First days are the toughest.

21
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,252
Testing, testing,

22
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:15,416
One, two, three.

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,272
Since I've been temporarily cut off from the outside world,

24
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:23,714
if friends and blog readers can get this message
out there for me.

25
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:28,597
As you all know, I believe that hurricane eve

26
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,562
was just a smokescreen to distract us from a larger,

27
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:33,039
far more ominous threat.

28
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:39,009
A larger, far more deadly threat.

29
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:40,425
But four days ago--

30
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:41,886
I found what I believed to be

31
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,132
the first alien-human remains combo.

32
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:48,172
A full skeleton penetrated by 12 prods.

33
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,087
24 hours later, an air force lieutenant

34
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,274
washed up on shore with 12 matching holes

35
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:00,752
in his body.

36
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,752
The holes looked eerily similar to the same ones I had

37
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:06,973
on my very legs.

38
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,288
Yes, that's right, folks, yours truly

39
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:14,017
had a close encounter of the painful kind.

40
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:18,789
Somebody--

41
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,609
most likely the military--

42
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,281
does not want a word of this to get out.

43
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,611
The skeleton has been stolen.

44
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,596
The lieutenant has gone missing.

45
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:28,908
And they're saying he's dead.

46
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:31,490
And the only evidence remaining

47
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:35,368
is a ring that I found in the trunk of my car.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,162
A ring which I believe came from the skeleton.

49
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:41,444
If I can prove that, I can establish

50
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:46,331
the ongoing presence of extraterrestrials in our waters.

51
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:48,812
- Dave!
- Yeah?

52
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:51,827
- Yeah?
- Coming in for breakfast?

53
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:52,842
Yeah, I'm on my way.

54
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,076
All right.

55
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,614
One last note--

56
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:00,693
the only other person who knows about all this stuff

57
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:01,965
is my brother-in-law russell.

58
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,294
And he thinks I'm nuts.

59
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:06,416
I don't understand.
Wilmore and casey can't clear the roads

60
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,648
because the equipment's broken?

61
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:08,801
because we don't have it.

62
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:09,834
The city's using it all.

63
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,002
- All right, I'm on my way.
- The air force came and took his body away.

64
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:14,374
They say he's dead, but who knows?
They told his wife he was overseas.

65
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,812
you're not hearing me, larkin.

66
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,273
Val, every reporter in town

67
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:18,460
is covering the relief center, okay?

68
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,952
This is a real story.

69
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,078
I need you in the shelter by 8:30. Good-bye.

70
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:24,544
What is wrong with her?

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,951
Mmm. You know what?

72
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,901
She just doesn't love you like I do.

73
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:30,624
Okay, newlyweds, simmer down.

74
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,090
This for me?

75
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,642
Just share them, I'm grumpy and pregnant

76
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,276
and I have to go to the relief center.

77
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:40,362
we need to talk.

78
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:42,195
russell, the roof just collapsed at lone pine.

79
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:43,998
Nobody's hurt, but they need some help.

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,525
All right, let 'em know I'm on my way.

81
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:46,982
Hey, honey, I gotta go.

82
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:48,714
You seen jesse's headphones?

83
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,447
He wanted me to drop him off at his mom'S.

84
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,232
Yeah, they're on the counter by the breadbox.

85
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,402
Russ, will you meet me at the jewelers later?

86
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:57,088
What's at the jewelers?

87
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,282
Uh, I wanna see if I can find anything out about the ring.

88
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,476
- It's a wedding ring, dave.
- Yeah, I know it's a wedding ring,

89
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:03,918
but maybe the inscription can tell us something.

90
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:04,733
"Two become one."

91
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,122
Maybe the jeweler will recognize it.

92
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:07,840
Well, how do you know he made it?

93
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,352
I don'T. It's just it's all we have left.

94
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:11,616
No, it's not.

95
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,759
I'm having tests run on that tissue fragment
mariel gave me.

96
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:17,824
If this thing is alien, we'll know by this afternoon.

97
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:21,115
Russell, your own daughter said she saw millions of lights

98
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,646
landing in the water during the hurricane.

99
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,270
So?

100
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,510
So what else could it be?

101
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:42,833
hey, the water's back on.

102
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:45,214
What a nice surprise.

103
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,337
Mommy, look at this.

104
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,864
Look at my shoes.

105
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:09,219
Mommy?

106
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,954
Mommy, you're not listening.

107
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,033
Daddy tom taught me how to tie my shoes.

108
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:17,982
Mommy!

109
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,630
That's very good, honey.

110
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:20,812
That's very good.

111
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,634
You probably shouldn't waste all that water, mare.

112
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:43,034
And you definitely don't want to lose another one of these.

113
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:44,946
Kira and jesse--

114
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:46,239
they still need a ride to town?

115
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,233
No, they decided to walk.

116
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,860
I'll get it.

117
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,377
- Daddy!
- Hey, how you doing, kiddo?

118
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,177
You wanna come in and have breakfast?

119
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:06,250
Morning, russ.

120
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,214
Hey, tom, these are jesse's headphones. He asked for them.

121
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:09,818
Oh.

122
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,823
Look, dad. Daddy tom taught me how to tie my shoes.

123
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:14,591
Wow, look at that.

124
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:16,279
She's a natural.

125
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:18,150
Well, that's great, sweetheart.

126
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:19,543
Hey, russell,

127
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:21,153
is everything all right?

128
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:23,413
Just dropping jesse's headphones off, that's all.

129
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:24,489
He's not here.

130
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,498
You can wait for him.

131
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,058
Oh, sweetie, I really gotta get back to work.

132
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,814
You know, actually, if you could stay,

133
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:29,820
that would really help us out.

134
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:31,367
Jesse should be back any minute. I'm late for work.

135
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,372
And I know tom would love to get in.

136
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:35,623
Yeah, daddy, please?

137
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:39,741
Uh, yeah, if you could hang around, that'd be really great.

138
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:41,461
Great, okay,
I gotta go.

139
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:43,561
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, I'll call you.

140
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:44,586
Bye, rosie,

141
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:46,837
I'll call you at lunch, okay?

142
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:48,906
Thanks.

143
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,241
uh, thank you.

144
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,678
I'll see ya.

145
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,572
So, daddy, wanna play in my room?

146
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:11,327
Your dad's a sheriff.

147
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:12,434
Doesn't he get free gas?

148
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,002
Not for your mom's car.

149
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,965
Boy, look at all these people who are still lost.

150
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,382
Yeah.

151
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,789
Luke hampton's missing.

152
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:21,629
He was in my gym class.

153
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,292
He was terrible at volleyball.

154
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,138
Well, they found my mom.

155
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,261
Maybe they can find him.

156
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:06,406
hello?

157
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,240
Hello, anybody here?

158
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:12,818
Hello?

159
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,199
Anybody in the back there?

160
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,132
- What do you want?
- What? Oh?

161
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,428
Oh, uh...

162
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,309
- you a looter?
- No. No.

163
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,448
- I'll shoot you if you are.
- No, I'm not a looter.

164
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:42,387
- I'm a customer.
- I'm not open.

165
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:49,698
well, I was just  wondering if maybe you could take a look

166
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:50,856
at something for me.

167
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:56,509
you know, uh,

168
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,592
you might wanna put that generator out on the street.

169
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:00,443
Why?

170
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,122
Oh, because, um, you know, if you leave it in here,

171
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:04,523
the carbon monoxide will kill you.

172
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:06,593
Just a tip.

173
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,489
How'd you know about this shortcut?

174
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:14,239
Derek culie showed me.

175
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,590
Oh, him.

176
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:19,051
Yeah, I know he's kind of a jerk.
But he has an awesome car.

177
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:23,483
That's always been my barometer for a friendship.

178
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,482
Whoa.

179
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:27,082
Look at that.

180
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,512
Man, that got tossed.

181
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:37,225
- Do you think anyone's inside?
- If they are, it's not looking good.

182
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:39,245
What are you doing?

183
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:40,792
I'm going in the water.

184
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,193
- Naked?
- I'm not naked.

185
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:45,907
Kira.

186
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:09,804
- You okay?
- Yeah.

187
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,084
Looks like ***** okay.

188
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,101
Cool, everything looks like down.

189
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,528
What do you think their deal is?

190
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,178
Hey, do you wanna see what's in the refrigerator?

191
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:49,952
You can tell everything about somebody

192
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,151
by what's in their fridge.

193
00:10:54,992 --> 00:10:56,690
These people are condiment fiends.

194
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:57,954
Kira,

195
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,065
you gotta see this.

196
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:03,056
kira.

201
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,919
wow, this is a, uh, very nice room, rose.

202
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:23,964
Yeah.

203
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:26,906
At your house the hurricane got everything wet.

204
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:29,762
But here, nothing happened at all.

205
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:31,680
Daddy!

206
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:34,292
Dad! Daddy!

207
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:35,640
Daddy!

208
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:36,708
Kira?

209
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,058
Your dad's not here.
What is it?

210
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:41,842
Kira?

211
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:43,823
What's wrong?

212
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,050
Stay in the car.

213
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:53,854
I wanna help jesse.

214
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:54,984
No, stay in the car, Rose.

215
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:07,881
Jesse!

216
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:08,764
Jesse!

217
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:09,910
Jesse!

218
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:11,768
Jesse!

219
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:16,241
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

220
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:21,164
Jesse!

221
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,238
- I wanna go see.
- Rose, wait! Rose!

222
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:28,750
- Wait, rose, come back!
- Daddy!

223
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:33,845
- Rose, wait, no!
- Let me go!

224
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:34,982
Come on!

225
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:55,830
Jesse!

226
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,890
Jesse!

227
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,390
Dr. Underlay? I'm looking for dr. Underlay!

228
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:21,265
This is her son.

229
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:29,183
Mariel?

230
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:30,319
Mariel?

231
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,530
- He's dr. Underlay's son.
- Multiple lacs--scalp, legs.

232
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:35,925
He's bleeding heavily.

233
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:39,870
you need to find his mother. Where is his mother?

234
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:41,246
Jesse?

235
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,114
Oh, my god.

236
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,008
Jesse?

237
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,431
Ugh. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.

238
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,435
- I've had a lot of looters in here.
- I know.

239
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,192
- Have to be careful, you know?
- Sure, yeah.

240
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,189
After andrew, they tied up my wife,

241
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:05,975
emptied the vaults, left her for 18 hours.

242
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,908
Oh, my god, that's awful

243
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,782
I didn't do this engraving.

244
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:12,882
It's amateur work.

245
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,353
But whoever owned the ring had it fitted.

246
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:16,753
There's a metal insert in here.

247
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,061
Not the finest, either.

248
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:24,391
And there's a date underneath.

249
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:26,913
There is?

250
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:28,321
"2...

251
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,038
"14...

252
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,319
"86."

253
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:34,633
Valentine's day.

254
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:35,758
Not very original.

255
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,000
So you think that was their wedding date?

256
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,980
Well, it is a wedding ring.

257
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,761
What about this other inscription here--
the "two become one"?

258
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:46,952
You think that has any special significance?

259
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,762
No, we see that a lot.

260
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:53,217
Start him on crystalloid and a unit of packed cells.

261
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,668
Then 4 units of a/b negative blood
and a dose of unasyn.

262
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:57,567
I'm nonot sure we've got that much a/b neg left.

263
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:58,998
The hurricane's left the bank pretty dry.

264
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,616
- Well, get me what you can.
- Okay.

265
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,188
Is he going to beall right?

266
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,367
He's lost a lot of blood. What happened?

267
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,940
He and kira found a mobile home

268
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,181
in the water near your house.

269
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:15,386
- In the water?
- Yeah.

270
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,819
Are any of his wounds like the lieutenant's I brought in--

271
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:22,388
that air force guy?

272
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,362
Paxton?

273
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:24,931
No, why?

274
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,187
They're glass cuts, russell, over his back and legs.

275
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:32,399
What happened?

276
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:41,223
I mean, is this story really necessary?

277
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:43,162
Do the people of south florida really need to know

278
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,730
that 20,000 new diapers just rolled into town?

279
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:47,633
I guess the incontinent ones do, yeah.

280
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,187
Mrs. Hernandez, are you ready?

281
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,290
Angel, I need you to stay close to me, okay?

282
00:15:58,093 --> 00:16:00,945
- Who are they?
- Military?

283
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,740
Why no markings?

284
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,728
And what's with the helicopter escort?

285
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:10,923
Hey, scott, get a shot of them.

286
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:25,251
Mommy.

287
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,306
Hey, sweetie.

288
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,205
Is jesse going to be okay?

289
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,015
I hope so.

290
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:36,577
I'm so sorry.

291
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,014
What happened?

292
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:40,340
We just--we thought it would be cool to explore

293
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,561
- and then jesse saw something and-
- saw what?

294
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,646
I told you, I don't know.

295
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,827
- Look, I said I was sorry.
- Kira.

296
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:04,199
How about I set you up in my office with some crayons?
Would you like that?

297
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,843
What do you think he saw, mom?

298
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:17,456
- Mona, you there?
- Go ahead.

299
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:19,490
I'm not gonna be able to make it down to lone pine,

300
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:21,189
but I need you to bring me something.

301
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,751
Well, I just want to go back to the house

302
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,800
to get some clothes and my grandson's photo album.

303
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,916
It's not safe, mrs. Lowell, but I'll tell you what,

304
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,232
I'm gonna send somebody out there and get it for you, okay?

305
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:34,002
Oh, my grandson's 4 months old.

306
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,632
But he's very big for his age--

307
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,547
in the 98th percentile.

308
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:38,456
Well, that's--

309
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,487
that's really big.

310
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,205
Um, would you excuse me?

311
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:42,582
All right, honey.

312
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,702
You still running your safety circle?

313
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,610
Nobody in or out of town without your clearance?

314
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:48,701
5-mile radius.

315
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,706
Recognize these guys?

316
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:56,208
No.

317
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:57,403
How's that possible?

318
00:17:57,695 --> 00:17:59,537
Well, as powerful as I am, I'm not actually present

319
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,288
at every checkpoint at every second.

320
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,889
But they look like the military to me.

321
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:04,356
Military what?

322
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:05,898
They weren't headed towards town.

323
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:07,326
They were moving away from it towards the keys.

324
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,073
So?

325
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:09,556
So if you didn't give them clearance--

326
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,281
then I didn't give them clearance.

327
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,500
Look, tom, the man russell found

328
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:17,861
half dead in his ranger station--paxton--was air force.

329
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:20,167
He was down there on some kind of classified mission.

330
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,843
Now I'd like to know what he was up to. Wouldn't you?

331
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,001
Oh, and you think there's a connection with these trucks.

332
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:25,791
Yeah.

333
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:29,784
I don't think you want to go after this one.

334
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:31,219
The air force is more than capable

335
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,326
of taking care of their own.

336
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,582
Then why is paxton dead?

337
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,405
And why did they tell his wife he was overseas?

338
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:38,953
You spoke to his wife?

339
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:40,977
I'm gonna find out what happened to this guy.

340
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,375
And why the air force is down here.

341
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,336
And if there's a cover-up, who's involved.

342
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:45,540
Now you can help me get the story

343
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,609
or you can be the story. It's your choice.

344
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:58,332
- When will he wake up?
- Probably in a few hours.

345
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,182
I don't know how long he was unconscious.

346
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,449
Why did kira leave him?

347
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:06,121
She said the trailer flooded.

348
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,507
She tried to get to him, but he was thrown to the back.

349
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:09,732
And I guess water was pouring in.

350
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,707
They shouldn't have been out there in the first place.

351
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,636
- Are you blaming me?
- No.

352
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,022
Because it could've happened
while they were at your house, russell.

353
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,208
Why were they out there at all?

354
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,610
They were getting gas.

355
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,962
Couldn't tom have done that?

356
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,505
Russell, when jesse's with you,

357
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:26,373
you've got him running all over the glades.

358
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,216
Yeah, when he's with me, not alone.

359
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,227
Not five days after a hurricane.

360
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,325
You want to make it my fault? Fine.

361
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,865
I'm not making it your fault.

362
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,608
You going to blame kira, too?

363
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,662
I'm not blaming anyone. I just want to know why it happened.

364
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:40,376
It happened because they're kids.

365
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:42,997
It happened because we can't be with them every second.

366
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:46,620
It's not because of me. It's not because of you.

367
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:47,932
It's not because we're divorced.

368
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:53,649
Well, I just want him to be okay. That's all.

369
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:01,407
Mariel?

370
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:03,155
Mariel?

371
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,837
I'm gonna go check on rose.

372
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,676
Here, prep this.

373
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:44,386
hey! Thought that was you.

374
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:46,144
Hi.

375
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,364
what's the matter?

376
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,556
Jesse's in the hospital.

377
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,544
Hospital? What?

378
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,624
Kira, what? What happened?

379
00:20:55,969 --> 00:21:00,830
- Could you just take me home, please? It's not far.
- Yeah. Uh, sure, yeah.

380
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:02,807
Uh, do you have a phone that works in your house

381
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,538
so I can call the hospital and make sure he's okay?

382
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,503
Um, we have a radio.

383
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:09,001
Right.

384
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:16,372
- hey, how's your boy?
- I don't know yet.

385
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:18,110
- I'm sorry, russ.
- Thanks.

386
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,140
- You get what I need?
- Yeah.

387
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:22,501
What is that thing?

388
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:26,138
It's a piece of tissue mariel pulled out
of that air force guy.

389
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:29,804
- What kind of tissue?
- It was stick inside one of his wounds.

390
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:31,764
I think it may be part of whatever attacked him.

391
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,172
I had the lab run some tests.

392
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:34,920
Was it a fish?

393
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:38,065
Hurricanes can sometimes throw up some bad fish.

394
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,370
- So who am I talking to?
-General turner with the 10th mountain.

395
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:47,475
That's army.

396
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,484
Yes, but he's the highest ranking
military officer in the area,

397
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:51,907
and he may know something.
After you.

398
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:57,052
- General.
- Tom.

399
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:59,735
This is larkin groves with wnkw-tv.

400
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:01,783
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- How do you do?

401
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:02,979
Please, show him the picture.

402
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,821
I saw these trucks headed south towards the keys this morning,

403
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:11,012
and I was hoping that maybe you could tell me who or what--

404
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:12,197
they're air force.

405
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:14,468
Air force?

406
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:16,449
Yes, ma'am.
Looks like a cleanup crew.

407
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,125
Cleanup crew? For what?

408
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:20,517
Are we on the record here?

409
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:22,647
Up to you, sir.

410
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:27,340
There was a sewage plant that got busted open down in key largo.

411
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:31,429
Nothing really serious, but there was some chemical leakage.

412
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,928
Air force offered to go down there and clean it up for us.

413
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,313
A sewage plant?

414
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:37,700
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,855
Well... that explains a lot.

416
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:45,133
Thank you, general.

417
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,250
Maybe next time you can introduce me
to someone more knowledgeable.

418
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:52,879
Excuse me?

419
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:55,146
The sewage plant in key largo closed a month ago.

420
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:56,306
I covered the story.

421
00:22:58,297 --> 00:22:59,460
I must have missed that one.

422
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:00,776
yeah.

423
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,516
Guess the general did, too.

424
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:04,952
Look, larkin, I told you,

425
00:23:04,953 --> 00:23:06,774
you don't want to mess with this, really.

426
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,113
Too late for that.

427
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,335
The operation is highly classified.

428
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,287
I'm only in the loop because they couldn't operate
down here without me.

429
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:15,775
I understand.
You're very important...

430
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:18,053
- no, I'm not.
- And about to be exposed as a liar.

431
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,251
Let go of my door.

432
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:22,772
If I tell you what's really going on,

433
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:24,331
I'm gonna put you right in the crosshairs.

434
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:26,557
These guys, they don't screw around.

435
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,857
They'll have you fired, blackballed... worse.

436
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,877
I'm a big girl.

437
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,644
And I'll probably be fired anyway.

438
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:41,960
They are operating out of key largo.

439
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:43,929
Prove it.

440
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,948
Mr. Varon, the nurse was looking for you.

441
00:23:49,526 --> 00:23:50,241
What's going on?

442
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,671
He's running a high fever, and his breathing's labored.

443
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,198
- Where's mariel?
- Haven't seen her.

444
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,462
What do you mean, you haven't seen her?

445
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,432
- what's happening?
- His B.P.'S dropping.

446
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,533
Heart rate's rising.

447
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:00,729
Where the hell's mariel?

448
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:02,689
Mariel!

449
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:16,043
mariel!

450
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:17,619
Mariel!

451
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:22,572
We need more L.R.S now.
Push a bolus as fast as you can.

452
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:23,505
Pressure's still dropping.

453
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,059
- What's the acuity?
- B.P.'S low.

454
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,013
His vitals are unstable.

455
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,374
Give him 50 milligrams of diphenhydramine
and 125 of solumederol.

456
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,796
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

457
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:30,987
What do you mean, you don't know? You have to know.

458
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:32,384
He's having a hemolytic reaction.

459
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:33,714
Are you sure your son's a/b negative?

460
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:34,503
Mariel?

461
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:35,995
Stop the blood. Stop it.

462
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,116
Call the red cross.

463
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,553
See if they have any blood substitute
and get them to send it up here now.

464
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:41,789
- Was he given the wrong type?
- No.

465
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,942
- How do you know? Are you sure?
- It was mine.

466
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:53,021
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

467
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:56,438
Boy, nice digs.

468
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:58,613
Yeah. Everyone thinks my dad's on the take,

469
00:24:58,614 --> 00:25:01,603
but he just got a lot of insurance money after my mom died.

470
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:04,489
The radio's upstairs.

471
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,641
My dad keeps it on a police frequency.

472
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,561
But number one's a direct line to the hospital,

473
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:17,459
so if you hit that button, it'll call mariel's office.

474
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:18,687
Okay, thanks.

475
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:22,585
hello?

476
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:25,978
Hello?

477
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,202
- is that your mom?
- Yeah.

478
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,022
she was hot.

479
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:36,133
Yeah.

480
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,695
She, uh, she kind of looked like an old movie star.

481
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:40,071
She had a lot of style.

482
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:42,915
Even her name grace had style.

483
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:46,177
- These are from her?
- Yeah.

484
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,206
They're letters she wrote to my dad
when he was in the first gulf war.

485
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:53,194
Nobody's picking up on this.

486
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, it's pretty crazy at the hospital.

487
00:25:57,343 --> 00:25:58,317
Okay.

488
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,919
so, uh, why did you feel like it was your fault,

489
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,058
what happened with jesse?

490
00:26:06,246 --> 00:26:06,868
I don't know.

491
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:09,979
I guess I feel like a lot of things are my fault.

492
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,962
Oh, c--oh, come on.
I'm sure that's not true.

493
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,810
I thought it was my fault when my mom died.

494
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:18,781
How did your mom die?

495
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:20,377
In a plane crash.

496
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:22,267
That's no good.

497
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:23,524
No.

498
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,461
You know there's nothing you could have done, right?

499
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,162
Yeah, I know. I know.

500
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,672
But you always wonder if, you know,

501
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:35,831
maybe you'd been there, something would be different.

502
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:39,913
yeah, but you were with jesse.

503
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:42,568
yeah.

504
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,477
- So, uh, guess it's my fault either way, huh?
- There you go.

505
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:47,461
That's the spirit, kid.

506
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:00,266
Mariel.

507
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:03,692
- Mariel, hold on.
- He's stable now, russell.

508
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:04,672
He's gonna be fine.

509
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:06,758
No, I'm not worried about jesse.
I'm worried about you.

510
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,308
Why?

511
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:13,916
Mariel, what is going on with you?

512
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,506
I'm just overwhelmed...

513
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,899
and exhausted.

514
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:27,057
And...

515
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:32,394
I don't know what's going on with me.

516
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:37,607
my blood almost killed jesse, russell.

517
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:38,898
But it didn'T.

518
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:42,917
He's stable now. You said so yourself.
He's gonna be fine.

519
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:46,636
Mariel, why don't you go be with him?

520
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,689
Just take a break and be with your son.

521
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:57,703
Yeah, I have the results here somewhere.

522
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,242
It's dr. Underlay's blood, right?

523
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:00,109
Yeah.

524
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,526
Yeah. Hurricane kind of messed everything up.

525
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:03,652
We lost our file cabinets.

526
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:06,411
I--oh, was it your son who had a problem?

527
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:07,276
Yes, that's right.

528
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:09,083
Oh, um, yeah...

529
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:13,424
I'm really sorry.

530
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,889
I'm not sure that he got the right blood.

531
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,921
You're not sure?

532
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,383
Well, I'm not sure he got his mother'S.

533
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:20,145
We've had lots of donors, and her results--

534
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:22,899
they were right here.

535
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:25,064
Uh... the hurricane kind of messed us up.

536
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:26,166
Uh...

537
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:28,793
uh... yeah. Here.

538
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:29,674
Here they are.

539
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:31,872
Yeah, we're running these tests again.

540
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:32,746
Why?

541
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,026
The equipment must have been contaminated.

542
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,072
Can I see that?

543
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,650
We had a couple different readings like this.

544
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,455
I--somebody must have forgotten to clean the centrifuge,

545
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:43,809
'cause there were enormous amounts of hemoglobin.

546
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:47,106
I mean, unless the donor was a dolphin or a whale or something.

547
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:07,677
where exactly are we going?

548
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:13,972
You sound like rose.
"Are we there yet?"

549
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,973
Yeah, but I didn't ask when.
I asked where.

550
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:16,938
You know where.

551
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,182
Key largo.

552
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:22,856
This isn't the way.

553
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:24,796
It's another way.

554
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,066
how's your husband?

555
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:31,970
I haven't talked to him today.

556
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:34,944
How's your wife?

557
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:46,223
hey.

558
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:47,042
Hey.

559
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:51,392
He's stable now.

560
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:58,787
I'm gonna go see about moving him to recovery.

561
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,529
hey, bud.

562
00:30:18,262 --> 00:30:19,920
Man, what were you doing in that water?

563
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,788
I don't want you near that water.

564
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:32,169
I just want you with me.

565
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,111
are you worried?

566
00:30:42,498 --> 00:30:43,333
About what?

567
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,849
That things are gonna change when the baby comes.

568
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,965
Between you and Russel.

569
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,708
Russell and I would never let that happen.

570
00:30:57,195 --> 00:31:01,079
How are you planning to do that?
I mean, change is inevitable.

571
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,490
Things are always evolving.

572
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,418
It's just a matter of how we choose to respond to it.

573
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:35,999
hey.

574
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:45,969
I'm sorry.

575
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:49,365
For what?

576
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,247
If it sounded like I was blaming you earlier about jesse.

577
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:55,675
I didn't mean to.

578
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,707
Well, I accept your apology--

579
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,573
if you were blaming me, which I'm not sure you were.

580
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,230
- How long has she been asleep?
- Half an hour.

581
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,156
She didn't get her afternoon nap today.

582
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:19,778
- She still takes naps?
- She doesn't when she's at your house?

583
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:24,371
Well, different homes, different rules.

584
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:28,389
- Different parents.
- Same parents.

585
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:34,990
Mariel, I spoke to the guy in your blood lab about jesse.

586
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:37,971
He said there may have been a mistake.

587
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:39,253
It may not have been your blood.

588
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:42,085
There's some problem with the equipment--

589
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:43,223
too much hemoglobin.

590
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:45,221
What?

591
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:48,124
The blood work contained massive amounts of hemoglobin.

592
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:51,047
He said it was like you'd find in a dolphin or a whale.

593
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:53,451
Of course, he thought that was a mistake.

594
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:56,112
Again, he didn't even know that it was your blood.

595
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,711
It's kind of a mess in there.

596
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:02,472
I'd better go find out what happened.

597
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:05,934
Hopefully this next round of tests

598
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:07,749
will clear everything up.

599
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:21,674
- Listen, I am jesse varon's stepbrother-in-law.
- I'm sorry.

600
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:24,953
I'm only authorized to give out information
to his immediate family.

601
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:27,064
Oh, how do I not qualify as immediate family?

602
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:27,953
Excuse me.

603
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:30,428
- Who am I speaking to?
- Joyce scovell.

604
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:34,227
Hi, joyce, this is kira underlay, jesse's stepsister.

605
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:35,644
I believe I qualify as family.

606
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:39,508
And if I don't, I'll make sure my father
and his wife dr. Mariel underlay,

607
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,883
the chief of staff at your hospital, hear about it.

608
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:43,868
Let me check with my supervisor.

609
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:44,726
Nice.

610
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:47,038
Yeah, I picked up a few things from my dad.

611
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,636
Yeah, don't pick up too much.

612
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:50,389
I've been to key largo a thousand times.

613
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,702
I've never seen this.

614
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,448
Yeah, well, I didn't blindfold you.

615
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:55,514
Yeah, but I stopped knowing where we were going

616
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:56,822
about 45 minutes ago.

617
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,040
Maybe that's a good thing.

618
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,614
Okay? There's your story.

619
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:20,709
- You just can't tell anybody.
- Why?

620
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:22,116
You wanted the truth?
Here it is.

621
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:24,366
But if you tell anybody what you've seen,

622
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:26,176
you burn me as a source forever,

623
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,265
not to mention as a friend.

624
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,085
So what am I looking at?

625
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,204
What's left of an hh-60g pave hawk.

626
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,369
Air force search and rescue.

627
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,319
Paxton's?

628
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:37,568
Took off with a 4-man crew.

629
00:34:38,484 --> 00:34:39,257
Why did it crash?

630
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:41,589
I'm assuming the hurricane.

631
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:43,262
Yeah, but why were they flying in a hurricane?

632
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:44,991
Why was paxton in a wet suit in the water?

633
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:46,162
What was he looking for?

634
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:47,162
According to my contact,

635
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:48,945
they were after a missing weather plane.

636
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,083
A weather plane?

637
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,054
Then what's going on over there?

638
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:11,923
what's in the box, tom?

639
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,373
How long was your dad in the air force?

640
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:19,517
12 years.

641
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:21,908
Handsome couple.

642
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:25,013
kira, I have good news.

643
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:27,816
Jesse varon's condition has been upgraded to good.

644
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,450
Thank you, joyce.
That's great news.

645
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,002
do you want to go see him?

646
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,106
- Yeah. You sure you're up for it?
- Yeah, absolutely.

647
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,384
Okay, let's go.

648
00:35:59,135 --> 00:36:00,310
you guys look funny.

649
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:07,120
Hey! Why's that?

650
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:09,473
You're all out of focus.

651
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:10,814
Yeah, just go with that.

652
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:12,064
It's been working for me for years.

653
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:15,341
Hey.

654
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:17,210
Hey.

655
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:19,842
I'm sorry you got hurt.

656
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:22,877
You know, kira--

657
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:24,956
she saved your butt, man.

658
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:28,955
Wasn't for her, you wouldn't be here right now.

659
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,604
Thanks.

660
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,460
I saw something in the water, dad.

661
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:45,586
I know.

662
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:49,767
jesse!

663
00:36:51,224 --> 00:36:52,098
Hey, baby!

664
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:57,090
- How are you?
- I'm doing.

665
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,190
I drew this for you.

666
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:02,105
- Mariel.
- Thanks, rose.

667
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,170
did you get a chance to talk to the lab?

668
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,306
It was a mix-up.

669
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,440
The tech told me he ran complete panels

670
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,530
and C.B.C. Makeups on my blood,
and everything's fine.

671
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:19,479
Jesse got somebody else'S.

672
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,227
It's not gonna happen again.

673
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,566
So you think he can come home tomorrow?

674
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:39,314
Which home?

675
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,892
My home.

676
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:43,917
I'll make sure he gets his naps.

677
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:46,851
Sure.

678
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:52,026
Thank you for being here for him, russell--

679
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,469
for both of them.

680
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:55,814
Thank you.

681
00:38:04,507 --> 00:38:07,609
- Hey, you make sure you get some rest, okay?
- Okay

682
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,922
russell? Honey?
Are you there?

683
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,268
Hey, baby.

684
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:11,237
Hey, blog readers.

685
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:12,783
It's me again--dave.

686
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:19,032
Unfortunately, my search for the owner of the ring
has not yielded anything yet.

687
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:22,190
But I haven't given up.

688
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,581
Something is out there.

689
00:39:25,637 --> 00:39:28,059
Whatever it is, wherever it is,

690
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:30,812
I'm going to find it.

691
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,513
But until I do--

692
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:35,422
until we do--

693
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:37,051
russell and me--

694
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:39,623
just a tip--

695
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,050
stay out of the water.
