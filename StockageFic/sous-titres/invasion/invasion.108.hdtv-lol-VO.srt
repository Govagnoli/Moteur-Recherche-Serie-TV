<i>I was hired by the military to catch this beast</i>

00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:05,047

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,215
<i>Well, I showed her your fish.</i>

8
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:36,436
- Is the washer working at your dad's ?
- No, they still don't have water.

9
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:39,332
- Sorry about this, mom.
- Oh, it's fine.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,951
Well, Larkin offered to do it by hand,
but

11
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:44,974
I told her not to. She's still on bed rest.

12
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,814
Jess, it's okay. This is your house.

13
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:48,260
I'm just happy you're here.

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,038
What's for dinner, mom ?

15
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,059
Salad, baked potatoes and pot roast.

16
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,011
- I don't like pot roast.
- Well, Tom does.

17
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:58,286
Well, why does he always
get to choose ?

18
00:00:58,939 --> 00:00:59,770
Honey...

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,894
why couldn't we have, like,
chicken or something ?

20
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,894
Jess...

21
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,284
why is your head bleeding ?

22
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:08,507
What ?

23
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,475
No, really, why-what happened to your head, mom ?

24
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:18,370
I...

25
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:20,541
I don't know.

26
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:38,139
Oh, my god.

27
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,693
What-what is wrong with you ?!

28
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,074
- Get away.
- Jesse

29
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:48,808
- Get away !
- Jesse, don't leave !

30
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:52,635
Jesse, come back !
Come back, Jesse !

31
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:05,280
Honey, you all right ?

32
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,014
I think you were having a bad dream, baby.

33
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,403
Here.

34
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:26,081
You wanna tell me about it ?

35
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:35,107
No.

36
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:45,245
The air force guy I found
had 12 symmetrical holes in his body.

37
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,818
Whatever attacked him left this part of itself
in one of his wounds.

38
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,132
Mariel said it was still moving
when she pulled it out.

39
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:55,388
Possibly ingurgitating fluids.

40
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:56,718
Sucking his blood ?

41
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,167
Fluids, Dave.

42
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:01,181
I'm checking to see if this thing
came from a squid, not a vampire.

43
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,544
So squids ingurgitate ?

44
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,522
None that I know of.

45
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:08,231
But there's a lot of creatures in the ocean

46
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:09,714
we haven't been able to study.

47
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,390
Well, look at that.

48
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,249
Those cells create light.

49
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:19,808
So it is a squid.

50
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:21,563
I didn't say that.

51
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:26,508
What the fisherman showed Larkin
sounded like a taningia but...

52
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,232
I mean, their photophores are huge.

53
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,098
And they're located at the end
of their tentacles.

54
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:34,164
These things are tiny.
They're on the ventral surface.

55
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,938
So basically, this thing could be
a squid, or it could not be.

56
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,510
Which also means it could be an alien.

57
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,055
That's a...

58
00:03:58,921 --> 00:03:59,331
That's a...

59
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:00,749
- Baby.
- Baby.

60
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,740
<i>Then take this corner tuck tightly,</i>

61
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:07,483
<i>and sometimes they push back,
and say, "no, thank you. "</i>

62
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,083
"No, thank you. "

63
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,178
<i>She has just about had it.</i>

64
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,474
Yeah, who can blame her ?

65
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,483
Larkin, do you want toast
with your eggs ?

66
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:22,905
'Cause it kinda got burnt.

67
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,272
Hey, hey, hey ! What are you doing ?

68
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,082
Dad says you're not
supposed to get up.

69
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:28,008
Well, I need that book.

70
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,652
- Here.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,394
I really, really think
you should be resting, Larkin.

72
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,463
I am resting.

73
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,093
I'm dying of resting.

74
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:41,693
All right.

75
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:45,581
Thank you.

76
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,220
You're welcome.

77
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,318
Hi, sweetie.

78
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:54,744
- Why are you watching this ?
- To learn stuff about babies.

79
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,231
What do you need to know ?

80
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:00,310
Everything. I never had one before.

81
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:03,055
Why don't you just ask my mom
about 'em ?

82
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,570
I think that would be
a little awkward.

83
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:05,867
Why ?

84
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:08,005
Because I'm having this baby
with your dad.

85
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,139
But why do we need another baby ?

86
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,111
Russell ?

87
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:14,303
<i>Are you there ?</i>

88
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,488
- Hey, will you get that ?
- Huh, oh, yeah.

89
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:18,924
Hey, Lark.

90
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,329
Hey, Dave, where's Russell ?

91
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,148
We're at the hospital. Someone
dumped a baby at his station.

92
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:25,759
<i>We're gonna get it to Mariel
to check it out right now.</i>

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,354
- Daddy has another baby ?
- Oh, no, no.

94
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,530
Can I speak to Russell, please ?

95
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,443
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,589
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

97
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,069
Hey, why would somebody
leave a baby with you ?

98
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:37,698
I don't know. Maybe they thought
I was a fireman.

99
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:38,880
<i>Is it okay ?</i>

100
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,214
Yeah, it seems to be.

101
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:41,761
Well, your daughter

102
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,319
would like to know why
we need another baby.

103
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:48,933
- It's okay.
- No, no, no.

104
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,459
<i>It's okay, just take it.</i>

105
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,071
Sweetie, can we talk about this later ?

106
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,701
Fine. Anythingon the squid ?

107
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:58,996
<i>Uh, inconclusive.</i>

108
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,941
Did you call the department of defense ?

109
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,694
I don't want you worrying
about that stuff, okay ?

110
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:04,755
Well, when am I supposed
to worry about it, Russell ?

111
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:06,278
When the military firebombs our house ?

112
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,108
<i>Those guys were up my butt !</i>

113
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,671
Okay, look, I gotta go.

114
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,653
"Up your butt ?"

115
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:38,166
What if these creatures put holes in our bodies

116
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,069
so they can, like, feed us information ?

117
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:40,950
Like, they're moving in.

118
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:44,112
Man, if I ever actually bought
into your theories,

119
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,446
what would we have to argue about ?

120
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,074
I do think that squid thing was a ruse,
don't you ?

121
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:51,439
I mean, that fisherman that
showed it to Larkin

122
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,163
said the military hired him to catch it.

123
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,838
How do we know they didn't just give it to him ?

124
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,904
Throw us off the scent.

125
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,659
Dave, even if the entire population of Jupiter
landed in the everglades-

126
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,555
- Jupiter doesn't have a population.
- The military still wouldn't give a damn about us.

127
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:03,616
Nobody gives a damn about us.

128
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,601
He might.

129
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:09,796
What is he doing here ?

130
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,578
Tom ?

131
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,097
Hey, Russ. Hope you don't mind.

132
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,302
Russell, this is Helen Conrad.

133
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,285
And this is herdaughter-in-law Christina.

134
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,077
Helen called my office this morning

135
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,944
and told me that her grandson was missing.

136
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,658
I went out to see her, met Christina, and, well,

137
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:34,630
it seems she dropped a baby off here this morning.

138
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:35,697
That's your baby ?

139
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,654
- No.
- Of course, he's hers.

140
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,942
- She doesn't know what she's saying.
- I know exactly what I'm saying.

141
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:40,957
The baby isn't mine.

142
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,865
- We just took him to the hospital.
- Oh, thank god.

143
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,580
What can I do to get him back ?

144
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,763
You'll have to prove that she's the mother.

145
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,166
I assume they'll do a D.N.A.Test-see if there's a match.

146
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:51,221
All right, then that's, uh,that's what we're gonna do.

147
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,202
Come on, Christina, let's go. Come on, up.

148
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,534
Whoa ! Whoa !

149
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,710
What is wrong with you ?!

150
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:01,932
Russell, would you give ms. Conrad
a ride to the hospital ?

151
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:03,803
And I'll make sure that Christina gets there, as well.

152
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:07,612
Listen, can you go home.

153
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,368
Tell Larkin I'll be there
as soon as I can ?

154
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:10,558
Sure.

155
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,347
All right, then,Christina ?

156
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:21,186
So...

157
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:25,151
how did your son die ?
If you don't mind me asking.

158
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,772
He was electrocuted in the storm.

159
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:35,134
I'm so sorry.

160
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:43,406
He and, uh, Christina and the baby
were staying with me.

161
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,309
Justin went out to get some supplies.

162
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:51,000
I mean, nobody thought the storm
was gonna hit so hard here.

163
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:54,047
I mean, everybody said it was gonna
be farther north and...

164
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:57,670
anyway, when he didn't come back,

165
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,768
Christina went out looking for him, and...

166
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:04,804
well, we found his body later that night.

167
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:08,460
We didn't know where
hristina was for two days.

168
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,041
Where was she ?

169
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:14,898
At a shelter.

170
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,808
Somebody, uh, brought her in.

171
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,810
And when I-when I got there it was...

172
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,359
her reaction was so strange.

173
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:28,057
It was-it was almost likeshe didn't even know who I was.

174
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,065
And then when I told her about...

175
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,427
what had happened to justin,

176
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,219
she had no reaction at all.

177
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:40,557
And then she wouldn't event ouch the baby,

178
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:42,768
or feed him,or even...

179
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,148
or even a cknowledge that he was hers.

180
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,649
Oh, thank god.

181
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:56,119
Are you finished ?
Can I take my grandson home ?

182
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:59,099
I'm afraid not, ms. Conrad.

183
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,080
Why ?

184
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,877
She's not the mother of this child.

185
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,858
What are you talking about ?

186
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,913
We gave your daughter-in-law a full examination.

187
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:10,511
She's never even been pregnant.

188
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,547
it's not physically possible
that Christina had a baby.

189
00:10:57,552 --> 00:11:00,220
So we had no reason to test her D.N.A.

190
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:03,650
But she had the baby here in this hospital !

191
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,018
We have no records of that.

192
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:08,947
Okay, I am telling you that
this child is my grandson.

193
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:09,792
Ms. Conrad ?

194
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,671
Christina says that you're making this up

195
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,156
because she feels you're distraught
over the loss of your son,

196
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:19,483
which is understandable under the circumstances.

197
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,767
I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

198
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,711
- Oh, my god.
- Hey, hey.

199
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,033
All right, where is she now ?

200
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,748
She left after the exam.
She said she was walking home.

201
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,195
What, you let her go ?

202
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,022
It really wasn't up to me.

203
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,532
Okay, all right, I am gonna go get Christina.

204
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,023
I am gonna bring her back here.

205
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:38,475
You are gonna test her D.N.A.

206
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:41,066
And then I am taking my grandson with me.

207
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,469
- Mar, what is going on here ?
- I don't know.

208
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,097
Do you think she's lying, Mariel ?

209
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,623
You think she's just invented all this ?

210
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,751
- What is up with you today, Russell ?
- That woman lost a son.

211
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,349
And it sounds like she's about to lose a baby.

212
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:59,486
- But it's nother baby !
- It doesn't matter !

213
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,709
Do you know that her daughter-in-law
went missing the night of the hurricane ?

214
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,380
Like you.

215
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,702
- No.
- Yeah.

216
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,749
And ever since then, she's been denying her child.

217
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:19,408
I mean, what is it about this hurricane
that's made so many people so different ?

218
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:23,304
What really happened to you that night in the water ?
Do you know ?

219
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:25,817
Do you ?

220
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:30,019
Well, you have children, too.

221
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:35,011
I mean, don't you think you at least owe it to them
to find out ?

222
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,728
I ran the plates.

223
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,472
The car was definitely registered to the air force.

224
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,042
- Really ?
- Yeah.

225
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:51,858
And the owner...

226
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:55,826
died in afghanistan two years ago.

227
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,169
Does Russell know you're pursuing this ?

228
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:03,139
No.

229
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:06,535
And I'm sure he would...

230
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,627
hate it if he knew that I'd called you.

231
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:12,026
I have to do something.

232
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,647
Russell was gonna call the D.O.D., But he...

233
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:19,148
anyway, I know that you have
contacts with the military.

234
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,671
- And so I thought that maybe you could
- Larkin-

235
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,778
No one's gonna bother you anymore.

236
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,624
How do you know ?

237
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:31,571
Because I called somebody
after your accident.

238
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:34,124
Do you know why that car
was following you ?

239
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:36,256
No.

240
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:37,899
Because you were snooping
around an air base,

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,109
and you went into a classified area.

242
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,231
What did you see in there ?

243
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,822
Titanium boxes.

244
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:49,787
Just like the ones that we saw
when we were in Key Largo.

245
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,430
And do you know
what was in them ?

246
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,450
No.

247
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,265
Good.

248
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:01,418
So you shouldn't have a problem anymore
unless you keep digging.

249
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,230
Christina ?

250
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,326
Christina, I need to talk with you.

251
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:42,364
Christina ?

252
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:17,324
oh, my god.

253
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:33,786
What have you done ?

254
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,325
- Hey.
- Oh !

255
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,170
Sorry.

256
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,886
I heard the new son the radio.

257
00:15:58,651 --> 00:15:59,677
Did you find her ?

258
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:04,859
Yeah, I came to find out what happened to her
the night of the hurricane.

259
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,487
Guess we've all gone crazy, huh, Russell ?

260
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,344
You don't need to be here, Russ.

261
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,926
I didn't have to go to the hospital
this morning either.

262
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:19,308
Russell's concerned I may have
a little too much in common with Christina.

263
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,191
I want you to go home, Mariel, please.

264
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:29,497
I am not that woman.

265
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,440
Maybe this isn't the best night
to bring the kids over.

266
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,420
No, you have 'em there by 6.
We'll be there.

267
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,778
What's going on here ?

268
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,183
- We're painting.
- Yeah, I can see that.

269
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,318
But who told you to ?

270
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,450
Larkin. Don't you like it ?

271
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,404
Hey.

272
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,119
What are you doing up ?

273
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,863
I went to the bathroom.

274
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,168
Are you sure these fumes
aren't bothering you ?

275
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:29,122
No.

276
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:31,033
I kinda like 'em.

277
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,779
Well, great.

278
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,029
- How is Mariel ?
- Why ?

279
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,169
Weren't you with her all morning ?

280
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:44,229
Isn't that why you weren't here ?

281
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,260
Honey, I found a baby at my station.

282
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,636
So I took it to the hospital.

283
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:52,810
Then the mother-

284
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:54,115
the mother disavowed it.

285
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:57,134
And for some reason, the tests show
that she never even had a baby at all.

286
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:59,268
And then she goes home,
and she kills her mother-in-law.

287
00:18:00,951 --> 00:18:03,081
It's been kind of
an intense day.

288
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:09,101
What's all this stuff ?

289
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:10,360
It's research.

290
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:15,931
I told you to leave this alone.

291
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:18,446
I know what you told me,
but I could've been killed.

292
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:19,901
Why don't you care about that ?

293
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:22,609
- I do. I said I'd take care of it.
- When ?

294
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:25,353
Have you called the D.O.D. ?
Have you called the air force ?

295
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,815
- Have you talked to Tom ?
- Why would i talk to Tom ?

296
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:29,689
- He's the sheriff.
- Have you talked to Tom ?

297
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,937
Oh, Larkin, you talked to Tom ?!

298
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:38,687
Damn it, Russell, I have a right to know
why this happened to me !

299
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,362
Yeah, and I have a rightt o protect you !

300
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:42,002
Since the hurricane, people are going nuts.

301
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,371
I wish you would've seent his woman this morning, Mariel.

302
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,534
- Larkin.
- Mariel ?

303
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:49,212
I meant Larkin. You know that.

304
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:53,592
I'm-I'm sorry.

305
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:57,291
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,151
But I am worried about her, too.

307
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:02,975
Now I'm supposed to drop the kids off

308
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,488
at her house tonight, and I don't want to.

309
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:08,004
I don't trust her anymore.

310
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,878
I'm not sure she trusts herself.

311
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:15,630
Well, you're not married to her.

312
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:33,519
Christina ?

313
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:36,609
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone without my lawyer.

314
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,682
- What do you want ?
- I wanna know what happened to you.

315
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:44,442
- You know what happened.
- No.

316
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,373
I don't.

317
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:08,415
Did you have that baby ?

318
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,445
- You're the doctor.
- I wanna hear it from you.

319
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:11,971
It's irrelevant now.

320
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,703
That person
doesn't exist anymore.

321
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,341
What happened
to that person ?

322
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:23,638
What happened
to your hospital records ?

323
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,373
Somebody must've stolen them.

324
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:32,747
Your husband and i had a very interesting talk

325
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,070
this morning on the way to the hospital.

326
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,005
He knows a lot.

327
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,586
But he doesn't know everything.

328
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:46,426
He told me how he survived a plane crash,

329
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,122
and how it changed him forever.

330
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,551
But we're not the same.

331
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,086
I think that scares him.

332
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:05,830
Does he understand what happened to you ?

333
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,908
Oh, I think he understands very well.

334
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,700
Why did you kill your mother-in-law ?

335
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:21,873
Doesn't everyone wanna kill their mother-in-law ?

336
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:22,675
No.

337
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:25,566
She wanted to drive me to the hospital
for a D.N.A. Test.

338
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:28,959
- I didn't want to go.
- So you killed her ?

339
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:33,151
If she wanted the baby, she could've had it.

340
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,037
She was forcing it on me.

341
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,717
Do you have children,doctor ?

342
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:45,612
Yes, I do.

343
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:48,127
Have you felt...

344
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:54,422
differently towards them since the hurricane ?

345
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:56,829
Have you felt like...

346
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:01,221
some part of you wasn't quite
as connected to them anymore ?

347
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:07,600
You might wanna take a look at that.

348
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:13,666
You see, all I've done since they pulled me out of the water

349
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,146
was look inside myself.

350
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,572
I know who I am now.

351
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:23,736
And thanks to your husband...

352
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,042
I know what I am.

353
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,986
So why are you still so confused ?

354
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,325
Mariel, Lewis told me you talked to Christina.

355
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:20,193
Her lawyer's gonna have a real problem with that.

356
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:23,699
Yeah, well, I've been having a real problem, too.

357
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:32,806
What did yous ay to her
on the way to the hospital ?

358
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,111
I tried to reason with her.

359
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,349
I tried to get her to see how precious her baby was.

360
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,208
Did you talk about you ?

361
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:49,197
Yeah, yeah, a bit.

362
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:50,457
What'd you say ?

363
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:52,360
I said that I understood her confusion.

364
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,612
That I'd gone through a trauma of my own.

365
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:55,833
But the truth is,

366
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:58,579
the thing I kept thinking about the whole time...

367
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:00,979
was you.

368
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:05,136
You have nothing in common with this woman, Mariel.

369
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,633
And, though, you may have shareda similar experience,

370
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:11,997
the outcome...

371
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,046
is gonna be very different.

372
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,685
She doesn't deserve to have a baby now.

373
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:29,868
But maybe you do.

374
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:33,564
What ?

375
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:37,947
I've been giving this a lot of thought and...

376
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,540
and, I don't know, maybe...

377
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:44,043
with everything that happened today, um...

378
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:44,883
wait a minute.

379
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:46,207
And I know when we got married,

380
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,061
- I said that I didn't want any more children,
- wait, wait,what are you saying ?

381
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:53,595
Are you saying that you want to have a baby ?

382
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:56,570
Yeah, I am.

383
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,788
Where does this come from ?

384
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:05,791
Why are you saying this now ?

385
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:10,211
Because I think the time is right now.

386
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,796
- Tom...
- What ?

387
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,408
This feels...

388
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,758
- very strange.
- Yeah, I know.

389
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:24,740
I guess I...

390
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:26,996
something happened to me.

391
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:29,280
No, something's happened to me.

392
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:35,913
I don't...

393
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,865
I really need o be alone right now.

394
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,558
Honey-

395
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,811
you know what ?
You're not just gonna...

396
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:46,555
brush over this and tell me
that everything's gonna be okay.

397
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:50,137
Not anymore.

398
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,101
If I find out that you have
been with holding from me...

399
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:59,511
that you know more about
what is going on with me than I do...

400
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:00,580
how would that be possible ?

401
00:26:14,494 --> 00:26:15,406
I love you.

402
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,148
I hope that's enough.

403
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:27,069
What did you say to my wife ?

404
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:29,852
She's very upset.

405
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:33,745
- You're not my lawyer.
- He's on his way here now.

406
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,289
We're transferring you up to miami.

407
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,460
Getting me out, huh ?

408
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:43,021
Before I cause any more trouble ?

409
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,615
What did you say ?

410
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,880
I just told her the truth.

411
00:26:56,476 --> 00:26:59,416
You're the one who took
my hospital records, aren't you ?

412
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:02,273
It doesn't matter.

413
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,711
If they ever do a D.N.A. Test,

414
00:27:04,712 --> 00:27:06,654
people will know the baby was mine.

415
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,379
And then everyone will be very confused.

416
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,853
Because this body didn't give birth to a child.

417
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,088
I think you're crazy.

418
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:23,391
And I think you're in a lot of denial.

419
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,548
You're just tryingt o control everything.

420
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,289
Trying to manage everyone.

421
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:32,746
But you can't.

422
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,443
Because even though we've all been
through the same experience,

423
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:39,377
none of us are the same.

424
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,046
Are we ?

425
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,952
And that's why you haven't
told your wife the truth.

426
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:59,916
You are just terrified of losing her.

427
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:03,346
How do you know so much ?

428
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,547
Call it mother's intuition.

429
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:32,997
Where are Kira and Dave ?

430
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:35,061
In the garagegetting some primer.

431
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:43,576
It looks like you got more paint on you
than on the walls.

432
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:45,675
You having fun ?

433
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:46,709
No.

434
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:49,604
Rose.

435
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:54,826
She heard you talking to Larkin about mom.

436
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,385
Hey, sweetie.

437
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:13,244
Why don't you trust mommy ?

438
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:15,991
I do.

439
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,593
It's just that your mom's just had a really,
really tough time lately.

440
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:24,725
But she's been getting better.
I can tell.

441
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,040
Yeah ? Well, maybe she is.

442
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:32,498
I'm sorry I said I didn't want another baby,

443
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:34,867
but I just...

444
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,140
don't want you to love it more than me.

445
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:40,587
Oh, Rose...

446
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:43,637
that's never gonna happen.

447
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:47,675
Does Larkin not want us here ?

448
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:48,874
Of course she does.

449
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:52,229
She's just, you know, she wants
to spend some time with me, too,

450
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,634
and we just haven't been able
to do that lately.

451
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:57,879
Want me to talk to her ?

452
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:10,139
Honey...

453
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:13,301
I've gotta take the kids now.

454
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:22,594
D-don't.

455
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:30,441
Hey. Come here.

456
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,604
What are you doing ?

457
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:39,861
Babe, where are we going ?

458
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,312
B-baby...

459
00:30:58,005 --> 00:30:59,829
this is where you proposed.

460
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:03,488
Oh, yeah. How about that ?

461
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:06,383
Are you gonna do it again ?

462
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:08,822
Do I have to ?

463
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:12,597
No.

464
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:19,580
I'm... I'm sorry...

465
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,388
if I've been a little crazy lately.

466
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:27,160
There's a lot going on and...

467
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:28,572
I know.

468
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:34,210
I love you more than I've everl oved anyone, Larkin.

469
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:37,146
I just hope you know that.

470
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:40,384
I do.

471
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,283
I do.

472
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:54,429
baby steps.

473
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:29,088
Where have you been ?

474
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,507
The kids are gonna be here soon.

475
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:34,320
Went to the cove where you found me after the hurricane.

476
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,405
Why ?

477
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,080
Felt like a swim.

478
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:45,152
Mariel...

479
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:46,825
what do you want for dinner, Tom,

480
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,505
pot roast or chicken ?

481
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,822
I think Jesse would prefer chicken.

482
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,057
What's wrong with you ?

483
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:03,450
I saw myself...

484
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,382
in the water...

485
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:10,917
dead...

486
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:16,788
rotting actually...

487
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:23,276
but it was me...

488
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:27,922
or at least what used to be me.

489
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:31,425
Oh, my god.

490
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,763
So chicken or pot roast ?

491
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,975
- Mariel...
- Don't.

492
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:44,269
- Did you know ?
- No.

493
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,259
Did you ?

494
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:49,642
No.

495
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:56,050
Then maybe you need to go
and see it for yourself.

496
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,153
So ?

497
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,365
So I-I went there...

498
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,555
to the cove.

499
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:11,814
Exactly where you said you were.

500
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:13,843
And...

501
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,656
did you see it ?

502
00:40:34,463 --> 00:40:35,296
Tom ?

503
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:41,623
I didn't see a thing.
