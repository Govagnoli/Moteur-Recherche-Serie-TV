4
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:18,473
Russell?

5
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:21,821
Russell?

6
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:25,249
Hey.

7
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:25,978
What's wrong?

8
00:01:26,013 --> 00:01:27,090
There's, um...

9
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,492
there's someone outside.

10
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:43,686
Hey, come on, guys.

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,172
Whatever it was, they're gone now.

12
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,983
Sheriff, can we ask you some questions?

13
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,127
Do you have a minute for us?

14
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:04,999
How are you feeling, sheriff?

15
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:05,876
I feel great.

16
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:07,685
I'm happy to be getting home to my family so soon.

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,386
I'm also grateful for the excellent doctors here at the hospital.

18
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,700
Any suspects in your shooting?

19
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:14,646
I'm not gonna get into the investigation right now.

20
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:16,998
You know, I'm gonna take my wife's advice...

21
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,027
go home and get some rest.

22
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,487
As for the investigation, the detective here
will answer all of your questions.

23
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:23,085
- Thank you, everybody.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,337
Detective, what information can you give us right now about this case?

25
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,602
- I'm gonna miss having you around.
- I'll see you tonight.

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,131
All set, sheriff?

27
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,429
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

28
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,626
I'm sure it was a person.
They were watching me.

29
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:49,543
A man or a woman?

30
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:52,434
I- I don't know.

31
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:55,600
They were crouched down in the doorway, and then...

32
00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:59,362
and then they just took off.

33
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:00,921
I...

34
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:04,106
I'm having a baby, Russell.

35
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,203
I don't know if I can stay here any longer.

36
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:10,286
Honey, I know that you're on edge with all that's happened,

37
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,183
and I understand,

38
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:14,004
but I'm still not sure that we have anything to be afraid of.

39
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:19,684
Hey, I will protect you, I promise.

40
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,551
I want our baby to be safe, Russell.

41
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:26,567
This doesn't feel safe.

42
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:27,251
I'll find it...

43
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,503
him, her, whatever it was...

44
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:30,638
and I'll take care of it.

45
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:35,511
Three days ago, I was shot,

46
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,712
and now, well, I'm almost completely healed.

47
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,534
Some of you seem surprised.

48
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:44,621
Well, me, too.

49
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,597
I did not know that my body could do this.

50
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,621
Like you, I'm still learning about who and what I am,

51
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:57,379
but one thing I've discovered is that none of us

52
00:03:57,414 --> 00:04:00,923
will experience this transformation in the same way.

53
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:03,923
Some of us will fight it.

54
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,847
Others may even become violent.

55
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,468
I'm looking for a man who needs our help today.

56
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,152
His name is Lewis Sirk.
He's my deputy.

57
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:25,286
If any of you know where he is,
I'd like to hear from you.

58
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,245
Small town, somebody must know something.

59
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,935
No?

60
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,127
All right...

61
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,464
but if any of you are harboring him...

62
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:53,069
if any of you are with holding information,

63
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,838
you will all be held accountable.

64
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:21,953
No, don't clean it up yet.

65
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,235
I want to get a good look at the crime scene,

66
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:26,331
and if you don't finish by the end of the day,
don't worry about it.

67
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,576
Mariel and my daughter...
they'll just stay at the hotel again.

68
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:29,568
<i>Roger that, sheriff.</i>

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,512
Got it.

70
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:32,613
Sheriff.

71
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:34,783
Hey.

72
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:37,814
Hey, is the deputy you're lookin' for the fella with one arm?

73
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:42,672
Could you give us a minute?

74
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,772
Yeah. What do you know?

75
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,832
Well, I've been doing a lot of swimming lately.

76
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,551
I was out at Logan Bay,

77
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,417
and I saw this guy swimming with one arm.

78
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,199
It was quite an odd sight to see, I have to tell you.

79
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:59,171
Now I didn't get that close, but when I was leaving,

80
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,684
I saw him washing some clothes on the shore,

81
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:05,001
like me might have been living out there or something.

82
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:07,856
Thank you, thank you.
This is helpful.

83
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:10,524
Yeah, I'm sorry that I didn't say anything earlier, sheriff.

84
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:13,761
I just...well, I just didn't want people to think I was a snitch.

85
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:17,061
You got it. We'll keep this between us, all right?

86
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:17,857
Absolutely.

87
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:24,592
What about the military?

88
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,499
They could have sent someone out here, right?

89
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,626
Larkin was snoopin' around that air base.

90
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,110
They were on her tail.
They could be after her again.

91
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:30,911
In the shower?

92
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,315
Okay, what about Healy?

93
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:35,044
He coulda came out here to talk to one of us.

94
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,337
He's got my phone number.

95
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,965
Then what if it's that guy he told you about...Szura...

96
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,750
the C. I. A. Hybrid assassin?

97
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:41,928
Who said he was an assassin?

98
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,711
Hey, Healy said they were in Cuba together.

99
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,423
What do you think they were doing out there, buying cigars?

100
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:49,887
They were there to check out the lights in the water,
and Szura got taken.

101
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,109
And Healy thinks he shot Underlay, right?

102
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,280
So Szura can become the top dog, the alien king?

103
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,672
It's a theory.
He's not sure.

104
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,821
Well, if this guy thinks Underlay's a threat,

105
00:06:58,856 --> 00:06:59,925
he's really not gonna like Larkin.

106
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,898
She almost went on the news and blew the whistle
on the entire alien invasion.

107
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,766
All right, Dave, we still don't know that they're aliens,

108
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,666
and the only reason that anyone would think

109
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,759
that Larkin is a threat is because you've been blabbing

110
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,938
about our entire family on that stupid blog of yours.

111
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:11,770
It's not stupid.

112
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:12,837
No. No more.

113
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:18,101
She's so frightened now, of everything.

114
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,765
I just have to figure out a way for her to trust me again.

115
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,971
She trusts you, Russ.

116
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,799
She just doesn't trust what's out there.

117
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:28,073
What's that?

118
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:30,322
What's what?

119
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,162
Is that...

120
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:42,703
Whoa. This is mine.

121
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,748
- What's it doing out here?
- I have no idea.

122
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,552
- Look at this.
- What?

123
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:54,195
- What is that, a footprint?
- It's hard to tell.

124
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:56,403
- Dave, give me that.
- What?

125
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:57,888
Your record.

126
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,209
Whoa, hey, that's my favorite Buddy Holly record, Russ.

127
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,205
What are you gonna do with it?

128
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:04,169
No, no, no, no.
Oh, right on Buddy's face.

129
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,879
- Come on.
- Don't worry about it, Dave.

130
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,880
- I'll call you if I need you.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,924
- Sir.
- Hello, Lewis.

132
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:44,959
Could you put the gun down, please?

133
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,511
Y- yeah, of course.

134
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:48,994
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:50,371
Here.

136
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:53,419
Just put it down.

137
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:05,098
Hi, dad.

138
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:24,552
You brought him to our house.

139
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:26,303
You told me to take care of him, so that's what I did.

140
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:28,435
Well, I didn't mean for you to take care of him like this.

141
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:29,994
Nothing happened, dad.

142
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,164
Lewis and I are friends, that's all.

143
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:33,609
He just hasn't wanted to see anyone.

144
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,312
I mean, he's been really upset because of you.

145
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,073
You lied to me.

146
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:38,757
I- I...

147
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:39,853
no, you lied to me.

148
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:41,261
You told me he got shot, but that's not true.

149
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,859
That's not how his arm got messed up.

150
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:44,116
What were you thinking, dad?

151
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:47,817
He lost his arm in iraq, and he...

152
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:51,927
and he goes in the water and something incredible happened to him...

153
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:53,722
his arm came back.

154
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:54,720
Kira...

155
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,784
I mean, his arm came back,

156
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:57,270
and you just got so freaked out by it,

157
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,905
that you told him to cut it off.

158
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,598
What happened to Lewis is very complicated,

159
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,500
and...and if people find out about it,

160
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,871
they will tear him apart.

161
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:06,364
Why?

162
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,688
Because they'll think he's a monster, and...and...

163
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:13,063
they will destroy him.

164
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,154
Dad, it was a miracle.

165
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:17,945
It had to be.

166
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,912
And you just didn't have enough faith to support it.

167
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:22,624
Is that what he told you?

168
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,956
Is that why he shot me?

169
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:26,393
He didn't shoot you.

170
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:27,686
How do you know?

171
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:29,937
Because I was talking to him when it happened.

172
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,185
He gave me the number for a pay phone out here,

173
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,780
and we were talking when Mariel called and said you'd been shot.

174
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,272
I want you to know that despite appearances,

175
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:42,583
Kira and I have not been intimate in any way.

176
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,991
We've just talked.

177
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:48,026
Lewis, you left a note in my mailbox accusing me of betraying you.

178
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:49,927
And I'm sorry about that, sir, but...

179
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,714
do you believe in god, sir?

180
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:00,545
Yeah.

181
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:04,504
You do? 'Cause Kira wasn't sure.

182
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,460
She thought you didn't.

183
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,801
Well, Kira's 17, Lewis,

184
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,732
and she's unsure about a lot of things.

185
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:09,719
I believe in god.

186
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,888
I believe that he saved my life more than once,

187
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,258
and I believe that he saved yours

188
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:15,999
when you made the decision to remove your arm.

189
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:20,043
That's very difficult to comprehend.

190
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:21,451
I know, I know.

191
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,012
I have to have faith in my leader, sir.

192
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,552
I couldn't follow you unless you were a man of faith.

193
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,526
I'm sorry I doubted you.

194
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:39,801
It's all right.

195
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,639
There's more stuff missing from up here, Russ,
my record player is gone, too.

196
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,900
- Why did you bring this back?
- We found it by his record.

197
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:04,774
But what is it?

198
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,881
- Oh, my god.
- What?

199
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:09,458
My beer.
Bastard stole my beer.

200
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,943
I had at least two six- packs down there.

201
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:15,109
Russell, it...it was a person that was outside the bathroom,

202
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:17,890
not a horse or a deer or whatever this is.

203
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,561
Larkin, I don't know what this is yet.

204
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:20,439
I'm going back out there.

205
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:21,701
Dave, wait a second.

206
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,565
No, I bet you it's those kids that hang out at the steel bridge.

207
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:26,123
Saw them cruising their A. T. V. S around it yesterday. Punks.

208
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:28,825
- Hey, dad?
- What?

209
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:30,618
Tom is out back and he wants to talk to you.

210
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,472
Yeah, daddy and Dave built it for me.

211
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:39,158
Tom?

212
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:42,279
Hey. Rosie was just showing me her tree house.

213
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:43,610
Surprised to see you up and around.

214
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:44,561
A lot of people are.

215
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:45,136
Come here, baby.

216
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:48,253
Russell, you mind if I ask you a few questions?

217
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:50,273
No.

218
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:53,698
In private.

219
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,057
Come on, Russ, let's take a ride.

220
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,110
You ever been in the backseat of one of these things?

221
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,861
Oh, of course you have.

222
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,142
That must have been pretty scary.

223
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,884
Arrested, young kid, lookin' at murder one.

224
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,874
I didn't shoot you, Tom.

225
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,424
Did I say you were a suspect?

226
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,278
Fingerprints all over my house aside,

227
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:24,056
your son owning a. 45 aside,

228
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,389
did I accuse you in any way?

229
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,786
My son owns a. 45 because you gave it to him.

230
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:28,966
What do you want?

231
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,566
I know you know what I am,

232
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,279
at least, you think you do,

233
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,023
but someone must have helped you with this information.

234
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:45,292
You told your wife stories of people being replicated,

235
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,957
mass suicides, children being killed,

236
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:50,585
stories that you claim someone else told you.

237
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,096
Who is this person, Russell?

238
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,152
Because they sure don't sound like they like me.

239
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,207
This person didn't shoot you, either.

240
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:58,768
- How do you know?
- I know.

241
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:01,459
Well, do you have any idea who did?

242
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,419
No proof.

243
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,401
I'm open to conjecture.

244
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:15,469
There's a guy named Szura.
He might be your guy.

245
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,485
Szura?

246
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,329
- And where did you hear this name?
- Same person.

247
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,779
Well, this person carries a lot of weight with you, doesn't he?

248
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:25,467
Well, I trust him.

249
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:26,796
But you're not gonna tell me who he is?

250
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:27,529
No.

251
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:28,710
Because?

252
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,298
He doesn't trust you,

253
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,235
although he does feel that your survival's important,

254
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:36,977
and he's certain that Szura's a threat...

255
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,116
which is interesting because...

256
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,550
well, he's one of you.

257
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:43,994
One of me?

258
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,392
Oh, one of the "hybrids"?

259
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:48,792
I heard that's what you're calling us.

260
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:49,781
That's very trendy.

261
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,815
How do you spell Szura?

262
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:12,520
Rosie?

263
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,907
Dave?

264
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,123
Lark! Hey!

265
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:19,760
What is it?

266
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:21,778
She saw something oufront.

267
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:22,575
By the front door.

268
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,148
Hey, hey.

269
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:25,128
Hey, what'd you see, pal?

270
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,576
I don't know, but it was big.

271
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,678
Want me to look for this?

272
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:30,571
- No, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey, Jesse, no.

273
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:32,094
I'll go...
I'll go look for it.

274
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:33,693
I want you guys to go wait in Rose's room, okay?

275
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,931
All right? Catch your breath, there, kiddo, okay?

276
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:38,146
You're all right.

277
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,403
Quickly, come on.

278
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,146
What do you think it is, Larkin?

279
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,670
All right, keep the door locked, okay?

280
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:44,887
All right.

281
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:47,629
Larkin?

282
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,191
Okay, Rosie. Why don't you sit right here, okay?

283
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:54,149
But what is uncle Dave gonna do if finds it?

284
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:07,811
Okay.

285
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,005
What...

286
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:26,086
Oh, god, oh, god.

287
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:27,115
Dave?

288
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:31,185
It's in the house.

289
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:42,375
Where's daddy?

290
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:45,001
When's he coming home?

291
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:46,981
He's with Tom, sweetie.

292
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,070
But I'm sure he'll come home as soon as he can.

293
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:52,584
I want to help him.

294
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:53,924
I want to help Dave.

295
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:55,104
We're staying here.

296
00:18:59,026 --> 00:18:59,519
Dave?

297
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:03,515
Dave?

298
00:19:49,946 --> 00:19:50,403
Dave?

299
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:51,889
Dave?

300
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:56,302
I'm helping him.

301
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:57,368
Dad would want me to.

302
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:58,017
I don't care.

303
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,083
This is your brother, Larkin.

304
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:00,871
Are you not the least bit worried about him?

305
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,966
Yes, but I'm worried about you, too.

306
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:43,126
Russell.

307
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:48,987
Now that all our cards are on the table...

308
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:55,533
I'm hoping we can have a smoother, more productive relationship.

309
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,833
Just because someone's different
doesn't make them a monster.

310
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:03,488
Funny. I just said the same thing to my wife this morning.

311
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:22,224
Look...whoever you are, just tell me what you want.

312
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,668
I've got a gun!

313
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,644
I'll shoot you, I swear!

314
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:03,154
Dave? Dave?

315
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:06,768
shoot it!

316
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:15,978
Mariel?

317
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:18,412
Hey, Kira.

318
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:20,506
Hey.

319
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:23,589
What's up?

320
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,737
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah, of course.

321
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,234
Kira?

322
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:44,405
What happens in the water?

323
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,851
Something happened to you the night of the hurricane, right,

324
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,772
and to my dad after the plane crash?

325
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,843
You both came out different, didn't you?

326
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,903
What happened?

327
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,226
I don't know.

328
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm trying to figure that out.

329
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,592
I know someone else it happened to.

330
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:20,494
Really?

331
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,427
Why hasn't it happened to me?

332
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:38,538
Russell, I'm telling you, it kinda looks like me.

333
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,278
I wouldn't get too close.

334
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:50,420
Oh, he's still conscious, Russ.

335
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,904
Yeah, I can see that.

336
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:07,669
Oh, man, Russ...

337
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:09,421
he does look like me.

338
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:14,025
I mean, a very messed up version of me,

339
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,644
but...

340
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:17,805
if you look into his eyes...

341
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:23,701
then it might not be an accident
that this thin was taking my stuff.

342
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:24,690
Dave?

343
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:25,680
Hey.

344
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:26,214
Larkin.

345
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:29,752
What is it?

346
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:32,189
Did you catch it?

347
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:35,768
Oh, my god, what is that?

348
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:36,834
We're not exactly sure.

349
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:42,239
Is it a hybrid?

350
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:46,120
Russell, this may have happened
the night that creature got ahold of my legs.

351
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,492
What are you saying?

352
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:53,081
The night...

353
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,839
after the hurricane, Dave got attacked...

354
00:25:58,485 --> 00:25:59,063
in the water.

355
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:02,147
We told everyone it was a gator, but...

356
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:03,638
it wasn't a gator.

357
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:11,755
so...you're saying that you think that this...

358
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:14,876
thing...

359
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,283
came from you?

360
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,440
I was only under for a minute.

361
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:21,343
Russell pulled me out really fast.

362
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,542
It may not have gotten enough genetic information.

363
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,934
Aw, hell, Russ.

364
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,533
What are we going to do?

365
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:33,639
It looks really sick.

366
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,303
It's all bleeding, its skin's all blistered.

367
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,321
It think it's having trouble breathing.

368
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:39,348
I think we need to do something.

369
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:41,097
All right, look, I got a first aid kit in my truck.

370
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,021
Are you going to touch it?

371
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:43,999
It may be dying.

372
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:46,054
But, Russell, you don't know what that thing is.

373
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:47,273
You don't know what it's going to do.

374
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,302
Larkin...

375
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:51,353
Larkin, come here.

376
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:52,230
No.

377
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:53,256
No, no, no, come here.

378
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,654
It's...it's trying to see you.

379
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:57,100
I don't think he wants you to leave.

380
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:03,798
It's okay, come here.

381
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:13,885
If you just come down here...

382
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:17,651
oh, god!

383
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:18,375
Okay, it's okay.

384
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:18,986
What is it doing?

385
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:19,564
I don't know.

386
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,419
All right, back up, back up. Okay...

387
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:25,730
all right, all right, all rit, back, back, back.

388
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:48,173
What is it?

389
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:50,952
It's us.

390
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,884
It's...it's us when we were kids.

391
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:10,019
It's us.

392
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:18,316
There are a lot of mr. Varon's fingerprints here, sir.

393
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,979
Do you know if he owns a. 45?

394
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,500
He didn't shoot me, Lewis.

395
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:25,013
The only reason I wanted to talk to him

396
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:28,516
was to see what he knew, and he knows a lot.

397
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,837
It may lead to something...

398
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,957
but he didn't do this.

399
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:35,252
Are you...

400
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:37,158
Are you feelin' all right, sir?

401
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:39,363
Better than all right.

402
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,131
I hope you never get shot, Lewis,

403
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,501
but if it should happen,

404
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:47,243
be glad you're in the body you got right now.

405
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:48,233
It's a hell of an upgrade.

406
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,869
Thanks.

407
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:54,861
Kira, hey, baby.

408
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,152
I thought I was gonna meet you at the hotel.

409
00:28:57,187 --> 00:28:58,364
I need some more clothes.

410
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,036
I talked to Mariel.

411
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:04,872
Oh?

412
00:29:05,518 --> 00:29:06,738
I had some questions for her.

413
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,221
She said I should talk to you.

414
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,795
Well, it's not really a great time right now, honey.

415
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,945
We're still working.

416
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,623
Well, when is a good time?

417
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:16,333
I don't know.

418
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,768
Well, can I talk to Lewis, then?

419
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,128
About what?

420
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:24,366
Dad, can I just talk to him, please, for two minutes?

421
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,168
Will you come with me to get my stuff?

422
00:29:31,034 --> 00:29:31,678
I...

423
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:36,574
yeah.

424
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:37,869
Take a break. Go ahead.

425
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:40,618
Five.

426
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:56,526
How's he doing?

427
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:00,409
His breathing has slowed down a lot.

428
00:30:02,157 --> 00:30:02,882
Hey, Lark, come here.

429
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:05,934
This was, uh,

430
00:30:06,427 --> 00:30:07,921
this was my favorite picture of us when we were kids.

431
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:08,529
Did you know that?

432
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,372
He could have taken a lot of pictures,

433
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:13,591
but he took this one.

434
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:15,724
How much do you think he knows?

435
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:19,832
I mean...

436
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:23,829
do you think he remembers when this was taken?

437
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:27,520
I don't know.

438
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:30,451
Does he have your memories?

439
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:33,610
Well, Mariel has hers.

440
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:37,492
Yeah, but Mariel came back whole.

441
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,289
Everyone we know of, so far, anyway, has come back whole.

442
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:55,084
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble with my dad.

443
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:57,739
No, no, no, it's not your fault.

444
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:04,521
It was inappropriate for me to be sharing the things with you that I did.

445
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:10,671
But, you know, I've just never been that close with people,

446
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,468
especially after I lost the arm.

447
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:18,340
People were always like,"oh, poor guy."

448
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:21,499
I hate that.

449
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:23,021
I know.

450
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:25,114
People have always treated me like,

451
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,739
"poor orphan girl, lost her mom."

452
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,937
It sucks.

453
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,705
Look, I want you to know that

454
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,445
even if we don't get to see each other much anymore,

455
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,267
I believe everything you said.

456
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,764
I believe that you getting your arm back was a miracle.

457
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,047
I'm sorry my father didn't.

458
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:49,636
Thank you.

459
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:51,729
It's his problem.

460
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:55,459
I tried talking to Mariel about it,

461
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:58,086
but I think I just made her uncomfortable.

462
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,326
Lewis...

463
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:08,514
I want to know what's in the water.

464
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:11,292
Good or bad, I want to know about it,

465
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,927
'cause I've always felt different, too.

466
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,428
I mean, people have accepted me...

467
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:21,136
and I've even been popular,

468
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:25,773
but I've never really felt like I belonged anywhere...

469
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:29,693
not even in my own family.

470
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,369
And it's just getting worse.

471
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:35,448
I mean, I feel like they're part of this secret club, you know?

472
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,998
And they just don't want me to be a part of it.

473
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,538
Yeah.

474
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:51,489
You know, Kira, you might want to talk to father Scanlon about all this.

475
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:53,223
He runs the hurricane survivor group,

476
00:32:54,176 --> 00:32:56,533
- and they've all had similar exper...
- Lewis.

477
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,883
- I promised Mariel that we'd finish tonight.
- It's all right. I was just leaving.

478
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,669
- Good night, Lewis.
- Night, Kira.

479
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:14,411
See ya.

480
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:22,806
So you two work everything out?

481
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:26,232
She's a very special girl, sir.

482
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:26,954
Yes, she is.

483
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:27,987
She's also a very young girl.

484
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:30,075
And in many ways, she's a very naive girl.

485
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,263
I suggested she speak with father Scanlon.

486
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,498
Whenever I've had questions about things,

487
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:38,830
he's always been very helpful.

488
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,609
But you haven't spoken to him recently, have you?

489
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:46,343
Oh, yes, sir. He's the first person I sought counsel from

490
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:47,632
after I left your house.

491
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:51,552
Really?

492
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:55,502
- He's my priest.
- No, I know.

493
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:57,301
You saw him recently?

494
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:01,553
- Did you talk about cutting off your...
- Yes, sir, but it was in confession,

495
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:03,219
so...

496
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:10,658
Sir?

497
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:26,338
- Should we take him to the hospital?
- I think it's too late for that.

498
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:36,734
I should go inside.

499
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:41,513
I promised Rose I wouldn't be gone for very long.

500
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:44,993
Hey, listen, uh, don't...

501
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,028
don't tell the kids about this.

502
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:46,790
Yeah, I won't.

503
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:52,198
Russ...

504
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:02,138
I hope our baby's like you.

505
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:10,212
I hope that he or she is never afraid of what they don't understand.

506
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:33,499
Oh, my god, I am heartily sorry for my sins,

507
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:36,995
and I firmly resolve,

508
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,281
with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins...

509
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:46,328
to do penance...

510
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,402
and to amend my life.

511
00:35:53,494 --> 00:35:54,142
I...

512
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,715
- Tom.
- It's all right, father.

513
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,873
You're not alone.

514
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,343
We both know it was you.

515
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,518
What do you mean?

516
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:14,511
Oh, come on, what,

517
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:16,753
are you gonna make me start quoting passages of judas?

518
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:23,873
Why would you want to kill me?

519
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:30,154
You abuse the privilege of God's grace.

520
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,961
You...you mutilated a man in the name of your own...

521
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:38,017
twisted belief.

522
00:36:41,186 --> 00:36:42,558
You misled us all, Tom.

523
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:47,560
After Lewis came to me, I was...

524
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:51,595
overcome with rage at your betrayal.

525
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:57,846
To think that I had counseled you in God's name...

526
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:04,299
How could you think you'd ever escape His justice?

527
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,127
How could you ever think that you'd escape mine?

528
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:18,776
Are your deputies outside?

529
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:24,985
You're not going with my deputies.

530
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,169
As a matter of fact,
you're not even gonna go to jail.

531
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,823
I'm gonna send you to another place entirely.

532
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:36,097
What sort of place?

533
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:39,182
It's a place that an old friend of mine runs.

534
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:42,043
A mr. Szura.

535
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:43,680
Have you ever heard of him?

536
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:44,672
