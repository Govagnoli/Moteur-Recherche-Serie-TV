00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,656
The hurricane creates chaos.

2
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:03,816
Mariel, look out.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:05,270
We thought it was gonna hit further north,

4
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,602
but it hit right over Homestead.

5
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:11,221
Szura was supposed to be training these people
to reenter society.

6
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:14,133
So basically we're dealing with
an armed hybrid militia.

7
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:16,981
Everyone's really freaked out.

8
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:18,812
I know some guys who can make people talk.

9
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,344
He's my stepdad.
He's the sheriff.

10
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:21,640
The sheriff that killed your mother.

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,572
Hey, deputy, if you can hear me,
raise your hands.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,393
- Let me go!
- Mommy!

13
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,187
- Let her go!
- Jesse!

14
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:31,513
He's got a whole operation.

15
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:33,733
Genocide under the cover of a hurricane.

16
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:38,421
Tonight you are going to deliver
what is inside of them.

17
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,481
Oh, my god.

18
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:42,652
There's a major emergency at the wharf.

19
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:43,953
A lot of people are gonna die.

20
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:49,211
They're watching everything.

25
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:34,800
<i>Just keep moving.
Everything is gonna be fine.</i>

26
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,361
<i>Keep moving. There's nothing
to be afraid of.</i>

27
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:53,390
Why are they doing this to us?

28
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,953
I don't know.
Just hold tight to me, okay?

29
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,053
Look, it's gonna be okay.

30
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,880
It's gonna be okay.

31
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:00,270
Jesse?

32
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:03,841
- Get under those stairs.
- I have to find my mom!

33
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:07,010
No, not now.
Just meet us under those stairs!

34
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:08,673
Mom, it's gonna be all right.

35
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,700
- Brett!
- Hey!

36
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:11,591
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,110
Man, they just pulled us out of our house.

38
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,033
Man, we didn't even have time to pack a suitcase!

39
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,931
What about your dad and your brother?

40
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,031
They separated us when we got off the truck.

41
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,751
Is this messed up or what?!

42
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:40,031
Get off of me!

43
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:42,810
Get off of me!

44
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:03,032
My god, they're pushing them
into the water.

45
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:06,122
I have to find a way out of here.

46
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:11,622
How many women are up there?

47
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,411
At least 30.

48
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,271
- Are they all hybrids?
- And all pregnant.

49
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,143
God. Here, give me the gun.

50
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,691
All right, stay here.

51
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:21,072
I'm gonna try and find Larkin
and the kids.

52
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,823
- Russell!
- Just stay in this area.

53
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,192
We'll be back for you, I promise.
Go.

54
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:39,723
You don't understand, colonel.

55
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:42,241
There is a major emergency at the wharf.

56
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,262
And if we don't get some soldier
down there A.S.A.P.,

57
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,932
a lot of people are gonna die!

58
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,081
I'm sorry, deputy,

59
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,372
but we just don't have the manpower right now.

60
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,510
Most of our people went up north.

61
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:52,543
Well, you must have someone!

62
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:53,690
Just tell her to look out the window!

63
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,862
Is this request coming directly from the sheriff?

64
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,113
<i>Yes! From the sheriff and from me!</i>

65
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:01,352
- I'm a veteran...
- Just look out the damn window right now!

66
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:03,503
<i>Look!</i>

67
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:28,910
It's me, honey.

68
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,243
Dad, what are they doing out there?
I hear people screaming.

69
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:34,643
I want you to lay down on the seat
and don't get up.

70
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:35,642
We're moving.

71
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:36,892
- Now?
- Now.

72
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:38,341
Now!

73
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:57,060
- Where are you going?
- To find a safe place to have our babies.

74
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:59,732
- What about the other women?
- They didn't want to leave.

75
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:03,210
- Can you get us to the hospital?
- I don't think that's possible.

76
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:07,661
I gotta get you away from this window.

77
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,463
We're gonna go downstairs.
Just come with me.

78
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:10,920
You're gonna be okay.

79
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:12,593
Keep breathing.

80
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,192
Just keep walking.

81
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:31,801
Mom! Mom, where are you?
Mom!

82
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:36,030
Hang on to me, Rosie!

83
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:37,913
Hang on.

84
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:41,221
Are you all right?

85
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,322
Crawl under here.

86
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,943
I want you to stay under here, okay?

87
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:47,832
And don't move.

88
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:48,900
Okay, mom.

89
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:50,593
Jess!

90
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:52,500
Jesse!

91
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:54,140
Larkin!

92
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:57,061
- Jess, I'm here!
- I'm coming!

93
00:05:58,718 --> 00:05:59,623
You're almost here!

94
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:01,570
Come on! Come here!

95
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:05,750
- Stay under here.
- Okay. Okay.

96
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:06,562
Stay with Rose.

97
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,012
Don't move.

98
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:09,913
It's okay. It's okay.

99
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,192
Anyone tries to run away, shoot 'em.

100
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,482
Throw their bodies in the water.

101
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,960
What if they're already dead?

102
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,932
There may be some life left in 'em.

103
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:40,582
No! No!

104
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:41,883
No!

105
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,753
Please! No!

106
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,153
No! No!

107
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:49,160
Mom!

108
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,393
Get off of me!

109
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,183
No! No! No!

110
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,473
Bring her back!

111
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,541
Larkin!

112
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,663
Larkin, they took Rose away!
Rose!

113
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,041
Rose!

114
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,613
Rose !

115
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,580
- Larkin!
- Put her down!

116
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,290
- Larkin!
- Stay here!

117
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,402
Rose!

118
00:07:14,078 --> 00:07:15,442
Larkin!

119
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:17,783
Larkin!

120
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,303
Stay down!

121
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,402
Just stay down, baby.

122
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:53,222
Larkin!

123
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:55,433
Rosie!

124
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:18,243
Tom, don't shoot!
It's me!

125
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:21,302
I found Mariel!

126
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:23,703
She's in the storage house just up the pier.

127
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,352
- Is she all right?
- For now.

128
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:26,733
Come on.

129
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:40,021
Move! Get out of the way!
Get out there!

130
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,841
Stop those men!
Move that truck!

131
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,373
<i>It is air force security.</i>

132
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,310
<i>This area is being secured.</i>

133
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,201
<i>All personnel stand fast.</i>

134
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,253
<i>Stand fast. Cease fire.</i>

135
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:03,343
<i>Cease fire.</i>

136
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:06,131
<i>Put your weapons on the ground
and put your hands in the air.</i>

137
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:11,022
<i>I repeat, this is air force security.</i>

138
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:14,071
<i>This area is now under air force command.</i>

139
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:41,670
<i>Do not move!</i>

140
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:47,581
<i>This area is now under air force security command.</i>

141
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:54,682
<i>You are to stand down immediately. Stand down.</i>

142
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:03,573
<i>All civilians remain in the way.
Remain in the way.</i>

143
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:15,251
You okay, baby?

144
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,722
Stay with Russell.
I'm going to find mariel.

145
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,553
2- story building just up the pier.

146
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:30,257
Larkin!

147
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,412
Jesse!

148
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,223
Kira!

149
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:36,273
Hey!

150
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,211
Hey.

151
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:40,710
You all right?

152
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,151
- Hey, where's Larkin and the kids?
- I don't know.

153
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,713
She said that they were here,
but you haven't seen them?

154
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:45,861
No. No, no, no.

155
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:46,900
Larkin!

156
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:49,651
Jesse!

157
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,463
- Russell!
- Hey!

158
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:55,312
- Russell! Russell!
- Hey!

159
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,302
Oh, my god.

160
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:01,010
- daddy!
- Hey! Hey!

161
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:04,983
You okay?

162
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:07,182
- Hey, pop.
- What's up, Jess?

163
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,363
You all right?

164
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,261
oh, my gosh, give me this one.

165
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:13,101
You all right?

166
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:15,813
The baby? The baby's okay?

167
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:16,883
Everybody's okay?

168
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:21,820
We're all okay.

169
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,052
We're okay.

170
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,013
Okay, ladies, settle in.

171
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:38,993
- Where are you taking us?
- Just get in the car!

172
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,471
Mariel!

173
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:42,840
Go!

174
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,091
- Tom!
- Go!

175
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:51,983
Mariel!

176
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,051
Mariel...

177
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:15,121
Szura and the hurricane are gone,

178
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,943
but their collective damage is everywhere.

179
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,080
Lots of people are missing.

180
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:23,881
Many more are dead,
and Mariel has been kidnapped.

181
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,270
The military has secured the area,

182
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:30,682
rounded up all the hybrids,

183
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,673
interrogating everybody all night long.

184
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,553
Not surprisingly,

185
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,291
the guy they spent the most time talking to
was sheriff Tom Underlay.

186
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:41,833
I have to admit,

187
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,080
the lights in the water don't seem so scary

188
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,561
when you compare them to the looks
on some of these people's faces.

189
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:55,193
When half of the town thinks
that the other half tried to kill them,

190
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,611
how do you recover?

191
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,562
Anyway, all I'm saying is

192
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:07,410
if we don't do something
about this guy now, who will, huh?

193
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,302
He's the sheriff,
so who's gonna stop him?

194
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,643
He's the most connected guy
in town, Brett.

195
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,572
Come on, man.

196
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,783
You've lost people,
I've lost people.

197
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:24,912
How much more are we gonna take?

198
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,090
I need to find my wife.
You have to let me out of here.

199
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:32,762
Your wife is not
the only person missing, Tom!

200
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,740
Lots of people went
into the water last night,

201
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:35,932
and we need to know why!

202
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:39,512
I've told you Szura wants to create
a majority.

203
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:43,021
- He wants to make everyone like him!
- And like you.

204
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:45,201
Come on, you really think
that I'm involved with this?

205
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,683
Why would I have them bring you here?

206
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,021
Why would I be shooting at them

207
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,420
from some damn truck that you gave him?

208
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,250
Those trucks were sent to a relief group

209
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,640
- run by a man named Dennison.
- Dennison is Szura!

210
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,640
- And somebody on your team obviously knows it.
- Not me.

211
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,083
Well, then someone above you,

212
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:04,610
someone who wanted this to happen.

213
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,250
Come on, Tom. Nobody wants to see
innocent people killed.

214
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,961
Nobody wants to see war, either,

215
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,421
but when it comes to national security,

216
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:12,413
we're pretty good about justifying everything.

217
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,383
You yourself have six hybrids locked up
at the base

218
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,282
that you're testing like lab rats,

219
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,490
and you think it's all for the greater good?

220
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:22,943
One small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind?

221
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:23,972
Think again, colonel.

222
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,692
Because if Szura has his way,

223
00:14:26,728 --> 00:14:28,740
there may not be any mankind left.

224
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,140
We'll find him.

225
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:33,852
Yeah, before or after he murders my wife?

226
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,370
You have to let me out of here.

227
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:41,100
Hey.

228
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:45,752
Okay, you guys are all clear to go.

229
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,512
Listen, Sirk's gonna take you back
to Tom's.

230
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:49,922
Stay there until you hear from us,
all right?

231
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,242
- What about Mariel?
- We're going after her.

232
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,481
Russ, be careful.

233
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:05,183
- Okay, so I'll see you guys soon?
- Please find mommy.

234
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,482
We will, honey.

235
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:12,193
We will.

236
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,160
- Where do we start?
- Battery park.

237
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:20,690
Why would Szura be there?

238
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,023
It's remote, it's secure,

239
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:24,460
and it's where I originally set him up.

240
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,243
Oh, I don't suppose you've shared this
with colonel Lopez.

241
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,260
No, I kept that part to myself.

242
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,861
Cover this area.

243
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:53,013
- This area, at the top.
- Yes, sir, right away.

244
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,120
Lie down.
I'll be right back.

245
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,602
Just lie down.
It's okay.

246
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,290
We have to get these women to a hospital,

247
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:17,442
or they're not gonna survive.

248
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,102
I don't care if they survive.

249
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,530
- Where are my children?
- They're fine.

250
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:27,380
- And my husband?
- He's fine, too.

251
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,630
He's probably out saving the world somewhere.

252
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,962
Now do your job.

253
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:39,902
All of these women are carrying
multiple fetuses.

254
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:45,772
- I'm not sure that I am capable of-
- Oh! God!

255
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,281
Oh, Mariel... help me.

256
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:55,390
Help. Help.

257
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,862
- She's bleeding.
- Well, then do something.

258
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:15,580
I...

259
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,170
I have to go to the water.

260
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:22,240
I have to go to the water.

261
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:25,211
Yes, yes. Can you take us
to the water?

262
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:26,740
Please?

263
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,762
P lease.

264
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,201
The water's what we need.

265
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,541
Jesse, you can just get in the back seat here.

266
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,371
Kira, put Rose in the middle.

267
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,780
Here, take this radio.

268
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:48,020
I'm gonna go ahead
and make sure the roads are clear.

269
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:50,032
- Thanks, Lewis.
- You're welcome.

270
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:54,410
Bye, guys.

271
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:55,791
Bye.

272
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:02,273
What's Pettis doing here?

273
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,472
Shouldn't they be in Iraq
profiting from all their misery?

274
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,543
Probably here to help with the cleanup.

275
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:08,803
Yeah, but this quickly?

276
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,872
That's what they do.

277
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,572
The government contracts them
to help rebuild places all over the world.

278
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:14,712
Yeah, I know what they do.

279
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,063
But this storm wasn't even supposed
to hit here.

280
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,550
This hurricane was supposed to hit
a hundred miles up north.

281
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,003
That's where every other relief group is.

282
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:23,460
So what are they doing here?

283
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,360
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

284
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:27,460
Could I trouble you guys for a ride?

285
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,251
- I don't mean to impose.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure, man.

286
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:34,531
- Where you going?
- Sheriff's house.

287
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:38,810
Come on.

288
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,840
Get in the car.

289
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:45,300
Go.

290
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,863
All right, look, man, I can't drive
with you pointing that gun at my head.

291
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:48,781
Go!

292
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,210
We have to get them to the water.

293
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:57,390
Why?

294
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,041
It's what they're telling me they need.

295
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,333
And it makes sense.

296
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,102
Their blood...

297
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:07,923
our blood is much closer to
that of a marine mammal's now.

298
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,643
In order for them to survive,

299
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,062
- I think they probably need to be in the water.
- I told you I am not concerned about-

300
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:15,011
Well, then for their offspring!

301
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:19,892
To survive, they may need to be in the water.

302
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,440
Every other species instinctively knows

303
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,693
where and how to give birth.

304
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,130
Why should they be any different?

305
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:30,723
Get down!

306
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:32,711
Get down!

307
00:19:59,025 --> 00:19:59,810
Mariel!

308
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:03,860
Oh, my god.

309
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,520
- Stay with her.
- What?

310
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,531
- I gotta find szura.
- No! Tom!

311
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,752
I gotta find him.

312
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:24,480
- Come on, we gotta get out of here.
- We have to take them with us.

313
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:24,972
What?

314
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,153
- I need to get them to the water.
- No, we don't have time for that.

315
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,561
- Szura's people could be here any minute.
- No, russell, I'm not leaving them.

316
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,162
What's at the water?

317
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,502
I think it's where
they need to give birth.

318
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,363
Mariel, we may not want them giving birth.

319
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,700
Well, if they don't go there, they'll die.

320
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:37,193
They may die anyway.

321
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,200
I am not leaving them.

322
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,390
We don't know what's inside of them.

323
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,912
It doesn't matter.

324
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:14,842
Tell me, Tom...

325
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:21,253
How many bullets did you take
and survive, huh?

326
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:23,762
You're done here.

327
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,143
I'm afraid that's not possible.

328
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:36,772
Thousands of people were taken
to the water last night...

329
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:42,641
to see the lights,
like you did with your wife.

330
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:44,552
These hybrids...

331
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:50,881
they felt compelled to change
those they loved the most.

332
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:54,581
I don't believe you.

333
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:57,913
Turn on your radio.

334
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:00,801
It's a brave new world, Tom.

335
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:07,091
Evolution swallows us all.

336
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,391
Why didn't anyone answer?

337
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:41,401
- 'Cause maybe nobody's home.
- His door was unlocked.

338
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,640
Call somebody.

339
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,043
Hello?

340
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:52,501
Where'd that deputy take everyone else?

341
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:54,863
Hey.

342
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:57,243
We saw them get into his car.

343
00:23:57,245 --> 00:24:00,141
- Maybe they had trouble on the road.
- We didn't.

344
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,461
Shut the door and lock it.

345
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:12,920
- What's upstairs?
- We don't actually live here.

346
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:16,521
- What's upstairs?
- Bedrooms, I think.

347
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:21,911
- The sheriff's bedroom?
- No, that's in the back.

348
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:25,073
Then that's where we're going.

349
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:47,910
- I'm gonna go out there.
- No, Lewis.

350
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:51,122
Kira, you heard them on the radio.
That man has a gun.

351
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:53,181
- Can't you just wait for my dad?
- No.

352
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,082
I want you to try yo stepfather again.

353
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,731
Don't anyone move.

354
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,151
Didn't anyone ever tell you it was rude
to eavesdrop?

355
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:34,422
Just give me your gun.

356
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:40,742
We just want to talk to your boss.

357
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:43,952
Jesse, is that you?

358
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:45,483
<i>Tom, you gotta get back here.</i>

359
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,081
There are guys in the house with guns,

360
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:48,721
and I'm afraid that they're gonna kill us.

361
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:51,820
Brett?

362
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:53,351
Jesse?

363
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,141
Jesse!

364
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:04,330
Damn it!

365
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:16,470
Mariel.

366
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,862
Are you sure you want to do this?

367
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:22,880
Would you just let them die?

368
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:26,012
I am not sure that what's inside them
is like you.

369
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,560
What if these hybrids are just
a bridge species,

370
00:26:29,106 --> 00:26:31,663
and it's their offspring that we really have to worry about?

371
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:35,592
Just to save a few lives,
are you willing to risk millions more?

372
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:39,210
Whatever's inside them may be different,

373
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,923
but it doesn't mean that it's bad.

374
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,361
And it doesn't mean
that it's dangerous.

375
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:47,953
It's just... different.

376
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,342
And the man I used to be married to
would have understood that.

377
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,010
God help us.

378
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:31,041
Come here.

379
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:50,531
You okay?

380
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:53,240
All right.

381
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,671
Alma.

382
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:35,891
I can't find her pulse.

383
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:23,743
What happened to you, man?

384
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:25,653
We're on the same side.

385
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:28,200
- You know that.
- No, I don't.

386
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,031
I get why you're angry.
I really do.

387
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,210
My dad saved you.

388
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:36,022
- Didn't you see that?
- He didn't save my mom.

389
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:40,981
- It wasn't his fault.
- Look, hey!

390
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:42,820
Look, you said everything was his fault!

391
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:44,812
So stop trying to change the story now,
all right?

392
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,750
I said I was angry,
and I told you a lot of things

393
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:47,973
that I was wrong about!

394
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:48,851
Sit down.

395
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:52,090
Sit down!

396
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,672
Where's my family?

397
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:14,853
I don't know.

398
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:17,262
Where are they?

399
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:20,061
Ms. Groves and her brother
are in here with me, sir.

400
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:22,170
I think
everyone else is upstairs.

401
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,181
- You all right, Lewis?
- Yes, sir.

402
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:27,132
But the other man has my gun!

403
00:31:27,406 --> 00:31:29,802
That's right, and he'll use it
if I tell him.

404
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:32,963
So how about you hand me yours?

405
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:36,301
- Now, or your kids are dead.
- Who are you?

406
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,121
I'm a revolutionary.

407
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:40,992
And I'm here to take back my town.

408
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:49,422
- Who's this?
- My mom.

409
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:54,613
- Where is she now?
- Dead.

410
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:57,640
Mine, too.

411
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:05,272
She could come back.

412
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,003
Mine did.

413
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:12,550
Yeah?

414
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:18,962
What is she like now, huh?

415
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:21,212
She still the same person?

416
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,151
No.

417
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:24,612
Right.

418
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:27,780
But she's still my mom.

419
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:38,053
There weren't any guns in that closet.
Where do you keep 'em?

420
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:40,522
That's the only gun I've got.

421
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:41,481
Hey!

422
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:43,090
What are you doing, man?

423
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:44,651
You were supposed to call me
when he got here.

424
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,292
- Yeah, I was going to.
- No, he wasn't.

425
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,231
He's blowing you off.
He just wants to rob the place.

426
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:48,951
Shut up.

427
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:53,070
- Where are the kids?
- Up here. They're fine.

428
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:55,633
Damn it, Brett,
why are you telling him that?

429
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,242
- Come on, man, we're leaving.
- What?

430
00:32:57,248 --> 00:33:00,172
This was a mistake, all right?
We're going home.

431
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:03,643
Are you crazy? This son of a bitch
killed your family!

432
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:06,892
- He tried to kill us all!
- Yeah, but killing him won't fix it.

433
00:33:11,016 --> 00:33:12,563
Look, I'm done!

434
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:14,091
And I'm leaving.

435
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:16,460
No, you're not.

436
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:22,860
Tom?

437
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:24,920
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

438
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,261
Everybody's fine.

439
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:30,870
Oh, no.

440
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,270
Hey, Lark, you okay?

441
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,222
Larkin.

442
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:46,323
Oh, my god.

443
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:47,231
Larkin.

444
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,763
Larkin, look at me!

445
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:51,012
Priority, this is unit seven.

446
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:52,193
We have a female victim down.

447
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:53,343
She's been shot.

448
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:57,433
- Squeeze my hand, squeeze my hand.
- Priority, response, please. This is an emergency.

449
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,313
Priority, respond, please!
This is an emergency!

450
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,541
We're not gonna get anyone out here, sir.

451
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,453
- The channels are jammed.
- Get some towels. Come on.

452
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,142
Towels!

453
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:09,173
Come on, come with me!

454
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,043
Larkin, stay with me.
Look at me.

455
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,583
- The baby.
- I know.

456
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:16,800
- The baby.
- I know. I know, I know.

457
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,263
- The baby.
- I know. Just look at me.

458
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,592
Honey, take Rose upstairs,
okay?

459
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:21,852
Go on, sweetie.

460
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,052
I know.
Just stay with me, all right?

461
00:34:24,297 --> 00:34:25,302
I think the bullet hit her lung.

462
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:27,361
Help me turn her over.
Help me turn her over!

463
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,340
Careful, careful.

464
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,723
Oh, my god.

465
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,000
Bullet's out, but she's bleeding badly.

466
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:33,950
Give me the towel!

467
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:35,933
- Coming!
- Go! Go! Bring 'em!

468
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,802
She's gonna need a chest tube, sir.

469
00:34:37,816 --> 00:34:40,023
- We've gotta get her to the hospital!
- There isn't time!

470
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:42,600
- Russell?
- He's coming, he's coming, all right?

471
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:44,352
- Just stay with me.
- Stay with me right now!

472
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:47,760
Her lung's collapsing.

473
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,890
Get her up.
Get her up. Let's go.

474
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:50,413
What? What? No, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

475
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:52,783
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

476
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,762
Stay with them, Lewis.
Lock that guy up and stay with them.

477
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:56,903
- I wanna come with you.
- Stay here!

478
00:34:56,907 --> 00:34:58,842
Don't let anybody leave this house
until I get back.

479
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,331
- That's my sister!
- And I'm trying to keep her alive!

480
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:03,893
Tom, where are you going?!

481
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:18,103
Tom's not here.

482
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:21,693
But Szura's dead.

483
00:35:25,817 --> 00:35:27,873
Come on. Let's go.

484
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:44,763
I really appreciate what you did today,
Russell.

485
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:55,741
I know we've had our... issues.

486
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:03,782
But today I was reminded of
how much good there is...

487
00:36:04,258 --> 00:36:08,010
or was... between us.

488
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:13,812
I'm sorry if I made you do something
you don't feel comfortable with.

489
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,892
You didn't make me do anything.

490
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:28,372
- What?
- You're a good man.

491
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:34,263
And I told your wife that, too.

492
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,072
Thanks...

493
00:36:39,727 --> 00:36:40,902
I think.

494
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:18,192
How are the kids?

495
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:22,043
They're good.

496
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:26,962
They've got a good mother.

497
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:38,322
Is that Tom's car?

498
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:19,732
Tom?

499
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,352
Tom, what is it?

500
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:47,683
What happened?

501
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:52,573
Tom, what happened?

502
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:04,162
What happened?!
