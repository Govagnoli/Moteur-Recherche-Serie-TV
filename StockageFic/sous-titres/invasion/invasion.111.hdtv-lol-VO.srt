2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,700
<i>there's this storm brewing inside me</i>

3
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,912
<i>that is more powerful than any hurricane.</i>

4
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>What really happened to you
that night in the water ?</i>

5
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:08,158
<i>Do you know ?</i>

6
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:09,778
<i>Mariel's not like you and me, father.</i>

7
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,531
<i>- She's afraid of losing her children.
- And you're afraid of losing her.</i>

8
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,310
<i>you did see a body, but it wasn't you.</i>

9
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:19,282
<i>- I was counting on your loyalty, Lewis.
- But I'm loyal to god, sir.</i>

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,412
<i>Lewis ?</i>

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,002
<i>Lewis !</i>

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,833
<i>Do you know what happened to you last night ?</i>

13
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,207
<i>My arm came back, sir.</i>

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,993
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

15
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:30,451
<i>What happed to him is wrong.</i>

16
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:33,960
<i>They'll want to dissect all of us
and I cannot let that happen.</i>

17
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,081
<i>There are people out there
who may be killing themselves</i>

18
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:37,533
<i>and their children.</i>

19
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:39,262
<i>I've been reconstructing this skull.</i>

20
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:40,860
<i>It's almost 10 years old.</i>

21
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:43,397

26
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:59,879
the morning after the hurricane,
when they pulled me from the water...

27
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,362
I felt like I had a secret to tell,
but I didn't know who to tell it to.

28
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:09,686
People don't like it when you change.

29
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,797
They say they do, but they really don't,

30
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,214
because it forces them to change, too,

31
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,399
and that's why I'm so grateful
I found you,

32
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,885
because I know that you understand

33
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,422
and I know that you accept me...

34
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,349
and to those who don't,

35
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:36,075
well, adios.

36
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,351
yeah, well, you stop by
anytime, Mariel.

37
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:53,973
I'm giving out free haircuts
to members of the group.

38
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:55,801
Oh, that's really sweet of you, Roger.

39
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:57,903
Well, we gotta take care
of our own, right ?

40
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,319
Alma !

41
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:04,223
Alma !

42
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:05,800
Alma.

43
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,077
Excuse me.

44
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,131
Damn it, Alma, I've been lookin'
all over for you.

45
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:12,614
We got two sick kids at home and you're hanging out with these losers again !

46
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:13,380
They're not losers !

47
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,719
I'm tellin' you, we don't need these people.

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,943
You need to calm down, son.

49
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:16,766
What-

50
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:18,334
get in the car.

51
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:20,101
Get in the car.

52
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:38,804
Stop it !

53
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,552
Let me through.

54
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,070
Stop it ! Stop it !

55
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,478
Stop it !

56
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,531
Somebody call 9-1-1.

57
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:50,519
He needs an ambulance.

58
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,736
Call 9-1-1.

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,429
Somebody call 9-1-1.

60
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,736
And the good news is
if you need a doctor,

61
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,067
she's right across the hall.

62
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:08,791
Hey, come on, come on.

63
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:09,841
Don't be shy.

64
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:13,301
I really would be more comfortable
in my apartment, sir.

65
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,386
Nonsense, nonsense.

66
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:15,422
After what you've been through,

67
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:18,121
the least we can do
is help nurse you back to health, okay ?

68
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:19,910
All right ? Kira ?!

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,854
Dad ?

70
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,165
Hey, sweetheart.

71
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,094
Deputy Sirk here had a really bad accident yesterday.

72
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:28,904
He was shot in the arm,

73
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,711
and as you know, he never had
much of an arm to begin with,

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,229
so he needs our help.

75
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,646
Would you mind looking after him
for the next couple of days ?

76
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,470
You want me to look after him ?

77
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,424
Sir, that really isn't necessary.

78
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:40,735
No, no, no. We'll put him
in Rose's room

79
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:41,997
while she's out of town.

80
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:42,744
Um, dad-

81
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:44,905
uh, do me a favor. We left
his overnight bag in the car.

82
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:46,502
Can you get that for us ?
Thanks, honey.

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,965
Right... yeah.

84
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,442
Oh, my g-

85
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:17,348
Hey. What are you doing here ?

86
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,606
What's wrong ?

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,933
Are the kids okay ?

88
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,490
Yeah, they're still with Larkin up north.

89
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,606
- I need you to come with me.
- Where ?

90
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,241
To my house. There's something
I have to show you.

91
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,090
- I'm working.
- It's important.

92
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:45,234
- What's this about ?
- You.

93
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:49,263
Sir, this doesn't feel right.

94
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,960
You have to stop arguing
with me, Lewis.

95
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,160
I know what's best for you.

96
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,708
Why'd you tell your daughter
I'd been shot ?

97
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,919
Because the truth is just
a little too complicated.

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,209
I really don't feel comfortable lying, sir.

99
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,876
You didn't lie. I did.

100
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:03,721
Now just get undressed, please.

101
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:06,797
- How long do I have to stay here ?
- Until you're recovered.

102
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,455
-  The doctor said that could be weeks.
- The doctor's wrong.

103
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:12,956
- How do you know ?
- I know.

104
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,205
This really hurts.

105
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:21,699
Yeah, I'll bet. We gotta get you some stronger meds.

106
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:23,879
I don't mean physically, sir

107
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,616
When I lost my arm in the war,
I figured it was god's will,

108
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,938
and  the other night
when I was in the water,

109
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:34,133
I thought god had given me my arm back
to help me swim.

110
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,796
I'm not so sure that was the reason.

111
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:39,825
Well, either way, I'm having
a difficult time with this

112
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:43,257
because I-I feel like I've gone against him.

113
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:44,371
No, no, no, no.

114
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,065
God must have helped you
make the decision to cut off your arm

115
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:50,332
because he knew how difficult
things would be for you otherwise.

116
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,288
I don't understand, sir.

117
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,053
Change scares people, Lewis.

118
00:05:58,414 --> 00:05:59,930
You couldn't just show up into town,

119
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:00,929
flailing around a new arm

120
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,823
like you were captain of the swim team.

121
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:06,268
I mean, folks would be wildly unnerved.

122
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:09,033
They would start poking and prodding at you,

123
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:13,209
trying to look for a rational explanation
for the-the thing,

124
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,672
and there just isn't one.

125
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,771
That's why we need to keep this between us.

126
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:20,834
I guess you're right, sir.

127
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:23,104
Of course I am. Besides,

128
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:24,869
I think one arm suits you.

129
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,140
Gives you an edge.

130
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,478
- Where do you want it ?
- Right by the door, honey.

131
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:38,732
That's great.

132
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,032
Come in, Jess.

133
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,041
It's too cold.

134
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,709
Can you throw me some quarters ?

135
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,025
Uh, I don't really have any quarters.

136
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:59,461
Larkin, do you have any quarters ?

137
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,029
Uh, yeah-yeah, I think there's a few in there. Here.

138
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:09,540
You hungry ?

139
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:13,109
Uh, no. Still recovering from the chocolate corn dog.

140
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,288
Hmm. Yeah, not so good, huh ?

141
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,112
Any food on a stick is not to be trusted.

142
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,453
Okay, Rose...

143
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,095
Throw them in the deep end !

144
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,952
Sorry.

145
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,713
Watch me.

146
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,247
It's too deep.

147
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,502
Can you get them for me ?

148
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:58,716
Jess ?

149
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,577
- Jess ?
- Hold on a second, Rose.

150
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,140
- Hey, Jess ?
- What ?

151
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:20,197
I think I'm gonna go try
to track down a salad.

152
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,080
Can you watch Rose for me ?

153
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:22,551
Yeah.

154
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:23,909
I'll see you back at the room, okay ?

155
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,951
All right.

156
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,793
She's good.

157
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:13,833
Yeah.

158
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,237
Hey. Did you tell her yet ?

159
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:29,743
No.

160
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,623
You sure you want to ?

161
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,380
- Hey, Mariel.
- Hey.

162
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:38,998
So ?

163
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,168
Look, I want you to know the only reason
that I'm doing this

164
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,016
is because if I tried to explain it, I-I couldn'T.

165
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,883
Just show me.

166
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,785
- What is that ?
- A skeleton...

167
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,178
Your husband's skeleton.

168
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,229
The head's under my bed.

169
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,638
We didn't think that
you'd want to see that.

170
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,390
- Is this a joke ?
- No.

171
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:43,596
This is Tom, or at least,
what used to be Tom...

172
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:48,068
and this-this larger carcass
that's wrapped around it,

173
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,623
I think this is the remains of an invasive species
that's moved into the glades.

174
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:54,759
Russell and I found it
at the plane crash site of '96,

175
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,217
the one that Tom survived.

176
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,114
We think that he may have lived
through the initial impact,

177
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:02,809
only to be attacked by this thing,

178
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,090
but Tom is not who you think he is, Mariel.

179
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,572
Hell, he may not be who he thinks he is.

180
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,053
Then who is he ?

181
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:17,500
We think that these creatures
take people's D.N.A.,

182
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:22,927
Add their own poison to the mix
to basically create a new being,

183
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,028
like a hybrid, you know ?

184
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,157
Half us, half them.

185
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,582
It's okay if you're confused
right now 'cause

186
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,300
a lot of people are confused right now,

187
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,150
like all the survivors at your church group.

188
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:39,602
We heard about this morning.

189
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,625
They beat that guy
really badly, didn't they ?

190
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:44,744
Like a pack.

191
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:47,358
Mariel...

192
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:51,713
look, if you can just look at
the science of this thing-

193
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,904
"the science" ?

194
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,952
What are you trying to do here ?

195
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,265
Protect our kids.

196
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:05,726
- I can't have them living in a house-
- Oh my god, you son of a bitch

197
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,200
I  can't let them stay with you. It's not safe.

198
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,108
- I'm their mother !
- Are you sure ?!

199
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,891
He told me that you saw your body in biscayne cove.

200
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:25,839
That was a girl from Florida City.

201
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,025
The girl they pulled out may have been,

202
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,406
but who was in charge
of that operation ? Tom.

203
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,873
Look,  the night of the hurricane,

204
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,802
I think Tom saw you you
after you left here,

205
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:35,013
and I think he knows exactly what happened to you

206
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:38,433
because the same thing happened to him
almost ten years ago, Mariel

207
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:43,574
If I don't have my children
back to me by 6:00 tonight,

208
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,118
I will have a hundred lawyers in this driveway.

209
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,430
Ask him.
Just see what he says.

210
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:48,780
I can't believe you're doing this.

211
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,263
I can't believe you'd want
to hurt our family this badly.

212
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:56,222
- I'm just telling you the truth.
- No, you're telling me your truth !

213
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,896
- Excuse me, mr Deputy ?
- Lewis.

214
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,945
Oh, uh, where would you like this ?

215
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,714
Um, you can just put it right here.

216
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,521
Um, Kira ?

217
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,656
I'm sorry about all this.

218
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,142
It's okay.

219
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,394
I'd really rather be back at my place.

220
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:59,870
How did you get shot ?

221
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,507
hey, I thought you were
gonna rest.

222
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:08,813
Hope you like the soup.

223
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,138
I'm gonna go out for a little bit.

224
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,330
You gonna be all right here ?

225
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,908
I'm very confused, sir.

226
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:25,421
The arm wasn't the only thing
different about me, was it ?

227
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,332
I'm different all over now, aren't I ?

228
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:40,245
Yeah, but in time, you'll come to realize
that it's all for the good.

229
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:42,934
Hey...

230
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:45,729
it's all good.

231
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,502
Baby steps, Lewis,
baby steps.

232
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,373
I've never seen anyone
stay underwater that long.

233
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,841
I've never seen anyone like her,
period.

234
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:13,060
You think she's a mermaid ?

235
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,356
I think she's smokin'.

236
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:21,240
Hey, Rose, you, uh, you want to
go into town with me ?

237
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,160
Are you going to buy
more baby stuff ?

238
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:26,114
No, I was thinking about
buying more Rose stuff.

239
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:27,209
Okay.

240
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,012
- Bye, Jess.
- See you later, Jess.

241
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:04,275
hey.

242
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:06,605
Hey.

243
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,612
- What's up ?
- Nothin'. You're, just...

244
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,355
you're a really good swimmer.

245
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:13,700
Thanks.

246
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,218
You staying here ?

247
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
No. I just like the pool.

248
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:19,323
Have you been in yet ?

249
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:21,800
No. I'm more of an ocean guy.

250
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,468
Chlorine kinda bugs me.

251
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,899
We're kind of far from
the ocean here, aren't we ?

252
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,642
Yeah. I live down south,
like the homestead area.

253
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:32,586
My aunt lives there.

254
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:33,169
Yeah ?

255
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,662
Yeah. My family and I got stuck
down there during the hurricane.

256
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,718
- It was crazy.
- Yeah.

257
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:41,284
Look like you got through it okay.

258
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,021
- What's your name ?
- Jesse.

259
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:48,670
I'm emily.

260
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,881
Hi. Good to meet you.

261
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,967
- So was that your girlfriend ?
- My girlfriend ?

262
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:56,818
- The brunette ?
- The brunette.

263
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,773
-  What, the little one ?
- No, the big one.

264
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:01,157
No, that's-

265
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,097
that's my dad's wife.

266
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,551
Oh. I thought she was your girlfriend.

267
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:09,434
- She doesn't look much older than you.
- Well, she's not.

268
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:13,733
- Well, where did she go ?
- She went shopping with my little sister.

269
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,737
- Do you have a room here ?
- Yeah. We're staying here.

270
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:25,652
- Does it have a bathtub ?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does. Why ?

271
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,186
I just can't believe she reacted that way.

272
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,930
Well, how did you think
she was gonna react ?

273
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,568
You just told her that
she's the bride of frankenstein

274
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,251
and that you're gonna
take her children away, Russ.

275
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,670
- What are you looking for ?
- An old phone book.

276
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:44,806
Russell, when are we gonna
tell the world

277
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:45,902
what's going on down here ?

278
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,289
When I know it's not gonna
hurt my kids.

279
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,476
- Your kids are outta town.
- Their mother's not.

280
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,202
Wait, what ?

281
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:54,081
You're protecting Mariel ?

282
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:55,393
She's the mother
of my children, Dave.

283
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,920
She was the mother
of your children.

284
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,849
If I can find a way to stop this
without destroying her,

285
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,737
that's what I'm gonna do.

286
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,015
She might destroy herself.

287
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,955
Healy said that the cubans
and brazilians, these hybrids,

288
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:08,180
- they were killing themselves and their children.
- And would you just stop calling them hybrids ?!

289
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,516
Why ?
That's what they are, Russ.

290
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:14,901
Okay.

291
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,119
Damn it.

292
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,280
What about the other mother
of your children ?

293
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,368
- Have you talked to her lately ?
- No.

294
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,423
Well, do you think maybe
you oughta give her a call ?

295
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:25,291
Not yet.

296
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,312
- Why not ?
- Because I don't know what to say.

297
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:29,316
"Sorry, honey, but you know
this perfect, little town

298
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,864
"I asked you to spend
the rest of your life in,

299
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:32,320
"well, it's been
overrun by aliens

300
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,098
"and one of them happens
to be my ex-wife" ?

301
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,591
And the sheriff and e head
of the news station-

302
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:37,334
and the priest.

303
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:38,707
He's the guy I need to talk to.

304
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:43,915
Here, if Larkin radios, just don't say anything
about any of this, okay ?

305
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,292
Tell her to stay put
and I'll be in touch.

306
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:47,349
- Where are you going ?
- To see the priest.

307
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:48,496
Russell !

308
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:49,634
How did this happen ?

309
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:55,101
He wanted to take his wife home
and our group wouldn't let him.

310
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,164
So they did this ?

311
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,381
I think they liked it.

312
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,304
Mariel, uh, I believe
you called me down here.

313
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:13,363
What do you want, babe ?

314
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,361
Answers.

315
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,578
I want to know exactly what happened to me
the night of the hurricane.

316
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:27,254
If you care about
our marriage,

317
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:28,748
you'll tell me
everything you know.

318
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:30,400
Who have you been
talking to ?

319
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:35,631
That doesn't matter.
I want the truth.

320
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:43,865
I don't know everything.

321
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,527
But you know more
than what you've told me.

322
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:52,540
If I've ever withheld anything
from you, it's because...

323
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:57,967
I love you.

324
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:01,208
Well, why don't you try
giving me a little less love

325
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:04,168
and a lot more truth,
and we'll see where we land ?

326
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,156
Tell me what happened
the night of the hurricane.

327
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:15,663
I'll do better than that.
I'll show you.

328
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:33,330
Sorry about this mess.

329
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:39,864
- It's okay. Nice.
- It's a quality tile.

330
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:50,625
- So, wanna take a bath ?
- What, together ?

331
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,012
There's no chlorine.

332
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,619
I don't know. Maybe we should
watch tv first or something...

333
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:00,925
what ? The electricity's out at home
and I don't get to watch it that much.

334
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,773
oh ! sorry.

335
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,939
Larkin and her porn.

336
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:14,209
So how come you don't
want to take a bath ?

337
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:19,042
'Cause  I don't know.
I don't really know you.

338
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:21,363
Do you ever really
know anybody ?

339
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,231
Yeah.

340
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:25,734
Who do you think
you know ?

341
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,642
My family, mom, dad.

342
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:32,930
Bet you're wrong. Bet
you don't know 'em at all.

343
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:39,017
- Whoa. You're weird.
- So they tell me.

344
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:41,334
What, do you always walk over
to strange guys

345
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,289
and ask them if they want
to take baths ?

346
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:46,153
No, they usually ask me.

347
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:53,764
Where do you live, Emily ?
I was in gainesville,

348
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,340
But not anymore..

349
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:56,919
You go to school there ?

350
00:21:58,246 --> 00:22:00,254
Mm-hmm. U.F. I was a gator girl,

351
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,067
a phi gamma gator girl.

352
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:07,530
Cool. You graduate ?

353
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,232
Come on, Jesse,
if you're not getting in, I am.

354
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:48,512
Lewis ?

355
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,919
Um, I'm finished.

356
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:01,293
Okay. You all right ?

357
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:03,484
Yeah.

358
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,606
I just, uh...

359
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:09,242
I thinI should sit down.

360
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:15,884
thanks.

361
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:19,295
Yeah, you probably shouldn't
be walking around by yourself.

362
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:20,619
I guess not.

363
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:25,961
Crazy couple days...

364
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,112
But I guess
we've all been tested, huh ?

365
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,431
What ?

366
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:37,496
You lost your mom when you were
a litt girl, didn't you ?

367
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:40,371
Yeah.

368
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:44,611
Must have really tested
your faith when you lost her.

369
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,215
- Faith in what ?
- God ?

370
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,036
you believe in god,
don't you ?

371
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:54,590
Um, I guess.

372
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,835
I mean, I believe there is
something bigger than us.

373
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:04,994
Shoot, trees are bigger than us,
but god's who lives in your heart.

374
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:09,220
God gives you the courage
to face each day.

375
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:13,159
God... god is everything.

376
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,419
I'm sure your dad
taught you that.

377
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:21,560
Actually, I think he'd rather have
people believe he was everything.

378
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,733
Oh, no, don't say that.

379
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:28,853
Kira, wait a minute.

380
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,907
I know your father
is a man of faith.

381
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:37,559
He's counseled me
so many times.

382
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,480
About what ?

383
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,433
Um, my life,
choices I've made.

384
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,453
Yeah, well, he doe"t talk
to me much about anything,

385
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:47,092
so, uh, for all I know,
he could be the dalai lama.

386
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,377
The dalai lama's a buddhist.

387
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:53,754
Whatever.

388
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,707
Oh, no, no.

389
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:02,283
I could never follow someone
that didn't have a deep faith.

390
00:25:03,078 --> 00:25:05,258
It would go against
everything I...

391
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:15,436
Oh, lord.

392
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:17,305
What-what is it ?

393
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:24,721
I think I should go now.

394
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:26,490
Why ?

395
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:31,222
I just think I need
some time by myself.

396
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,746
I'm a little confused
right now.

397
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,866
- Do you want me to leave ?
- No, no.

398
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,986
It's not about you.

399
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:44,167
It's just, uh, um,

400
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:47,634
I don't know who I am right now.

401
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,209
Yeah.

402
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,788
Yeah, I don't know
who I am.

403
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:01,209
I've lost my way, Kira.

404
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,393
I've been following
a blind man.

405
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,434
Lewis...

406
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:08,493
I'm sorry.

407
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:13,678
I'm sorry that you have
to see me like this.

408
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:14,674
Sorry.

409
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:18,844
I've sinned, Kira.

410
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,196
I've committed
a terrible sin.

411
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:31,756
God gave me the most beautiful gift
and I threw it away.

412
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:46,477
May I...
confess my sins to you ?

413
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,255
- Father ?
- Russell.

414
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:20,238
We, uh, we had an incident
this morning.

415
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,218
I heard.

416
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:25,754
What can I do for you ?

417
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:27,730
I wanted to talk to you
about your church group-

418
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,930
these survivors.

419
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:33,196
Oh, it's not affiliated
with the church.

420
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,361
It's something separate.

421
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,990
- You meet at the church.
- Only because it's convenient.

422
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:42,342
Fact is our meetings
are getting so big, we may have to move.

423
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:46,763
Are you thinking about
joining us ?

424
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:48,863
I'm not sure
that I'm qualified.

425
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:55,470
Does what happened this morning
concern you ?

426
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:56,540
Of course.

427
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:57,998
Well, why do you think
it happened ?

428
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:02,740
I don't know.

429
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:13,675
Father, you know Mariel
and I have two children.

430
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:19,029
I need to know if they're safe
in her home, with Tom, with her.

431
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:21,542
Are they safe ?

432
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:26,429
You saw what happened out there
this morning.

433
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,405
Mariel saw it, too.

434
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,740
Why didn't anyone
do anything to stop it ?

435
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,294
She did.

436
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,268
Mariel protected the man. I...

437
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,524
and the others...

438
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:40,522
we all just watched...

439
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:43,908
but she...

440
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:50,620
she protected him.

441
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,468
I couldn't have walked
all this way by myself in the storm.

442
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:03,081
You weren't by yourself.

443
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,278
You re with me.

444
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:10,858
How did I end up with you ?

445
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,093
The last thing I remember was leaving Russell's house to go looking for Rose.

446
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:19,229
I called you in your car.

447
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:25,178
I told you to meet me up by the main road,
by the melaleuca trees.

448
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:27,675
Why ?

449
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:29,146
I wanted
to show you something.

450
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,784
The last thing I remember when my
plane went down were the lights...

451
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:41,829
orange lights in the water.

452
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:44,765
For a long time, I thought
maybe it was burning fuel,

453
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:46,424
but I was wrong because
the night of the hurricane,

454
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:51,142
I saw those same lights
right here in the sky...

455
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,633
and I wanted you
to see them, too.

456
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,220
- What are they ?
- I don't know.

457
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:06,647
Have they done something
to us ?

458
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:12,943
Kept us alive, as far as I
can tell, made us stronger.

459
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:23,086
We came right down here
in this raging storm,

460
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,537
and we saw those lights...

461
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,046
come right down into the water,

462
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,150
and one minute, you're by my side,

463
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:31,955
and the next minute, you're not.

464
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:38,007
And you just let this happen
to me ?

465
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:39,183
There was nothing
I could do.

466
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:41,068
I wanted to stop it,
but I couldn't.

467
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,379
I couldn't.

468
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:53,016
I don't believe you.

469
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,155
I don't believe...

470
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:02,069
you wanted to stop it
and you couldn't.

471
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:07,394
What I wanted
was to trust you.

472
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:09,807
I wanted to be...

473
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:15,297
your wife and a good
mother to Jesse and Rose,

474
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:16,593
and you have taken that
away from me.

475
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:19,186
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have !

476
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,298
You did this to me.

477
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:26,512
Mariel...

478
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:29,332
Whatever is happening to me,
I am gonna fight it.

479
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:32,234
I swear, you are not
gonna do this to me, Tom.

480
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,143
- I'm leaving.
- You can't leave.

481
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:39,097
- I'm leaving.
- You can't leave me now !

482
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:01,785
Damn.

483
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,548
Are you kidding me
right now ?

484
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,985
How do you do that ?

485
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,110
I don't know, but I think
I'm ready for the olympics.

486
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,230
God, you're so...

487
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,201
- weird.
- Weird.

488
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,326
Yeah.

489
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:23,088
But weird's cool.

490
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:24,998
I'm cool with weird.

491
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:27,358
Thanks for coming in
with me, Jesse.

492
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,725
Yeah, it's no problem.

493
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:33,927
Have you ever been
with a girl before ?

494
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:35,328
I mean, like this ?

495
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:37,831
Unh-unh.

496
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,552
Have you ever been
with a girl at all ?

497
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:43,224
Yeah, sure. I've walked
and I've talked with 'em,

498
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:48,258
but I've never been naked
in a bathtub with them.

499
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:50,811
- It's fun, right ?
- Yeah.

500
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,427
Huge fan, huge fan.

501
00:32:57,172 --> 00:33:00,096
A few weeks ago, none of the
people I used to hang out with

502
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:02,476
wanted to be my friends
anymore.

503
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:06,425
You know sororities, they can
be so cliquey anyways, you know ?

504
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:11,388
I mean, their whole thing
is based on "us" and "them",

505
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:16,143
so if you change, you're no
longer an "us," you're "them. "

506
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:18,694
Yeah.

507
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:22,341
I've never really felt
like an "us. "

508
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:24,141
I've...

509
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,170
pretty much always been
a "them. "

510
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:37,574
Nice to meet you.

511
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:41,965
- Jesse ?
- Oh, god.

512
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:43,723
<i>Jesse, you in there ?</i>

513
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,276
Hey, uh, can you go out
this way ?

514
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:46,005
Yeah.

515
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,417
- Are you gonna be okay ?
- Yeah.

516
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:54,643
- Are you sure ?
- Thank you.

517
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:57,768
- For what ?
- For being a "them. "

518
00:33:58,432 --> 00:33:59,264
Okay.

519
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,460
I'm comin' !

520
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:06,883
<i>What are you doing
in there ?</i>

521
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:11,922
hey, guys.

522
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:17,830
What were you doing ?

523
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:19,468
Takin' a bath.

524
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,447
I like baths.

525
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,930
And you wouldn't get in
the pool with me ?

526
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:30,784
Nope. I hate chlorine.

527
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:38,826
<i><b>Three sorority sisters drowned
at university of florida, fourth girl sought</b></i>

528
00:34:55,437 --> 00:34:56,591
Mariel ?

529
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:05,606
Lewis ?

530
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:12,368
Lewis ?!

531
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,346
Kira, where is everyone ?

532
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:21,794
Who's "everyone" ?

533
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:23,191
Your stepmother, Lewis ?

534
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:26,642
Um, I haven't seen Mariel,
but, uh, Lewis left.

535
00:35:26,643 --> 00:35:27,656
Left for where ?

536
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:28,989
He didn't say.

537
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:31,425
You were supposed to be
looking after him.

538
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:32,855
I did look after him.

539
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:35,449
I listened to his confession.

540
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:36,889
You what ?

541
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,804
Yeah. He told me the story
of abraham and isaac.

542
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,086
Have you ever heard it ?

543
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,974
As a test of faith, god asks abraham
to sacrifice his only child,

544
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:48,035
but in the end,
god spares the kid

545
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:50,017
because his father
had so much faith.

546
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:53,595
I think Lewis thought
you were like abraham, dad,

547
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,558
and then he found out
you were just a guy.

548
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,557
I mean, he lost it.

549
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:58,685
I don't know
what happened,

550
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,553
but he's lost his faith
in you.

551
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:01,674
Oh, god.

552
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:07,086
Ted, come in.

553
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:09,201
Ted, are you there ?

554
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:11,229
<i>Yeah, Tom,
what's up ?</i>

555
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,787
You know that thing we were
talking about ? I'm ready.

556
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,988
<i>Roger that.</i>

557
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:16,261
<i>She'll be waitin'.</i>

558
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:46,561
Mariel ?

559
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:52,993
Mariel.

560
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:58,096
Mariel.

561
00:36:58,339 --> 00:36:59,548
Rose needs this
for her cat.

562
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:00,678
Are you planning a trip ?

563
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:06,014
Are the kids back yet ?

564
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:07,507
No.

565
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:08,779
Are they going to be ?

566
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:10,275
Not today.

567
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:15,883
Don't touch me !

568
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,453
Hey, listen to me,
listen to me. Hey !

569
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:20,077
Don't !

570
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:21,936
- I know how hard this must be for you.
- No, you don't !

571
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:23,684
- Yes, I do, Mariel !
- No, you don't !

572
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:25,177
I want to help you !

573
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,860
You want to take
our children away from me.

574
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:46,208
You actually think
I would hurt them ?

575
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:51,413
Whatever has happened to me,
part of me is still here,

576
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,087
the part of me
that loves my kids,

577
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:59,954
the part of me that once
loved you is still here.

578
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:02,288
hey, where you been ?

579
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:05,317
I didn't, uh,
I didn't know what to do

580
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:07,918
with the skeleton in there,
so I wrapped it up

581
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,938
and put it in my crawlspace.

582
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:10,750
Is that okay ?

583
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,288
Well, you know,
maybe we should bury it.

584
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:13,340
Bury it ?

585
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,805
That's the only proof we have
that Underlay's A...

586
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:20,926
that Underlay's
not what he says he is.

587
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:24,494
Right now, I'm not even sure
what that means, Dave.

588
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:01,671
What are you doing here ?

589
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,807
We came home early.

590
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:08,930
I don't think that place is as
cool as you remember it, honey.

591
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:09,806
Where are the kids ?

592
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,519
I just dropped them off
at Mariel's.

593
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,136
Tom called,
said they have plans.

594
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:16,795
What ? No.

595
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,493
Russell ?

596
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:37,924
Kids ?

597
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:40,629
Are you here ?

598
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:50,598
Jesse ?

599
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:35,121
Mariel ?

600
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,344
- What's wrong ?
- He's taken them.

601
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:41,132
- Tom's taken the kids.
- Where ?

602
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,197
I don't know, but we have
to find them.

603
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:45,252
Mariel, hold on a second.
What did the note say ?
