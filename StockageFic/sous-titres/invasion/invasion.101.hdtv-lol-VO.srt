00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,933
Hurricane 2-1 to Hurricane control...

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,861
We are 5 miles from the eye wall.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,136
Copy that, Hurricane 2-1.

7
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:26,309
- 4 miles to the hurricane eye wall!
- All right!

8
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:28,186
Let's cut her open !

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,820
<i>Fox five-niner</i>

10
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:40,088
Hold on to your hats, folks !
We're going inside !

11
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:56,476
We're in the eye.
Drop the sonde and get us a reading.

12
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,463
Sonde away.

13
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:07,202
Sea level pressure's at 936 millibars.

14
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:11,362
- How fast is she moving now ?
- 030 degrees at 14 knots.

15
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,233
At this rate,
she'll make Miami by sundown

16
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:16,861
Hurricane 2-1 to Hurricane control.

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,428
What is going on down there ?

18
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:20,469
She's changed course.

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,027
No, no, no, I'm seeing something else...
something bigger under the water.

20
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:26,648
My screen's going nuts.
I got lights... thousands of lights.

21
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,541
- Military ?
- No !

22
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:16,326
- Hey, Mona,we're still not boarded up ?
- They should be here any minute !

23
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,537
- Who are they ?
- Their car broke down.

24
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:22,487
I told 'em I'd take 'em to the shelter,
but they don't wanna go.

25
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,119
Hey, Ma'am ?

26
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,040
There's a big hurricane coming.
You really don't want to be here right now.

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,126
We're supposed to meet his father
in Ocala. He's worried about him.

28
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:34,018
Hey, your Dad's gonna be fine.
I'm sure he'd want you to be safe, though.

29
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,380
Know what ? Maybe you can do me a favor.

30
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,500
My little buddy here
needs a ride to the shelter.

31
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:54,799
Hey, think you can get him there for me ?
Yeah ?

32
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:55,824
Okay.

33
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:58,634
There you go.

34
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,280
All right, you guys should go
with my partner.

35
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:04,235
Ocala's not gonna get much of this.
Your husband's gonna be fine.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,778
- Gracias.
- De nada.

37
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,195
All right, Mona, they're with you !
See you on the other side !

38
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:10,661
All right! hop in, you guys !

39
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,648
...after andrew and they dodged charlie,

40
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:15,397
So folks out here are pretty confident
that they can withstand anything.

41
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,837
That being said, they're not
taking any chances.

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,043
The owner of this gas station told me
that he's had lines around the block

43
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:22,246
Like this since yesterday.

44
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,169
But when I talked to the drivers
of these vehicles,

45
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,556
They tell me that they're heading
straight back home to wait it out.

46
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:29,693
Folks out here are pretty confident
they can withstand anything.

47
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:31,710
But by tomorrow,
they just might think again.

48
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,789
This is Larkin Groves reporting live
from Florida City.

49
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,982
And we're out.

50
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:37,681
Great. Thanks.

51
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,716
Get some more b-roll.
I'll be in the van... throwing up.

52
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,155
- Yeah ?
- Hey, honey.

53
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:45,268
Hey.

54
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,856
- Why aren't you home ?
- 'cause the I-Team never sleeps.

55
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,058
Well, pregnant women shouldn't
be covering hurricanes.

56
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,288
Well, one more stop at dixon's
for a little Q&A with the stockpilers,

57
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,821
And then all my nausea will be yours.

58
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:57,309
Where are you ?

59
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,996
Just locking down the station
before this thing makes landfall.

60
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,363
You talk to your brother ?

61
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,853
Yeah, he's with your kids at the house.
He and Jesse got most of the plywood up,

62
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:10,104
and rose put new batteries in everything,
and I guess Mariel's called a lot.

63
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,211
Why ?

64
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:13,115
She's their mother.
She's probably concerned.

65
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,271
I'm their father.
They'll be fine.

66
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,801
- Will you come home ?
- I will

67
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,254
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

68
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,487
Carlita !

69
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,890
Carlita !

70
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:41,797
Carlita !

71
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,021
<i>We are having
record pressure readings.</i>

72
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:51,085
<i>The eye has expanded then contracted</i>

73
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:53,722
<i>From 20 miles to 10 miles,
then back to 20 miles...</i>

74
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:56,320
Carlita ?

75
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,058
She won't be out here, Rose.
Rain's coming, and cats hate rain.

76
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:03,474
I saw her run out
the kitchen door.

77
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:07,523
Well... maybe you should
check in the shed again.

78
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:11,994
Carlita ?

79
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:19,877
- Hey ! Where'd you guys put the beer ?
- What ?

80
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:23,322
I saw you stackin' them cans
in the pantry earlier.

81
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,439
Where'd you put the beer ?

82
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,668
- I didn't see any beer.
- What ?

83
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:30,643
Dad didn't get any more beer, Dave.
Just what was in the fridge.

84
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,562
Have you seen Carlita ?

85
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:37,706
Who's Carlita ?

86
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:39,310
- My cat.
- No.

87
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,429
Look, I'm going to the market.
I'll be back in a sec, okay ?

88
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:42,905
Rose, could you get that for me ?

89
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,320
You can't leave us, Dave.
Dad's gonna be pissed.

90
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:48,751
Why don't you call Larkin or someone ?
Maybe she can get you some beer.

91
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,930
No, she won't !
She doesn't like it when I drink.

92
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,893
Gee, I wonder why.

93
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,136
Hey... Hey, don't talk to me like that.
I'm your uncle.

94
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,885
No, you're my stepmother's brother.

95
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:02,349
Right, whatever. Trust me, when
this thing hits, you're gonna want beer.

96
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,988
- I've been through hurricanes before.
- No, not like this one, you haven't.

97
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,689
I've been monitoring this bad boy.
You wanna know what my people are saying?

98
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,730
Not really.

99
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,678
They think the whole thing
is a smoke screen, Jesse.

100
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:14,596
Dave, I really gotta get this stuff...

101
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,860
A smoke screen cooked up
by the military.

102
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,644
Dave !
Mom wants to talk to you !

103
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:21,808
You'll see.

104
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,068
He's still not home.
How was I ever married to this person ?

105
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:31,295
Well, weren't you like, 11, at the time ?

106
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,060
- Will you take this to room 405, please ? 
- Right away.

107
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:36,278
college sweethearts...
the root of all evil.

108
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:38,958
Unbelievable.
There's a huge storm coming,

109
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,518
And the father of my children's
out picking acorns somewhere.

110
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,416
Make sure everyone's
out of maternity.

111
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,847
- Yeah, hey.
- Dave, sorry to bother you again

112
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,518
Oh, no, it's no bother.

113
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,977
Rose tells me
you're leaving to get beer.

114
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,180
Uh... no.

115
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,322
No, she's mistaken. I'm staying
right here with my happy apple.

116
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,054
Okay, that's good to hear.

117
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:59,962
I really don't think they should be
left alone right now.

118
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,155
- Frankly, I wish they were here with me.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:04,511
Could you have russell call me
when he gets there ?

120
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:05,880
Hey, yeah, Dr Dave is on it.

121
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,974
- Great. Thanks, Dave.
- You're welcome.

122
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,359
The guy's an idiot.

123
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:16,540
- I got so much to do. I just...
- Ms Mccall, for your own safety,

124
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,412
We're gonna have to move you
to a room without a window

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,751
- So when do you get the kids again ?
- Monday after school.

126
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:25,343
Well, I'm sure they'll be fine.
That Larkin girl
seems pretty responsible...

127
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,135
... at least on tv.

128
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,154
<i>You guys all clear here
on the south side?</i>

129
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:40,451
<i>All right, my guys, you stay with me.
Stay on the same channel.</i>

130
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:43,776
They say 6:00, but don't you believe it.
Who knows what's gonna happen?

131
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,567
Everybody clear on this ?

132
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:50,882
Hey, doc,
When you coming home ?

133
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:54,262
Ten minutes ?

134
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:58,314
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.
Take Krome Avenue.

135
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,854
The Turnpike's already
closed, all right ?

136
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:02,813
Hey, Ruthie...

137
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:04,681
That's a really nice haircut.

138
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:08,780
Well, he's all charm today.
What are you feedin' him ?

139
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:11,657
Me.

140
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,129
All right, guys, let's do it.
Do it up, man.

141
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,108
<i>He's picking you up!</i>

142
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:49,528
Come on, Kira.

143
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:54,290
Dad, I have asked you a thousand times
not to pick me up in this car.

144
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,662
I couldn't help it today, honey.

145
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,316
Eve's got me working overtime.

146
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,474
So... uh, how was school today ?

147
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,978
We had an assembly, and...

148
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,519
This dorky safety guy told us
if it gets really crazy tonight,

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,656
We're supposed to get in a bathtub
and sleep under a mattress.

150
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:11,053
Yeah, right. In case the roof caves in ?
I mean, that'll be comfortable.

151
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,948
The roof's not gonna cave in.

152
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,193
How do you know ?

153
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:18,000
I know.

154
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,330
- Hey, Dad !
- Hey, bud.

155
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:41,581
- I got everything almost finished.
- Great ! Here, help me with this stuff.

156
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,241
Where's everybody ?

157
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:46,469
Rose and Dave are in the house,
but Larkin's not even back yet.

158
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,715
- She call ?
- No !

159
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,728
Hey, hey ! I found a secret stash !

160
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,137
Hey... Russ.

161
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,780
- You talk to your sister ?
- No.

162
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,310
Russell, you're home.

163
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,087
Yeah, I live here.

164
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,307
What are you doing here, Mariel ?

165
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,490
I just wanted to make sure that the kids
were okay. I just talked to Dave...

166
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,151
Hey, honey.

167
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:37,396
Hey.

168
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:38,829
- Everything okay ?
- Yeah, everything's good.

169
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,685
Oh, your hair is wet.
Did you take your cough medicine?

170
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:41,409
Yeah.

171
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:42,996
- Where's Rose?
- She's in the house.

172
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:45,756
Can I say hi ?

173
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,868
You shouldn't be here now.

174
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:51,933
I just want to see my daughter.
Do you mind ?

175
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:56,026
I'll go get her.

176
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:04,358
What ?

177
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:06,299
Are you ever gonna trust me ?

178
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,590
What are you talking about ?

179
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,374
Mariel, you always do this.

180
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,900
Every time the kids are with me,
you're always checking up.

181
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,141
No, I'm not.

182
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:14,318
How many times did you call today ?

183
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,041
Russell, there is a hurricane coming.

184
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,651
I have a right to know
that my children are safe.

185
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,825
They're our children !

186
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,690
Our children, Mariel !

187
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:22,399
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of them...

188
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:23,723
You know what ? This isn't about you.

189
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,684
This is about the fact that
I want to see my kids.

190
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,828
- Hey !
- Stop taking everything so personally.

191
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,746
- I just want to see my kids.
Why can't you understand that ?

192
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:32,896
What don't you understand ?!
I only see them once a weekend...

193
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:33,676
Dad ! Dad !

194
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,099
Rose isn't here.

195
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:36,980
What do you mean ?

196
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:39,178
We checked every room,
but we can't find Rose.

197
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:42,569
- You lost our daughter ?
- No, I didn't lose her. I just got home.

198
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:48,070
Rose !

199
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,528
You know what ? She's probably
next door at the Lassards'.

200
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:52,307
Just go home, Mariel !

201
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,184
I'm not going anywhere.

202
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:53,795
Go home !

203
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,874
I'm waiting for her !

204
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,308
We'll have her call you
when she gets back !

205
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:57,144
I'm waiting !

206
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,001
She was just here five minutes ago !

207
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,490
Rose !

208
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,375
Rose !

209
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,580
- She just went looking for her cat !
- Jesse !

210
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,321
Rose !

211
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:20,224
- Mariel ! Go home !
- I'm not going anywhere, Russell !

212
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,980
- Why do you keep doing this, Mom ?
- Doing what ?

213
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,572
Pushing everyone away !

214
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:33,816
Why don't you just go home and worry about
your new husband and leave us alone ?

215
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:34,866
Jesse...

216
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,407
- Please !
- Jesse !

217
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:41,227
Go !

218
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:48,951
Rose !

219
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,664
Carlita !

220
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,760
Carlita !

221
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:10,068
You're not holding it straight !

222
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,243
I can't see what straight is !
Just hamme r!

223
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,115
That's good! That's good !

224
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:34,010
Larkin !

225
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,638
You okay ?

226
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,084
Yeah.

227
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,210
- Are you sure you're okay ?
- Yeah, yeah.

228
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,069
Oh, man, did that thing
come up quick or what?

229
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,868
Yeah.

230
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:05,712
The meteorologist said he thought it was
gonna come further north, but...

231
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,439
Where's Russell ?

232
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,709
He went to find Rose.

233
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,370
Rosie ? Out there !

234
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,847
Carlita ! 

235
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,714
Carlita was here the whole time ?

236
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:25,535
She probably snuck in when I got home.

237
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:28,313
I bet you were so scared.

238
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,489
We were all scared, Rose.

239
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:34,481
Rose, look at me.

240
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,855
You know never to leave the house without
telling somebody where you're going.

241
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:42,120
I didn't know where I was going.

242
00:15:58,802 --> 00:15:59,315
Daddy ?

243
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,093
Did you see the lights ?

244
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:03,974
No. What lights ?

245
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,977
In the sky.
I saw a bunch of colored lights.

246
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,012
It's probably another power line.
I'm sure they're down everywhere.

247
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:14,643
I love you.

248
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:17,094
Love you, too, Daddy.

249
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:21,021
Rose !

250
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:39,768
Hey, Rose.

251
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:46,467
<i>Here you go.
You got that one ?</i>

252
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,338
- Are all the phones out ?
- Yep. Not one tower held.

253
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:52,261
Got no electricity or water, neither.
Everything's gone.

254
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,203
Governor's already declared
most of dade county a disaster area.

255
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:38,718
- Russell !God.
- Hey.

256
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,422
What happened ?
Where were you ?

257
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:48,089
It's okay, honey.
We're all okay.

258
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,124
Right ?

259
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,038
Yeah.

260
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,000
Dad !

261
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:55,378
Hey !

262
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,226
Oh, gosh, good to see you.

263
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:00,757
- You all right ?
- Yeah, I'm good.

264
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:01,434
Good

265
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:02,806
Hey, where'd you find that cat ?

266
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,491
She was in Dad's truck the whole time.

267
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,581
- Oh, man. I'm glad you found her, Rose.
- Hey, you're alive.

268
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:12,032
- Hey, us, too.
- Good

269
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,510
Well, what happened ?
We lost a little roof there ?

270
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:16,916
Yeah, windows blew out, too.
The place is completely soaked.

271
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,927
Hi, Rosie.
I am so glad to see you.

272
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,870
- Could I feed carlita ?
- Yeah

273
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,737
I think I know where
there's a can of cat food.

274
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:25,628
Think I know where
there's a can of everything.

275
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,216
Hey, be careful in there.

276
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:29,345
Wow

277
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:33,220
- We're all okay. That's all that matters, huh ?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:35,658
Where were you ? I called and called.

279
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:37,100
Hey, what's he doing here ?

280
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:44,062
Jesse, can you give us a second ?

281
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:45,253
Why ? What's wrong ?

282
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,945
- Mariel didn't make it home last night.
- What ?

283
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,118
Tom called on your radio this morning.

284
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,053
He said that the last time
he spoke to her, she had just left here,

285
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:56,088
And he said she was very upset.

286
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,200
All right, look, I'm sure she's just
stuck somewhere. You know, like we were.

287
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,093
Yeah.

288
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,145
It's okay.

289
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:20,685
- I'd say good morning, but...
- Good morning,Tom.

290
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,568
Did you have words with
your mother last night, son ?

291
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:29,789
This isn't his fault.

292
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,470
I didn't say it was.

293
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:34,320
Did you tell your Mom
to leave last night, Jesse ?

294
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:35,767
I told her to leave.

295
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,262
That might not have been
the wisest idea, huh ?

296
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:44,133
<i>Sheriff Underlay ?
Come in, Underlay.</i>

297
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,405
<i>Underlay, come in, please.</i>

298
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,378
Yeah, come back.

299
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:56,809
Come in.

300
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:03,693
Hey. Jesse, it's not your fault.

301
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,215
- He's just upset.
- Yeah.

302
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:10,193
It's just my mom, you know ?

303
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:14,427
She's always so worried that something
bad's gonna happen that she ends up...

304
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:15,809
Making it happen.

305
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:19,801
Sucks.

306
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,163
Did you check the plate ?
Check the plate.

307
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:27,505
<i>- It's a match.
- 10-4.</i>

308
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:30,843
They found the car.

309
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,745
Don't worry, Rosie.
We're gonna get this all cleaned up.

310
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,454
Did they find mommy yet ?

311
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,216
Not yet, but I'm sure they will.

312
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:23,184
Yeah,
I'm sure they will, too.

313
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:26,453
Yeah. So Kira's gonna come with me.

314
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:28,576
Okay ? And we're gonna be back around 3.

315
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:29,899
- You got that, Dave ?
- Yeah.

316
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,365
Listen, I'm telling you,

317
00:22:31,402 --> 00:22:33,694
You want a good story, you go down
to the abandoned Air force base.

318
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,592
There's all kinds of secret projects
going on there.

319
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:36,827
I really gotta go, Dave.

320
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:38,179
Right.

321
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:41,334
Bye, Rosie.

322
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:42,592
Bye.

323
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:44,207
Bye, Rose.

324
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:45,766
- Bye.
- See ya.

325
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:49,926
Don't you worry, kiddo. I'm gonna have
this roof fixed for you in no time.

326
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,001
You ever fix roofs before ?

327
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:54,137
Yeah, sure, after Andrew,
I did it for a living.

328
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,742
What do you do now ?

329
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:58,203
I'm kind of between jobs right now.

330
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,437
What was your last job ?

331
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:04,874
Well, I managed an apartment building
with my girlfriend, but...

332
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,879
She kicked me out, so...

333
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:07,902
You're here.

334
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:09,987
Yeah.

335
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,958
Did you see the lights ?

336
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,207
What lights ?

337
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:24,198
I saw a bunch of lights
In the sky last night.

338
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,390
Dad thought they were sparks,

339
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:28,306
But they were much bigger.

340
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:30,282
Really ?

341
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:32,066
Where'd you see them ?

342
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,832
Landing in the water.

343
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,470
Landing ?

344
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,677
What, uh...

345
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,550
What kind of shape were they ?

346
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:47,869
Mom !

347
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:50,719
Mariel !

348
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:54,639
I don't understand why
she would leave the car.

349
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:56,095
She probably felt safer in here.

350
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,015
These melaleuca trees are pretty tough.

351
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:00,704
Why some people, you people,

352
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:03,047
Want to spend millions trying to get rid of them,
I don't understand.

353
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,277
They're killing the park.

354
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:05,798
They take 15 acres a day.

355
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,169
Survival of the fittest.

356
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:14,056
Dad !

357
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:16,836
Dad !

358
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,967
Dad !

359
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:24,451
Mariel !

360
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:26,239
Mare ?

361
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,061
Come on, baby.

362
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,131
Come on.

363
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,272
Come on, baby.

364
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,577
Come on.

365
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:39,793
Okay.

366
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,690
Okay.

367
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,141
Okay, it's okay.

368
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,136
It's okay.

369
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:49,967
Mom ?

370
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,484
It's Jesse, honey.

371
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:54,667
It's Jesse.

372
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:58,249
Jesse.

373
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,616
Hey, mom.

374
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:03,933
Call the hospital,
tell them we're coming.

375
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:05,683
Tell them we're coming.

376
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,681
Tell them we're coming.

377
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:20,765
Look she's gonna be alright.

378
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:22,214
I hope so.

379
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:26,437
I wonder what happened to her clothes.

380
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,284
It's hard to describe
the emotion here, Peter.

381
00:25:36,338 --> 00:25:38,710
I've talked to so many people
who've lost everything.

382
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:41,607
Yet the overwhelming feeling
seems to be hopeful.

383
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:43,257
Families who's home were less damaged

384
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,094
Were opening their doors to their neighbors,

385
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:48,363
Helping them with their childrens,
just helping them any way they can.

386
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:51,516
It's a nice reminder that even
in the most difficult times,

387
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,905
The human spirit remains strong.

388
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,891
This is Larkin Groves reporting live from Florida city.

389
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,391
We're clear and we're out.

390
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,790
- Great.
- Good job.

391
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:04,691
If your family isn't out here
by tomorrow, call me.

392
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:06,687
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

393
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,513
I'd like to be on TV someday.

394
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:12,897
Oh yeah ? Why  ?

395
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:14,882
I don't know maybe 'cause
you can help people.

396
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,249
You know, like, when my mom died,
I really couldn't believe it, you know.

397
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,596
Until I saw the story on the news.

398
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,203
Even though all these reporters
were going on about how terrible it was,

399
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:23,757
You know, two seconds later, they were
laughing and talking about the weather.

400
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,499
So in a way, it made me feel better.

401
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,363
I'm not sure
That's such a good thing.

402
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:29,640
Me either.

403
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:31,676
No, but my dad says
television's important

404
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,790
Because it distracts people
from the truth.

405
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:35,189
Like with this hurricane,

406
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:38,598
I mean, you know, it's terrible,
but on the news it'll just be a story.

407
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,067
And at first the reporters
will be serious about it,

408
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,921
But after awhile they'll be
laughing and making jokes,

409
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,283
And then everyone will be distracted
from what's really going on.

410
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:49,452
What is really going on ?

411
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,950
The truth.

412
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:57,813
Where are my kids ?

413
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:59,794
You know where they are.
They're at Russell's.

414
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:00,902
I want to see them.

415
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,038
We're gonna have 'em back on monday.

416
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,109
I want to see them now.

417
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:04,921
Mare ?

418
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:07,024
Hi, baby.

419
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:09,062
Thanks, Ruth.
We'll take it from here.

420
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:14,038
Thank you, Ruth.

421
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,123
How you feeling, sweetie ?

422
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:23,846
I was telling the mayor that we felt
that a quarantine might be in order,

423
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,348
At least for the first few weeks.

424
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,010
Do you really think
it's necessary, Mariel ?

425
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:28,344
We're so cut off as it is.

426
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,869
We have no idea what's been
let loose here, mayor.

427
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,076
The I. C.U. is badly damaged.
We're got hundreds of people missing.

428
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,855
The water may be contaminated.
Better safe than sorry.

429
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,104
I'll have to clear it with the council.

430
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:40,677
Of course. You do.
Whatever you have to do.

431
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,358
All right, all right.

432
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,405
Let's go home.

433
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,137
We're done here.

434
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,536
What's happening to me ?

435
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:15,668
You sure you saw the lights out here ?

436
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,860
Yeah.

437
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:19,198
We're a long way from home.

438
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:20,757
So ?

439
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,494
Must have been
a hell of a lot of lights.

440
00:28:25,522 --> 00:28:26,884
There were.

441
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:49,057
What's that ?

442
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:50,945
What ?

443
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,104
Right there, that shiny thing.

444
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:54,602
Oh, hey, hey, sit down.

445
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,076
Want to get bit ?

446
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,550
Bit by what ?

447
00:28:57,813 --> 00:28:59,494
A gator, goofball.

448
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,315
A gator won't bite you ?

449
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,977
No, they're afraid of me.

450
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:08,283
What is it ?

451
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,442
I don't know.

452
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,367
Could be a piece of a boat.

453
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,029
Which part ?

454
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:18,423
I can't tell ya, but...

455
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,616
Whatever it is,
it's stuck down there good.

456
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:25,799
Why won't a gator bite you ?

457
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:29,893
Dave ?

458
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:34,109
Dave ?

459
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,447
Uh, yeah. Let's get outta here, huh ?

460
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:06,442
Thanks for letting me
go back to my house, dad.

461
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:08,264
This is your house.

462
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,226
I mean my real house.

463
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:13,146
- Hey, Bud. How you doing ?
- Hey, Tom.

464
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:16,372
- Hey.
- What's going on ?

465
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,644
Here she comes.
Hello, honey.

466
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,719
Slide that kitty right
in the backseat here.

467
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:23,954
Let your brother help you
out there. All right.

468
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,433
It's very good of you to let
them come with us, Russell.

469
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:29,259
Her mom really appreciates it. Thanks.

470
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,189
- How's she doing ?
- She's good, fine.

471
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,527
By tomorrow, I think
she'll be better than ever.

472
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,076
Good.

473
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,386
Here you go, honey.

474
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,691
All right,

475
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:39,977
I love you, Rosabelle.

476
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:41,170
I love you, too, Daddy.

477
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:42,203
Okay.

478
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:44,297
Here, put your seat belt on.

479
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:48,400
Jess, tell your mom
I hope she feels better.

480
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,264
Yeah.

481
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,841
Okay, have fun.

482
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,024
Thanks, dad.

483
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,954
We'll talk soon.

484
00:30:57,057 --> 00:30:59,649
Hey, Tom, there's still a little
something I'm confused about.

485
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:00,916
What's that ?

486
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,685
Well, just, you said last time
you spoke with mariel,

487
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,874
She was just leaving here ?

488
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:06,700
That's right.

489
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:09,677
We lost cell service pretty early
yesterday. How'd she get through to you ?

490
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:14,559
Must have stopped and used a pay phone.

491
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:17,677
Thanks.

492
00:32:10,306 --> 00:32:12,531
Father Scanlon,
just a few questions, please.

493
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:14,418
How many hours were you
in the water, sir ?

494
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:15,775
Excuse me, can we just get a word, sir?

495
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,249
The E. M.T. said that you were there
for 16 hours.

496
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,522
- Is that true, sir ?
- Did you ever lose your faith ?

497
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,836
I have to go.

498
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,517
Father jeffrey scanlon,

499
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:28,437
Obviously distraught after
a terrible night in the everglades.

500
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:32,414
Lifted from the water by paramedics
seemingly in amazing health, actually.

501
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,395
Let's go back to you in the studio.

502
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,860
Poor guy.

503
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,160
That's the second time
I've seen that look today.

504
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:45,230
Mariel ?

505
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,414
Yeah.

506
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:49,709
Completely disoriented,

507
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,127
No clothes.

508
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:56,235
How do you spend all night in a hurricane
and not have a mark on you ?

509
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:00,399
You did.

510
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,559
Hi.

511
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,127
Russ, can I see you for a second ?

512
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,099
Yeah, you sure can.

513
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:12,714
You took Rose out on an airboat today ?

514
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:14,169
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

515
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,306
I knew there was something weird
about this hurricane, Russ,

516
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:18,944
And I thought it was cover
for the military, but I was wrong.

517
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,207
Whoa ! Jeez !

518
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:31,014
What is that ?

519
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:32,122
You tell me.

520
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,066
It's a skeleton.

521
00:33:34,132 --> 00:33:35,118
Yeah,

522
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,761
And the other stuff ?

523
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:39,747
Where'd you find this ?

524
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,722
In the water about 2 miles
south of everglades city.

525
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,393
- What, did rose see it ?
- No, no, no, no, no,

526
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:44,576
I dropped her off,
and I went back to get it.

527
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:45,862
Well, take it to the police, Dave.

528
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,293
No way, Russ.
They'll just cover it up.

529
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,680
You think they want people to know that
we have an extraterrestrial in our midst ?

530
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:52,190
What ?

531
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:56,959
- Are you drunk ?
- No, I'm not drunk, Russell.

532
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:58,275
Look at this thing.

533
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:00,282
It's got spikes poking through
its head and its neck.

534
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,088
Like it just had the life
sucked right out of it.

535
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,579
Dave, this is a person.

536
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:05,793
I know.

537
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,946
He may have had a family.

538
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,314
I mean, we need to find out who he is
and what really happened to him.

539
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:10,931
I know, and we will, we will,
but on our own.

540
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:13,938
I want to go back there tonight,

541
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,163
And I want you to come with me.

542
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:19,362
- No, Dave.
- Come on, Russ.

543
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,292
Come on, come on, come on.

544
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,517
You've been studying weird plants
and animals your whole life.

545
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,808
I show you the work of one E.B.E.

546
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:24,832
A what ?

547
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,297
An extraterrestrial biological entity.

548
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,358
Dave, will you stop ?

549
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,644
There are no aliens.

550
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:39,339
Then will you tell me
what's going on here ?

551
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,051
I don't know.

552
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:28,140
Maybe a sea creature.

553
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:29,977
We weren't in the ocean.

554
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:35,737
All right, Dave. I'll admit
this is interesting,

555
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:37,427
But I'm not gonna go out there
with you tonight.

556
00:35:37,456 --> 00:35:38,902
Come on, Russ, come on !

557
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,409
Look, I know that
you don't care about aliens,

558
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:43,315
But I know that you care
about your wife and kids.

559
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:47,625
So do I.

560
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,144
And...

561
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:52,530
I don't want them
to end up like this guy.

562
00:35:56,423 --> 00:36:00,709
Russ, I have to do something tonight,
and I'm asking you please to come with me.

563
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:13,023
Were you really worried about me ?

564
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,567
Yeah, I was.

565
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,065
Dad said you were.

566
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:22,239
I was worried about you, too.

567
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,595
Know what, sweetie ?

568
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:30,046
I think you gotta go to sleep now.

569
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,285
Will you take me to school tomorrow ?

570
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:38,849
There's not gonna be any school
for awhile, honey.

571
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:42,832
Will a hurricane come again tonight ?

572
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:44,795
No.

573
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:49,442
Mommy ?

574
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,034
You smell different.

575
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,201
What am I looking for ?

576
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,440
Lights.

577
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,445
In the sky ?

578
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:22,642
No, in the water.

579
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,745
Rosie said that when they landed,
they didn't go out.

580
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:25,679
They didn't go out ?

581
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,036
No. That's what made me so suspicious.

582
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:39,351
You ever been out this way before ?

583
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,600
Yeah, after the '96 plane crash.

584
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:44,665
A lot of park people were called
in for search and rescue.

585
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:46,215
Oh, my god.

586
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:48,604
That might be what I found today.

587
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:50,097
No, Dave, you found an alien.

588
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:51,370
No, no, no, not that.

589
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:53,811
I found a piece of metal
in the water today.

590
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:55,492
I bet it's from that plane.

591
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,154
Well, maybe the martians shot it down.

592
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:01,698
What's that ? Hey, hey !

593
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,435
Hey, right there. Look.

594
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:05,952
Look. Did you see that ?

595
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:09,736
There it is again. Right there.
Straight ahead, Straight ahead.

596
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,435
Slow down.

597
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:20,092
What do you say now ?

598
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:23,641
A fish.

599
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:24,899
A jellyfish, maybe.

600
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:26,294
Yeah, come on.

601
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:34,867
All right, if that's a fish,
where's the light coming from?

602
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:37,092
Bioluminescence.

603
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:38,538
Bio what ?

604
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,391
It's a life light.

605
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:41,636
A lot of fish have it to identify
other members of the species,

606
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,461
So they can mate or...

607
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:47,813
Scare away predators...

608
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:49,241
Or attract prey.

609
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:50,791
Dave, I wouldn't do that.

610
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,509
I don't think...

611
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,335
Dave ! Dave !

612
00:38:58,162 --> 00:38:59,644
Oh, my god !

613
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:23,628
That was no fish !

614
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:26,091
That was no fish !

615
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:33,062
Are you all right ?
Are you all right ?

616
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:34,482
- I think my leg's broken.
- What ?

617
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,759
My leg's...

618
00:39:36,593 --> 00:39:37,472
Be careful.

619
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:42,486
Emergency supply centers are being
set up all over the county,

620
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,859
And volunteers are desperately needed,
so if you think you can help out,

621
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,420
Please, call the number
you'll be seeing on our screen

622
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,640
Or come down here
to the homestead hospital

623
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,544
And speak to one of these aid workers.

624
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:55,184
Now we understand you have
a family member in there, Larkin ?

625
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:56,923
Yes, that's right.

626
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,503
My brother Dave got into a bit of a wrestling
match with an alligator last night.

627
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,485
Did you tell 'em a gator did this ?

628
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:05,960
For now, it's the most
plausible explanation.

629
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:07,916
Russ,

630
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,103
It was an E.B.E.

631
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,014
Extraterrestrial biological entity ?

632
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,512
That's a dumb name for an alien.

633
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,191
Good morning, Gentlemen.

634
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,219
Good morning.

635
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:25,429
Heard you had
a little accident last night.

636
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:26,984
Mind if I take a peek ?

637
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,231
Be my guest.

638
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,935
Gently, please.

639
00:40:31,146 --> 00:40:32,010
How you feeling, Mare ?

640
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,471
Oh, much better.

641
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:34,642
Thanks.

642
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:35,773
Kids okay ?

643
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:37,531
Oh, yeah, they're great.

644
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:41,069
Rose decided it would be a good idea
to give her cat a bath this morning,

645
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,890
Which didn't go over too well,

646
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,535
And Kira made Jesse breakfast,

647
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:45,700
Which I thought was really sweet.

648
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,846
I understand you ordered
full quarantine for the area.

649
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:51,465
Yeah, I think it's best.

650
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:52,671
With everything that's been stirred up,

651
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:54,143
We just don't know
what's out there right now.

652
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:55,780
Oh, you got that right.

653
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:57,779
Well...

654
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,171
You're a very lucky man.

655
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,106
How do you figure ?

656
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,740
Judging from the size
of these teeth marks,

657
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:04,333
That gator could have
swallowed you whole.

658
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,101
What makes you so sure it was a gator ?

659
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:11,801
What else could it be ?

660
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:00,057
You're feeling better now, aren't you ?

661
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,164
Yeah.

662
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,155
The first days are the toughest,

663
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,653
But you're gonna be okay.

664
00:43:06,695 --> 00:43:07,944
Baby steps, honey.

665
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,775
Baby steps.
