1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,300
Previously on "invasion"...

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,900
there's this storm brewing inside me

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,100
that is more powerful than any hurricane.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,300
What really happened to you that
night in the water? Do you know?

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,000
Mariel's not like you and me, father.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,200
She's afraid of losing her children.

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,800
And you're afraid of losing he

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:13,800
you did see a body,

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,500
Aah!

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
but it wasn't you.

11
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,900
I was counting on your loyalty, lewis.

12
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,400
But i'm loyal to god, sir.

13
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
 Lewis?

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Lewis!

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,000
do you know what happened to you last night?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
My arm came back, sir.
It's a miracle.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,700
what happed to him is wrong.

18
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,100
They'll want to dissect all of
us and i cannot let that happen.

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,500
There are people out there
who may be killing themselves

20
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
and their children.

21
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,600
i've been
reconstructing this skull.

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
It's almost 10 years old.

23
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,100
This isn't god's plan, sir.
He gave me a gift.

24
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,900
That's right, lewis, so why do
you want to go against him?

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,400
The morning
after the hurricane,

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,000
when they pulled me
from the water...

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,500
i felt like i had
a secret to tell,

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,100
but i didn't know
who to tell it to.

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
People don't like it
when you change.

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
They say they do,
but they really don't,

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,300
because it forces them
to change, too,

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
and that's why i'm so grateful
i found you,

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
because i know
that you understand

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,300
and i know
that you accept me...

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
and to those who don't,

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,200
well,

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
adios.

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,300
Yeah, well, you stop by
anytime, mariel.

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm giving out free haircuts

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,000
to members of the group.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, that's really sweet
of you, roger.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, we gotta take care
of our own, right?

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,800
alma!

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Alma!

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,600
Alma.

46
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,900
Excuse me.

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,600
Damn it, alma, i've been
lookin' all over for you.

48
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
We got two sick kids at home
and you're hanging out

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,300
with these losers again!

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
They're not losers!

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm tellin' you,
we don't need these people.

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,000
You need to calm down, son.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,400
What...

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,000
get in the car.

55
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,800
Get in the car.

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,400
get that guy!

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,500
He's taking alma away.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,200
Hey, leave her alone.

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,300
get him!

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Stop it!

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,400
Let me through.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,300
Somebody call 9-1-1.

64
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,100
He needs an ambulance.

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,200
Call 9-1-1.

66
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,900
Somebody call 9-1-1.

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,000
And the good news is
if you need a doctor,

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,100
she's right across the hall.

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,900
Hey, come on, come on.

70
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,700
Don't be shy.

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,300
I really would be
more comfortable

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,500
in my apartment, sir.

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,700
Nonsense, nonsense.

74
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,400
After what you've been through,
the least we can do

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
is help nurse you back to health, okay?

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,000
All right?

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Kira?!

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Dad?

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Hey, sweetheart.

80
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
Deputy sirk here had
a really bad accident yesterday.

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,200
He was shot in the arm,

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
and as you know, he never had
much of an arm to begin with,

83
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,300
so he needs our help.

84
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,500
Would you mind looking after him
for the next couple of days?

85
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
You want me to look after him?

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,500
Sir, that really isn't necessary.

87
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
No, no, no. We'll put him in rose's room

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,900
while she's out of town.

89
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Um, dad...

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,500
uh, do me a favor.

91
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
We left his overnight bag in the car.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Can you get that for us?
Thanks, honey.

93
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,600
Right... yeah.

94
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,300
Oh, my g...

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,300
hey. What are you
doing here?

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,700
What's wrong?

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Are the kids okay?

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,500
Yeah, they're still
with larkin up north.

99
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,500
I need you to come with me.

100
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,600
Where?

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,500
To my house. There's something
i have to show you.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,100
I'm working.

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,200
It's important.

104
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
What's this about?

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,700
You.

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
Sir, this doesn't feel right.

107
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,200
You have to stop arguing
with me, lewis.

108
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I know what's best for you.

109
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
Why'd you tell your daughter
i'd been shot?

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because the truth is just
a little too complicated.

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,400
I really don't feel
comfortable lying, sir.

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,800
You didn't lie. I did.
Now just get undressed, please.

113
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,600
How long do i have to stay here?

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,900
Until you're recovered.

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
The doctor said
that could be weeks.

116
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,600
The doctor's wrong.

117
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,000
How do you know?

118
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,900
I know.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,100
This really hurts.

120
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,200
Yeah, i'll bet.

121
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
We gotta get you some stronger meds.

122
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
I don't mean physically,sir.

123
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
When i lost my arm in the war,

124
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,800
i figured it was god's will,

125
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
and the other night
when i was in the water,

126
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,200
i thought god had given me
my arm back to help me swim.

127
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not so sure
that was the reason.

128
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,200
Well, either way,

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,900
i'm having
a difficult time with this

130
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,100
because l-i

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,300
feel like
i've gone against him.

132
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,200
No, no, no, no.

133
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,400
God must have helped you

134
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
make the decision to cut off your arm

135
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,800
because he knew how difficult

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
things would be for you otherwise.

137
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,300
I don't understand, sir.

138
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Change scares people, lewis.

139
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
You couldn't just show up into town,

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
flailing around a new arm

141
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
like you were captain
of the swim team.

142
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,400
I mean, folks would be wildly unnerved.

143
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
They would start poking
and prodding at you,

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,900
trying to look for
a rational explanation

145
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,900
for the... the thing,
and there just isn't one.

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,600
That's why we need
to keep this between us.

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
I guess you're right, sir.

148
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,200
Of course i am.

149
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,700
Besides,i think one arm suits you.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,900
Gives you an edge.

151
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,800
Where do you want it?

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,500
Right by the door, honey.

153
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,400
That's great.

154
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Come in, jess.

155
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
It's too cold.

156
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,600
Can you throw me some quarters?

157
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Uh, i don't really have
any quarters.

158
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,500
Larkin, do you have
any quarters?

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Uh, yeah... yeah, i think
there's a few in there. Here.

160
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,200
You hungry?

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,100
Uh, no. Still recovering
from the chocolate corn dog.

162
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,300
Hmm. Yeah, not so good, huh?

163
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,000
Any food on a stick
is not to be trusted.

164
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Okay, rose...

165
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
throw them in the deep end!

166
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,800
You got it.

167
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,800
Sorry.

168
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,200
Watch me.

169
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,500
It's too deep.

170
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Can you get them for me?

171
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Jess?

172
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Jess?

173
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Hold on a second, rose.

174
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
hey, jess?

175
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,100
What?

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think i'm gonna go try
to track down a salad.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Can you watch rose for me?

178
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah.

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,100
I'll see you back at the room, okay?

180
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,600
All right.

181
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,800
She's good.

182
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah.

183
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,300
Hey. Did you tell her yet?

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,300
No.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,100
You sure you want to?

186
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,300
Hey, mariel.

187
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,500
Hey.

188
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,100
So?

189
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Look, i want you to know

190
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,900
the only reason
that i'm doing this

191
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,200
is because if i tried to
explain it,

192
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,300
l-i couldn't.

193
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
St show me.

194
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,700
What is that?

195
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
A skeleton...

196
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,700
your husband's skeleton.

197
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,700
The head's under my bed.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
We didn't think that
you'd want to see that.

199
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Is this a joke?

200
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
No. This is tom,

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
or at lst,what used to be tom...

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,700
and this... 

203
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,100
this larger carcass
that's wrapped around it,

204
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,500
i think this is the remains
of an invasive species

205
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,900
that's moved into the glades.

206
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Russell and i found it
at the plane crash site of '96,

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,300
the one that tom survived.

208
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,200
We think that he may have lived
through the initial impact,

209
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
only to be attacked
by this thing,

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
but tom is not
who you think he is, mariel.

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,500
Hell, he may not be
who he thinks he is.

212
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,100
Then who is he?

213
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,600
We think that these creatures
take people's d.n.a.,

214
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,900
add their own poison
to the mix

215
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,000
to basically
create a new being,

216
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,100
like a hybrid, you know?

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,300
Half us, half them.

218
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
It's okay if you're confused
right now

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,100
'cause a lot of people
are confused right now,

220
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,900
like all the survivors
at your church group.

221
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,400
We heard about this morning.

222
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,600
They beat that guy
really badly, didn't they?

223
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,700
Like a pack.

224
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Mariel...

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,100
look, if you can just look at
the science of this thing...

226
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,900
"the science"?

227
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,700
What are you trying
to do here?

228
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Protect our kids.

229
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,400
I can't have them
living in a house...

230
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,900
oh, my god,
you son of a bitch.

231
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,200
I can't let them
stay with you. It's not safe.

232
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm their mother!

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,100
Are you sure?!

234
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,100
He told me that you saw
your body in biscayne cove.

235
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
That was a girl
from florida city.

236
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,000
The girl they pulled out
may have been,

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500
but who was in charge
of that operation? Tom.

238
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,000
Look, the night
of the hurricane,

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,900
i think tom saw you you
after you left here,

240
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,000
and i think he knows
exactly what happened to you

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
because the same thing
happened to him

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
almost ten years ago,
mariel.

243
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,700
If i don't have my children
back to me by 6:00 tonight,

244
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,000
i will have a hundred
lawyers in this driveway.

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,700
Ask him.
Just see what he says.

246
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't believe
you're doing this.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,300
I can't believe you'd want
to hurt our family this badly.

248
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm just telling you
the truth.

249
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
No, you're telling me your truth!

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,500
excuse me,
mr. Deputy?

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,100
Lewis.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,800
Oh, uh, where would
you like this?

253
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,900
Um, you can just
put it right here.

254
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Um, kira?

255
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm sorry about all this.

256
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,100
It's okay.

257
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,500
I'd really rather be back
at my place.

258
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
How did you get shot?

259
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Hey, i thought you were
gonna rest.

260
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Hope you like the soup.

261
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm gonna go out
for a little bit.

262
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
You gonna be all right here?

263
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm very confused, sir.

264
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,500
The arm wasn't the only thing
different about me, was it?

265
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
I'm different all over now,
aren't i?

266
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,100
Yeah, 

267
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,000
but in time,
you'll come to realize

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
that it's all for the good.

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,400
Hey...

270
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,400
it's all good.

271
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
Baby steps, lewis,

272
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,700
baby steps.

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,400
I've never seen anyone
stay underwater that long.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
I've never seen anyone like her,
period.

275
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,200
You think she's a mermaid?

276
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,000
I think she's smokin'.

277
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Hey, rose, you, uh, you want to
go into town with me?

278
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,300
Are you going to buy
more baby stuff?

279
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,300
No, i was thinking about
buying more rose stuff.

280
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,900
Bye, jess.
See you later, jess.

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Hey.

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,100
Hey.
Hey.

284
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,200
What's up?

285
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
Nothin'. You're, just...

286
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
you're a really good swimmer.

287
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,700
Thanks.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
You staying here?

289
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,400
No. I just like the pool.

290
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Have you been in yet?

291
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,000
No. I'm more of
an ocean guy.

292
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Chlorine kinda bugs me.

293
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,700
We're kind of far from
the ocean here, aren't we?

294
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,800
Yeah. I live down south,
like the homestead area.

295
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,300
My aunt lives there.
Yeah?

296
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Yeah. My family and i got stuck
down there during the hurricane.

297
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,000
It was crazy.

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,800
Yeah.

299
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,500
Look like you got
through it okay.

300
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
What's your name?

301
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Jesse.

302
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm emily.

303
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
Hi. Good to meet you.

304
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,100
So was that your girlfriend?

305
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
My girlfriend?

306
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,100
The brunette?

307
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,000
The brunette.

308
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
What, the little one?

309
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
No, the big one.

310
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,700
No, that's...
that's my dad's wife.

311
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,900
Oh. I thought
she was your girlfriend.

312
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,700
She doesn't look
much older than you.

313
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,500
Well, she's not.

314
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,900
Well, where did she go?

315
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,600
She went shopping
with my little sister.

316
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,800
Do you have a room here?

317
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Yeah. We're staying here.

318
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Does it have
a bathtub?

319
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,500
Yeah, i'm pretty sure
it does. Why?

320
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,400
I just can't believe
she reacted that way.

321
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,100
Well, how did you think
she was gonna react?

322
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,800
You just told her that
she's the bride of frankenstein

323
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,300
and that you're gonna
take her children away, russ.

324
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,300
What are you looking for?

325
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
An old phone book.

326
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
Russell, when are we gonna
tell the world

327
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,800
what's going on down here?

328
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,300
When i know it's not gonna
hurt my kids.

329
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,400
Your kids are outta town.

330
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
Their mother's not.

331
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,600
Wait, what?

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You're protecting mariel?

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,600
She's the mother
of my children, dave.

334
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,900
She was the mother of your children.

335
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
If i can find a way to stop this
without destroying her,

336
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
that's what i'm gonna do.

337
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,100
She might destroy herself.

338
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Healy said that the cubans
and brazilians, these hybrids,

339
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,200
they were killing themselves
and their children.

340
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,100
And would you just stop
calling them hybrids?!

341
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,700
Why?
That's what they are, russ.

342
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,700
Okay.

343
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,800
Damn it.

344
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,200
What about the other mother
of your children?

345
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Have you talked to her lately?

346
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,500
No.

347
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,800
Well, do you think maybe
you oughta give her a call?

348
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,400
Not yet.

349
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,300
Why not?

350
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Because i don't know
what to say.

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
"Sorry, honey, but you know
this perfect, little town

352
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,900
"i asked you to spend
the rest of your life in,

353
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,500
"well, it's been
overrun by aliens

354
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
"and one of them happens
to be my ex-wife"?

355
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,000
And the sheriff and e head
of the news station...

356
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,900
and the priest.
He's the guy i need to talk to.

357
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,500
Here, if larkin radios,

358
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
just don't say anything
about any of this, okay?

359
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
Tell her to stay put
and i'll be in touch.

360
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,300
Where are you going?

361
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,500
To see the priest.

362
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,700
Russell!

363
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
how did this happen?

364
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,300
He wanted to take his wife home
and our group wouldn't let him.

365
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,400
So they did this?

366
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,500
I think they liked it.

367
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,600
Mariel, uh, i believe you called me down here.

368
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
What do you want, babe?

369
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,300
Answers.

370
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,700
I want to know exactly
what happened to me

371
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
the night of the hurricane.

372
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,500
If you care about
our marriage,

373
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
you'll tell me
everything you know.

374
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,600
Who have you been
talking to?

375
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
That doesn't matter.

376
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
I want the truth.

377
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know everything.

378
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
But you know more
than what you've told me.

379
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
If i've ever withheld anything
from you, it's because...

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
i love you.

381
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Well, why don't you try
giving me a little less love

382
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,100
and a lot more truth,
and we'll see where we land?

383
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,200
Tell me what happened
the night of the hurricane.

384
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I'll do better than that.

385
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,400
I'll show you.

386
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,500
sorry about this mess.

387
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,900
It's okay. Nice.

388
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
It's a quality tile.

389
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
So, wanna take a bath?

390
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
What, together?

391
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,900
There's no chlorine.

392
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,200
I don't know. Maybe we should
watch tv first or something...

393
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
what? The electricity's
out at home

394
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,700
and i don't get to watch it
that much.

395
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,900
Oh! sorry.

396
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Larkin and her porn.

397
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
So how come you don't
want to take a bath?

398
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,100
'Cause i don't know.
I don't really know you.

399
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,200
Do you ever really
know anybody?

400
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,100
Yeah.

401
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Who do you think
you know?

402
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,800
My family, mom, dad.

403
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,300
Bet you're wrong.

404
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,900
Bet you don't know 'em
at all.

405
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,000
Whoa. You're weird.

406
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,900
So they tell me.

407
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,700
What, do you always walk over
to strange guys

408
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,500
and ask them if they want
to take baths?

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,300
No, they usually ask me.

410
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,100
Where do you live, emily?

411
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
I was in gainesville,

412
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
but not anymore.

413
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,900
You go to school there?

414
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,400
Mm-hmm. U.f. I was a gator girl,

415
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,000
a phi gamma gator girl.

416
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,300
Cool. You graduate?

417
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Come on, jesse,
if you're not getting in, i am.

418
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
lewis?

419
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,900
Um, i'm finished.

420
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,400
Okay.

421
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,500
You all right?

422
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,800
Yeah.

423
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,400
I just, uh...

424
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,100
i think should sit down.

425
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,400
thanks.

426
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,100
Yeah, you probably shouldn't
be walking around by yourself.

427
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,400
I guess not.

428
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,900
Crazy couple days...

429
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,500
yeah.

430
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
But i guess
we've all been tested, huh?

431
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,200
what?

432
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,500
You lost your mom when you were
a little girl, didn't you?

433
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,400
Yeah.

434
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,900
Must have really tested
your faith when you lost her.

435
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Faith in what?

436
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,300
God?

437
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,300
You believe in god,
don't you?

438
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,700
Um, i guess.

439
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,000
I mean, i believe there is
something bigger than us.

440
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
Shoot, trees
are bigger than us,

441
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,000
but god's who lives
in your heart.

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,300
God gives you the courage
to face each day.

443
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,000
God... god is everything.

444
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,700
I'm sure your dad
taught you that.

445
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,200
Actually,
i think he'd rather

446
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,900
have people believe
he was everything.

447
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh, no, don't say that.

448
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Kira, wait a minute.

449
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,800
I know your father
is a man of faith.

450
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,700
He's counseled me
so many times.

451
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,400
About what?

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,500
Um, my life,
choices i've made.

453
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,700
Yeah, well, he doe"t talk
to me much about anything,

454
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,400
so, uh, for all i know,
he could be the dalai lama.

455
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,300
The dalai lama's a buddhist.

456
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,300
Whatever.

457
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,900
Oh, no, no.

458
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,400
I could never follow someone
that didn't have a deep faith.

459
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,500
It would go against
everything i...

460
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
oh, lord.

461
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,400
What... what is it?

462
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,700
i think i should go now.

463
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Why?

464
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,700
I just think i need
some time by myself.

465
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm a little confused
right now.

466
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
Do you want me to leave?

467
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,600
No, no.
It's not about you.

468
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,200
It's just, uh, um,

469
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,800
i don't know who i am right now.

470
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
Yeah.

471
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah, i don't know who i am.

472
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I've lost my way, kira.

473
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
I've been following a blind man.

474
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,300
Lewis...

475
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,000
i'm sorry.

476
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm sorry that you he
to see me like this.

477
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,600
It's all right.

478
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,500
I've sinned, kira.

479
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
I've committed
a terrible sin.

480
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,000
God gave me the most
beautiful gift

481
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,500
and i threw it away.

482
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,600
May i...

483
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
confess my sins to you?

484
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,900
father?

485
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
Russell.

486
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,400
We, uh, we had an incident
this morning.

487
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I heard.

488
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,700
What can i do for you?

489
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
I wanted to talk to you
about your church group...

490
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,800
these survivors.

491
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,200
Oh, it's not affiliated
with the church.

492
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,700
It's something separate.

493
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
You meet at the church.

494
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,100
Only because it's convenient.

495
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,300
Fact is our meetings
are getting so big,

496
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
we may have to move.

497
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Are you thinking about
joining us?

498
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm not sure
that i'm qualified.

499
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,500
Does what happened this morning
concern you?

500
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,400
Of course.

501
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Well, why do you think
it happened?

502
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't know.

503
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,500
Father, you know mariel
and i have two children.

504
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,500
I need to know if they're safe in her home,

505
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,200
with tom, with her.

506
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,300
Are they safe?

507
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
You saw what happened out there
this morning.

508
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Mariel saw it, too.

509
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,000
Why didn't anyone
do anything to stop it?

510
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,800
She did.

511
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
Mariel protected the man. I...

512
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
and the others...

513
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,200
we all just watched...

514
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,900
but she...

515
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,300
she protected him.

516
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
i couldn't have walked
all this way

517
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,600
by myself in the storm.

518
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
You weren't by yourself.

519
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,200
You're with me.

520
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,900
How did i end up with you?

521
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,700
The last thing i remember
was leaving russell's house

522
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,000
to go looking for rose.

523
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,900
I called you in your car.

524
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,200
I told you to meet me
up by the main road,

525
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,700
by the melaleuca trees.

526
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,700
Why?

527
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,100
I wanted to show you something.

528
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,700
The last thing i remember
when my plane went down

529
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,800
were the lights...

530
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,500
orange lights in the water.

531
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,900
For a long time, i thought
maybe it was burning fuel,

532
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,700
but i was wrong because
the night of the hurricane,

533
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,200
i saw those same lights
right here in the sky...

534
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
and i wanted you
to see them, too.

535
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,600
What are they?

536
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,300
I don't know.

537
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,900
Have they done something
to us?

538
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,600
Kept us alive,
as far as i can tell,

539
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,800
made us stronger.

540
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,500
We came right down here

541
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,100
in this raging storm,
and we saw those lights...

542
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,200
come right down into
the water,

543
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
and one minute,
you're by my side,

544
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,900
and the next minute,
you're not.

545
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
And you just let this happen
to me?

546
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,300
There was nothing
i could do.

547
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,200
I wanted to stop it,
but i couldn't.

548
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
I couldn't.

549
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't believe you.

550
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,600
I don't believe...

551
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,300
you wanted to stop it
and you couldn't.

552
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
What i wanted
was to trust you.

553
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
I wanted to be...

554
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,400
your wife and a good
mother to jesse and rose,

555
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,800
and you have taken that
away from me.

556
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,300
No, i haven't.

557
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,000
Yes, you have!

558
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,700
No, i haven't.

559
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,200
Yes, you have!
You did this to me.

560
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,500
Mariel...

561
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,100
whatever is happening to me,
i am gonna fight it.

562
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
I swear, you are not
gonna do this to me, tom.

563
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm leaving.

564
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,400
You can't leave.

565
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
I'm leaving.

566
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,100
You can't leave me now!

567
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,200
Are you kidding me
right now?

568
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,900
How do you do that?

569
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,100
I don't know, but i think
i'm ready for the olympics.

570
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,700
God, you're so...

571
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,300
weird.
Weird.

572
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
But weird's cool.

573
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,600
I'm cool with weird.

574
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
Thanks for coming in
with me, jesse.

575
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,900
Yeah, it's no problem.

576
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,000
Have you ever been
with a girl before?

577
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,100
I mean, like this?

578
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,600
Have you ever been
with a girl at all?

579
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Yeah, sure. I've walked
and i've talked with 'em,

580
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,200
but i've never been naked
in a bathtub with them.

581
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,000
It's fun, right?

582
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,900
Huge fan, huge fan.

583
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
A few weeks ago,

584
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,100
none of the people
i used to hang out with

585
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
wanted to be my friends
anymore.

586
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,400
You know sororities,

587
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
they can be
so cliquey anyways, you know?

588
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,700
I mean, their whole thing
is based on "us" and "them,"

589
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,400
so if you change, you're no
longer an "us," you're "them."

590
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,700
Yeah.

591
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,200
I've never really felt
like an "us."

592
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,000
I've...

593
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,000
pretty much always been
a "them."

594
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,500
Nice to meet you.

595
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,100
jesse?

596
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Oh, god.

597
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,700
Jesse, you in there?

598
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,600
Hey, uh, can you go out
this way?

599
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeah.

600
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,400
Thanks.

601
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
Are you gonna be okay?

602
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,500
Yeah.

603
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,200
Are you sure?

604
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Thank you.

605
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,100
For what?

606
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,400
For being a "them."

607
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay.

608
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,300
I'm comin'!

609
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,000
What are you doing
in there?

610
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,300
Hey, guys.

611
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,900
What were you doing?

612
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Takin' a bath.

613
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,500
I like baths.

614
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,000
And you wouldn't get in
the pool with me?

615
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,700
Nope. I hate chlorine.

616
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
Mariel?

617
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,300
Mariel?

618
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Lewis?

619
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,600
Lewis?!

620
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Kira, where is everyone?

621
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,000
Who's "everyone"?

622
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,500
Your stepmother, lewis?

623
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Um, i haven't seen mariel,
but, uh, lewis left.

624
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,100
Left for where?

625
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,000
He didn't say.

626
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,600
You were supposed to be
looking after him.

627
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,400
I did look after him.
I listened to his confession.

628
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,900
You what?

629
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,200
Yeah. He told me the story
of abraham and isaac.

630
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,000
Have you ever heard it?

631
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
As a test of faith,

632
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,500
god asks abraham
to sacrifice his only child,

633
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,600
but in the end,
god spares the kid

634
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,400
because his father
had so much faith.

635
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,700
I think lewis thought
you were like abraham, dad,

636
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
and then he found out
you were just a guy.

637
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,800
I mean, he lost it.

638
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't know
what happened,

639
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
but he's lost his faith
in you.

640
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,300
Oh, god.

641
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Ted, come in.

642
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,300
Ted, are you there?

643
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,500
yeah, tom,
what's up?

644
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,700
You know that thing we were
talking about? I'm ready.

645
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Roger that.
She'll be waitin'.

646
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,200
Mariel?

647
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,500
Mariel.

648
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Mariel.
Rose needs this
for her cat.

649
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Are you planning a trip?

650
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
Are the kids back yet?

651
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
No.

652
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Are they going to be?

653
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,300
Not today.

654
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,100
Don't touch me!

655
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,700
Hey, listen to me,

656
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,600
listen to me. Hey!

657
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't!

658
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I know how hard this must be for you.
No, you don't!

659
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,700
Yes, i do, mariel!
No, you don't!

660
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
I want to help you!

661
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,800
You want to take
our children away from me.

662
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,800
You actually think
i would hurt them?

663
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,500
Whatever has happened to me,
part of me is still here,

664
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,200
the part of me
that loves my kids,

665
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,100
the part of me that once
loved you is still here.

666
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,000
Hey, where you been?

667
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,600
I didn't, uh,
i didn't know what to do

668
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,500
with the skeleton in there,

669
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,100
so i wrapped it up
and put it in my crawlspace.

670
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,600
Is that okay?

671
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,500
Well, you know,
maybe we should bury it.

672
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Bury it?

673
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,800
That's the only proof we have
that underlay's a...

674
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,700
that underlay's
not what he says he is.

675
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,600
Right now, i'm not even sure
what that means, dave.

676
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
surprise.

677
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,400
What are you doing here?

678
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
We came home early.

679
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
I don't think that place is as
cool as you remember it, honey.

680
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,100
Where are the kids?

681
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,800
I just dropped them off
at mariel's.

682
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,200
Tom called,
said they have plans.

683
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,100
What?

684
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,000
No.

685
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,700
Russell?

686
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,700
Kids?

687
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,300
Are you here?

688
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Jesse?

689
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,900
mariel?

690
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,600
What's wrong?

691
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,400
He's taken them.

692
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,200
Tom's taken the kids.
Where?

693
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,300
I don't know, but we have
to find them.

694
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,500
Mariel, hold on a second.
What did the note say?
