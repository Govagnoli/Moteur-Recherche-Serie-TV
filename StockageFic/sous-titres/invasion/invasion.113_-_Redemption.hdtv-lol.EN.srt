NOW CAN YOU TELL ME,PLEASE,WHAT IS THREE PLUS FOUR?

88
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,850
-WHAT?

89
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,690
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THREE PLUS FOUR IS?

90
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,700
-SEVEN.

91
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,350
JUST TESTING YOUR RESPONSE TO PAIN.

92
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,500
ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO ANY MEDICATIONS?

93
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,360

95
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,660
REPEAT THESE THREE WORDS-

"SNAIL,RAZOR,NAPALM."

97
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,980
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?

98
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,700
THEY'RE FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

99
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,620
THEY'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.

100
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,110
-THE GOVERNMENT?
-YES.

101
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,940
WHERE'S MY WIFE?
WHERE'S MY WIFE?

102
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,260
WE'VE TRACKED DOWN YOUR DAUGHTER.

103
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,770
SHE'S ON HER WAY HERE NOW.

104
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,690
I NEED TO SEE MY WIFE!

105
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,360
I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

106
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,580
WHY NOT?

107
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,150
BECAUSE YOUR WIFE IS DEAD,MR. UNDERLAY.

108
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,030
CAN I CALL TO MAMMY AND DADDY TOM TO SAY GOOD NIGHT?

109
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,510
CAN I,DADDY?

110
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,620
OHH... YOU SURE CAN.

111
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,590
HERE... JUST SIT DOWN RIGHT HERE.

112
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,240
GO AHEAD AND CALL THEM,OKAY?

113
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,190
SO DOES SHE KNOW HER MOTHER

114
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,070
IS NOT WHO SHE THINKS SHE IS ANYMORE?

115
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,830
NO,AND NEITHER DOES JESSE.

116
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,020
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL THEM?

117
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,350
NOT YET.

118
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,870
WHY NOT?

119
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,150
BECAUSE I PROMISED MARIEL I WOULDN'T.

120
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,020
YOU PROMISED MARIEL?

121
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,500
YEAH.

122
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,480
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO JUST PRETEND EVERYTHING'S NORMAL?

123
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,650
LARKIN,DID YOU PUT THE NAPKINS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE?

124
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,890
SECOND DRAWER ON THE LEFT.

125
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,130
I'JUST SAYING,

126
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,840
UNTIL WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE,

127
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,740
I- I THINK WE SHOULD... WE SHOULD TAKE THIS SLOWLY.

128
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,970
DID YOU KNOW THAT IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES THIS HAPPENED,

129
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,400
THE HYBRIDS KILLED THEMSELVES?

130
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,680
DADDY,THERE'S NO ANSWER.

131
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,540
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND LEAVE A MESSAGE?

132
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,010
HI,MOMMY,IT'S ME,ROSE.

133
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,460
I JUST WANTED TO S GOOD NIGHT.

134
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,730
SO GOOD NIGHT. AND GOOD NIGHT,DADDY TOM.

135
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,300
AND SEE YOU SOON,KIRA.

136
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,170
-MAYBE THEY WENT TO DINNER.
-YEAH,MAYBE SO.

137
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,260
DIDN'T THESE- WHATEVER THEY ARE-

138
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,010
DIDN'T THEY ALSO KILL THEIR CHILDREN?

139
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,400
YEAH,SOME,BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED HERE.

140
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,750
YEAH,THIS GUY HEALY THINKS

141
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,470
THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT HOMESTEAD,

142
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,630
SOMETHING THAT'S HELPING THE HYBRIDS TO THRIVE.

143
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,360
WHAT IF THEY STOP THRIVING?

144
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,260
RUSSELL,WE HAVE TO TE PEOPLE ABOUT THIS,

145
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,700
FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S MY JOB.

146
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,290
WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION.

147
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,300
AND HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT LETTING THE KIDS BE

148
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,970
-WITH TOM AND MARIEL NOW?
-THEY'RE NOT WITH THEM ANYMORE.

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,930
THEY'RE WITH US NOW.

150
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,770
I KNOW,BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITH THEM AGAIN ONE DAY.

151
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,520
WHAT ABOUT OUR BABY?

152
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,650
RUSSELL,WE'RE HAVING A CHILD.

153
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,450
DO WE WANT OUR CHILD TO GROW UP IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

154
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,330
IF IT'S NOT SAFE,OF COURSE NOT.

155
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,050
I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS YET.

156
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,400
I'LL GET IT.

157
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,900

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,900
MET YOU.

180
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,260
DON'T LET ME DIE.

181
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,450
DON'T LET ME DIE.

182
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,170
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,830
KEEP TALKING TO ME.
LOOK AT ME,TOM. LOOK AT ME.

184
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,200
JUST KEEP TALKING. YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

185
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,340
I'M RIGHT HERE,BABY. I'M RIGHT HERE.

186
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,640
DR.UNDERLAY!

187
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,240
-WHERE ARE WE TAKING HIM?
-EXAM ONE IS READY.

188
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,520
WE'RE HAVING A TEMPORARY POWER OUTAGE.

189
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,290
MAIN POWER SHOULD BE BACK UP SOON.

190
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,730
OKAY,I'M HERE,TOM.

191
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,310
-DADDY,I WANT TO GO,TOO!
-WE'RE GONNA BE PRETTY LATE!

192
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,460
WHY DON'T WE ALL GO?!

193
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,280
OKAY!I'LL TAKE THEM WITH ME!

194
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,800
YEAH?

195
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,500
IT'S HEALY. WHERE ARE YOU?

196
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,530
HEALY?

197
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,090
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE HOSPITAL. I'M WITH MY SON.

198
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,580
THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LISTEN.

199
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,640
HE'S GOT THREE G.S.W.s TO THE ABDOMEN.

200
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,130
HIS PULSE IS THREADY. HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

201
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,040
KEEP LOOKING AT ME,TOM. STAY WITH ME.

202
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,480
ALL RIGHT,GUYS,LINE HIM UP.

203
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,360
-I'M RIGHT HERE.
-MY COUNT,ONE,TWO,THREE.

204
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,120
I'M RIGHT HERE.

205
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,670
START A CENTRAL LINE

206
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,150
AND GIVE A BOLUS OF 2 LITERS OF SALINE,WIDE OPEN...

207
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,140
AND TYPE AND CROSS 2 UNITS OF BLOOD.

208
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,770
RIGHT AWAY.

209
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,300
UH,NO,ON THE BLOOD.

210
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,880
UM... DR. UNDERLAY...

211
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,240
-TYPE AND CROSS.
-GIVE HIM O-NEG. HE'S O-NEG.

212
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,190
ARE YOU SURE?

213
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,830
YES.

214
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,740
OKAY,DO IT. HANG A BAG.

215
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,570
HURRY,OVER HERE.

216
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,850
WHAT?

217
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,460
I NEED... I NEED YOU.

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,170
I KNOW. I'M RIGHT HERE.

219
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,380
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER,OKAY?

220
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,920
JUST STAY WITH ME. JUST STAY WITH ME.

221
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,600
<i>JUST KEEP TALKING TO ME,TOM,OKAY,BABY?</i>

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,800
MR. UNDERLAY,THE MEN OUT THERE

223
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,880
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITHOUT-

224
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,740
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO THEM. BUT THEY'RE FROM THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION-

225
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,970
I- I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE FROM.

226
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,140
I'LL TALK TO THEM LATER.MAYBE TOMORROW.

227
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,480
ALL RIGHT.

228
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,240
DO YOU MIND IF I CHANGE YOUR DRESSING?

229
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,240
NO.

230
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,970
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESS OUTSIDE,

231
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,130
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EAGER TO SEE YOU.

232
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,690
WHERE'S YOUR LITTLE GIRL?

233
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,740
WITH HER AUNT.

234
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,250
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH FOR HER.

235
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,240
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT TO WORK THROUGH...

236
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,490
ALL OF US...

237
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,950
BUT EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON,RIGHT?

238
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,750
I WOULDN'T BE HERE

239
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,160
UNLESS I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO...

240
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,790
BE... HERE.

241
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,190
YOU'RE HEALING REMARKABLY FAST.

242
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,040
THESE STITCHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME OUT

243
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,160
IN JUST A FEW DAYS.

244
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,230
DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED?

245
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,820
WELL,I ASSUME IN THE CRASH.

246
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,900
NO. IT MUST HAVE BEEN AFTER.

247
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
I KNOW YOU WERE BLEEDING WHEN THEY PULLED YOU FROM THE WATER.

248
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,860
THEN I MUST HAVE CUT IT ON SOME WRECKAGE.

249
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,180
HOW DO YOU THINK I SURVIVED THIS?

250
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,120
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

251
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,710
NO.

252
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,750
ME EITHER.

253
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,840
YOU KNOW,YOU SAY SOME THINGS THAT ARE VERY UNSETTLING.

254
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,020
I'M SORRY. I JUST FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU,

255
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,500
LIKE I'VE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE.

256
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,620
YOU EVER FELT LIKE THAT?

257
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,010
YOU KNOW,WHEN YOU MET SOMEONE

258
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,950
YOU JUST KNEW YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE IN THEIR LIFE FOREVER?

259
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,420
THAT'S HOW I FELT WHEN I MET YOU.

260
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,820
MAY I HAVE THAT,

261
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,540
THE-THE VASE?

262
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,840
SURE.

263
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,960
YEAH.

264
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,180
YOU GIVE ME HOPE,MARIEL.

265
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,670
MARIEL.

266
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,340
-HEY,EXCUSE ME.
-RUSSELL.UH..I'M WORKING.

267
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,980
I'M SORRY,HONEY,I KNOW.

268
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,200
I JUST,UH,I CALLED YOUR OFFICE-

269
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,990
UM,MR. UNDERLAY,THIS IS MY HUSBAND RUSSELL.

270
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,000
HOW DO YOU DO?

271
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,670
H- HOW DO YOU DO?

272
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,170
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING SEARCH AND RECOVERY AT THE CRASH SITE,

273
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,130
AM I RIGHT?

274
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,710
THAT'S RIGHT.

275
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,700
WOULD YOU TAKE ME THERE?

276
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,670
UM,MR. UNDERLAY...

277
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,310
TOM,PLEASE.

278
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,400
TOM... I DON'T THINK...

279
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,160
I KNOW THE N.T.S.B. PEOPLE WOULD LIKE...

280
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,270
-TOM.
-TOM.

281
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,810
UM,I THINK THE N.T.S.B. MEN WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

282
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,020
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK TO THOSE GUYS,

283
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,770
BUT YOUR HUSBAND HERE COULD HELP ME.

284
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,250
HOW ABOUT IT,RUSSELL?

285
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,800
WOULD YOU TAKE ME THERE TOMORROW?

286
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,240
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,I'LL TELL THE N.T.S.B. PEOPLE

287
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,320
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

288
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,800
I'LL BE WORKING,MR. UNDERLAY.

289
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,080
RIGHT.

290
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,990
HOW ABOUT YOU,DOC?

291
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,920
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING ME OUT TO THE CRASH SITE TOMORROW?

292
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,190
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

293
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,840
WHY NOT?

294
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,270
THE N.T.S.B. WANTS ANSWERS,SO DOES THE PRESS.

295
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,460
I MEAN,AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL,

296
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,930
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS ABOUT HOW I SURVIVED THIS?

297
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,890
COME ON,DOC.

298
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,600
WOULD YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

299
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,180
HEY,RUSSELL,COULD YOU ASK YOUR WIFE TO HELP ME OUT?

300
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,440
HELP ME.

301
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,270
-WHAT DO YOU NEED,BABY?
-HELP ME.

302
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
YOU'RE GOING INTO SURGERY. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY,TOM.

303
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,860
MARIEL,I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

304
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,230
NOW?

305
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,910
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,TOM,OKAY?

306
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,660
IT'LL BE OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. BE RIGHT BACK.

307
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,420
-WHAT?
-HOW IS HE?

308
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,330
HE'S TERRIBLE. HE'S BLEEDING TO DEATH.

309
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,720
WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE HIM INTO SURGERY.

310
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,470
YOU CAN'T LET HIM DIE. I'VE TALKED TO SOMEBODY

311
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,140
WHO KNOWS FAR MORE ABOUT THIS THAN YOU DO.

312
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,720
HE TOLD ME IN OTHER PLACES WHERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU

313
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,080
HAVE BEEN CHANGED DURING A HURRICANE,

314
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,450
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES HAVE TURNED IN ON THEMSELVES.

315
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,620
THERE'S BEEN MASS MURDERS,SUICIDE...

316
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,800
WELL,WHO IS THIS PERSON?

317
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,490
SOMEBODY WHO'S SEEN IT,WHO'S SEEN THE WORST.

318
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,650
HE THINKS TOM MAY BE WHAT'S MAKING THE DIFFERENCE HERE

319
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,680
BECAUSE HE'S HAD SO MANY YEARS TO ADAPT,

320
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,170
HE MAY BE ACTING LIKE A STABILIZING FORCE

321
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,920
FOR THE OTHERS.

322
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,970
-THAT'S CRAZY.
-WHAT ISN'T CRAZY?

323
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,350
HE'S NOT LIVING IN THE BODY HE WAS BORN IN,NEITHER ARE YOU,

324
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,210
BUT HE HAS SURVIVED,FAR LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE WE KNOW OF.

325
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,020
PLEASE,MARIEL,EVEN- EVEN IF I'M WRONG,

326
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,020
UNTIL WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS,

327
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,840
THEN YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

328
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,880
HE'S MY HUSBAND,RUSSELL. WHAT ELSE WOULD I DO?

329
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,640
WHAT ELSWOULD I DO?

330
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,160
SO IS UNDERLAY GONNA MAKE IT?

331
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,210
I DON'T KNOW.

332
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,770
DID YOU TELL MARIEL WHAT HEALY SAID?

333
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,650
-YEAH.\-AND?

334
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,080
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK. VAL JUST CALLED.

335
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,520
SHE WANTS ME TO DO A PROFILE ON TOM AT THE 11:00.

336
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,090
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

337
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,170
WHAT I KNOW.

338
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,690
YOU KNOW A LOT. WELL,WHAT IF TOM GOT SHOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE IS?

339
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,020
WHAT IF THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE

340
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,320
THAT ARE IN DANGER NOW,TOO?

341
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,230
MARIEL MIGHT NOT WANT HER SECRET OUT,

342
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,980
BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.

343
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,930
SO AM I.

344
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,620
THEN LET ME GO ON TELEVISION AND TELL THE TRUTH.

345
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,700
IT COULD BE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR EVERYONE.

346
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,060
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

347
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,520
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR MOTHER,LARKIN.

348
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,450
THEY HAVE TO FIND OUT AT SOME POINT.

349
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,060
YOU KNOW,LARKIN MIGHT BE RIGHTRUSS.

350
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,120
THIS COULD BE TOO BIG TO KEEP QUIET.

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,490
HELL,I MEAN,KIRA COULD BE ONE OF THEM.

352
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,560
ONE OF WHAT? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT,HERE?

353
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,510
WHAT?

354
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,010
COME ON,DAVE,YEAH,FINE. THESE PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED,OKAY?

355
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,150
BUT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?

356
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,000
UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY'RE A THREAT TO US,

357
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,530
I'M NOT GONNA START HANGING EVERYBODY.

358
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,890
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,090
LISTEN,CAN YOU STAY HERE AND WATCH THE KIDS?

360
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,810
WHERE YOU GOING?

361
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,250
HEALY WANTS TO SEE ME IN PERSON.

362
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,180
WHAT? HEY,WHAT IF TOM DOESN'T MAKE IT?

363
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,560
WELL,THEN MAYBE NONE OF THIS WILL MATTER.

364
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,670
HIS TEMPERATURE'S SPIKING.

365
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,030
IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU WAITED OUTSIDE.

366
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,890
NO,I WANT TO STAY HERE WITH HIM.

367
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,340
PULSE OX IS 80.

368
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,620
HE'S HAVING A REACTION TO THE BLOOD.

369
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,280
-PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
-STOP THE TRANSFUSION.

370
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,690
HE'S NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN.

371
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,770
NO! IT'S NOT-NOT-

372
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,010
WE CAN TRY AUTOLOGOUS TRANSFUSION WITH A CELL SAVER.

373
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,120
NO! NO! NO! NO!

374
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,420
-GIVE HIM MY BLOOD.
-YOURS?

375
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,110
-WE'RE THE SAME TYPE.
-BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE-

376
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,580
PLEASE. JUST DO IT.

377
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,500
-I- I REALLY HAVE TO GO.
-NO,MARIEL,PLEASE.

378
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,440
PLEASE,WAIT.

379
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,770
WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

380
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,800
WHEN I CAN.

381
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,870
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST 16 HOURS.

382
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,540
YOUR SON MISSES YOU,I MISS YOU.

383
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,670
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

384
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,040
I HAVE TOLD YOU. I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU FOR SO LONG,

385
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,310
BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT HEARING ME.

386
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,270
I KNOW. YOU'RE UNHAPPY,OKAY? I'M SORRY. I'M UNHAPPY.

387
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,620
BUT WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

388
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,310
KILLING YOURSELF AT WORK ISN'T THE ANSWER.

389
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,140
IF YOUOULD JUST-HEY- COME ON,COME ON. COME WITH ME.

390
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,210
LET'S TALK TO FATHER SCANLON. OKAY?

391
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,110
I LOVE YOU,RUSSELL,

392
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,390
AND I LOVE OUR LITTLE BOY MORE THAN ANYTHING,

393
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,160
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

394
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,550
AND RIGHT NOW,I WOULD JUST REALLY RATHER BE HERE,

395
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,750
I'M SORRY.

396
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,410
WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE NEWS,

397
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,480
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE THE SHOOTER.

398
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,090
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME THE EX-HUSBAND

399
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,990
HAS GONE AFTER THE NEW GUY.

400
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,150
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

401
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,320
NO,THANKS.

402
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,570
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

403
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,560
SHE'S DEAD.

404
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,760
YOU KNOW WHO KILLED HER?

405
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,380
HIS NAME IS ELI SZURA.

406
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,280
HE USED TO DO CONTRACT WORK FOR THE C.I.A. WITH ME.

407
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,870
WE WERE SENT DOWN TO CUBA RIGHT AFTER HURRICANE CHARLEY

408
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,570
TO FIND OUT ABOUT THESE LIGHTS IN THE WATER

409
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,130
AND SEE HOW WE MIGHT MANAGE THEM.

410
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,370
-MANAGE THEM HOW?
-FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.

411
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,720
SO THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS?

412
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,280
OF COURSE,AND I'M SURE TH'RE AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

413
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,890
WELL,WHY AREN'T THEY DOING ANYTHING TO STOP IT?

414
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,890
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SZURA AND I WERE HIRED

415
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,750
SO THAT THE MILITARY COULD KEEP THEIR HANDS CLEAN.

416
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,160
IT'S LIKE THEY WANT TO KEEP TABS ON THIS.

417
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,300
THEY WANT TO STAY ON TOP OF IT,

418
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,600
BUT IF IT BLOWS UP IN THEIR FACES,

419
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,870
THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

420
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,890
THAT'S THE REASON WHY I THINK UNDERLAY IS SO IMPORTANT.

421
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,020
NOW HE SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS,

422
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,870
TO CONTROL THINGS- HE'S KEPT HIS WIFE AT BAY,

423
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,810
HE STARTED THAT SURVIVORS GROUP,

424
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,930
HE MIGHT HAVE EVEN CONVINCED THE MILITARY THAT THEY NEED HIM.

425
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,640
BUT IF THIS TURNS INTO CUBA OR BRAZIL...

426
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,240
THEN A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE DEAD,

427
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,840
BUT THE GOVERNMENT'LL STILL HAVE DENIABILITY

428
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,830
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO IT,THE ALIENS DID.

429
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,360
OH,MY GOD. I'VE GOTTA GET MY FAMILY OUT OF HERE.

430
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,550
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

431
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,650
YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA END HERE IN HOMESTEAD?

432
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,230
IF THESE HYBRIDS BECOME THE MAJORITY,

433
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,480
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

434
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,600
NO,AS FAR AS I SEE IT,YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHOICE-

435
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,700
YOUR CHOICE IS TO STAY HERE AND FIGHT THIS.

436
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,400
YOU KILL THESE THINGS IN THE WATER,

437
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,660
STOP THIS FROM GROWING

438
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,610
AND FIND OUT WHAT THE MILITARY'S REAL AGENDA IS.

439
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,650
-WHAT ABOUT MY EX-WIFE?
-WHAT ABOUT HER?

440
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,240
WHAT,ARE U SUGGESTING I KILL HER,TOO?

441
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,590
RUSSELL,I DON'T THINK YOU'RE HEARING ME.

442
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,030
WE'RE IN A FRAGILE SITUATION HERE

443
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,630
THAT COULD EXPLODE AT ANY TIME,

444
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,870
AND IF SZURA HAS HIS WAY,

445
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,760
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

446
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,090
WELL,WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON?

447
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,950
HIS OWN. HE GOT TAKEN

448
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,530
WHEN WE WERE IN CUBA AND HE'S BEEN HUNTING ME EVER SINCE.

449
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,810
HE'LL KILL ANYBODY HE VIEWS AS A THREAT TO HIS OWN SAFETY,

450
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,670
THAT MAY EVEN INCLUDE UNDERLAY.

451
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,880
BUT UNDERLAY'S A HYBRID.SO?

452
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,350
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE THE SA.

453
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,220
SZURA WAS A SOCIOPATHIC SON OF A BITCH

454
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,580
BEFORE HE GOT TAKEN AND THIS H ONLY EMPOWERED HIM.

455
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,370
IF UNDERLAY IS SADDAM,SZURA IS ZARQAWI.

456
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,330
HE'S NOT GONNA SIT BACK AND LET THE MILITARY RUN THINGS.

457
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,950
HE'S GONNA WANT TO TAKE CHARGE.

458
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,510
HOW IS IT THAT YOU WEREN'T TAKEN?

459
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,660
I GOT SPIT OUT.

460
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,510
I'M NOT A WELL MAN,RUSSELL. I HAVEN'T BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.

461
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,910
THEY DON'T TAKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SICK.

462
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,260
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

463
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,760
MY WIFE IS ABOUT TO GO ON THE NEWS AT 11:00

464
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,110
TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON THIS WHOLE THING.

465
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,380
THEN YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY TO STOP HER...

466
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,640
BEFORE SZURA DOES IT FOR YOU.

467
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,790
I*****************IT

468
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,200
I WANT US TO FIND SOMETHING

469
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,530
THAT UNDERSCORES TOM'S COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY

470
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,270
AND HIS YEARS OF SERVICE.

471
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,440
WE HAVE A LOT OF FOOTAGE GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO '96.

472
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,580
THIS IS HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE

473
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,110
RIGHT AFTER THE PLANE CRASH.

474
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,890
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME LIVE OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

475
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,840
I DO. WE'LL RUN A HERO PIECE

476
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,890
AND THEN YOU CAN DO THE WRAP UP FROM THERE.

477
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,420
HE SHOULD BE OUT OF SURGERY BY THEN.

478
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,130
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO TOM,AREN'T YOU?

479
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,560
HE'S HELPED ME TREMENDOUSLY.

480
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,650
SINCE THE HURRICANE?

481
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,360
I CAN PUT SOMEONE ELSE ON THIS

482
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,220
IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE OBJECTIVE.

483
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,150
NO. I CAN BE OBJECTIVE.

484
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,370
I'LL WANT TO SEE IT BEFORE IT RUNS

485
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,440
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME HERE.

486
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,400
-I HAVE TO GO.
-I KNOW.

487
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,200
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS.

488
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,120
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE,REMEMBER THIS.

489
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,960
REMEMBER HOW IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST MET.

490
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:57,810
TOM...

491
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,140
THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF ROUGH DAYS AHEAD,

492
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,190
A LOT OF CHANGES.

493
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,790
THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'LL GET THROUGH IT...

494
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,130
IS IF WE REMEMBER.

495
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,580
HI.

496
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,780
YOU'RE HERE?

497
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,240
SO ARE YOU.

498
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,190
YOU SAVED ME...AGAIN.

499
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,710
YOU SAVED YOU.

500
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,270
THE DOCTORS SAY THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A BODY

501
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,510
FIGHT SO HARD TO LIVE.

502
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,450
YOU'RE ALREADY HEALING,TOM.

503
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,560
YOU GAVE ME YOUR BLOOD?

504
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,570
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED?

505
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,130
I DIDN'T.

506
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,380
WHERE'S MY CLOTHES?

507
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,330
THEY'RE IN MY OFFICE.

508
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,540
MY KEYS... SHOULD BE WITH THEM.

509
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,660
GET MY KEYS... AND GO HOME.

510
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,020
WHY?

511
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,050
'CAUSE I WANT YOU TO GET ME SOMETHING...

512
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,460
FROM THE CLOSET.

513
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,740
WHAT'S IN IT?

514
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,960
EVERYTHING.

515
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,650
THEIR REPORT IS TWO MINUTES,AND THEN WE GO LIVE!

516
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,620
ALL RIGHT! HEY,HE MADE IT,YOU KNOW? UNDERLAY.

517
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,830
JUST CAME OVER THE WIRE,HE MADE IT THROUGH SURGERY.

518
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,200
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAD WITH THAT...

519
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,640
UNLESS YOU GOT SUSPECTS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

520
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,110
DO THE POLICE EVEN HAVE ANY SUSPECTS?

521
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,180
LARKIN!

522
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,580
GO SET UP,I'LL CATCH UP TO YOU.

523
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,650
LOOK,YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

524
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,620
-I HAVE TO.
-NO,I JUST GOT BACK FROM HEALY'S.

525
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,500
RUSSELL,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THIS HEALY PERSON IS.

526
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,840
OKAY,IT DOESN'T MATTER,ALL RIGHT?

527
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,280
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YOU GO PUBLIC WITH THIS,

528
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,100
NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE YOU

529
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,710
BECAUSE NO ONE'S GONNA BACK THE STORY.

530
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,290
YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG. THE MILITARY IS INVOLVED.

531
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,860
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE SAVING ANY LIVES

532
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,510
BY TALKING NOW,LARKIN,BUT YOU MIT BE KILLING US.

533
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,460
THERS A GUY OUT HERE THAT DOESN'T WANT THIS STORY TOLD.

534
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,940
I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO YOU TO PROTECT MARIEL,I DO.

535
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,340
NO,IT'S NOT ABOUT MARIEL ANYMORE.

536
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,930
BUT I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT HER ANYMORE.

537
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,150
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT US AND OUR BABY.

538
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,960
AND I'M SORRY IF THIS MEANS

539
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,350
THAT THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GET HURT.

540
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,350
IT'S GONNA HURT ALL OF US,NOT JUST THE KIDS,LARKIN.

541
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,310
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

542
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,770
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

543
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,130
THANK YOU.

544
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,890
-I WAS SO SCARED,DADDY.
-I KNOW. I'M SORRY...

545
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,180
FOR EVERYTHING.

546
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,320
YOU LOOK AMAZING,TOM. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SHOT.

547
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,030
I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS HANGIN' AROUND,

548
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,800
BUT IT'S GETTIN' KINDA LATE,YOU KNOW?

549
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,220
MAYBE YOU OUGHTA BE GETTIN' HOME.

550
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,520
SHERIFF,MR. VARON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU.

551
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,090

EVERYBODY WAS JUST TAKING OFF.

555
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,510
ALL RIGHT,GOOD NIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU ALL SOON.

556
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,880
GOOD NIGHT,BABE. GOOD-BYE,JESS.

557
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,030
GOOD NIGHT,TOM.

558
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,320
TOM,I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

559
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,070
MY WIFE'S ABOUT TO GO LIVE WITH A STORY

560
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,620
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TOLD,

561
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,010
A STORY BIGGER THAN YOUR SHOOTING.

562
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,060
AND FOR NOW,IT'S A STORY I'M WILLING TO KEEP TO MYSELF,

563
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,600
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

564
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,010
IS THAT THE BACKGROUND YOU WANT?

565
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,310
-YEAH,THIS LOOKS GREAT.

00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,140
YEAH,IT'S GREAT NEWS.

569
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,470
LARKIN,LOOK... HE'S A GOOD MAN.

570
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,280
I KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS

571
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,960
ABOUT BOTH OF US LATELY,

572
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,450
BUT HE'S A GOOD MAN.

573
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,420

574
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,030

575
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,310

00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,290
-UH,HE'S INSIDE.

577
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,510
I WAS GOING THROUGH SOME VIDEO FOOTAGE TONIGHT,

578
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,560

579
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,010
AND I SAW YOU...

580
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,380
HERE,ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO...

581
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,970

582
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,910
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU TWO WENT SO FAR BACK.

583
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,250

585
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,470

586
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,670
YEAH.

587
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,330
YOU KNOW I HAD A SECRET ABOUT WHO I AM,

588
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,260
I BEGGED HIM TO KEEP FOR ME...

589
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,380
BUT HE WOULDN'T DO IT.

590
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,060
HE TOLD YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE MORE IMPORTANT.

591
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,430
HEY,LARKIN.

592
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,010
WE'RE GONNA GO LIVE IN ABOUT TEN SECONDS. I'M SORRY.

593
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,920
IN EIGHT,SEVEN,

594
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,400

00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,160
<i>WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THIS MAN HAS BEEN THROUGH,</i>

598
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,550
<i>ALL THAT HE'S ENDURED,</i>

599
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,460
<i>YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION-</i>

600
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,330
<i>WHAT MAKES HIM DIFFERENT?</i>

601
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,330
<i>WHEN I SPOKE WITH HOSPITAL OFFICIALS TODAY</i>

602
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,040
<i>FOR COMMENT,DOCTOR-</i>

603
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,000

607
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,690
I COULDN'T REACH HER.

608
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,760
DID YOU FIND THE BOX?

609
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,160

I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU OPENED THAT,DID YOU?

611
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,910

613
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,430

614
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,780

617
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,150
TURNING SO MANY LIVES UPSIDE DOWN.

618
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,860
WE'VE ALL HAD TO REASSESS...

619
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,310
REASSESS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,

620
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,170
AND WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS FAMILY...

621
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,510
AND THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

622
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,380
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT

623
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,640
