4
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,035
You remember how to get there ?

5
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,009
Yep, route 27, 20 miles north.

6
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,186
Boca chica motel.

7
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,322
Yeah, the road's still blocked,
but I got you clearance.

8
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,041
I'll try to get up there
as soon as I can.

9
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:10,520
I won't count on it.

10
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,499
Hey, come on, it was my idea.

11
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:13,565
It's okay, honey.

12
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,285
Just find out what was inside that alligator,

13
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,882
and then come meet us when you can.

14
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:19,812
A little solo stepmother time
might be good for everybody.

15
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,420
Okay.

16
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:23,821
Hey, daddy, does the hotel
have a pool?

17
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:24,856
They got a big pool,

18
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:27,751
and they got cinnamon pancakes
the size of Jesse's head.

19
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,177
Oh, wow.

20
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,529
How come you're not goin'?

21
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:34,802
I got some work to do, but I'll try to meet up
with you guys tonight.

22
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,312
- Do you wanna drive?
- Yes.

23
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,283
Go for it.

24
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,414
All right.

25
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:46,016
When I get back, I want answers to all
the secrets of the universe.

26
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,203
Well, I'll try and have one.

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,249
- Take care of our baby.
- I will.

28
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:52,925
- Bye.
- Bye.

29
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,907
- You have fun, kids.
- Okay.

30
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,320
- Is this on tight?
- Seat belts?

31
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:58,810
- Okay.
- Bye, dad.

32
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,297
See ya later.

33
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,559
Dave, I'm goin' into work early.

34
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:14,047
Listen, I need you to promise me

35
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:16,560
you're not gonna say anything
about what we found until I...

36
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,517
Dave.

37
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,182
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

38
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,553
<i>I hope you're all sittin' down
right now,</i>

39
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,799
<i>because I have got some major news.</i>

40
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,864
<i>The eagle has landed.</i>

41
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,043
<i>That's right, bloggers.</i>

42
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,777
<i>We found an actual piece of an alien life-form...</i>

43
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,910
<i>In the belly of a gator.</i>

44
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:11,361
<i>Oh, and first thing tomorrow morning,</i>

45
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:13,998

46
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,394
<i>live from my favorite internet café.</i>

47
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,602
That son of a bitch.

48
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:19,830
Okay, okay.

49
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:26,917
Okay, all right, easy.

50
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,173
Eh. Uh...

51
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,209
Who the hell are you?

52
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:35,982
Ah. Okay.

53
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,229
No, don't.

54
00:04:05,587 --> 00:04:07,028
Please, please, please.

55
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:28,380
Will you please just tell me what's going on here?

56
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,360
Your dream has come true, Dave.

57
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:33,141
You've been abducted.

58
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,326
You can't leave people in the dark.

59
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,541
Listen, if we don't get power back
in this town soon,

60
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,112
they're gonna burn my house down, Howard...

61
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,787
Don't let me down.

62
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:50,890
Good morning, Sir.

63
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,443
Ah, good morning to you,too, Lewis.

64
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,221
You're in early this morning.

65
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,253
- Yeah, a little work out.
- Good for you, Sir.

66
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:03,357
- And how's mrs. Underlay feeling today?
- Much better.

67
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,109
- Thanks for asking.
- Good.

68
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:10,206
Oh, I got an I.D. on that body we dredged up
the other night.

69
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,293
Oh, yeah?

70
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:13,548
Yeah.

71
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,408
Brandi Marie Kotner.
32 years old,

72
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,353
resident of florida city.

73
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:20,750
That was very enterprising of you, Lewis.

74
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,473
I'm trying to figure out
what she was doin' in that cove, sir.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,878
I believe  she was drowning.

76
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,361
But that's just it.
The coroner's report

77
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,550
says that she had sea water in her lungs,

78
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,326
- Not brackish.
- So?

79
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:36,830
So I'm thinkin' she died elsewhere,
and somebody moved the body.

80
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,533
You think she was murdered?

81
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,241
N-no, sir. There's no evidence of foul play.

82
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:45,712
Then why would someone move
a dead hurricane victim from one place to another?

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,829
- It's a puzzler, sir.
- Yes, it is,but then again...

84
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:54,715
Sir?

85
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:57,078
Hurricanes have been known
to move a lot of things.

86
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,482
I'll tell my wife you asked about her.

87
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:11,156
We're doing the right thing.

88
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:13,286
We're gonna have to go find someone else
if it's not him.

89
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:16,026
- Give me a little bit of time.
- No, no, no.

90
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:17,881
We need to find out if his blood test is...

91
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:20,469
I'll do my best. I need at least an hour.

92
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,338
An hour? I don't know if we have an hour.

93
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,045
His family's gonna start
lookin' for him very soon.

94
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:26,597
- We don't have all the materials.
- I'll give you as much time as I can.

95
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:27,938
Go ahead and do what you have to do.

96
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,313
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:46,370
Who are you?

98
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,786
If you're offering that to me,
I'm not thirsty.

99
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,106
What does that mean?

100
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,808
Why won't you talk to me?

101
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:20,919
I just want you to talk to me.

102
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,031
I just need to know what's goin' on, that's all.

103
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:41,480
- Get up.
- Why?

104
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,080
We're moving.

105
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,209
What the hell is wrong with you?

106
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,987
You run now, you'll never know the truth.

107
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,118
What truth?

108
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,680
We've been readin' your blogs, Dave.

109
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,554
We understand you had an encounter with something
that may not be of this world.

110
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:42,775
Me, too.

111
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:10,820
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

112
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,610
Lookin' for my brother-in-law Dave Groves.

113
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,830
Oh, crazy Dave?

114
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:17,596
- Yeah. I guess he comes in here a lot.
-Yeah, he's not in here now.

115
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,989
- Was he in here this morning?
- Nope.

116
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:25,324
- What time are you guys open?
- Uh, 5 A.M.

117
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,846
And you're sure he wasn't in here this morning?

118
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:30,923
Positive, but you're the second person
in as many days that's asked about him.

119
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,435
Who was the first?

120
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:34,881
Uh, the Iraqi woman.

121
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,062
What Iraqi woman?

122
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:38,890
I don't know her name.
She's Iraqi...

123
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:41,257
or Arab or Persian or somethin'.

124
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,642
Been talkin' him up about some old naval yard
from the civil war.

125
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,311
- Cold war.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

126
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,407
I think she really wanted to take him up there.

127
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,274
He didn't seem that interested.

128
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,833
Did you know that our whole town
has been invaded by ebays?

129
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,170
Your scars look  lot different than mine.

130
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:08,991
- Mine are older.
- How old?

131
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,474
Two years.

132
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,131
Those things have been out in the water for two years?

133
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:15,270
Not here.

134
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:20,832
Why don't you sit down?

135
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:24,382
Don't worry, the tests are over.

136
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,508
Tests?

137
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm sorry, Dave.We had to find out
if you were really who you said you were.

138
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,462
Hold on, hold on,hold on.

139
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,749
- Are you sure you don't want some?
- Yeah, no, I mean...

140
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:39,948
Do you have any beer?

141
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,426
No. Please sit.

142
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,540
Why'd you take my blood?
Why'd you put me under water?

143
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,824
On one of your blogs, you wrote about
a hurricane survivors' meeting in a local church.

144
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:59,723
Yeah. I went to a couple of 'em.
I scoped 'em out.

145
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:00,592
Why?

146
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:05,018
Well, because a lot of people in this town

147
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,038
have been actin' pretty weird since the hurricane.

148
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,874
- This guy that Russell was working with--
- Russell's your brother-in-law.

149
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,895
- How did you know that?
- You've written about him.

150
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:13,495
I know about your whole family.

151
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,013
- I didn't get your name.
- Healy.

152
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,459
- Healy.
- Right.

153
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:22,344
- Is that your real name?
- No.

154
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:25,414
Right. Not like I haven't asked you
this about 1,000 times,

155
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:26,786
but what the hell is going on here?

156
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,722
- We were hopin' you could tell us.
- You first.

157
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,758
- Who's that chick who was in the back of the room?
- You'll meet her.

158
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,769
- You always kidnap people off the net?
- No, and I'm sorry we had to do it this way,

159
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,686
but based on your last message, we felt that
there was some urgency.

160
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:41,501
What was my last message?

161
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,242
"Hey, bloggers, it's me again, Dave.

162
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,366
"I'm on the verge of being able to report

163
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:55,412
"that the lights in the water
may contain human D.N.A.

164
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:59,717
"Oops. Guess I just reported it."

165
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,043
This alligator you found
with the partially digested alien in its belly,

166
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:06,786
that was from a dying part of the glades?

167
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,910
Yeah, Russell's not even certain
that it is an alien.

168
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,257
But again, I'm available via e-mail.

169
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,972
I didn't need in the middle of the night
and have my head shoved...

170
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,911
- into a vat of water.
- Pria !

171
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:24,890
We need you now.

172
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,738
Connie?

173
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,361
- You took this statement?

174
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:42,846
Sir, I just talked to the victim's parents.

175
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:44,837
What victim?

176
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,550
Brandi Marie Kotner...

177
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:49,827
the girl we pulled from the water
a couple nights ago.

178
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:58,016
Oh. I thought she didn't have any family.

179
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,986
The coroner thought so, too,
but I did a little research,

180
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,051
and apparently, she was adopted,

181
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,842
and though her adoptive parents have passed on,

182
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:09,163
her real parents, her birth parents
are still very much alive.

183
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:12,895
Lewis, why did you do this?

184
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:19,188
Because I felt so badly for what happened to her...

185
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,815
and to die in such a terrible way...

186
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:25,815
And have no one there for--
Well, I prayed on it last night, Sir.

187
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:26,916
You--you prayed on it?

188
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:28,497
I pray about a lot of things, Sir,

189
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,162
and like me, these people were curious

190
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:34,135
how sea water managed to get into
their daughter's lungs.

191
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,425
Your wife was confused about it, too.

192
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,415
You talked to Mariel?

193
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,423
Well, she was the one who originally
discovered the body.

194
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:45,841
Come here.

195
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,903
This is not a good thing you've done, Lewis.

196
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:02,704
Why not?

197
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,989
Because you've gone into people's lives--

198
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,898
perfectly happy people's lives--

199
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,633
and brought them tragedy.

200
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,345
- But, Sir, I--
- and on top of that,

201
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,935
you did it without talking to me.

202
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,697
How many jobs were available to you
after your tour of duty?

203
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,790
How many sheriff's departments
wanted to hire you?

204
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:26,800
None, Sir, only you.

205
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,443
And why do you think that is?

206
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:33,253
- I don't know.
- Because I knew you'd be loyal.

207
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:38,697
- I was counting on your loyalty, Lewis.
- And you have it, Sir...

208
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,782
but I'm loyal to someone else first.

209
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,618
Who?

210
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,675
God, Sir.

211
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:02,549
Give me the family's phone number,
and I'll talk to them.

212
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,603
- Thank you,Sir.
- Meantime...

213
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,769
You know that in let over on Biscayne
where the kids like to party?

214
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:12,340
One of the sugar companies
may be dumping out there again.

215
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,282
I want you to meet  me down there tonight.

216
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:17,639
- We'll see what we see.
- I'll be there, Sir.

217
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:11,962
Why did he call you Pria?

218
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:14,317
- Because that's my name.
- Your real name?

219
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,326
- No.
- No.

220
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:18,813
What is with you people?

221
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:20,679
We have to be careful, Dave.

222
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,804
- You should be, too.
- Oh, come on, come on.

223
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,117
You've been buggin' me around
that coffee shop for weeks now,

224
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,289
spinnin' me your stupid
little conspiracy theories,

225
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,915
tryin' to drag me out to some cock amamy naval yard.

226
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,336
I still need more time.

227
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,028
Time for what, huh?

228
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:43,352
- Who are you?
- We're survivors like you.

229
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:44,999
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not a survivor.

230
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,667
I spent the entire night of the hurricane
huddled in my sister's bathroom.

231
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:48,998
I never went near the water.

232
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,086
And I told your buddy here
that I only went to that church

233
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,341
- to check things out.
- And?

234
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,770
I don't know. They seemed
pretty normal to me...

235
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,302
but then I guess, you can't really trust anybody,
can you, Connie?

236
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:04,647
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit down.

237
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,055
As a matter of fact, I wanna leave.

238
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,428
That's what I'm gonna do.

239
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,624
I-if you leave now,
everyone you care about may die.

240
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,949
- Is that the truth you were talkin' about?
- Yes.

241
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:24,554
Then both of you need to stops
peakin' in Yoda right now...

242
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,639
and tell me everything you know,
or I'm outta here.

243
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:33,645
I think you should hang around.

244
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:28,822
How'd you find me?

245
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,563
I followed your mouth.
Who are you?

246
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:33,966
He says he's Healy.
She says her name's Pria,

247
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,432
- but yesterday, she was Connie, so...
- Put down the gun.

248
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,510
Also, he's got scars all over his body
just like Paxton, like the ones on my legs.

249
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,242
See if they're armed.

250
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:46,261
Okay.

251
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:01,391
All right. I think we're okay.

252
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:04,130
Sit down.

253
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,263
Why'd you bring him here?

254
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:16,399
We wanted a safe place where we could talk.

255
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,985
- They were readin' my blogs.
- We wanted to know who he was...

256
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,718
- and what he was.
- "What he was"?

257
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,585
Your brother-in-law has noticed
a lot of changes

258
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:27,449
in people around town lately, Russell.
Haven't you?

259
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:29,963
Your ex-wife, maybe?

260
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,660
Let us show you something.

261
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:49,663
It's Bonaire, off the coast of northern Venezuela.

262
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,671
Three years ago, fishermen caught in a hurricane

263
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:56,139
reported strange and beautiful lights landing in the water.

264
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:02,193
The next day, all the fishermen showed up on a beach--

265
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,935
naked--not a mark on 'em.

266
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,394
A week later, they all killed themselves.

267
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:18,799
That's La Isla de la Juventud,
The Isle of Youth, off Cuba.

268
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:21,924
One of Castro's nastiest prisons is there.

269
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,289
A year ago, on the heels of hurricane Charley,

270
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,181
the guards reported seeing "las luces" in the water.

271
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,351
Lights.

272
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,551
Shortly there after, the place imploded.

273
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:33,239
How?

274
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,943
After murdering half the prisoners,
all the guards committed suicide,

275
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,196
and none of this was made public, of course.

276
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,672
I only knew about it because
I was in Cuba at the time.

277
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:48,383
- Brazil?
- That's where we met.

278
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:49,484
That's enough.

279
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,245
Tell me what you know

280
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,300
- about my ex-wife.
- I think we already have.

281
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,720
You're saying she's gonna kill herself?

282
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:00,505
- I can't sit here any more.
- Sit back down.

283
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,724
You're treating us like hostages.

284
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,283
What the hell do you think you were doin' to him?

285
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:05,687
We don't have time for this.
There are people out there

286
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:10,158
who may be dying right now,
killing themselves and their children

287
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:13,427
because they can't reconcile what's happened to them.

288
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,236
Who are you?

289
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,059
I'm an archaeologist...

290
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,535
and you're keeping me from my work.

291
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,471
Pria and her husband...

292
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,755
they were in Brazil in 2004

293
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:42,716
when the first hurricane ever recorded down there
made landfall.

294
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,944
They were separated by the storm,
but they found each other two days later.

295
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:55,514
He was in remarkably good shape
considering what he'd been through,

296
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:57,343
but he wasn't the same man.

297
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:00,961
They'd gone deep into the forest on a dig
and taken their children with them,

298
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:04,009
and one night while they were asleep,
he snapped.

299
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:10,104
He doused himself with gasoline, set himself a blaze,
and he walked into their tent.

300
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,223
Pria lost her whole family that night.

301
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,001
How long after the hurricane did this happen?

302
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:27,771
Less than a week.

303
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,169
I'm sorry, but we just can't trust
anyone anymore.

304
00:23:57,588 --> 00:23:59,030
See anything out there, Lewis?

305
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,706
Nothin' yet, sir.

306
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,461
What exactly are we looking for?

307
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:05,928
Any sign of chemical contaminants,
discoloration.

308
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,642
Sir?

309
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:18,227
I think I see somethin'.

310
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:57,726
Lewis?

311
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,388
Lewis!

312
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,525
Where is it?

313
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:06,590
It's in the back.

314
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:10,748
Let's go.

315
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:31,270
- Looks like a piece of fish.
- I wish it were.

316
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:43,498
- Those your kids?
-  Yeah.

317
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:45,099
You wanna see 'em again?

318
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,869
All you have to do
is tell us what this is.

319
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,014
I think you know more than I do.

320
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,726
If that were the case, we wouldn't be here.

321
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:53,983
What were you doin' in Cuba?

322
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,341
You military? C.I.A.?

323
00:27:03,126 --> 00:27:04,113
Why do you keep lookin' in the mirror?

324
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:05,181
Something out there scare you?

325
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,159
Change.

326
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:09,646
I don't know what the hell that means.

327
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:11,246
A lot of people went missing in the hurricane,

328
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:12,924
but no one's committing suicide here.

329
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:17,302
In fact, many people, my ex-wife included,
seem to be--

330
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,406
adapting?

331
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,348
You're right, Russell.
Things are different here,

332
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:23,366
and that should concern you.

333
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:28,586
When an invasive species enters the park,
what do you do?

334
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,147
I study it.

335
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,462
And if it poses a threat?
You kill it.

336
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,309
You think that's what we're dealing with here,

337
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,688
an invasive species?

338
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:39,947
I don't know, but whatever it is,

339
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,039
the people affected here seem to be thriving.

340
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:45,354
They're goin' to church,
supporting each other,

341
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:47,470
developing a community.

342
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,766
So I gotta ask myself,
what is it about this place

343
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,630
that makes everything so different?

344
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:55,258
Now these things have been in the water everywhere,

345
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:59,563
but in Cuba and in Brazil,
most everyone's dead now.

346
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,662
So what is it about this place?

347
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,846
I don't know.

348
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,054
I think we owe it to your children to find out...

349
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,187
don't you?

350
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:23,550
What color?

351
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,532
I'm thinkin' maybe, like,
peachy kinda like.

352
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:26,634
Oh, yeah, I love that.

353
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:28,312
Yeah.
Morning, daddy.

354
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:29,643
Hey, hey.

355
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,890
- Honey.
- Hello.

356
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,051
What's the matter, eggs no good?

357
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:36,334
No. No, they're fine.

358
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,059
Are you okay?

359
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:46,465
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just thinkin' about stuff.

360
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:50,964
Lewis told me that he spoke with you.

361
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:55,178
Yeah. He mentioned that they found sea water
in that girl's lungs.

362
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,176
I told him that she could have drowned elsewhere.

363
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,834
That's possible, isn't it?

364
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:04,539
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

365
00:29:06,296 --> 00:29:07,549
Is that what's bothering you?

366
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:08,966
You know me.

367
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,652
I always like to be thorough.

368
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:15,655
You can't save everybody.
You're only human.

369
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,357
See ya later, okay?

370
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:24,262
Okay.

371
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:12,779
- Lewis.
- Sir.

372
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,836
What are you doing here?
I mean, I...

373
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:17,616
How did you get to my house?

374
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:18,949
- I walked.
- You walked.

375
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,579
- Walked from where?
- The beach.

376
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,851
Come on in.
Come on.

377
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:35,713
Lewis...

378
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:39,676
do you know what happened to you last night?

379
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,447
- Not really, sir.
- Are you sure?

380
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:49,095
Yes, but I don't think
that really matters now.

381
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,955
Who am I to question a miracle?

382
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:56,412
Well, I don't know if
I'd call it a miracle, but...

383
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,465
Oh, it's a miracle, sir.

384
00:31:03,804 --> 00:31:05,325
It's a miracle.

385
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,756
The human D.N.A. came
from blood, that was in this tentacle.

386
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,052
I think it acts like a feeding tube.

387
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:25,420
These are the suckers at the end here,

388
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:27,363
and this looks like a proboscis that could

389
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:29,456
- easily pierce the skin.
- Guys, I have to pee.

390
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,335
- Hold on.
- No, man, I can't.

391
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:32,705
I've been strapped in this chair all night.

392
00:31:32,706 --> 00:31:34,229
Why does he get to walk around, and I don't?

393
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,590
- We'll take you outside in a minute.
- I can't wait that long.

394
00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:40,706
Any trace of a digestive enzyme?

395
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:44,028
No.

396
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,855
I'm not sure this even leads to a stomach.

397
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,178
I mean, most of this is blubber, but right here...

398
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,607
this tissue is different.

399
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:54,273
It's muscular.
It's lined with a soft membrane.

400
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:56,939
It's similar to what you might find
in the inner lining of a uterus.

401
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,101
So it's a womb?

402
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,418
All right, if somebody doesn't come over
and let me out of this chair,

403
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,092
- I'm just gonna piss all over everybody.
- Shut up!

404
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,539
You shut up, man!
I gotta take a piss!

405
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,179
- What do you want me to do?
- You gotta be quiet.

406
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,044
What, is that--is that what you're afraid of?

407
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,643
Are you afraid somebody might hear me?

408
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:13,208
Are you afraid someone's gonna hear me yellin'

409
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:14,595
about how I'm gonna take a piss?!

410
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:16,498
Hey! Stop it!

411
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:23,736
I'll take him outside.

412
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,003
Unstoppable.

413
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,431
For two... and another two.

414
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,685
What could I possibly say to him, Tom?

415
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,058
It has to be a miracle, and if he wants
to tell the world about it, he should.

416
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:50,687
I'm left-handed.

417
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,634
- But who would believe him?
- The faithful.

418
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:56,343
No, they won't.

419
00:32:57,224 --> 00:32:58,593
They'll think he's a freak.

420
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:06,323
Tom, every sunday, I stand behind my altar
and proclaim the mystery of faith,

421
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:09,676
a mystery that is at the very center of my beliefs--

422
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,191
death and resurrection.

423
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,631
It happened to me...

424
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:21,724
the night of the hurricane, I was dead,
but God chose to save me.

425
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,421
He's done the same for Lewis in a way
we could never possibly imagine.

426
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,827
But you're not hearing me, father.

427
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:31,709
I need you to tell this boy that
what happened to him is wrong,

428
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:34,115
that it goes against nature.

429
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,831
Believe me, it's in his best interests.

430
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:38,042
People are terrified of what they don't understand,

431
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,287
and they won't understand him.

432
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:42,403
Please, somebody call me on the double dribble.

433
00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:43,411
They'll wanna dissect him.

434
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:47,427
Hell, they'll wanna dissect all of us,
and I cannot let that happen.

435
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:56,796
Perhaps he could be convinced
that this miracle is his and his alone...

436
00:33:58,172 --> 00:34:00,606
A private communion with God.

437
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,872
Or...

438
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:08,917
as a test of his faith...

439
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:15,059
maybe a greater sacrifice is necessary.

440
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh. You know, if you had've just
told me your name

441
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:27,552
in the first place, this would have been a little easier.

442
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:29,802
I couldn't.
We had to know who you were.

443
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:32,627
Ah. So if these things really are changing people,

444
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:34,302
is this, like, the end of the world?

445
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,484
I have no idea.

446
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:38,994
Oh, 'cause I, uh...

447
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,211
spent some time with Russ's ex recently,

448
00:34:42,787 --> 00:34:44,005
and she seemed pretty good--

449
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,290
nicer than she used to be, actually.

450
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,158
So if this has happened to her,

451
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,481
I--it doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing,
does it?

452
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:51,776
I mean, just 'cause something is different,

453
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:53,986
doesn't necessarily make it bad.
It could still be good, right?

454
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:55,511
Well, it wasn't good for me.

455
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:02,279
Pria?

456
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,197
- Russell!
- What's wrong?

457
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:08,428
- She's been shot.
- What?

458
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:11,541
It's okay. It's okay.

459
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:14,666
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

460
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:15,849
Stay here!

461
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:17,721
We gotta get her to a hospital.

462
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:20,781
- I'm all right.
- No, you're not.

463
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:22,764
Please. It's too far.

464
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,792
Pria.

465
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:28,288
I have to show you something.

466
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:36,781
It--it's amazing.

467
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,408
I got so used to the one,
that having two just feels so...

468
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:45,768
abundant.

469
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,443
I am truly blessed.

470
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:50,996
We all are, Lewis.

471
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:53,168
Are you sure there are poachers living here?

472
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:56,484
It looks abandoned.

473
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:01,206
You never know,
and even if there aren't...

474
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:05,852
it's nice to be so close to the water, isn't it?

475
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,948
- It feels good.
- Actually, it does.

476
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:11,920
Water saved my life.

477
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:16,300
- The plane crash, sir?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:22,402
That was a nightmare, Lewis,
but I lived through it.

479
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,345
I survived.

480
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,848
Not that everyone was happy
about that, mind you.

481
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,861
- What do you mean, sir?
- Well, a lot of people resented me...

482
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,795
thought I was a...

483
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,391
I don't know, a freak or somethin'.

484
00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:41,057
The first years, they were the toughest.

485
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:48,142
My "miracle" brought the people
around me a lot of grief.

486
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:49,673
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

487
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:55,241
But maybe my experience...

488
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:03,017
could spare you the same fate.

489
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:18,556
People don't like different, Lewis.

490
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,205
Sir.

491
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,739
It won't be good for you.

492
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:28,086
It won't.

493
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:31,559
When you were in the hospital,

494
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,367
you posted a blog about a skeleton
you found in the water near everglades city.

495
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:36,128
Yeah.

496
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,957
You said it was in the trunk of your car.

497
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,261
It was you.You took it.

498
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:48,204
It looks like the person was killed
by one of these creatures from the water.

499
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:54,945
It's almost 10 years old, which would make it
the first we know of.

500
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,268
I've been reconstructing the skull.

501
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:00,241
It's back there.

502
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,448
Pria!

503
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:08,847
- You see who did this?
- No...

504
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:13,077
but if they know we're here,
they'll be back.

505
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:14,488
- Who?
- Who are you talk--

506
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,164
who's after you?

507
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:18,371
- Who do you think?
- Where are you going?

508
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:21,347
- We'll be in touch.
- Russ. Russ!

509
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:22,639
Dave, we gotta go.
We gotta get outta here.

510
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,428
No, come here. Come here.
You gotta see this.

511
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:36,655
She's given it a face.

512
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,078
This isn't God's plan, Sir.

513
00:38:56,733 --> 00:39:01,074
- How do you know?
- Because he gave me a gift.

514
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,256
That's right, Lewis.

515
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:05,228
- So why do you wanna go against him?
- Go against him?

516
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,973
He took your arm for a reason, son,
to challenge you.

517
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:10,103
It defines who you are now.

518
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,608
Wasn't that his plan?

519
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:17,684
Yeah.

520
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,183
I don't know what to do, sir.

521
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:28,469
I don't know what to do.

522
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:34,908
Listen. Listen.

523
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,155
Then do what's right.

524
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,508
Okay?
