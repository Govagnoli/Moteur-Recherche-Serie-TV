00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:03,043
I don't want to be
a prisoner anymore, Derek.

3
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,198
Do you understand that?

4
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,656
That's why we got
away from Szura. Okay.

5
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,716
You know about
the lights in the water, right?

6
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,322
What's wrong
with the town?

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,684
- I am not an alien!
- Then what are you?

8
00:00:11,876 --> 00:00:14,145
Because we know you've been
different for a long time.

9
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:18,336
Our family is never going
to be the same again, is it?

10
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:19,502
You any closer
to finding Szura?

11
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,722
No. But if I die
before it happens,

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,223
you'll kill him for me,
won't you?

13
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,037
They're supposed to start
school again tomorrow.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,154
Wonder how that's gonna go.

15
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,797
I think I'm pregnant,
you son of a bitch!

16
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,594
Szura, don't lose anymore.

17
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,057
Hey, we found him!
We found Szura.

22
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:05,407
Honey, what bag is the coffee in?

23
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:08,212
Duffel in the back.

24
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,587
I need the keys...

25
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,888
and a map.

26
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:29,164
And I don't have time
to argue about it.

27
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,119
- Good morning, Mar.
- Morning.

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,229
- Did you sleep okay, honey?
- Yeah, all right.

29
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,624
Yeah, not so all right.

30
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:57,695
It's the kids' first day
back at school today.

31
00:01:58,358 --> 00:01:58,860
I know.

32
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:04,356
It'll be the first time in their lives
that I haven't taken them.

33
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:08,676
Well, I'm sure you could have.
Did you talk to Russell about it?

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,415
He wanted to take Rose.

35
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,806
Jesse's not talking
to me right now, so...

36
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,603
Ah, he's just going
through a hard time.

37
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,705
He'll come around.

38
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,153
I tried calling him.

39
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:27,878
And I wrote a little note
for Rose's lunchbox, but...

40
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,310
Why don't you give it to me?
I'll drop it off on the way to work.

41
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,501
I think they feel like
they've lost their mother, Tom.

42
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,743
They haven't.

43
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,907
And if we ever have
a baby of our own,

44
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,140
they'll see you're not
that different after all.

45
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,733
Here you go.

46
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:19,114
Thanks for the ride.

47
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:22,269
You okay?

48
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:27,424
No. I don't know
what I'm doing here.

49
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,204
You've got to go
to school, Jess.

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,684
I'm not talking about school.
I'm talking about here, in this town.

51
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:36,339
If we're really being
overrun by aliens,

52
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:38,910
what are we doing here?

53
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,885
All right.

54
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,899
- You ready for your first day back?
- Yup.

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,457
You might make
some new friends.

56
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:53,662
How will I know?

57
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:54,860
Know what?

58
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,380
When people are, you know,
like mommy.

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,056
Hey, you brush your hair
this morning?

60
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:05,940
Yeah.

61
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:07,629
You still got
a couple knots in it.

62
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,024
You remember we're not gonna talk about
any of this stuff with anyone else, right?

63
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:14,953
We don't want to scare anybody.

64
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,672
But how will I know?

65
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:20,502
You might not.

66
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:26,238
But all you have to worry about
is you right now, okay?

67
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,317
You just be who you are.

68
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,030
All right, come on.

69
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:31,958
Let's go.

70
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,340
Daddy Tom!

71
00:05:02,044 --> 00:05:03,088
Hey, sweetheart.

72
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,159
Hey, how are you?
Hey, Russ.

73
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:06,827
Been workin' in the mines?

74
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:08,726
Russ, this is Ms. Wade.

75
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:10,977
She's gonna be taking over
for mr. Gonzales.

76
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:15,867
Hi. Sheriff Underlay's told me so much
about you and your daughter.

77
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,293
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi.

78
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:18,398
What happened
to mr. Gonzales?

79
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,606
Oh, I'm afraid that
this last hurricane

80
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:24,157
was too much for him,
and he moved up to orlando.

81
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,387
Yeah. Well,
he's gonna be missed,

82
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,713
but ms. Wade here
is gonna fit right in.

83
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:28,759
Can I talk to you a second?

84
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:30,241
Sure.

85
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:30,900
Excuse me.

86
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,997
We haven't found anything
about Christina right now.

87
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:40,947
This isn't about Christina.

88
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:43,645
Eli Szura.

89
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:46,766
You told me
you didn't know who he was.

90
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,544
But the man we met yesterday
from county services,

91
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:51,171
the man that you called
on the radio?

92
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,496
That was Szura, and you knew
exactly who he was.

93
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,376
Szura killed my friend.

94
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:01,034
I better not fd out you had
anything to do with it.

95
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,115
What friend?

96
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,480
What friend, Russ?

97
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:09,103
Daddy?

98
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:30,910
Hello?

99
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:31,924
Hey, Russ.

100
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,247
I'm still at Healy's trailer.
You forget about me?

101
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:35,853
No, I'm on my way
back to you now.

102
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:37,441
I found something...

103
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:39,867
in one of healy's coat pockets.

104
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:40,587
<i>It's a key.</i>

105
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:41,641
A key to what?

106
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:45,781
I don't know. It's got something
engraved on it, though.

107
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:49,809
It says, "h-p-m 2-2-8."

108
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,197
That's for a boat.

109
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:52,182
<i>For a boat?</i>

110
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,935
Yeah, H.P.M. Stands
for highland point marina.

111
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:57,538
Did you know Healy
had a boat?

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,594
No.

113
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,300
<i>Well, why don't we go
down there and check it out?</i>

114
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:03,268
<i>I mean, I don't know
if it's gonna get us</i>

115
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:04,019
<i>any closer
to finding Szura,</i>

116
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,513
<i>but might be a computer
on board or something.</i>

117
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:06,640
<i>What do you say?</i>

118
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:08,566
<i>Russ?</i>

119
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:13,118
Nothing around here is ever
gonna be the same again, is it?

120
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:23,859
I love this town, Lewis,
and I will not let it slip away from me.

121
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:25,587
It won't, sir.

122
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,953
Good always triumphs
over evil.

123
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,735
And which side are we?

124
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,163
Good, of course, sir.

125
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,972
Then how do you explain
Christina Conrad?

126
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,121
She's killed
two people already-

127
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:46,657
not exactly the poster girl
for our future.

128
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,179
We'll find her, sir.

129
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,867
Our people are looking.
Mr. Varon's people are looking.

130
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,107
We'll find her.

131
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,434
Or she'll find us.

132
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:44,596
Just keep it cool.
Get me to an exam room.

133
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:49,440
Good morning, dr. Underlay.

134
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:51,913
Good morning.

135
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,313
Don't stop.

136
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:58,632
- I have to check in.
- No, you don't.

137
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,091
Dr. Underlay?

138
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,037
Do you need some assistance?

139
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:11,416
No, thank you.
We're fine.

140
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,772
Where are we going?

141
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,351
The examination room
is right here. It's here.

142
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:37,289
Get in here.

143
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,370
So if we actually find Szura,

144
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,842
do you have a plan for what
we're gonna do with him?

145
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,193
Russell?

146
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:53,997
I'll have him arrested.

147
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:56,220
I thought you didn't want
the police involved.

148
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,068
Not locally.

149
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,768
We take him to Miami.

150
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,400
How do we know what's going on
here isn't going on there?

151
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,012
I mean, Kira got attacked
in the water.

152
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,462
We thought it was just going
in the glades,

153
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,321
but if these creatures
are in the ocean now, too,

154
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:09,647
I mean,
they could be anywhere.

155
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:11,332
Look, I don't want to think
about that right now, Dave.

156
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,280
I just want to find Szura,

157
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,809
make sure that my kids get through
their first day back at school.

158
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:17,421
Yeah, all right. Fine.

159
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:18,888
228.

160
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:22,094
Well, let's check it out.

161
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:25,530
It's filthy.

162
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,483
- You friends with the owner?
- yeah.

163
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,235
- What's his name?
- Healy.

164
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:44,181
Haven't seen
much of him lately.

165
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,689
I thought he might have
finally taken off for good.

166
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:50,707
You, uh, you really
friendly with him?

167
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,708
You know him well?

168
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,477
We're just neighborly.

169
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,993
Did he ever find that island
he's looking for?

170
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,717
Island?

171
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:02,007
He waslways talking about retiring
to some island in the keys.

172
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,439
Seemed pretty serious
about buying one.

173
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:06,901
- So he was looking for an island?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,467
Sounds like
a pretty good idea these days.

175
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:14,055
Since the hurricane, this place
has gotten too strange.

176
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:26,233
Hey, man.

177
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:27,548
What's up?

178
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:30,643
Nothing.

179
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,684
Where you sittin' at?

180
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,638
Uh, over there
with greg and will.

181
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:39,043
Well, uh...

182
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,033
see ya.

183
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,216
Jesse, right?

184
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,371
- Anyone sitting here?
- No.

185
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,100
- I'm brett.
- I know.

186
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,401
- Strange, huh?
- What's that?

187
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,400
Well, the way things
have changed.

188
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,175
Come on,
you see it too, right?

189
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:42,891
I mean, look at that.

190
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,485
Stephanie Johnson
talking to Weidermeyer?

191
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:46,429
I mean, come on.

192
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,795
Sunglass man?

193
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,930
A lot of these guys didn't hang
out with each other last year.

194
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:54,506
Yeah. It's kind of weird.

195
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:55,738
Yeah.

196
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,461
So your family make it
through the hurricane okay?

197
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:04,757
Because, you know,
a lot of people didn't.

198
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:08,315
Yeah. We made it all right.

199
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,148
What about you?

200
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,146
Not so much.

201
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,331
So are you going to abandon this child
like you did your last one?

202
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:31,223
Well, not to split hairs,

203
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,036
but that baby
wasn't mine anymore.

204
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,142
Because the body I'm in now
hasn't given birth.

205
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,243
Neither has yours,
by the way.

206
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,286
Is that hard for you-

207
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:48,958
pretending that you still love
what used to be your children?

208
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,837
I do love my children.

209
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:54,957
Right. Right.

210
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,389
You just keep
telling yourself that.

211
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:07,950
Leave it!

212
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:10,933
It's my husband.

213
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,837
If I don't answer,
he may show up here.

214
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:14,118
Is that what you want?

215
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,643
Calm and happy.

216
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:25,969
Hi.

217
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,793
Hey, baby.

218
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,247
<i>I got your note to Rose.
You ever reach Jesse?</i>

219
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:30,843
I, um...

220
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,617
I talked to him briefly
while he was on his way to school.

221
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:40,188
Talked to Kira
at the house today.

222
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:42,064
She sounds like she's doing
a lot better now.

223
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,640
Good. Good.

224
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,783
Are you, uh,
all right?

225
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,676
I'm actually just with
a patient right now, Tom.

226
00:14:58,677 --> 00:14:59,647
Can I call you back?

227
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,104
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.</i>

228
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:03,324
<i>Just, uh...</i>

229
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,108
<i>just checkin' in,
tellin' you that I love you.</i>

230
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,408
I love you, too.

231
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,352
Is this how you manage things for the C.I.A.?

232
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:39,527
You have to be flexible, Tom.

233
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,109
If everything goes
according to plan,

234
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,466
Christina will be found.

235
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:47,898
Security on the island
will be improved.

236
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:50,125
I'll continue to isolate
the bad seeds

237
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:51,817
for as long as you think
it's necessary.

238
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,349
I've got Derek patched up.

239
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,357
She tried to kill him.

240
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,591
Some women are fickle
that way, eh?

241
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,688
Russell knows who you are.

242
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,892
He thinks you murdered
some friend of his.

243
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,617
The park ranger?

244
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,731
Yeah, the park ranger who
shares children with my wife?

245
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,323
The park ranger who we're gonna
need to help contain this?

246
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,353
Yeah, that one.

247
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:21,891
- I can contain this.
- No, you can't.

248
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,509
This girl is running arod
killing people in my community.

249
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:27,453
And they're not going to hold
you accountable for that.

250
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,784
They're going to come to me.

251
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,081
I really believe that we can
all work together, Eli-

252
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,097
the people in this town
that have been changed

253
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:42,894
and the people who haven't-
if there's mutual trust.

254
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,172
Feeling better?

255
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,605
Um, yeah. Yeah, much.

256
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,055
Good. Then we should be
on our way.

257
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,020
Great.

258
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:02,849
- Where are we going?
- To find your girlfriend.

259
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,822
She's obviously
very confused right now.

260
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,792
She needs our help.

261
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:08,716
- No. No, she's crazy.
- No, no. She's pregnant.

262
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:13,088
Oh, god!

263
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:14,513
what is it?

264
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,056
I just...

265
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,112
it fee like
it's eating me alive.

266
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:25,478
I mean, it's only been
three weeks.

267
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,612
Have you ever seen anyone
this big after only three weeks?

268
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,386
Who's the father?

269
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,862
She shot me.

270
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:36,521
The bitch shot me, man.

271
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,104
Well, I'm sure
that was an accident.

272
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,022
We'll find her. We'll take
her back to the island,

273
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,187
and before you know it,

274
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,879
you'll be celebrating
the birth of your son.

275
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:50,667
My son?

276
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:52,677
You know it's a boy?

277
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:55,563
Well, no, but we can
always hope, right?

278
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:57,664
Yeah...

279
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,646
I really want to.

280
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,529
You know, I really
want to be a father.

281
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,350
I know.

282
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:05,524
But she's just-
she's just so nuts.

283
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:06,574
She'll be fine.

284
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:09,359
She just needs
a little support.

285
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:11,930
Come on.

286
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,000
How are we gonna find her?

287
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:18,742
The way every other species
finds its way-instinct.

288
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,100
I have no idea
what I'm looking at here.

289
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,716
Satellite photos of the keys
I got from our weather station-

290
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,451
120 miles of them.

291
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:30,490
Yeah, but Szura's here.

292
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:33,143
- He killed Healy here.
- He could be based out there.

293
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,646
You know how many camps
the C.I.A. set up
during the cold war?

294
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:37,545
No.

295
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,640
Hell, the bay of pigs alone
must have had...

296
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,202
What does this look
like to you?

297
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:51,111
A road.

298
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,845
Yeah. What's the date
on that photo?

299
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:55,822
It's november 14th.

300
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,490
I just saw a picture
of that same island.

301
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:02,646
There. Look at that.

302
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:06,385
This was taken in august-
three months earlier. No road.

303
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,273
So this is new.

304
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:12,393
This is a new road...

305
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,238
on what used to be
an uninhabited island.

306
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:31,978
Ready?

307
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,058
Fire away.

308
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:50,069
What is that?

309
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,303
Why is it doing that?

310
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,188
Is it twins?

311
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,866
Triplets?

312
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,507
What's going on?

313
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,124
It looks like
you're having a litter.

314
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,850
if it can happen to me, it can happen to you.

315
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,773
You and the sheriff hooked up
since the hurricane?

316
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,821
What is it about you
that feels the need
to hurt so many people?

317
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,219
I have to replace
your I.V. Bag.

318
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:49,841
It's right across the hall.

319
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,472
Keep the door open.

320
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,637
Wait.

321
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:06,591
Can't you just use this?

322
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:08,050
Sure.

323
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:19,714
Doctor?

324
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:22,719
We need another liter-
standard sux I.V.

325
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,958
Can I see that?

326
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,729
We just need to get
more fluids in you.

327
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,071
So show it to me.

328
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:54,812
Thanks.

329
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:26,852
What's up, guys?

330
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,007
Let's get in there.

331
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,357
Guess we can forget about making
the basketball team this year, huh?

332
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:56,972
Mariel?

333
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:00,085
Dad?

334
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:05,311
What are you doing home?

335
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,626
I came to see you.

336
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,265
No, you didn't.

337
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:12,637
Yeah, I did.

338
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,611
You came home from the middle
of work just to see me?

339
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,358
I came to check in
on you, and-

340
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:20,982
I'm your dad.

341
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,524
What's so weird about that?

342
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:25,598
Well, you've just
never done it before.

343
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,848
Oh.

344
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:32,444
Well, I wanted
your yogurt, too, so...

345
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:39,948
You feeling okay?

346
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,007
Am I gonna have
these scars forever?

347
00:24:47,264 --> 00:24:47,907
No.

348
00:24:49,074 --> 00:24:50,298
They'll go away.

349
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,729
But you're not gonna
do that again, are you?

350
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:57,718
No going in the water.

351
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:00,377
You want to take a swim,
find a pool.

352
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,727
Here, hold this, baby.

353
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:18,146
yeah?

354
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,275
Whoa. Hey, whoa, whoa.

355
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:42,591
Are we gonna need that?

356
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:44,449
Who knows?

357
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:45,866
I'm sure Szura's got one.

358
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:47,916
Did you tell Larkin
that we're going to do this?

359
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:51,185
I told her... that we might
be gone a day or two.

360
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:54,438
No, but does she know,
Russ?

361
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:57,024
She knows...

362
00:25:57,664 --> 00:25:59,130
what's at stake.

363
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,174
Come on, let's go.

364
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,714
We didn't see my dad
for, like, three days.

365
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,662
Filled out police reports,
even hung his picture

366
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,091
on the fence
for the missing.

367
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,843
How did you
finally find him?

368
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,171
We didn't.

369
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:28,140
He just showed up one day.

370
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,014
Acted like
everything was fine,

371
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:32,903
but I could tell
he wasn't the same.

372
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,270
What about, you know,
your mom?

373
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:37,898
No, no. No.

374
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:40,856
In fact, she and my dad-

375
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:44,226
I mean, she can't stand
the way he is now-

376
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,281
always screaming at him,
crying.

377
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,889
Yeah. I stay out of it.

378
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,430
Rarely get home
except to go to bed.

379
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,139
Good news is,
is that we're not the only guys

380
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,761
that feel this way, you know?

381
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:03,950
Couple of guys I hang with,
same thing happened to them.

382
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:05,344
Really?

383
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:09,599
Yeah. Yeah, you know, they're afraid that
if this keeps happening to people,

384
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:12,594
we're gonna end up like-
like shut-outs or something.

385
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,979
I mean, I'm already a minority,
you know what I mean?

386
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:17,476
Yeah.

387
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:19,827
I just think we should
stick together on this,

388
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,360
you know, maybe do something
about it down the road.

389
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:25,093
You know what I'm saying?

390
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,224
I know what you're saying.

391
00:27:39,052 --> 00:27:40,517
Will you be needing
anything else, doctor?

392
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:41,712
No.

393
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:45,562
Thank you.

394
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,288
Hey. What did you do?

395
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:54,524
Nothing.

396
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,745
Just keeping you hydrated.

397
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:00,985
I'm getting...

398
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:02,915
out of here.

399
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,737
You've done something
very stupid.

400
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:09,557
What's in that?

401
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:12,270
What is in that?

402
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,521
Christina.

403
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,201
You okay?

404
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,252
Yeah.

405
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,823
I trusted you.

406
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:35,973
I thought you, of all people,
would understand I'm a pregnant woman.

407
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:36,908
Oh, shut up.

408
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,946
Hey, how many
islands are out here?

409
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,293
Hundreds.

410
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:53,849
Well, then how are we supposed
to find this particular one?

411
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:56,170
Well, I've got
the coordinates.

412
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:58,403
Should be close,
but I don't see a thing.

413
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:00,442
We go too far?

414
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:05,808
No, not according to this.

415
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,214
It's gotta be up ahead.
Speed up a little bit.

416
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:18,808
- You all right?
- Yeah.

417
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:20,682
What the hell was that?

418
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:23,646
I don't know.

419
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,932
Russ, you hear that?

420
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:32,701
Hey.

421
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:48,825
- Russ, what the hell is that?
- I don't know.

422
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:00,873
How you feeling?

423
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:03,174
A little better.

424
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,344
So how was it being back?

425
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:09,344
Weird.

426
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,987
It's a great argument
for homeschooling.

427
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:22,145
You still mad at me
for not telling you
about Mariel and my dad?

428
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:27,170
It's not just
our family, Kira.

429
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,646
It's a lot of people.

430
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:35,248
You know that for sure?

431
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:41,780
Well, at least we know
we're not crazy now.

432
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,045
And maybe my dad
took your mom to the water

433
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,759
so she wouldn't feel alone.

434
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:51,457
What do you mean,
"took her to the water"?

435
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,194
The night of the hurricane.

436
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:55,616
Wait.

437
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:58,117
He took her?

438
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:01,550
I mean, he did this
to her on purpose?

439
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:02,418
No.

440
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:07,020
No, um, I don't think he knew
it was gonna happen,

441
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:08,956
I mean, for sure.

442
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:10,356
But he took her.

443
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:11,391
He...

444
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:15,601
my mother didn't
have to be this way.

445
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:18,744
But he made her this way?

446
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:24,281
Jesse.

447
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:25,949
Jesse, wait.

448
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:36,670
I can't get it from here.

449
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:38,620
So what-what-

450
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:40,368
what do we do?

451
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,126
I gotta go in the water.

452
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,492
What?

453
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:47,500
- What about whatever's in there, man?
- I don't think we have a choice, Dave.

454
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:49,593
- You want to be stuck out here?
- Well, no.

455
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:51,440
You'll go in after me
if there's a problem, right?

456
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:54,456
Yeah.

457
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,140
Yeah, yeah,
of course I would, yeah.

458
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,411
Come on.

459
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,280
Oh! Whoa! Hey!

460
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:56,469
Can you not point
the shotgun at me?

461
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,051
Oh, yeah. Sorry, man.

462
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,736
- What, did you fix it?
- Uh-huh. Look at this.

463
00:33:01,737 --> 00:33:02,563
Check this out.

464
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:03,919
That looks
like a channel marker.

465
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:06,019
What's it doing way out here?

466
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:07,185
That's a good question.

467
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:09,908
- Come on, give me a hand.
- Here, take this.

468
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:22,735
Look at this.

469
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:24,922
It's brand-new.

470
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:25,941
So what's it doing out here?

471
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,060
Maybe to help somebody
find a remote island.

472
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,332
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

473
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:51,413
So... plan on having
any more kids?

474
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:58,025
'Cause if not, if you're
thinking of adopting,

475
00:33:58,518 --> 00:34:01,031
I may have five or six
I could throw your way.

476
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,740
I could just disappear,
you know...

477
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:21,166
if you'd let me.

478
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:23,908
Yeah, I've seen
how you disappear.

479
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:27,279
Christina!

480
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:36,672
What the hell?

481
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:38,730
I knew you were close.

482
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:39,836
I knew it.

483
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,982
See, Derek?

484
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,443
You're like a homing pigeon.

485
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,022
What are you doing here?

486
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:48,227
Waiting for her.

487
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:50,590
I was bringing her to you.

488
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,178
I'm sorry, Tom.

489
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,120
Get them both
out of here now.

490
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:01,622
Hello, Christina.

491
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,536
It's gonna be okay, Chrissie.

492
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:11,269
It's gonna be okay.

493
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:35,975
Hey.

494
00:35:58,185 --> 00:35:59,128
You all right?

495
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,017
What'll happen to that girl?

496
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:11,989
She'll be okay.

497
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,722
Everybody's gonna be okay.

498
00:36:29,122 --> 00:36:31,352
We won't be having
any children, Tom.

499
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,746
I don't know what's growing
inside that girl,

500
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:40,164
but...

501
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:43,642
I don't want
to be a part of it.

502
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:05,979
Whoa. Whoa. There.

503
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:07,933
- What?
- See that?

504
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,365
Yeah, I do.

505
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:14,766
What is that?

506
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,424
Pull over there
by those weeds.

507
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,794
Turn the light off.

508
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,566
That's the island.

509
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:51,413
They got a bonfire goin'.

510
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:54,262
There's a lot
of people on the beach.

511
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:55,412
What are they doing?

512
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:00,275
I don't know.
There's a boat.

513
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,240
Can we get
a hand here, folks?

514
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:25,808
Ladies and gentlemen,

515
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,228
our missing friends
have returned-

516
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,370
Christina and Derek.

517
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:31,908
Who's that guy talking?

518
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,248
Szura.

519
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:42,910
I know this has been
a difficult time
for some of you.

520
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:48,516
We've all been through
an extraordinary experience.

521
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:52,095
We're no longer
who we once were.

522
00:38:52,669 --> 00:38:54,716
We've moved on
from the life we had,

523
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:59,460
left friends
and loved ones behind.

524
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,349
And I know that
many of you

525
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,449
have questions
about your future,

526
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,715
fears... doubts.

527
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:13,947
You all want to know that your sacrifice
has been worth it.

528
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,931
Let me tell you
what I believe.

529
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:26,913
I believe that we are
the seeds of the future

530
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:30,465
that no man could
ever imagine.

531
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,293
But this future
is not guaranteed.

532
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:36,997
There are those who will
oppose it, oppose us.

533
00:39:37,914 --> 00:39:42,946
To reach this future, we will need the strength that comes from our sticking together.

534
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:47,376
Our very survival
depends on our unity,

535
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,165
and that's why I've brought
Derek and Christina back...

536
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:56,250
so that they can be
an example to all of us...

537
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:04,731
to show us the consequence
of going alone.

538
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,265
You killed her!

539
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,275
You bastard!
