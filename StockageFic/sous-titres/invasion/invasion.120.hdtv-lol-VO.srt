1
00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:03,416
I know that there's an invasive species
that's entered the glades...

2
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:07,544
And now is the time for us to rise up!

3
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:11,162
And i'll do anything to protect my family.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,629
Who can tell me what this word means?

5
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,007
She's a very special girl, sir.

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,147
Yes, she is. she's also a very young one.

7
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:21,534
Hey, deputy. If you can hear me,
raise your hand.

8
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:22,516
Oh, my god.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,920
The lights came in during the hurricane, right?

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,260
So wouldn't it stand to reason
if you were a hybrid psychopath

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,362
planning an invasion, you might do it
under the cover of a storm?

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,323
Szura's gone, Russell.

13
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:37,690
I don't know what he's planning,
but i'm gonna need your help to stop him.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,443
- Thank you, miss.
- You're welcome.

15
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:43,018
It's nice to know if i get in trouble again,
you're always nearby.

16
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:46,501
<i>That's right, Paul.</i>

17
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>winds are moving northwest
at 12 miles per hour,</i>

18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,671
<i>and Accutrack is predicting that miranda</i>

19
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,357
<i>could make landfall as early as 8:00
tomorrow night.</i>

20
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:54,341
<i>Well, Larkin, we're hearing up here</i>

21
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:55,922
<i>that some residents of west palm beach</i>

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,581
<i>- are already evacuating.
- That's my understanding, as well,</i>

23
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,555
<i>but even though the national weather service</i>

24
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:02,317
<i>is saying that we'll all be safe down here,</i>

25
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,901
<i>i would caution all Homestead residents</i>

26
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:06,882
<i>to be prepared for anything.</i>

27
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,282
<i>Well, certainly, better safe than sorry,</i>

28
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,452
<i>but right now, i think we can all be grateful</i>

29
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,962
<i>that this time it looks like we dodged a bullet.</i>

30
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:14,661
<i>That's definitely one way of looking at it.</i>

31
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,588
<i>Thanks, Paul.
Back to you.</i>

00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:27,237

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,436
I brought you a doughnut.

37
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:47,227
I'm not hungry.

38
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,317
You left the island.

39
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:54,345
Yeah, it was getting a lile crowded.

40
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:57,478
Coast guard, park rangers.

41
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,628
- Where is everybody?
- Safe.

42
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:00,571
Where?

43
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,511
I don't think I like your tone, Tom.

44
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,231
And I don't like the fact

45
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:05,708
that I sent you people to look after,
and they're dead.

46
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,182
You know, when we first got together,

47
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,450
you promised me the freedom
to do what I needed to do,

48
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,237
and now all you do is second-guess me.

49
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:15,318
- I don't trust you anymore, Eli.
- That's clear.

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,236
And you shouldn't trust me.

51
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,882
- You can't keep me in here.
- Maybe not forever,

52
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,677
but long enough to find out
where you're hiding everyone.

53
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,456
- I told you they're safe.
- No, they're not.

54
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:36,172
These people are a danger to themselves
and everyone around them.

55
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:40,348
Nature will take care of them, Tom.
Nature takes care of everything.

56
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:44,183
Have you seen the news?
There's a storm coming.

57
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:45,602
The experts said
it will land further north,

58
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,265
but we know different, don't we?

59
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,458
Our people will be fine.

60
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:52,600
It's the rest of the town
you should be concerned with.

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,648
This hurricane is gonna make landfall here,

62
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:56,282
and no one's gonna be able to evacuate,

63
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:58,463
because all the roads heading north will be blocked.

64
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:01,990
For our protection, to keep our citizens
from going into a war zone.

65
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,053
Mayor, this will be the war zone.

66
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,252
Miranda's following the exact same path
that Eve did.

67
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,446
Well, that can change.

68
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,812
Do you have any proof to support
what you're saying?

69
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:14,486
None. He has none.

70
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,793
This is mr. Vargas
from the parks department.

71
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:20,196
I asked him to come down here,
see if he could verify any of this for us.

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,596
I, uh, wish I could, but i'm afraid
Russell doesn't share our view.

73
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,877
As a matter of fact, he doesn't even work
for us anymore.

74
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,546
Our chief suspended him
yesterday afternoon.

75
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:35,190
He was concerned that, uh, personal issues
have been clouding his judgment.

76
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,406
I'm not here representing
the department, Frank.

77
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,808
I'm here as a private citizen,
a concerned citizen.

78
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,146
So am I, Russell.

79
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,258
We just got the park back open.
Tourism is finally picking up.

80
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,370
If we do as you say,

81
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,963
we're going to have to close
the whole place down again.

82
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:53,827
And after the economic hit
we all took from Eve,

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,220
does anyone really want this?

84
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,256
If everyone in the park's dead,
it won't matter.

85
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:02,438
Sorry i'm late, mayor.
My deputy's in the hospital,

86
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:04,742
and he asked me to pick up
some storm shutters for him,

87
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,316
but Dixon's was sold out.

88
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,286
- Tom, are you supporting an evacuation?
- Not a mandatory one,

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,026
but I think we should give
people the option

90
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:17,248
and remind them
of the unpredictability of these things.

91
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:20,638
I think that being cautious would be far less damaging to tourism

92
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:24,677
than the sight of a couple hundred bodies
floating past city hall, don't you?

93
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:34,993
I think they were getting ready
to string me up in there. Thanks.

94
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:38,576
- I didn't know you lost your job.
- Well, hopefully it's only temporary.

95
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,402
- I've got szura.
- What?

96
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:43,686
In jail, and I'm going to hold him
through the storm.

97
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,762
Well, what about the missing hybrids,

98
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,546
the people who were on his island?

99
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,202
He won't tell me where they are.

100
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,995
Did he give you any idea about
what he's planning?

101
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:52,565
No, but if I were you,
I wouldn't stick around to find out.

102
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:58,048
- We're already packing.
- You got a place to go?

103
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,783
A little motel I spent some time at
as a kid.

104
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,570
A few hours north of here.
what about you?

105
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,370
I'm gonna try to track down
these people,

106
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,727
- keep 'em contained.
- All right, we'll ben touch.

107
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,232
Kira.

108
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:28,065
Hey, Lewis.
How you feeling?

109
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:32,987
Okay, I think.
How do I look?

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,428
Beautiful.

111
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,016
I really appreciate
you being here, Kira.

112
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,807
Don't understand how this happened.

113
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,947
It happened because people are stupid.

114
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:50,246
- Is your brother okay?
- My brother... Jesse?

115
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,947
He's my stepbrother, and who cares?

116
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:56,957
He's one of the people
who beat you up.

117
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,857
No, he wasn't.

118
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,736
He tried to protect me,
maybe even saved my life.

119
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,325
- But they were his friends.
- No, it was a couple older guys.

120
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:13,245
It was my fault, too.
I trust people way too easily.

121
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:17,960
And check the blood banks.

122
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,761
We ran out of packed cells during Eve.

123
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,502
I want to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

124
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:24,586
- But, doctor, the news said-
- The news is wrong.

125
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,116
- Dr. Underlay, they need you in maternity.
- I'll be right there.

126
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,536
Hey there, doc, they told me
I could wait in here. I hope you don't mind.

127
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:41,416
- Uh, what are you doing with that camera?
- Making a documentary.

128
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,315
- On what?
- The destruction of the entire human race.

129
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:46,677
Smile.

130
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,421
I'm only half kidding.
If this hurricane comes in

131
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,121
carrying anything even close to
what Eve had,

132
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,630
there's gonna be thousands of lights
in the sky

133
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,162
and even more E.B.Es in the water,

134
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:57,410
and I'm gonna catch the whole thing
on tape this time.

135
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,073
I'm not talking about some fuzzy,
black-and-white u.f.o. garbage either.

136
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm talking about full-on, high-def color.

137
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,348
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

138
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,730
Now to kick it off, I thought maybe
you could be my first interview,

139
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,272
- a little human-to-hybrid, you know?
- I'm kind of busy, Dave.

140
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,241
Yeah, yeah, i can see that,

141
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,433
but if this thing hits like i think it's going to--

142
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,417
- Is Rose here?
- What ?

143
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,897
This is her backpack.
Is she here with you?

144
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,602
- No.
- What's this doing here?

145
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,653
Oh, my god.

146
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,997
<i>Are you sure she's still in school?</i>

147
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:04,533
Yes, i just spoke to her teacher.
She's fine.

148
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,202
But she did have

149
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,516
<i>her backpack this morning.</i>

150
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,401
Where's Jesse?

151
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,033
<i>He's at school, too,
but he's on his way here now. </i>

152
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,572
- Have you talked to him?
- Hmm. And Kira's in with Lewis,

153
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:12,793
<i>but i'm scared, Tom. </i>

154
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,178
We have to get Rose.

155
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,212
Dr. Underlay, they really need you
in maternity.

156
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,188
- I'll go. I'll go get Rose.
- Are you sure?

157
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,053
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I can be there in five minutes.

158
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,436
I'll call you soon as I've got her.

159
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,212
Oh, my god, Russell, is Rose okay?

160
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:23,961
<i>For now.</i>

161
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,542
But this backpack thing was obviously done
to send a message.

162
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,491
<i>The weird thing is, underlay told me
he's got szura in jail,</i>

163
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,012
<i>so i don't know who did this.</i>

164
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,133
We have to leave.

165
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,672
<i>We have to get all the kids out of here.</i>

166
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:33,971
The roads are gonna close at 3:00.

167
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,827
Can you be back at the house in time

168
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,672
<i>to make it? </i>

169
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:36,710
Yeah, I think so.

170
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,595
I've just got one more story
I've got to do.

171
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,412
Russell, how can I even think
of leaving here

172
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:47,045
without telling people
what's going on?

173
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,908
There's so many people
that could die in this storm.

174
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,405
But what can you do?

175
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,153
You should have seen the look
on the face of the city council

176
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:55,581
this morning when I was trying
to convince them

177
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,457
that I knew more than
the national weather service.

178
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:59,748
<i>It was crazy.
No one's going to believe you.</i>

179
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,946
I'm supposed to go live at 11:10
from the fairground.

180
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,946
Let me do that, and then
I'll be home at 11:30.

181
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,176
You'll be fired, you know,
if you tell the truth.

182
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,117
There is that possibility.

183
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:12,976
I'll see you soon.

184
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,808
Who can tell me what "character" means?

185
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,890
Jake.

186
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,558
Character means someone
who pretends to be something.

187
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,035
Okay, anyone else?

188
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,748
Rose, what's character?

189
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,355
Someone in a show?

190
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,742
All right, yeah, there are those
kinds of characters,

191
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,885
but what about personal character?

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,795
All of our actions define our character.

193
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,226
We are what we do.

194
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:42,598
That's why it's so import--

195
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:45,155
Hi.

196
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:48,096
I'm, uh, I'm here to pick her up.

197
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,197
Hang on a second.
Excuse me, guys.

198
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,462
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm, uh...

199
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,813
I'm Dave Groves.
I'm Rose's uncle.

200
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,046
- I'm here to pick her up.
- I thought her mother was coming.

201
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,198
Yeah, she was,
but I'm here instead.

202
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,400
- Do you have a note?
- Do I have a note?

203
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,850
Well, we can't let any of the children leave
without proper authorization.

204
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,450
Okay, I know, but she knows me.
I'm her uncle.

205
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,815
But I don't know you.

206
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,336
Okay, well, why don't we call
her mother then, okay?

207
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:15,875
- After class.
- I'm sorry, what?

208
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,126
After I've finished with the class.

209
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,316
You're welcome to take a seat in the back
if you'd like.

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,486
Okay, guys, so if we are what we do,

211
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:30,036
what are the two most important ways
that we can define our character?

212
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,956
How we live...

213
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,516
and how we die.

214
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:19,676
You can't contain the future.

215
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,717
His name is Eli Szura.

216
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:55,948
I want to know how he got out.

217
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,035
You were all here.

218
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:24,272
Mr. Munger, there is blood
on the wall of that cell.

219
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:27,278
How did he manage to do that
on your watch?

220
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,516
He used his elbow, sir.

221
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,083
His elbow?

222
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,975
He scraped his elbow so hard
against the wall that it bled.

223
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:40,428
- And you just let that happen?
- I was...

224
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:46,515
intrigued by it, sir.

225
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,925
- Did you release that suspect from the cell?
- No, sir!

226
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,975
Do you know who did?

227
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:55,985
Deputy?

228
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:58,715
What was his crime, sheriff?

229
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:02,926
His crime, deputy Armis?

230
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,325
His crime was betrayal,

231
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:06,987
and I consider that a very serious offense.

232
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:12,505
Have any of you ever read
"Robin Hood"?

233
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,516
I have.

234
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,290
Then you know that
when Robin is sick,

235
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,948
he goes to his cousin for help,

236
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,458
but Robin's cousin has other ideas.

237
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:26,995
She kills him.

238
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:30,875
All to curry the favor
of a lousy king.

239
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,688
I'm gonna find this man.

240
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,246
And I'm gonna arrest him,

241
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:43,208
and then I'm gonna come back here,
and I'm gonna decide

242
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:47,217
how many of you
I'm gonna hold responsible.

243
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,613
Here you go, Lewis.
Good as new.

244
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,027
- You washed it?
- Well, the hospital did,

245
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,216
but i saved your badge.

246
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:22,666
Are you finished eating?

247
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,778
Yeah, thanks.

248
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:27,706
Shouldn't you be in school?

249
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,913
Yeah, but my dad said
I can hang out with you today.

250
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,785
Actually, he asked me to.

251
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:33,196
- He did?
- Yeah.

252
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:34,876
I don't know what's gotten
into him lately.

253
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:39,505
He's actually been kind of nice.

254
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,066
You look... like an angel.

255
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,535
Hey.

256
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,045
I came to apologize.

257
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:12,658
It's okay, Jesse.

258
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:14,127
No, it's not.

259
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,038
I want you to stay here with Lewis
until your dad gets here, okay?

260
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,767
Okay.

261
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,308
- Kira, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

262
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,597
I didn't really want to be in here
with him anyway.

263
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,448
Okay, guys, 20-minute recess.

264
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,677
Afterward, we are gonna get started
on our dioramas.

265
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,205
- Cool class, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, very interesting.

266
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:43,556
Listen, we're getting out of here.

267
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,817
- Why?
- Becaaue your mom wants you home.

268
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:48,006
- Which home?
- Your dad's home.

269
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,576
But i have school.

270
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,215
I know. You're getting out early today.
Okay?

271
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,995
- Uh, miss, um...

272
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,447
- Ms. wade.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,448
Do you think you could maybe call
her mother now so we can get out of here?

274
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,955
Rose, Rose!

275
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:01,375
She's just going outside.

276
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,196
Look, lady, you can't even hang on
to a backpack.

277
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,796
Why am i gonna trust you with a kid?

278
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:21,873
Hey, hey, listen,

279
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:23,170
we got to go to the hospital
to see your mom, okay?

280
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,086
Mr. Groves?

281
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,023
All right,

282
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,503
now could you please just call
her mother right now

283
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,186
so we can get out of here?
We'll be late.

284
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,687
- Late for what?
- For death.

285
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,931
We have an appointment with death

286
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:35,652
we're gonna be late for.

287
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:37,286
- Am i now speaking a language you understand?
- Okay, what is your problem?

288
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,386
You are. You're my problem.

289
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,105
- Do you treat all the parents this way?
- You're not her parent.

290
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:45,485
And if your sarcasm is meant to be funny, it's not.

291
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,015
Okay, i'm sorry. i'm sorry.

292
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:49,288
But listen to me, ms. Wade,

293
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,345
you are teaching second grade here.

294
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:54,282
I think these kids can put off worrying

295
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,880
about when they're gonna croak for a couple more years.

296
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,755
Okay, my class is not about death.

297
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,483
It's about learning how to live.

298
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,180
So you're one of those "every class is a philosophy class"

299
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,870
kind of teachers?

300
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,573
No, i am one of those "i actually care

301
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:07,387
"about the quality of my students' lives" teachers.

302
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,096
Do you want to know what i think you are?

303
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:11,167
Dave! Yeah?

304
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:13,008
Uncle dave, do you want a cupcake?

305
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:15,573
Cupcakes, that's what you're feedin' them, cupcakes?

306
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,403
No wonder you're teaching 'em about death on a diet like that.

307
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,888
Okay, look, i'm dying, all right?

308
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,665
- What?
- I'm dying.

309
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,522
I have stage iv lymphoma,

310
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:27,456
and i'll be lucky to make it through the semester.

311
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:29,168
You're kidding.

312
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,697
Do i sound like i'm kidding?

313
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:34,565
That's horrible. It's reality.

314
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:36,387
So for as long as i am here,

315
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,318
i want to bring something positive from my experience to these kids.

316
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:42,950
They're gonna lose me,

317
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,487
and i want them to understand why.

318
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:48,570
I don't want them to think of it as some great tragedy.

319
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,197
I want them to be prepared.

320
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:55,135
That's the only way i know how to make sense of this.

321
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:13,186
- So... what's her mother's number?
- I'll dial it for you.

322
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:21,005
- But i don't want to leave.
- We have to.

323
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:21,697
Why?

324
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:24,516
Because this man is making direct threats
against our family.

325
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,657
Well, then why doesn't dad arrest him?

326
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:27,130
He did, but he got out somehow,

327
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,465
and now your father's concerned
that he's gonna come after us.

328
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,025
- Have those extra beds arrived yet?
- Not yet.

329
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,281
Okay, i want you to get on the phone to miami
and find out where they are.

330
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,042
They really don't think we'll be needing them, dr. Underlay.

331
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,345
That is not for them to decide.
Get them.

332
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:43,155
We're leaving from Russell's house this afternoon.

333
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,687
- Dad, too?
- Dad, too.

334
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,911
But if this hurricane's really coming,

335
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:47,255
how can dad just leave town?

336
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:49,078
I mean, isn't he in charge of all that emergency stuff?

337
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,658
Kira, i don't think you're hearing me.

338
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:52,941
This man and a lot of other people like him

339
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:56,216
may be coming after our family. we have to leave.

340
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,405
What about Lewis?

341
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,548
- Well, he'll be fine. He'll be safe here.
- We're leaving him?

342
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,321
Not forever, honey.

343
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:06,275
- No...
- Kira--

344
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:08,807
I won't.
I'm not gonna leave him.

345
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,915
- Kira!
- I'm not going!

346
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:13,876
Kira, come back here!

347
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:58,376
- Lewis.
- sir.

348
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,255
What are you doing out of bed?

349
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,228
It's all right, sir.

350
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:03,767
Any sign of Kira?

351
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,057
No.

352
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,136
Not yet.

353
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,047
But i just got here. We'll find her.

354
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,518
There's a hurricane coming,
isn't there?

355
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:18,765
Yeah.

356
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:23,438
- It's a big one, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

357
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:27,845
Find her, sir.

358
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:35,801
Just give me a minute, all right?

359
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,045
And then we'll be on our way.

360
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,708
- What if they don't find Kira?
- They'll find her.

361
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,697
Tom's at the hospital now. Mariel's got her staff looking.

362
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:44,398
Don't worry.

363
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:47,221
I feel like this is all my fault, dad.

364
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:48,783
If i hadn't gotten involved with those guys,

365
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,463
then Lewis wouldn't be in the hospital,

366
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:52,206
and Kira would be home safe.

367
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,927
Jesse, Kira's got her own issues.
This is not your fault.

368
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,445
Well, do you think she's, like, in love with him?

369
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:04,536
Because i saw her in the room, and she was,

370
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:07,156
i don't know, looking at him like she might be

371
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,475
liking him more than a friend.

372
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,368
- Does that bother you?
- I don't know.

373
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:17,505
Yeah. Yeah, maybe it kinda does.

374
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,578
But i mean...

375
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,635
I don't know. I don't know anything right now.

376
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,038
Jesse...

377
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,553
The next few days may get pretty rough, okay?

378
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:31,865
I'm gonna need you to be there

379
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,686
for your mom, for your little sister,
for Larkin, for everybody.

380
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:39,598
But no matter how hard tngs get,
none of this is your fault.

381
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:47,566
- Well, where are you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be inside.

382
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:00,250
Well, it's nice to see that one person

383
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,066
in this department doesn't think i'm crazy.

384
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,065
Oh, no, i still think you're crazy,

385
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,333
but if they're closing off blackpoint sound,

386
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,378
i figure somebody somewhere knows something.

387
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:11,025
- Who's closing off the sound?
- The chief.

388
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:14,675
Vargas called and said no one would be allowed down there for another 72 hours.

389
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,758
- Because of the hurricane?
- I guess.

390
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,923
This morning vargas said that
no one in the department

391
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,806
thought the hurricane was coming
anywhere near here.

392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,737
- Well, maybe you changed their mind, Russ.
- No.

393
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:26,365
No way.

394
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,857
You're getting out of town, i hope.

395
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:31,881
Yeah, i'm headed up to my sister's in Jacksonville,

396
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,846
even though she's sure it's coming up there, too.

397
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,196
What are you doing with those?

398
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,738
Borrowing 'em.

399
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:46,466
Hey, look, i told you how i feel about all this, Russ.

400
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:47,792
The world is turning.

401
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:49,746
You either go with the flow, or you get knocked off.

402
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:51,082
Vargas has always been a politician.

403
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,486
He's gonna go where the wind blows,

404
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,283
and if the wind is blowing towards the sound--

405
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:56,396
it's gonna be blowing everywhere.

406
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,857
What's so special about the sound?

407
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,352
Yes, ms. Wade. i'm sorry we missed you earlier.

408
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:06,755
But things have just been a little crazy around here.

409
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:10,406
Rose probably won't be back to school until, uh...

410
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,758
um, next week.

411
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,442
But if you give Dave her homework,

412
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,766
we'll see that she gets it done.

413
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:19,898
Great.

414
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,557
Thank you.

415
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:25,846
Should i have told her?

416
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,426
She's got all those kids there.

417
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,647
The schools won't be open tomorrow.

418
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:33,155
That's the one thing we got the mayor to agree to today.

419
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:35,426
What about Kira?

420
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,168
I'm going to go to the house, see if she's there.

421
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:39,102
I've called, Tom.

422
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,356
Maybe she's not picking up.
Meet me at Russell's, one hour.

423
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,108
- Okay?
- What if we can't find her?

424
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:44,336
We have to.

425
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:20,777
Hey, sheriff.

426
00:24:21,883 --> 00:24:23,911
I was just talking with your daughter here.

427
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:25,638
I can see that. Come out of the car, honey.

428
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,636
Unlock the door.

429
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:31,117
She seems pretty upset.

430
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:34,598
Unlock the door, deputy.

431
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:48,427
Go in the hospital and stay there.

432
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:50,175
- But, dad, why--
- Now!

433
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:51,748
Go!

434
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:58,705
What are you doing out here?

435
00:24:58,712 --> 00:24:59,773
I was just taking a break,

436
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:03,307
and then i saw your girl, and she just seemed so sad.

437
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,505
<i>Mr. Munger, are you there?</i>

438
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:12,217
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

439
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:14,626
<i>Mr. Munger, it's Szura. Are you there?</i>

440
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:17,968
<i>Mr. Munger, are you still at the hospital?</i>

441
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:21,015
Yes, Eli. We're still at the hospital.

442
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,327
And i'm coming to get you, you son of a bitch!

443
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,988
Move!

444
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:31,996
Where is he?

445
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:34,806
I don't know.

446
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:37,712
Stop lying. What's he trying to sell you, huh, Munger?

447
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:38,823
He didn't have to sell me anything.

448
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:41,853
- We all saw what happened to Lewis.
- Lewis, what? You blame me for Lewis?

449
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,037
We can't just sit back and wait to become a majority.

450
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:46,091
No one will let us. We have to be proactive.

451
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:49,413
And Szura understands that. Szura will protect his people.

452
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:52,016
- Szura's a madman. He's gonna get us all killed.
- You, maybe.

453
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,017
Where is he hiding the others?

454
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,855
Where is he hiding them?

455
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:01,896
If you want to shoot me, go ahead.

456
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:03,956
You think it'll change anything?

457
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:05,885
You're a dinosaur.

458
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:09,647
You and your family-- all dinosaurs
and all dead,

459
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:11,486
so go ahead, shoot me!

460
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,643
I'll look forward

461
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,667
to rotting with your daughter in the grave.

462
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:23,487
You're not gonna make it that far.

463
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:32,835
We're good. I think that's gonna work great.

464
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:35,256
Hey, we're gonna be on in five minutes, Larkin!

465
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:47,877
<i>Hello. </i>

466
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:49,538
Hey. We're watching.

467
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:50,623
Where are you?

468
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,655
<i>We're on our way home via blackpoint sound.</i>

469
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,283
- What's there?
- That's a good question.

470
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:56,631
The chief closed it off, and i'd like to know why.

471
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:57,847
You're not gonna be late, are you?

472
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:02,385
- No.
- I'm proud of you.

473
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,932
So, Rose, i want you to work on

474
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:11,625
all of your spelling words
while you're gone, okay?

475
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:14,406
And when you come back,
we're gonna have a quiz.

476
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,925
There you go.

477
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,135
- Okay, thanks, ms. Wade.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

478
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:21,155
Come on, kiddo.

479
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,806
Hey, um...

480
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:28,605
You know the storm that's supposed to hit up north?

481
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,196
Um, don't ask me how i know this but--

482
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,326
It's coming here?

483
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,197
Yeah.

484
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,437
Yeah, how'd you know that?

485
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,127
Life is very unpredictable.

486
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:40,057
Yeah.

487
00:28:41,062 --> 00:28:45,595
- Well, nice to meet you mr. Groves.
- You, too, ms. Wade.

488
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,597
Hey, listen, um, actually...

489
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:53,370
Do you mind if i just-- i got my camera...
right here.

490
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,857
- Do you mind if i get a quick shot of you?
- A shot?

491
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,072
Yeah, i mean, you can say a couple words
if you want,

492
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,186
but, um, i'm making a documentary.

493
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,567
About what?

494
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:06,037
Stuff that's, uh,
happening in the town.

495
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,346
Life.

496
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,057
Okay.

497
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,711
Ladies and gentlemen,

498
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,957
the teacher that you wish you'd always had,

499
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,115
but you never got--

500
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:18,905
- What's your first name?
- Erica.

501
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,015
Ms. Erica Wade.

502
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,836
Great, so what should i say?

503
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,775
I don't know. Start with, um...

504
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,140
whatever you want. I don't know.

505
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,923
- Talk about the, uh...
- What, the weather?

506
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:30,510
No, not the weather. That's...

507
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,915
- we got everybody talking about the weather.
- You want to hear a song?

508
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,806
No, no, i don't want to hear a song.

509
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:38,456
You can start with, um...

510
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,527
Uh, i know that you're busy right now,

511
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:45,448
so maybe you could say that

512
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,108
you will let me come back and speak to you another time.

513
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:53,972
And maybe you would let me
buy you a cup of coffee some other time.

514
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:55,128
You could say that.

515
00:29:56,241 --> 00:30:01,340
And maybe you could tell me
that when this storm ends,

516
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,026
you'll promise to keep yourself safe.

517
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,287
How about that?

518
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:07,936
Yes.

519
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:09,386
Yes?

520
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:15,147
Okay.

521
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,168
Lewis...

522
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,288
Lewis, i'm sorry.

523
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:27,643
I'm sorry i've been gone so long.

524
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:28,935
I just needed some time.

525
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,925
I've been praying for you every minute.

526
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,680
You have to go now with your family.

527
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,243
- I want you to come, to...
- I can't.

528
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:37,177
I need to stay here. I'll be fine.

529
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,417
- I don't want to leave you, Lewis.
- You won't be leaving me.

530
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:41,356
I'll be here. I'll be waiting for you.

531
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:44,758
I would wait for you forever.

532
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,857
Kira, we have to go.

533
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:09,856
It's okay.

534
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:12,416
It's okay.

535
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:43,537
<i>Where, as you can see, the wind has picked up considerably,</i>

536
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,610
<i>and though i know you've been hearing reports</i>

537
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,622
that hurricane miranda is expected to make landfall

538
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:48,838
in west palm beach,

539
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:52,426
we're now being told that it is likely to change course

540
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:55,027
and bear down directly on homestead.

541
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,753
<i>Residents should be prepared for sustained winds</i>

542
00:31:57,753 --> 00:31:59,797
<i>of up to 150 miles an hour,</i>

543
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,957
<i>severe thunderstorms and flooding.</i>

544
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,401
<i>I urge you stock up on food, water and supplies.</i>

545
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:06,697
What the hell is she doing?

546
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,126
Cut her off.

547
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:12,057
- There's nothing cued up.
- Go to Paul.

548
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:15,256
<i>Evacuate immediately to one of the shelters up north.</i>

549
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,012
<i>I've got it. I'm sorry, folks.</i>

550
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:18,826
<i>there's obviously been some confusion.</i>

551
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,373
<i>We have absolutely no confirmation whatsoever</i>

552
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,027
<i>from the national weather service</i>

553
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:25,208
<i>that this storm is headed towards homestead.</i>

554
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:27,008
<i>In other news...</i>

555
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,207
Turn if off.

556
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:33,077
Well, at least she got most of the story out.

557
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:34,415
She got the important part out.

558
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,146
Stay here a sec, okay?

559
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,431
Hey, i've done everything you've asked me to do,

560
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,135
but i've got to go, and i need my money.

561
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,175
<i>You'll be paid when this is over.</i>

562
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:49,380
I can't wait that long! i'm not like you people.

563
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,526
I can't just--just go hide out in a swimming pool.

564
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:53,876
Frank!

565
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,308
I'll call you later.

566
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,457
Hey, Russell.

567
00:32:58,221 --> 00:32:59,248
What are you doing here?

568
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,646
Oh, i just came by to see what all the excitement's about.

569
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:06,790
- Who were you talking to?
- Nobody. Let'go.

570
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,645
We shouldn't be here.

571
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,006
What are you talking about, "we shouldn't be here"?

572
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:09,931
- Where are you going?
- The chief says--

573
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,726
The chief says what?
I just talked to the chief.

574
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:15,106
- He didn't order this area closed off, you did.
- Russell--

575
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,831
- No, Frank, no.
- Russell--

576
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:19,555
No, why did you do it, huh,
and who were you talking to?

577
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,827
- Nobody.
- Who were you talking to, frank?

578
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,667
Russell, Russell!

579
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,407
Are you working for Szura, Frank?

580
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:26,918
Is that it? Are you one of them?

581
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:29,151
- Are you one of them, Frank?
- No, no!

582
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:31,126
You are one of them! Are you one them, huh?

583
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,526
I'm... i'm not one of them!

584
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:36,725
Well, then you sold out your own people, you son of a bitch!

585
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:39,643
You like the water? You like how that feels, Frank?

586
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,205
- You like how that feels?
- Dad!

587
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:49,917
What is going on out here, Frank?

588
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,305
Why did you do this?

589
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,346
Look!

590
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,307
Look at what?

591
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,398
Look!

592
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,468
- Are you sure they were all from the island?
- Absolutely.

593
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,648
- What about this Vargas?
- He's on szura's payroll.

594
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,707
He cordoned off the area so no one would find them.

595
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,127
You have to send some of your people out there now.

596
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,710
I'm not sure who i've got left, Russell.

597
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,555
Szura's gotten inside my department, too.

598
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,846
- Well, they can't all be hybrids.
- Was Vargas?

599
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:52,796
When people are afraid, they'll follow anybody.

600
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,330
I don't know who we can trust anymore,

601
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,966
but we haven't got the time to find out.

602
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,768
- You know what we have to do.
- Tom!

603
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,718
We're ready to go.

604
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:05,005
It's the only way, Russ.

605
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:12,357
- Okay, honey. Carlita's okay?
- Yeah.

606
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:13,560
Okay, i just want you to hop in the back.

607
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,807
- Maiel, which car?
- Mine!

608
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,527
Hurry up!

609
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:19,967
Thanks.

610
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:22,146
Hey, mom.

611
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,357
I'm glad we're all going together.

612
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:31,515
Me, too.

613
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,736
- You have to come with us.
- No, i don't.

614
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,812
Nobody's looking for me, okay?

615
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm gonna stay here, put the whole thing on videotape.

616
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,018
- I'm gonna prove to the world that i'm not crazy.
- You could die!

617
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:44,377
We could all die.

618
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:48,118
But i could also save your house

619
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:51,840
and maybe civilization while i'm at it, okay?

620
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,696
So just leave me alone, will you?

621
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:55,085
I'm staying, end of story.

622
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:58,830
Larkin, hey. Let's go.

623
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,381
I got the, uh, most of the back boarded up.

624
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:02,055
Gonna try and catch the front before dark,
all right?

625
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,858
Thanks, dave.

626
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:04,656
I don't want to leave him.

627
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,561
He'll be fine. He can take care of himself.

628
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:08,617
No, he can't.

629
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:13,207
<i>Come on, honey. We have to go.</i>

630
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:15,207
Come on.

631
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,307
All right.

632
00:36:20,283 --> 00:36:22,123
Since Larkin went public, there may be more people

633
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,097
on the main highway than we have time for.

634
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,223
Well, if the access roads aren't blocked,

635
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:26,315
i can get us out through the 'glades.

636
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:28,316
- At least as far as alligator alley.
- We'll follow you.

637
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:29,347
All right.

638
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:41,167
- Hey, dave!
- Yeah?

639
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:46,735
We'll see you soon.

640
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:34,096
Why are we stopping?

641
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:36,778
Because we're getting out.

642
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,033
How much further till alligator alley?

643
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:44,338
Probably another half-hour.

644
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,975
If they just stay on this road,

645
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,168
once they're there, they shouldn't have any problem.

646
00:37:48,173 --> 00:37:49,726
Who shouldn't? What are you talking about?

647
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,896
Larkin, we're not going with you.

648
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,128
- What?
- Tom and i have to go back.

649
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:56,417
Go back?

650
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,986
You're not going back. Szura will kill you.
Both of you

651
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:00,510
No, we talked this through,

652
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,318
and this is the only way. We had to get you guys out.

653
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,160
We had to make sure that you guys got through the roadblocks,

654
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,522
and you're safe, but we're going back.

655
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:09,456
You son of a bitch, i'm not leing you do this to us.

656
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:12,132
I am not letting you do this. You're just two men.

657
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:15,265
Honey, listen to me, it is the only way, okay?

658
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,963
For you, for the kids, for our baby, it's the only way.

659
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,456
No, it's not the only way.

660
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:20,918
You could have told us the truth.

661
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,676
Would you have gone?

662
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,167
What are we supposed to tell the kids?

663
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,317
Tell 'em we love them...

664
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,876
and we love you. That's why we're doing this.

665
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,597
We'll be back.

666
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:49,967
You gotta go.

667
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:51,185
Come on.

668
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,818
All right, let's go!
