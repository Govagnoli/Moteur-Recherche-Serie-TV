1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Previously on "invasion"...

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,740
what's happening to me?

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,490
I believe that we have been chosen

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,590
to rebuild this community as we rebuild ourselves.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,480
Some of us will rise to the challenge. Others won'T.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,970
if the military is working on something secret down here,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,930
I want to know about it.

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,320
I went out on a limb for you.

9
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,710
If you want to be a good reporter,talk to me.

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,330
Just don't tell anyone you're doing it.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,390
You have all been given a second chance on life,

12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,180
and I encourage you not to squander it.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,530
Tom,what the hell does that mean?

14
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,390
What is happening to all these people?

15
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,380
we will all ultimately survive.

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,260
Man,it's hot. How do I get a transfer to glacier national?

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,720
Oh,yeah. I could just see you up there tagging grizzlies.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,880
Just gets hotter out here every year.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,900
we're getting close.

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,810
Well,hello,boris.

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,670
Do you see him?

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,700
Yep.

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,640
Looks like he made it through the storm safe and sound.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,810
Still tagged,still fat and happy.

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,930
Hey,russ.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,700
Check it out!

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,590
Auxilio!

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,470
Auxilio!

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,780
Ayudame,por favor!

30
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,240
Auxilio.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,960
Ayudame.

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,210
Estan perdidos todos.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,130
All right. Here you go,sir.
Just have a seat.

34
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,260
no pude salvar a mi familia.

35
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,060
There you go.

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,410
What did he say? Did he lose his family in the hurricane?

37
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,100
Que paso? Perdiste tu familia en el huracan?

38
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,450
...es de havana.

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,080
He came from havana.

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,030
Anoche vio las luces.

41
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,300
He saw lights?

42
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,220
Luces?

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,730
Eran luces en el agua?

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,300
Lights in the water?

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,180
Y despues?

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,080
No pude salvar a mi familia.

47
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,140
No pude salvar a mi familia.

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,280
what did he say?

49
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,600
He couldn't save his family.

50
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,370
Okay,roosevelt,this is the last bag of ice we have

51
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,160
before jesse brings us some more,okay?

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,100
Okay.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,070
There you go

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,040
you want to try,uncle dave?

55
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,110
Mnh-mnh. No,thanks. I don't want to lose my natural musk.

56
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,490
hey. You ready for my presentation?

57
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,700
Yeah,I kinda gotta work,dave.

58
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,580
This is about your work.

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,520
This is where russell and i spotted our first E.B.E.

60
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,290
What does that mean?

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,850
That is an extraterrestrial biological entity.

62
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,190
Russell thinks it's a fish.

63
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,890
Okay,we'll pretend it's a fish.

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,700
This is russell's ranger station,okay?

65
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,340
This is where he found that bloody air force guy paxton.

66
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,500
This is key largo.

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,960
You saw downed helicopter wreckage,

68
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,530
dead flyers,a hazmat team and a titanium box

69
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,970
being loaded onto the back of a semi.

70
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,950
Yeah,and I saw a hundred more boxes just like it at the air base,

71
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,900
and people may be following me as a result.

72
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,390
And underlay told you that the helicopter

73
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,420
was searching for a missing weather plane,right?

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,480
- Right.
- Right!

75
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,250
Then this is your story.

76
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,970
Weather plane goes down during a hurricane.

77
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,030
Search and rescue helicopter goes out to find it.

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,780
They lower paxton into the water.

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,270
Boom! He's he's immediately attacked by a school of... fish.

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,410
Hearing all this over the radio,

81
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,110
the air force sends out their cleanup crew.

82
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,220
Shocked,they find a dead orange fish at the scene,

83
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,860
and they immediately lock it into a titanium box--

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,210
they very same titanium box that you saw being loaded into the truck.

85
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,510
How do we know that these boxes aren't just holding weather planwreckage?

86
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,970
Hmm?

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,590
I've had a minute to think about it,too.

88
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,990
Maybe we're all just getting ahead of ourselves.

89
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,250
The air force doesn't generally advertise when they lose a plane.

90
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,130
Maybe that's their big secret--they lost a plane.

91
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,340
So,uh,so these guys are following you

92
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,600
because they think you have a tray table?

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,860
I'm not sure anyone was following me.

94
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,470
It could have been your paranoia rubbing off.

95
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,330
Oh,yeah,that'S...

96
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,470
Hey,daddy!

97
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,080
Hey,rose.

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,480
Hey! You're home early.

99
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,750
Yeah,well,I'm not staying long.

100
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,660
I just need to pick up some supplies.

101
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,850
Supplies for what?

102
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,930
Fishing trip.

103
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,940
How can frozen water be so heavy?

104
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,990
do you want to stop by the hospital and say hi to your mom?

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,110
Nah. She'll be busy.

106
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,700
I know she misses you,jess.

107
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,940
whoa!

108
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,140
Hey,marcia and greg.

109
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,070
- You guys need a lift?
- No.

110
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,120
Come on.You're gonna melt.

111
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,850
What do you want,derek?

112
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,280
Just a sense of fulfillment,of helping other human beings.

113
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,450
- That's all.
- Go away.

114
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,210
That's not what you said the other night at the bonfire.

115
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay,fine.

116
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,820
Wait.

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,500
No,it's okay. There's something derek and I need to settle.

118
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,850
Sweet.

119
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,370
stop acting like we slept together.

120
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,440
You embarrsed?

121
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,190
If I'd actually had sex wi you,I'd be embarrassed.

122
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,610
I mean,the night's a bit of a haze,

123
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,750
but I think I'm remember something like that.

124
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,650
Kira,totally straight--

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,440
I woke up that morning feeling like I've never felt before.

126
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,460
Really. Supercharged.

127
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,360
And the last thing I remember was kissing you.

128
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,970
Yeah,right.

129
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,180
No,I'm serious.

130
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,050
It was amazing.

131
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,960
You were amazing.

132
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,780
Whoo!

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,800
derek!

134
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,730
they'll probably let you off with a warning

135
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,960
once they find out who my father is.

136
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
Right.

137
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,060
but in this case,that might not help.

138
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,600
What's the hurry,son?

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,400
Hello,honey.

140
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,210
Hey,dad.

141
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,020
Hello,sir.

142
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,650
Have we met before?

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,470
Dad,he's been over to the house.

144
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,530
Wait in my car for me,honey.

145
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,110
Dad!

146
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,600
I'd like to talk to this young man alone.

147
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,350
I'm not going to give you a ticket,son.

148
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,490
Thank you,sir.

149
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,270
But I am going to give you a warning.

150
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,890
Okay.

151
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,370
I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.

152
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,170
Sir,I--

153
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,620
- hey,she's not your type.
- Oh,we're just friends,sir.

154
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,030
Well,I'm sure you have other friends.

155
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,630
And if you don't,I'll be happy to find some for you...

156
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,950
st not my daughter.

157
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,670
what are you doing here?

158
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,170
What do you mean,what am I doing here?

159
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,840
I wanted to see you.

160
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,520
How did you get in?

161
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,480
Hopped the fence.

162
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,870
I'm sorry about my dad.That was so lame.

163
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,480
No biggie. It happens.

164
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,150
What did he say?

165
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,380
He said I had,um,I had good taste.

166
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,340
No,he didn'T.

167
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,150
So you gonna invite me in?

168
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,250
What if he comes home?

169
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,100
Does he ever come home during the day?

170
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,200
your father said I wasn't your type.

171
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,070
He did?

172
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,170
kira!

173
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,860
Hey,kira!

174
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,230
Get in the closet.

175
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,470
The closet?

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,440
Kira?

177
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,610
kira? Oh.

178
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,730
Hi...

179
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,510
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,330
Uh,what are you doing home so early?

181
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,650
Well,I finished my rounds early today.You okay?

182
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,290
Yeah. Um,I was just resting.

183
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,240
Oh. Okay.

184
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,450
Well,I just wanted to check in.

185
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,590
I'm going to take a quick bath and then go to my meeting.

186
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,540
But I'll be home early,so I'll make us all dinner.

187
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,780
- Okay?
- Great.

188
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,040
- Will you set the table?
- Sure.

189
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,730
Okay.

190
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,520
Well,I guess I'll see you later then.

191
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,620
Right. I'll see you later.

192
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,450
Sorry. My stepmom's been trying to do this dinner thing,like,for a long time.

193
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,760
It was hot in there,right?

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,060
It's hot everywhere.

195
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,940
Look,I,um...

196
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,680
look,I think I should go.

197
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,260
Oh,no,no. You're not going anywhere.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,750
This doesn't feel right.

199
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,060
Sorry,kira.

200
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,150
It felt right a minute ago.

201
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,490
What's wrong with you?

202
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,390
I think your dad was right.

203
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,820
You're not my type.

207
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,550
??

208
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,210
soon as I catch one of these things.

209
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,860
Where you guys going,anyway?

210
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,500
just a little fishing trip.

211
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,940
He's going to look for the lights.

212
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,920
You are?

213
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,470
Yeah.

214
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,850
- Well,can I come?
- No.

215
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,170
- Why not?
- Because,jess,it's just not safe.

216
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,760
Well,why is it safe for you?

217
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,710
Jesse--

218
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,670
dad,I'm not a little kid anymore,you know?

219
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,840
I can help you out.

220
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,700
That's kind of why I'm here,to help you out.

221
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,980
Russell,if he's going,I'm definitely going.

222
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,280
Why don't you l go?

223
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,120
You can take care of each other.

224
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,510
Don't kill it,daddy.

225
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,580
Just catch it.

226
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,570
Before the hurricane,

227
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,930
the biggest challenge I faced was whether to give somebody a crew cut or a trim.

228
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,180
and the only person I ever thought of...

229
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,090
the only person I even worried about was me.

230
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,340
And I was alone.

231
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,750
Now I don't remember exactly what happened the night eve hit.

232
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,640
But I do know that something washed that man away.

233
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,630
Because the man you see before you now,

234
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,910
the man who survived that night knows his life has just begun.

235
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,510
I come in here,

236
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,410
and meeting all of you and hearing all of your stories,

237
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:30,260
I've realized that the only way to truly move ahead

238
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,510
is to do it with all of you.

239
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm just grateful that I'll never have to be alone again.

240
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,990
that was cool,huh?

241
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,540
I'm derek.

242
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm mariel.

243
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,700
I know who you are.I've seen you with kira.

244
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,500
Right. Yeah,we have a couple classes together.

245
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,430
Well,I mean,we did,when there was school.

246
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,620
Right.

247
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,290
Hey,these meetings are really great,hmm?

248
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,890
I,uh...

249
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,850
is this your first one,

250
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,680
or have you--you keep coming back,

251
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,210
or you've been at a couple?

252
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,310
Actually,this is my third.

253
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,670
But I plan on coming to as many as I can.

254
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,970
Yeah. Yeah,me too.

255
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,470
What was your experience?

256
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,980
If you don't mind me asking.

257
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,150
No. Um...

258
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,170
during the hurricane,I was fine.

259
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,850
But almost a week after,something happened,and I,uh...

260
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,270
well,I haven't been the same.

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,800
This is gonna sound really weird,

262
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,640
but do things feel different to you now?

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,470
Like water...

264
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,090
water feels completely different to me now.

265
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,730
It's almost...almost like velvet.

266
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,100
You know,I should be getting home,derek.

267
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,910
Yeah. Sure.

268
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,790
- Thanks for listening.
- Sure.

269
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,880
I mean,it's the first time I've told anyone about any of this.

270
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,540
So...

271
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,430
it helps to talk about it,doesn't it?

272
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,590
Yeah. A lot.

273
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,840
Um,can I...

274
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,390
can I talk to you again sometime?

275
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,260
You know,about...about all this stuff?

276
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,190
Of course. Anytime.

277
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,980
Right. Thank you.

278
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,780
Higher,larkin!

279
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,080
Higher?

280
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,090
Looks to me like you're going pretty high already.

281
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,600
Please? Just one more higher?

282
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,180
Okay.There you go!

283
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,350
Hey,rose?

284
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,680
Let's play something else.

285
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,480
Let's play hide and go seek.

286
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,040
I want you to count to 100 and then find a really good hiding place in the house,okay?

287
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,700
And then,after 100,I'll come find you.

288
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,260
okay.

289
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,920
Okay? One.

290
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,140
Two.

291
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,530
Three.

292
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,490
Who are you?

293
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,740
stop.

294
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,110
Russ,why does this area look so familiar?

295
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,510
This is where that plane went down.

296
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,560
What plane?

297
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,930
There was a crash here in '96.

298
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,290
I was part of the search and rescue team.

299
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
Was that the one with kira's mom?

300
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,590
Yeah.

301
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,560
How did tom live through that?

302
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,410
What,kira's dad was on that flight,too?

303
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,480
Yeah. He was the only one who survived.

304
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,950
- Everyone knows that.
- I didn'T.

305
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,990
- So how'd he make it,dad?
- I don't know.

306
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,300
I remember reading something about him being trapped in an air pocket--

307
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,930
"underlay's miracle in mud,"they called it.

308
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,090
No wonder the guy's so full of himself. He's invulnerable.

309
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,630
hey,jess,slow down.

310
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,960
What is it?

311
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,020
What do you got?

312
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,330
That's it. That's one of them.

313
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,610
There's one. Jesse,get the net.

314
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,100
No,jesse,hold on. Hold on!

315
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,920
where did it go?

316
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,140
I think it's under the boat.

317
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,890
- What?
- shh! Don't move.

318
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,860
There it is!There it is!

319
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,780
Follow it!Follow it! Follow it,foll it,follow it!

320
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,280
Looks really good,honey.

321
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,590
Well,you might want to taste it first.

322
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,250
Kira?

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,800
I met a friend of yours today--derek.

324
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,090
Where did you meet him?

325
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,530
At our support group.

326
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,670
I guess he's been having a rougtime lately.

327
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,780
Since when?

328
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,580
- He hasn't told you?
- No.

329
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,240
But we're not really that close.

330
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,320
At least,not anymore.

331
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,100
Well,that's too bad.

332
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,470
He seems kind of lonely.

333
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,950
How do you know?

334
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,860
I could just tell,talking to him.

335
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,810
Why were you talking to him?

336
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,730
'Cause he's been having a rough time.

337
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,220
Wow.

338
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,400
What?

339
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,250
The kid is something.

340
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,170
You don't even know him,dad.

341
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,810
I'm getting to know him.

342
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,490
Well,hopefully the group will help.

343
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,530
Oh,I'm sure he's just gonna blossom.

344
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,060
What is wrong with you?

345
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,630
Dad doesn't like derek.

346
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,220
No,dad knows derek.

347
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,090
Dad knows derek all too well.

348
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,530
looks like it's slowing down.

349
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,280
- Cut the engine,dave.
- Why I don't i see any lights?

350
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,520
Just cut the engine.

351
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,210
Is it still there?

352
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,230
- Yeah.
- Okay,on three.

353
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,460
One... two... three.

354
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,500
I got it.You got it? You got it?

355
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,030
come on.

356
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,460
Here we go.I got it. Come on!

357
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,860
Damn it,russ!

358
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,660
Is it gone?Did we lose it?

359
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,520
No,it's still there.

360
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,840
I don't understand it.

361
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,630
Russ,russ,russ!It's getting away!

362
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,930
Russ,hold on.Hold on! Hold on!

363
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,870
It's getting away!

364
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,040
No more shooting,russ!You don't wanna shoot it!

365
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,330
Jeez,I think you just missed it,dad.

366
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,650
I don't think so.

367
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,830
did you tag it?That was a tag?

368
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,660
It's not going anywhere without us.

369
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
You tagged it.

370
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,780
- What are you doing here?
- Just hanging out.

371
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,670
Why don't you hang out somewhere else?

372
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,670
I'm not interested in your daughter anymore,sir.

373
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,660
I know that.

374
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,540
But the person you are interested in...

375
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,240
she's not available.

376
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,580
My wife told me you joined her group.

378
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,250
You choose all your wife's friends?

379
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,370
Let me explain something to you,son.

380
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,480
I understand how you feel.

381
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,950
I understand it better than anyone

382
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,940
because I've lived with the feeling far longer than anyone you'll ever meet at that support group.

383
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,150
But let me tell you something else,and this is the really important part.

384
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,390
You don't matter to me at all.

385
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,420
You have zero value in my life.

386
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,720
And where mariel's concerned,

387
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:00,100
the only value that you could ever have is by causing me problems.

388
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,290
And that's not something you want to do.

389
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,680
inhalation therapist to C.C.U.

390
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,420
inhalation therapist to C.C.U.

391
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,610
Hi. Do you know where I can find dr. Underlay?

392
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,800
You need to go to admitting.

393
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,010
No,no,I need to find dr. Underlay.

394
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,300
yes?

395
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,050
mariel?

396
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,010
Oh,my god.

397
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,370
How'd you do this?

398
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,170
I was,um...

399
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,760
I was trying to unscrew a light bulb.

400
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,230
So you're going to the meeting tonight?

401
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,120
- Hmm,I think so.
- Yeah.

402
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,510
Would you mind giving me a lift?

403
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,810
Well,you know,I just don't think I should drive.

404
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,420
we should have found it by now.

405
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,850
we will.We just have to be patient.

406
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,010
As long as there's a signal,we'll catch up to it.

407
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,020
hey,dad,what happened to that old cuban guy you found?

408
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,630
Yeah,what's up with him?
You send him back to havana?

409
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,530
No,mona took him down to the border patrol.

410
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,400
Is he gonna be able to stay here?

411
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,580
I don't know if he'll want to.

412
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,200
You did.

413
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,860
Well,my situation was very different.

414
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,950
What situation?

415
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,170
Dad came here in the boatlift in 1980 when he was only 10 years old...

416
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,000
by himself.

417
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,860
What about your folks?

418
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,140
They were supposed to be on the next boat.

419
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,670
There wasn't one.

420
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,850
- What'd you do?
- Waited.

421
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,460
Yeah,and?

422
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,170
Waited.

423
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,140
this is just like "deliverance."

424
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,740
let's hope not.

425
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,150
Hey,you know,if we don't find the one we tagged,

426
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,330
what do you say,russ?

427
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,000
You want to head out into deeper water tomorrow?

428
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,740
Maybe there's an E.B.E. Mothership out there--

429
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,810
hey,dave,why don't we just stop with that alien nonsense now,okay?

430
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,800
That E.B.E. Word--

431
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,070
why don't you lose it?

432
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,770
It's not a word.It's an acronym.

433
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,010
Yourather is afraid of the unexplained,jesse.

434
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,200
No,his father just doesn't need you explaining.

435
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,730
How about when we find one of these things,

436
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,270
we let science give us an explanation?

437
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,160
You know,every scientist thought the world was flat

438
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,580
until one lone visionary proved them wrong.

439
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,460
- One.
- Which visionary?

440
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,230
Chris columbus--

441
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,770
famed explorer and director of "home alone."

442
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,460
Aristotle proved the wod round.

443
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,390
And he was seconded by the likes of roger bacon and thomas aquinas.

444
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,110
Columbus--he just golost.

445
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,140
But he still managed to wipe out countless native americans along the way.

446
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,980
Okay,fine,both you guys mock me all you want.

447
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,900
When the invaders come a-prodding,

448
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,630
you guys are both gonna know the true meaning of "squeal like a pig."

449
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,660
"the tall black figure was coming her way.

450
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,210
"He was keeping very close to the houses across the street,

451
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,290
"hiding in the shadowy places where there was no moonlight.

452
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,920
"On and on it came,nearer and nearer..."

453
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,100
you said this was scary.

454
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,630
It's not scary.

455
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,490
It seems scary to me.

456
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,430
"On and on it came,nearer and nearer.

457
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,340
"But it was moving in spurts.

458
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,710
"It would stop,and then it would"--

459
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,170
"and then it would move on.

460
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,790
And then it would stop"--

461
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,140
what is it?

462
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,050
is everything okay,larkin?

463
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,700
dad?

464
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,950
Hey,jess.

465
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,610
Why aren't you sleeping?

466
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,650
I don't know.

467
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,470
Why aren't you?

468
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,180
Just thinking about stuff.

469
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,450
Yeah,me,too.

470
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,170
Dave doesn't seem to have a problem.

471
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,630
Why do you think it's so important for him that there be extraterrestrials?

472
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,200
Isn't there enough weird stuff on this planet?

473
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,030
Yeah,I guess he just hates the idea that we could be alone.

474
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,040
Well,we're not alone.

475
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,900
Have you ever really tried to find out what happened to your parents?

476
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,180
Sure.

477
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,580
And?

478
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,060
It's cuba,son.It's a brick wall.

479
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,090
And they were dissidents.

480
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,720
Was it scary for you when you first came out here?

481
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,850
Of course.

482
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,830
Thanks for letting me come out here with you,dad.

483
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,120
You're welcome.

484
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,690
Think you're really gonna be able to bring one of these things home alive?

485
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,440
We'll see.

486
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,240
It may not be so easy.

487
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,780
It looked pretty big.

488
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,110
Did your mom ever mention to y that she saw one

489
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,410
- when she was in the water?
- No.

490
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,270
Think that's why she could be acting so weird?

491
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
Dad?

492
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,040
Looks good.

493
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,200
Oh,yeah.

494
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,860
Nothing like a week's worth of salt in a bowl to really hit the spot.

495
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,440
You want me to make you something?

496
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,250
You?

497
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,330
Hey,back in the day,I made a mean spaghetti.

498
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,920
What days were those?

499
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,680
You're still upset about derek?

500
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,100
Yeah,but for a different reason.

501
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,800
Did you know that mariel's taking him with her to her meeting tonight?

502
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,630
What?

503
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,500
Yeah. She just called and said she bumped into him at the hospital,

504
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,820
so she's not going to be home till after.

505
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,710
What's up with that?

506
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,620
I mean,the guy has been weird since the bonfire,

507
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,300
but what's he doing with mariel?

508
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,880
I just find that so weird.Don't you?

509
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,120
do you need to check in with anybody?

510
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,480
- Your mom or your dad?
- No. No,they're out of town.

511
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,110
- So you're all alone,then?
- I guess.

512
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,880
Well... not anymore.

513
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,690
Derek,you know that I'm a happily married woman,right?

514
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,290
And that I'm twice--or... nearly twice your age.

515
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,490
Of course.

516
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,500
- I'm gonna take you home
- No,no,no,no,no.

517
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,910
Look,there's something I want to show you.

518
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,100
What?

519
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,170
Can we swing by biscayne park?It's right on the way.

520
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,880
- No,it's not.
- It's almost on the way.

521
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,580
Okay?Please.

522
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,960
Well,what's in biscayne park?

523
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,810
The water.

524
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,410
kira.

525
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,590
Dad?

526
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,370
I'm at the church.Mariel's not here.

527
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,710
I need you to tell me about derek.

528
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,730
What do you want to know?

529
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,410
What happened the night of the bonfire?

530
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,220
Dad...

531
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,490
I need to know what happened to derek!

532
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,990
We spent the night on the beach.

533
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,760
- And then--
- what beach? Where?

534
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,640
Biscayne park.

535
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,910
Dad?

536
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,880
Dad?

537
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,800
You ever been here before?

538
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,860
Not for a long time.

539
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,600
It's amazing,isn't it?

540
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,010
You feel it,too?

541
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,610
The pull?

542
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,830
Yeah.

543
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,560
It's hypnotic.

544
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,980
I want to take you in.

545
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,990
Derek...

546
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,200
just for a couple of minutes.Okay? It's okay.

547
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,100
- No.
- Mariel,it's okay.

548
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,970
No,derek,we have to go to our meeting.We're already late.

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,780
- It's okay. Who cares?
- Stop it.

550
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,050
- You want this,too.I know you do.
- Derek,let me go!

551
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,430
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. Come on.

552
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
- What are you doing?
- Why are you fighting me?

553
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,590
Are you okay?

554
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,470
Yeah.

555
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,920
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

556
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,910
Go to your meeting.

557
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,600
Tom...

558
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,010
go,mariel.

559
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,940
We'll be fine. Go.

560
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,200
look,I'm sorry,all right?I'm sorry.

561
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,810
- You like the water,derek?
- No.

562
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,390
- You enjoy swimming?
- No,please--

563
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,600
let's go swimming!

564
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,740
What... that was amazing.

565
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,340
You have a lot to learn.

566
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,910
Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,360
I guess I do.

568
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,450
My wife is not the answer.

569
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,580
- No.
- No.

570
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,710
I won't mess with her.

571
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,130
And I won't go to those meetings anymore.

572
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,670
No,no,no,no,no.

573
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,240
I want you to go to the meeting.

574
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,470
- Oh,yeah?
- Yeah.

575
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,220
And I think with the right guidance,

576
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,300
you could play a valuable role in this community.

577
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,800
- You do?
- Yeah.

578
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,620
Okay. Okay.

579
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,730
Now listen to me.

580
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,360
There's a little work camp down in the glades.

581
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,610
I'm gonna send you there for awhile,all right?

582
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,880
It's gonna sharpen you up a little bit.

583
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,700
And then maybe in six to eight months...

584
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,520
months?

585
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,060
- You want something more permanent?
- No. No,no.

586
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,640
'Cause I think that's the best solution for everybody.

587
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,920
There you go.

588
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,320
what the hell do you think you're doing?

589
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,550
- Nothing. I was just--
- you're trespassin'.

590
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,900
Sir... I'm with the park service.

591
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,390
I tagged a fish last night,

592
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,010
and I just wanted to see if it was in your net.

593
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,310
- Did you do something to my son?
- What?

594
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,820
Stevie!Stevie,get out here!

595
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,150
Sir,could you put the gun down?

596
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,830
You recognize this fella?

597
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,620
What's wrong with him?

598
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,280
He's been like this since he got home this morning.

599
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,580
Stevie,come here.

600
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,900
This man thinks you stole his fish.

601
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,040
Sir,I didn't say that he stole it.

602
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,010
how long was he on the water?

603
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,050
Why is that thing making such a racket?!

604
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,680
I'm talking to you,mister!

605
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,390
drop it!

606
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,460
Drop it,guy!

607
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,760
You drop it!

608
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,620
Russ.

609
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,410
Russell,come on!

610
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,300
I think you'd better get going.

611
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,490
honey? Honey,you up?

612
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,630
Hey.

613
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,840
Yeah,yeah,I've been up for two hours now.

614
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,720
I just dropped rose off at mariel'S.

615
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,290
Why? What's going on?

616
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,680
I got a live shot down at nine mile pond.

617
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,770
Big story--the boats are running again.

618
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,940
How are you guys in all this rain?

619
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,630
It's not raining here.

620
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,580
Is everything okay?

621
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,580
I don't--I'm not sure.

622
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,730
I'll tell you about it when I get back.

623
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,890
- I love you.
- I love you,too.

624
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,550
how'd that thing get away from us,russ?

625
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,270
Damn it,how'd it get away?
