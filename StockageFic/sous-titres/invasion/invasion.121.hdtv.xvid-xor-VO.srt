00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:03,642
A hurricane hit and devastated
my hometown of Homestead, Florida.

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:04,717
There's a storm coming.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:05,752
Our people will be fine.

4
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,861
It's the rest of the town
you should be concerned with.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,087
I know a lot more
than you think I do.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,267
There is blood
on the wall of that cell.

7
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:14,705
I want to know
how he got out.

8
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:17,498
I would wait for you
forever.

9
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:20,915
- What's going on?
- It looks like you're having a litter.

10
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:23,421
- Russell!
- You one of 'em?

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,422
- What's goin' on here, Frank?
- Go ahead and look!

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,453
But I don't want to leave.

13
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:30,257
This man may be coming
after our family.

14
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:31,802
Where's he hiding them?

15
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,772
You and your family-
all dead.

16
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:38,662
We're not goin' with you.
We're goin' back.

17
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:39,893
What are we supposed
to tell the kids?

18
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:42,142
Tell 'em we love 'em.
That's why we're doing this.

19
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,422
Let me out, now!

00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,091
Tighten up your life jackets,
ladies and gents,

25
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,280
because we are going
storm chasing.

26
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,310
As we speak,
hurricane Miranda

27
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:03,583
is just two hours away
from making landfall here.

28
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:06,661
And if history repeats itself,
she won't be coming in alone.

29
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:12,272
During hurricane Eve, thousands of lights
landed in the wat- jeez!

30
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,302
This time,
if the invaders come again,

31
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,262
I'm gonna be there
with this camera,

32
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:20,631
catching the whole thing
on tape.

33
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:24,061
That way, nobody can deny
the existence of extraterrestrials

34
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:25,540
or the fact
that they're in this town,

35
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:26,422
because all the proof
they need

36
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:27,920
is gonna be right here
on the screen.

37
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:35,163
Hello?

38
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,353
Dave, you get
everything boarded up?

39
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:39,921
<i>Yeah. If the roof holds, I think
everything should be okay.</i>

40
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:41,182
<i>You get everyone out of town?</i>

41
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:42,931
Yeah, the family's
headed north.

42
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,122
We're on our way back
down to the sound

43
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,822
to see if we can round up
Szura's hybrids.

44
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,991
Round 'em up?
Round 'em up how?

45
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:48,851
<i>I don't know.</i>

46
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,523
But if they're primed
for some kind of insurrection-

47
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,621
then we'll kill 'em.

48
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:54,532
You hear that?

49
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:57,062
Yeah. Sounds like
a great plan.

50
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:59,301
Listen, stay close to the phone.
We may need your help.

51
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,340
Okay. Hey, Russ,
be careful, all right?

52
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:03,143
<i>You, too.</i>

53
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:04,480
Thanks.

54
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:12,173
- How many were out there?
- At least a hundred.

55
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,270
Maybe more.

56
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,520
And they were just...

57
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:20,183
- sitting underwater?
- Standing underwater.

58
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:21,801
Like an army.

59
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,952
<i>since initial reports had the storm landing
in west palm beach...</i>

60
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:33,201
Not my initial report.

61
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:37,122
<i>So many people in a panic, and many of them
at this hour still trying to find...</i>

62
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:39,691
You did everything
you could, Larkin.

63
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:41,471
You told everyone
it was coming to Homestead.

64
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:42,831
Yeah.

65
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:44,651
How much longer
to the motel, mom?

66
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,272
I'm guessing
at least another hour.

67
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,043
Shouldn't we be
on the main road by now?

68
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,932
I think
this is the main road.

69
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:57,072
- None of the phones are working.
- The towers must be down.

70
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,173
I wanna call Lewis.
I wanna see how he's doing.

71
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm sure he's fine,
honey.

72
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,121
The hospital's probably
the safest place he could be right now.

73
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,151
Yeah, I'd be
much more worried

74
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:06,841
about dad and Tom
than I would Lewis.

75
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,901
Lewis will be fine. He's not
gonna hunt down the aliens.

76
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,281
Mariel, look out!

77
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:18,521
Oh, my god...

78
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:19,821
You okay?

79
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,682
Is everybody okay?

80
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:21,862
- Mommy?
- Are you okay?

81
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:23,601
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I think so.

82
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,240
Rose, you okay?

83
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:26,370
Uh, yeah.

84
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:27,192
We're all right.

85
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:35,850
- Maybe we can move it.
- Well, you're not gonna move it.

86
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,292
Um, Kira, Jesse?

87
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:41,651
Let's see what
we can do with this.

88
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:54,672
Lewis.

89
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:01,310
Oh... hey, guys.

90
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:02,483
What's up?

91
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:03,953
How you feeling?

92
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:05,610
All right.

93
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,822
Little concerned
about the storm, I guess.

94
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:12,271
What's wrong?

95
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,343
You have any idea
where the sheriff is tonight?

96
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:17,211
Yeah, he took his family
out of town.

97
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:18,303
He's back.

98
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:20,561
Sanchez called and said

99
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,471
he came through the blockade
on highway 1 about an hour ago.

100
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,301
Did you try him
on the radio?

101
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,300
We think he killed
deputy Munger, Lewis.

102
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:34,633
We found Munger's body handcuffed
in the passenger seat of his own car.

103
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,303
Someone drove it off
into a flatbed.

104
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,123
He was decapitated.

105
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,432
My god.

106
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,571
Underlay was the last person
with him.

107
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,833
But the sheriff could never
have done something like that.

108
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:49,930
I mean, he couldn't!

109
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:52,302
We think Munger was killed
because he was different, Lewis.

110
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:54,382
Different like you.

111
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,161
And like me and Troy here.

112
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:58,612
The sheriff
is different, too.

113
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,141
Yeah, but he seems
to have forgotten that his job

114
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:01,520
is to protect his people.

115
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:05,511
We think he may have
fallen in with some folks

116
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,251
who don't
want us around anymore...

117
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,671
maybe some of the same folks
who put you in this hospital.

118
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:18,592
I don't believe you.

119
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,593
The sheriff has always wanted everybody
to live and work together!

120
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:23,520
Then where is he?

121
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,711
On a night like this, when his people
and his town need him the most-

122
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:27,603
Where is he?

123
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:33,560
His time has passed, Lewis.

124
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,291
It's time for us now.

125
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:42,230
And it's time for you to decide
which side you're on.

126
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,540
Will you help us find him?

127
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:49,910
I- I don't-I really
have no idea where he is.

128
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,230
Well, then maybe you know
someone who does.

129
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,743
Stupid freaking door.

130
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,772
First aid kit.

131
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,793
Come on, first aid kit.

132
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,473
I'm bleeding to death here.

133
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,053
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:45,503
Who's that?

135
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,270
Vargas-the guy I was
telling you about.

136
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,513
He was here earlier.
I think he's working for Szura.

137
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:52,713
What's he doing?

138
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,671
Standing guard,
I imagine.

139
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,060
Stupid bastard.

140
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,141
Let's go.

141
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:12,191
Looks like someone else
has been here, too.

142
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:20,161
Hey.

143
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,423
Hey, Vargas...

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,912
Was he a friend of yours?

145
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,283
No.

146
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,175
So this is where you saw
all these people in the water?

147
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:39,021
Right here?

148
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,410
Yeah, but I can't
see anything now.

149
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,533
I can't tell
if they're still in there.

150
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:49,252
They're not.
They're gone.

151
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,413
They're gone.

152
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:56,373
Russ.

153
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,033
It's their clothes.

154
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,843
Why would they leave
all their clothes?

155
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,213
Let's go back
in the truck.

156
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,951
Why would these people be
running around without clothes?

157
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:31,681
I'm afraid they may have
changed into uniforms.

158
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:34,991
- Uniforms?
- Military uniforms.

159
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,813
Szura was supposed to be
training these people to reenter society.

160
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:44,223
As soldiers?

161
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,680
The reasoning was that
during the next hurricane,

162
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:52,620
if some of the national guard
were actually hybrids themselves,

163
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:57,730
that it might make the transition easier
for the new people.

164
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,160
Well, you didn't...

165
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:02,813
arm them, did you?

166
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:08,032
Oh, no.

167
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,212
I trusted the man,
Russell.

168
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,461
And in the beginning, he...

169
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:20,403
he didn't give me
any reason not to.

170
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:23,630
Is there anything else that
you'd like to share with me?

171
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,781
Tt's no use, mom.
It's not gonna move.

172
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,751
We just have to
all do it together.

173
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,623
We've tried. It's not working!

174
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,372
Hey!
Hey!

175
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,043
Hey!

176
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:46,412
Larkin!

177
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:49,013
- You folks all right?
- We got stuck.

178
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,613
I don't think we're
gonna get out tonight.

179
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,643
Can you give us a lift?

180
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,211
Pretty crowded back there,

181
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,950
but I think
we can make some room.

182
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:55,723
Great.

183
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,373
You guys get on the truck.

184
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:58,972
Come on. They're gonna
give us a ride.

185
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,923
- What about Carlita?
- We'll take her.

186
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,203
Come on.

187
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,361
Come, honey.

188
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,131
Come on, Rose.
Come on. It's okay.

189
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:19,140
Watch your step.

190
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,550
You better hurry, ma'am.

191
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:41,091
Mr. Szura,
we've got another load coming.

192
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:13,001
- Hey!
- Mr. Groves, I'm Lewis Sirk.

193
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:15,631
- I'm sheriff underlay's deputy-
- deputy, yeah.

194
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,601
Yeah, I know.

195
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,240
Come in, come in.

196
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,810
Come in, come in. I thought
you were in the hospital.

197
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:22,481
Yeah, I, uh,
got better.

198
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,920
This is deputy Buell
and deputy Armis.

199
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,831
I'd shake your hand,
but I'm bleeding here.

200
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,272
Mr. Groves...

201
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:29,163
Dave.

202
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:33,021
Dave, do you happen to know
where the sheriff is tonight?

203
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,140
Yeah, uh...

204
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:39,272
he and, uh, Russell
took everyone up to, um...

205
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:46,193
uh... why?

206
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:47,270
Why do you ask?

207
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,240
Some of our emergency management
folks need to talk to him.

208
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:52,340
Don't you guys
have radios?

209
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:53,952
He's out of range.

210
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,953
Well,
I'll tell you what.

211
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,591
If I hear from him,
I'll let you know, okay?

212
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:03,113
When do you expect
to be hearing from him?

213
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,293
I don't know, really.

214
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:07,442
Maybe I won't. I don't know.

215
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,231
You say he's with
your brother-in-law?

216
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,100
Yeah.

217
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:12,313
Yeah,
they went together.

218
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:13,551
What are they doing?

219
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,770
You know, I don't know what
this is about.

220
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:17,961
What are we talking about?

221
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,193
How'd you hurt your hand?

222
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:27,740
I cut it.

223
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,180
Uh, I cut it on a door.

224
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:32,750
You mind if I take a look?

225
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,380
I used to work
in an emergency room.

226
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,850
Oh, boy,
that doesn't look good.

227
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:47,553
Where is he?
Where is underlay?

228
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,331
- Troy! Troy!
- Stop! Stop! Please!

229
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:50,253
I don't know!

230
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,843
Damn it, man, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

231
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,201
Troy, I think mr. Groves
is telling the truth.

232
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:58,233
Oh, you think so?

233
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,462
You think I'm telling the truth?

234
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:00,751
So I think...

235
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:04,801
that we're all gonna
just wait right here

236
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:07,463
until the sheriff
or this brother-in-law

237
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,322
decides to make contact.

238
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,823
Does that work for you,
mr. Groves?

239
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,232
I don't think we're going
in the right direction.

240
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,692
I think we're headed back
towards homestead.

241
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,721
How far is it
to the shelter?

242
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:49,970
Not sure on that, ma'am.

243
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,061
Well, can I at least
borrow your radio?

244
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,990
Call my husband,
tell him we're all okay?

245
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,653
This only operates
on a special frequency.

246
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:01,710
Won't be of any use to you.

247
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,293
What's wrong with him?

248
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,151
He's a hybrid.

249
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,743
And he knows I'm one, too.

250
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,540
Our best bet is to call
all the different agencies-

251
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:21,880
police, fire,
emergency management-

252
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,603
let them know
what we're really facing.

253
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,083
Won't make a difference tonight.

254
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,503
Everyone thought
the storm was going north,

255
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,742
and that's where they are.

256
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:29,502
They won't be able
to get anyone down here,

257
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,601
because in an hour's time,

258
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,783
there won't be a road
safe enough to travel on.

259
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:34,303
Well, Szura's traveling.

260
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,483
You see the size of those
tire treads back at the sound?

261
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,912
Yeah. Probably got the military
to give him some trucks.

262
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,053
Why would they do that?

263
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,132
Don't they realize
as soon as he's strong enough,

264
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:45,533
he's gonna
come after them, too?

265
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,181
No, I don't think they do.

266
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,450
We should go to your station
and pick up a scanner.

267
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:53,453
If he's running
a bunch of trucks,

268
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,970
he's gotta be
in contact with them.

269
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,133
How about picking up
a truck instead?

270
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:07,563
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

271
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:10,121
I'm sheriff underlay.
This is... deputy varon.

272
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,122
We had a report of some
hazardous materials

273
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:15,083
being transported out of town-
mind if I take a look?

274
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,712
Look, I'm late for a pickup.
We're running hurricane evac.

275
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:30,603
There's nothing here, Russ.

276
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:35,563
- Where you headed?
- Trailer park just north of here.

277
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:37,231
We're gonna try and get those
folks to the high school

278
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,862
before this thing
really comes down.

279
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,271
Which high school's that?

280
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,893
Which high school is that,
soldier?

281
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:48,212
- The local one.
- Which local one?

282
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,292
That shot was
pretty close to me.

283
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:08,532
His would have been closer.

284
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:10,592
Come on.

285
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,260
- Was he a hybrid?
- Yeah.

286
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:20,131
Grab his radio and see if we can
find out where he was going.

287
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,793
How come
he didn't recognize you?

288
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,783
I didn't send everyone
to that island, Russell.

289
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,561
Szura's gathered
a lot of people on his own.

290
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:27,381
Dispatch?

291
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:29,210
I'm a little lost.

292
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,502
<i>You coming in or out?</i>

293
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:33,543
In.

294
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:35,870
<i>All right,
you got a full load?</i>

295
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,801
Yeah, we're full.

296
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:44,343
<i>Okay, then you just wanna
get on 144 going east,</i>

297
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:45,953
<i>and take her
all the way out to the water.</i>

298
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,051
To the water?

299
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,560
<i>Yeah, toward turkey point.</i>

300
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:51,680
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

301
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:54,790
Roger that.

302
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,512
<i>We need help
with unloading.</i>

303
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,242
Okay, everybody out.

304
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,162
Watch your step, sir.

305
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,720
There you go.
Right this way, please.

306
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,250
Ma'am, there we go.

307
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:41,220
Right this way.

308
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,241
Thank you, sir.

309
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,702
That line, please.

310
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:45,782
Thank you.

311
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,100
- Where are we, mommy?
- I don't know.

312
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,880
- What is this place?
- It's a shelter.

313
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:57,821
Here you go, miss.

314
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:00,210
Right this way, please.

315
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:03,082
Right this way.

316
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,103
There you go.
Right in this line right here.

317
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,831
Just get in this line
right here.

318
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:19,191
No, it's okay-
it's all right.

319
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:21,920
Thank you. Here you go.

320
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,683
- Not you.
- What?

321
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,722
- You're going someplace else.
- No, I'm not.

322
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,402
- You're going in this other line.
- Mom?

323
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,300
- Get out of my way.
- Hey, let go of her!

324
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,460
- Get out of my way!
- Let me go! Let me go!

325
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:41,283
- Mommy?
- Let her go!

326
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:42,732
Jesse! Jesse!

327
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,762
- Mommy!
- Rosie! Jesse!

328
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:49,701
- Jesse! Let me go!
- Mommy!

329
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,423
You know, I never really
trusted underlay.

330
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,332
But I've always heard
good things about you.

331
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:59,150
Kira thinks
you walk on water.

332
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,061
Does she know you're
hanging around with these guys?

333
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,241
I'm just doing my job.

334
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,281
Oh, this is your job.

335
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:10,141
This is your job?

336
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,693
Holding innocent people hostage,
that's your job?

337
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,351
Nobody is
holding you hostage.

338
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:16,390
Yeah- look, a crime
has been committed.

339
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,033
We have to find out
who's responsible.

340
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,322
This is a crime!

341
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,313
This-whatever you're doing
right now- this is a crime!

342
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:23,963
Sit down, dave.

343
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:25,252
I don't want
to sit down, man!

344
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:26,891
I always thought it was
good cop-bad cop,

345
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:28,540
but I don't see
a good cop in here.

346
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:30,373
Hell, man, you guys think
I'm the only one

347
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,710
who knows underlay in town?

348
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:32,760
Hell, I-
tell us where he is.

349
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:35,930
Tell us, or I'm gonna rip
your damn throat out!

350
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,052
He killed our friend!

351
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,511
Whoa. Whoa, man.

352
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:46,901
Now, mr. Groves, you will
tell us where he is, now.

353
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,041
He's somewhere on the road.

354
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:50,981
That's all I know.

355
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:58,802
I mean, um...

356
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:03,110
I might be able
to find him for you.

357
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:07,381
There's a satellite phone
in the garage.

358
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:09,952
Maybe I could
call him for you.

359
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:13,481
That sounds like
a great idea.

360
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,580
Let's go.

361
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:19,471
Okay.

362
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,890
I'll go.

363
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:24,503
You stay here with Troy.

364
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,262
You got a problem
with that, deputy?

365
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,511
All right,
where's the phone?

366
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,641
All right, hey,
just chill, man, okay?

367
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,413
Why is it so important that you
find underlay tonight anyway?

368
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:56,510
This hurricane's only getting
worse before it gets better.

369
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:57,782
Can't you wait
till Tomorrow?

370
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,123
- No!
- Why not?

371
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:00,710
Because by tomorrow,

372
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,803
thousands of people are gonna be looking
for clear guidance.

373
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,172
We don't need people
like underlay around,

374
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,361
muddying the water.

375
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,862
Muddying the water?

376
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,050
You got a way bigger problem
than mud, man.

377
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,040
The phone!

378
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,552
It's right there.
It's on the table.

379
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:16,543
Right there.

380
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:28,522
Call him.
Find out where he is.

381
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,483
- Why don't you call him?
- Do it!

382
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:43,833
You know what
his number is?

383
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:12,443
He's got
a whole operation.

384
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:17,471
Genocide under the cover
of a hurricane.

385
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:23,713
If everyone dies,
Szura didn't do it, nature did.

386
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:24,840
We gotta get there.

387
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:26,011
- And do what?
- Stop him.

388
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:27,881
- We gotta get those people out.
- Get them where, Russell?

389
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,052
Where are we
gonna take them?

390
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,362
We have to do
something else.

391
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,303
We have to do
something else.

392
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:43,681
I think we should split up.

393
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:03,093
Okay, everybody out.

394
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,392
Watch your step, sir.

395
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:09,851
Right this way, please.

396
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,712
Step-watch your step,
ma'am.

397
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:18,343
Hey, man. I think
you're in the wrong room.

398
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:23,752
Hey, we didn't
get his I.D.

399
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:54,802
Russell?

400
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:05,952
Mariel, what are
you doing here?

401
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:07,712
We got stuck.

402
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,763
A tree fell on our car,
and the national guard picked us up.

403
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:12,013
They're not the guard.

404
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:13,360
I know. I knew it
as soon as I got in the truck,

405
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,421
but it was too late.

406
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:15,530
Larkin and the kids
are here, too.

407
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:17,463
They're in some warehouse.

408
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,071
- Which one?
- I don't know.

409
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:21,832
They're separating everybody.

410
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:23,862
I was in a long tunnel
with a bunch of other hybrids,

411
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:26,123
and when they saw my I.D.,
they brought me in here.

412
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:38,661
What are we gonna do,
Russell?

413
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:41,053
Listen, Tom's trying to find
the main power station

414
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:42,591
so we can
shut this place down.

415
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:46,243
Then maybe we can find Szura and
create a little uprising of our own.

416
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:49,291
In the meantime,
I want you to take this.

417
00:25:49,476 --> 00:25:51,073
- No, you need it.
- No, you need it more.

418
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,852
Come on, take it, Mariel.
Take it!

419
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,621
Dr. Underlay?

420
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:14,382
- Yes, you are dr. Underlay.
- Who are you?

421
00:26:14,477 --> 00:26:15,993
My name's Szura.
Open this.

422
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,252
Would you mind
coming with me?

423
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:25,823
Where are my children?

424
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:27,691
They're being looked after.

425
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:29,860
I'm not going anywhere
until I see my children.

426
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,123
Your children are fine.

427
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:35,690
There are others who may die if
you don't come with me right now.

428
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:53,401
How long does it take
to make a phone call?

429
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:56,662
Maybe I should go out
and check on him.

430
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,550
I think we can both
go out there, Lewis.

431
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:02,641
Don't bother.

432
00:27:04,948 --> 00:27:06,180
All right,
watch your step.

433
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:11,062
They took my mom away because
of what she is now, didn't they?

434
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:12,850
I don't know.

435
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:17,363
If the phones worked,
we could call my dad.

436
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,611
They took all the phones.

437
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,153
<i>Section two,
report to base.</i>

438
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:25,682
Jesse, you stay here
with your sister, okay?

439
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,991
- Where are you going?
- To get us some help.

440
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,110
Kira, will you come with me?

441
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:34,942
Jesse, don't leave
from this spot, okay?

442
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:43,762
See that guard up there? The one
that was on the truck with us?

443
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:46,393
Yeah.

444
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:50,540
You think you could distract him
long enough for me to get around him?

445
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:51,641
Where are you gonna go?

446
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,550
There's a ranger station about a quarter
of a mile up the road from here.

447
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:55,953
They'll have a radio.

448
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,860
You shouldn't leave.
Rose is scared enough already.

449
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,632
- Let me do it.
- No.

450
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:05,110
Yeah, it's okay.

451
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,233
You create the distraction.

452
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:09,432
I'll get to the station
and call Russell and dad, okay?

453
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,500
Trust me, Larkin,
I can do this.

454
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:14,382
I can do it.

455
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:19,931
Excuse me.

456
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:21,361
Can I help you, ma'am?

457
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,240
Do you know where there's
a restroom I could use?

458
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:25,011
I'm afraid you're
gonna have to wait.

459
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:27,601
Oh... I'm pregnant.

460
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,620
I can see that,
but there's nothing I can do.

461
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,130
Are you telling me
I can't use the restroom?

462
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,442
There's not one
available, ma'am.

463
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:40,741
Are any of you
hearing this?

464
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:41,920
Ma'am.

465
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:44,672
This man is telling me
I can't use the restroom.

466
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:46,022
Ma'am.

467
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,242
I'm a pregnant woman.

468
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:48,911
Don't touch me!

469
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:51,083
Get your hands off me!

470
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,392
I'm a pregnant woman!

471
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:53,921
How dare you touch me!

472
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:56,003
I'm a pregnant woman!

473
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:01,423
Hey! Come back here!

474
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:05,670
Stop!

475
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,923
Hey, I told you to stop.

476
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:16,722
- Dad? Dad! You're here!
- And so are you, honey.

477
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:19,122
Come on!

478
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,302
Yes, thank you, gentlemen.

479
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,022
Take a seat.

480
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:38,541
No, thank you.

481
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:41,713
Please, doctor, I assure you,
this will be very brief.

482
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:48,751
I'm sorry your husband
isn't with us tonight.

483
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,422
- I want to see my kids.
- You will.

484
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,533
Why was I taken from them?

485
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:53,620
'Cause they don't belong
with you anymore.

486
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:56,242
They're not
a part of you anymore.

487
00:29:56,677 --> 00:29:58,491
The sooner you accept that,
the better.

488
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:07,310
What was that?

489
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:08,860
My problem.

490
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:14,421
You see, in most cases,
nature takes care of itself.

491
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:16,162
But this is
a transitional period,

492
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:19,061
and certainly not like any case
that we've ever seen.

493
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:20,562
This situation...

494
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,841
I'm afraid I'm
a little out of my element.

495
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:28,483
Would you mind coming with me?

496
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:32,290
- Where?
- Upstairs.

497
00:30:58,328 --> 00:30:59,262
Is everyone all right?

498
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,340
So far, but we don't know
where Mariel is.

499
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:04,451
They took her away.

500
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:09,372
Yeah.

501
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:10,722
<i>Tom.
It's dave.</i>

502
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:12,131
We got a problem here.

503
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:13,941
Yeah, I got a lot of problems
right now, too, dave.

504
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,252
<i>Two of your deputies came to the
house tonight looking for you.</i>

505
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:17,441
<i>They brought Lewis.</i>

506
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:21,461
- Lewis?
- Yeah, he's okay, though.

507
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:24,352
But these other two guys...

508
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:27,472
these guys aren't so good.

509
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,240
I think they wanted
to kill you.

510
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:31,801
<i>Where are they now?</i>

511
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:33,251
We have the situation
under control.

512
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:34,362
<i>Good, good.</i>

513
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:35,231
<i>Then do me a favor.</i>

514
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:37,703
<i>Tell Lewis to call colonel lopez
at the air base,</i>

515
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,192
<i>and let her know that there's
a major emergency</i>

516
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:41,121
at the wharf.

517
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,100
We need as many soldiers
and trucks and evac equipment

518
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:47,033
as they can spare, or a lot
of people e gonna die.

519
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:49,251
Does this have anything
to do with Szura?

520
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:50,552
<i>Yeah, everything.</i>

521
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,801
<i>But isn't the military
working with him?</i>

522
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:54,461
On the mass murder
of their own people?

523
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:55,791
I doubt that's what
they signed up for.

524
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:58,512
All right, we're on it.

525
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:01,720
Hey, listen, after
this whole thing is over,

526
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:03,912
you gotta give Lewis
a raise.

527
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:06,643
I think he saved
both of our asses tonight.

528
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:09,460
<i>I hope I get the chance.
Talk to you later.</i>

529
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:15,293
I want you
to sit tight in here.

530
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,021
If anybody
should mess with you,

531
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,081
you let 'em know
you're my daughter.

532
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,150
If that doesn't work,
you use that.

533
00:32:26,197 --> 00:32:27,343
All right?

534
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,413
I should have
seen this coming.

535
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:42,502
Foul weather is known
to incite this

536
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,011
in all kinds
of other species.

537
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:46,071
Incite what?

538
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,223
Oh, my god.

539
00:33:58,307 --> 00:33:59,872
Gotta get those women
to a hospital.

540
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:01,993
Come on, you know
that's not possible.

541
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,972
Alma?

542
00:34:09,738 --> 00:34:10,752
What are you doing here?

543
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,262
I'm-I'm having a baby.

544
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:17,022
I can see that, but I thought
your husband wasn't...

545
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,150
She left her husband.

546
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:21,920
Met a new man-
like us.

547
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:24,703
It's only been
three weeks.

548
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,103
I don't understand.

549
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:30,802
I think it's
more than one.

550
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,542
They all
need your help, Mariel.

551
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:47,512
Damn it!

552
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:52,663
I'm worried about Kira.

553
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:54,493
Think she made it?

554
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:56,060
I hope so.

555
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,452
<i>Folks, could you all
to back up a bit?</i>

556
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:01,460
<i>Give us some room here.</i>

557
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:03,592
<i>We're bringing in
some cots tonight</i>

558
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:05,303
<i>so that you guys can be
a little more comfortable.</i>

559
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:08,791
Cots?

560
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:11,031
Right as the storm's hitting,
they're bringing in cots?

561
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:13,013
Where's everybody going?

562
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:17,071
Guys.

563
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,573
Don't move.

564
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:21,171
But he said
to go over there.

565
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:22,031
No.

566
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,262
Don't move.

567
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,290
I treated
a pregnant hybrid woman.

568
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:32,901
And based on what I saw,

569
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:36,490
I'm not certain she could
have survived childbirth.

570
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:38,653
Whatever's inside them-

571
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:42,933
what is inside of them is us
- the future.

572
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:48,001
And tonight, you are
going to deliver it.

573
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:51,353
I can't. Not alone...

574
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:54,420
and certainly not here,
without the proper equipment.

575
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:56,982
Well, I'm sure
we can find you a knife.

576
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,241
<i>mr. Szura?</i>

577
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,223
Yes?

578
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:03,141
<i>Can you get downstairs, sir,
right away?</i>

579
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:07,633
I'll be right there.

580
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,370
Mariel, why don't
you join me?

581
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:18,361
We found him outside.
He tried to get in the back.

582
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,871
What is it about
your choice of men?

583
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:36,703
All right, I have to go.

584
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:37,532
Leave him.

585
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:43,671
Maybe you can assist your
ex-wife in the delivery room.

586
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:05,452
I'm sorry.

587
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,481
I was on my way to find
Larkin and the kids,

588
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:08,991
and I just heard a scream.

589
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:22,313
It's okay.

590
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:32,312
It's gonna be okay.

591
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:42,893
Oh, my god.
