1
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:02,985
It's a large storm.

2
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,614
Lot of wind.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:07,859
Free lights.

4
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:12,032
I saw a bunch of lights
in the sky last night.

5
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:13,288
Can you keep a secret,
honey?

6
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,700
I saw them, too.

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,117
I don't remember
what happened that night.

8
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:18,623
My dad took your mom
to the water

9
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,667
so she wouldn't feel alone.

10
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:22,470
He did this to her
on purpose?

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,050
My mother didn't have
to be this way.

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,823
I guess people
are acting strange.

13
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:29,527
A lot of guys didn't hang out
with each other last year.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,813
I think he knows a lot more
than he's letting on.

15
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,579
I'm gonna find out why
the air force is down here,

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,252
and if there's a cover-up,
who's involved.

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,302
Now you can help me
get the story,

18
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,005
or you can be the story.

19
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,060
It's your choice.

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,934
According to my contact,

21
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,582
they were after
a missing weather plane.

22
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,679
Then what's going on
over there?

23
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,387
Dave thinks aliens
have invaded our town.

24
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:48,844
These creatures take
people's D.N.A.

25
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:50,814
To create a new being,
like a hybrid.

26
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:53,417
- I am not an alien!
- Then what are you?

27
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:54,729
What's going on?

28
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,421
Looks like you're having
a litter.

29
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:58,696
There's something
really not right with the guy.

30
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:02,354
I hope you never get shot,
lewis, but if it should happen,

31
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:03,987
be glad you're in the body
you got right now.

32
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:05,064
It's a hell of an upgrade.

33
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,038
- Why would you wanna kill me?
- You misled us all, Tom.

34
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,956
I'm gonna send you
to a mr. Szura.

35
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:11,545
He runs a little camp
down in the keys

36
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:14,422
for the people just like you
who have lost their way.

37
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,055
A few haven't been
behaving themselves.

38
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:18,347
What are you doing?!

39
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:20,369
But they're not around anymore.

40
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:23,989
I'll do anything
to protect my family.

41
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,693
I don't know who I am anymore.

42
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:26,555
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

43
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:28,608
There's really nothing
to worry about.

44
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:29,947
Everything's under control.

45
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,715

49
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,699
I'm telling you, Russ,
this is a bad idea.

50
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,464
We shouldn't be here.

51
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,423
Trying to find Szura
on our own is crazy.

52
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:44,626
We should go back home,
get some help.

53
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,767
Szura could be gone
by then.

54
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:47,772
Yeah...

55
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,004
but our radio's jammed, Russ.

56
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,150
Our cell phones aren't working.

57
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,175
How we gonna call
the cavalry if-

58
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,933
Look, he murdered two people
last night, Dave.

59
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:55,197
- Did you not see that?
- Of course I did.

60
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,106
I also saw a lot of other people
backing him up.

61
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,328
Look, if you wanna go back
and call for some help, go.

62
00:01:59,412 --> 00:01:59,959
Take the boat.

63
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,611
I'll find him on my own.

64
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:02,755
No, man.

65
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,197
What is the matter
with you, man?

66
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,114
You got a death wish
all of a sudden?

67
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,297
I'm not going back
until I've got some answers.

68
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,770
And if you find Szura,
what are you gonna do then, huh?

69
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:13,375
Huh? You gonna kill him?

70
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,305
What are you gonna do then?

71
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:17,917
That's up to him.

72
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,871
Hey, what if he's got
this whole island booby-trapped?

73
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:27,031
Well, I guess
we'll find out.

74
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,258
I'm telling you, we need
to find a working radio...

75
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,992
so we can at least contact
someone just in case we're-

76
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,714
In case we're dead?

77
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,040
No.

78
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,417
What the hell was that?

79
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,101
It sounded like some kind
of signal call.

80
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:46,999
Oh, great.

81
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,230
"The humans are here."

82
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,866
Aw, man. It's them.

83
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,720
What the hell
happened to her?

84
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:06,704
- She was pregnant.
- Oh, I know...

85
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,179
but what came out?

86
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:29,157
I'm not saying
I won't do it, val.

87
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,115
I'm just saying there might be
more interesting stories to cover.

88
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,560
People already know
that their lights are on, val.

89
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,507
I don't know if that's
necessarily news.

90
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:38,205
All right.

91
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,729
Yeah, I'm about ten minutes from
the plant right now.

92
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,154
Okay, bye.

93
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,601
Are you okay?

94
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,845
You came out so fast,
I didn't see you.

95
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:03,473
You need a doctor.

96
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,770
You can take
a shower now, Jess. I'm done.

97
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:12,083
Thanks, Rose.

98
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,415
What are you doing?

99
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:22,854
I promised Larkin I'd help you
get ready for school.

100
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,057
So what do you
want to wear?

101
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:28,052
I said I can handle it,
Rose.

102
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:29,891
I don't mind.

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,156
Did dad come home
last night?

104
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,482
Nah. Larkin said
he's still working,

105
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,858
so mr. Elmore is going
to take us to school today.

106
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,377
So...

107
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:45,818
basically we have
no parents now, is that right?

108
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,064
That's, uh...

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,064
that's the gun
Tom gave me.

110
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,958
Have you shot it yet?

111
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:06,255
No.

112
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,283
Why did daddy Tom
give it to you?

113
00:05:15,886 --> 00:05:18,252
Maybe he wants to see
if I know how to use it.

114
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,513
She's waiting
in your office, sir.

115
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:29,609
- Did she say what this was about?
- No.

116
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:36,620
- Tom.
- Sabrina.

117
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:40,617
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

118
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:44,343
I heard about your shooting.
You look reMarkable.

119
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,931
Good genes.

120
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,071
But what can
we do for you today?

121
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,545
Well,
this is kind of awkward.

122
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,998
I'd like to keep this
between us.

123
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,206
Always.

124
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:57,194
We had a psych patient
go A.W.O.L. This morning.

125
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,252
He's a young
helicopter pilot,

126
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:01,869
just back
from a long tour in Iraq.

127
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:03,946
We're hoping
you can help us find him

128
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,089
before the media
gets ahold of this.

129
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,200
Do you have any idea
where he's headed?

130
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,651
No, but we think someone
may have picked him up.

131
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:11,803
A couple of our people reported

132
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,922
seeing an old green bronco
near the west gate.

133
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,056
An old green bronco?

134
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,493
- Where are we going?
- To the hospital.

135
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,501
No.

136
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,271
- Your leg is in really bad shape.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

137
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,136
Look, why don't you just
let me off right here?

138
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,606
No, I won't.

139
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:38,195
Well, I am not going
to a hospital. You understand?

140
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,021
Okay. Okay.

141
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,163
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

142
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,188
Just right over to the table.

143
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:50,397
Okay.

144
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,792
Here.

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,133
I'm just gonna go get
the first aid kit, okay?

146
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,477
William?

147
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:32,982
Are you all right?

148
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,849
May I have
a glass of water, please?

149
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,101
Sure.

150
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,034
You think Underlay
knows about this-

151
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:54,581
that Szura's got his own little
hybrid island here?

152
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:55,977
Of course he knows.

153
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,321
I'm sure he sent him
half the people we saw
on the beach last night.

154
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,801
Yeah, but why?

155
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,113
What are they doing?
What's the big plan?

156
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,921
That's what
we're gonna find out.

157
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,456
What is that, barracks?

158
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:16,641
Looks like
an old military base.

159
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,895
Well, where there's
a satellite dish,

160
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,626
there may be a phone.

161
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,445
I guess I missed "robin hood
and the cambrian explosion"
on amazon.

162
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,320
It's the exact same layout
across the hall.

163
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,122
It's like japanese modern
meets the bay of pigs.

164
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,660
It's bizarre.

165
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,327
Hey, Russ. Look at this.

166
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,276
No phone.

167
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:02,925
No internet either.

168
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,463
This is a downlink station,
Russ-

169
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,475
only receives data.

170
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:11,607
Russ, come here.

171
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,696
Looks like they're pirating images
off a satellite grid.

172
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,855
West africa...

173
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,955
brazil...

174
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,328
cuba. You name it.

175
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,059
Look at the water.

176
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,300
They're monitoring temperature.

177
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,867
These are different gradations
in the atlantic currents.

178
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,128
Why do they care about
water temperature?

179
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,348
Maybe they care about
what's in the water.

180
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,312
Let me know
if this is too hot, okay?

181
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,695
You're already healing.

182
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,000
You've gone through some
changes lately, haven't you?

183
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,078
I was a lieutenant
in the air force...

184
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,823
53rd weather recon.

185
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:13,273
You're a hurricane hunter?

186
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,590
My crew was, uh...

187
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,585
stationed out of biloxi.

188
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:23,774
We tracked storms,
mostly in the gulf.

189
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,858
We were sent into the eye
of hurricane eve.

190
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,246
You were on that plane
that went down.

191
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:34,847
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,434
hold on to your hats,
folks! We're going inside!

193
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:44,182
All right,
let's cut her open!

194
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:56,561
drop the sonde
and get us a reading.

195
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:03,307
c- level pressure's
at 9-3-6 kilowatts.

196
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,681
What is going on
down there?

197
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:06,547
She's changed course.

198
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:09,426
No, no, no. I'm seeing something
else, something bigger-

199
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,073
under the water.

200
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,640
My screen's going nuts.
I got lights-

201
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:13,193
thousands of lights!

202
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:13,831
Military?

203
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,904
No! He's-he'S...

204
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,295
oh, my god.

205
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:28,658
I have to go.

206
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:29,951
Why? What's wrong?

207
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,503
Please, I want to help you.

208
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,318
Did they send you?

209
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,268
Do you hit me on purpose
to see what would happen?

210
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:39,646
I don't know
what you're talking about.

211
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,095
Don't lie to me!

212
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,457
'Cause I'm sick
of being lied to.

213
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,797
We won't lie to you,
William.

214
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,019
He's a psych patient.

215
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:04,990
He took off this morning.

216
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,950
The air force asked me
to try to round him up.

217
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:09,251
They mentioned
an old green bronco,

218
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:12,229
so I called your boss at work
to see if you'd shown up, but...

219
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,795
did they ask you
to keep this quiet?

220
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,323
Why?

221
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:19,075
Because he told me
a very different story.

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,618
I think you should hear it.

223
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,220
William?

224
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,978
This is sheriff Underlay.

225
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:29,303
Would you mind telling him
what you told me?

226
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,005
Hi.

227
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,892
You weren't in Iraq,
were you, son?

228
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,878
Willie!

229
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:09,462
What are they doing here?

230
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:10,752
I called them.

231
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,657
Hey, look, guys,
there may have been a mistake.

232
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:13,924
I'm not sure
this is your man.

233
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:15,645
Oh, he's our man, sir.

234
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:19,171
Our colonel
will be very grateful.

235
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:36,365
Jesse?

236
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,240
Hey.

237
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,042
How you feeling?

238
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,292
Okay. Better.

239
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,984
That's good.

240
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,716
Yeah, I never thought
I'd say it,

241
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,492
but I'm actually kind of psyched
to be back at school.

242
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,526
Brace yourself.

243
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:56,599
What do you mean?

244
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,360
It's just
a whole different place.

245
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,300
Nothing is like it was.

246
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:03,756
Hey, man.

247
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,454
Did you sleep in your car?

248
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,017
You did?

249
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:15,734
My dad kicked me out
last night.

250
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:19,252
I left a bowl of soup
on the table,

251
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:20,605
and he told me to hit it.

252
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:23,159
- That's insane.
- Yeah.

253
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,036
His dad's got a little...

254
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:27,955
"hurricane damage."

255
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,005
Yeah, my brother, too.

256
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,776
They both came back
after the storm and were like,

257
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:34,979
"hey...

258
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:38,498
what do we need
our family for?"

259
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,888
I'm just afraid they're gonna
toss my mom out on the street next.

260
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,882
Better than tossing her
in the water.

261
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,413
That's what Kira's dad
did to my mother. Right, Kir?

262
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,805
He didn't do it
on purpose.

263
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:53,152
It just... happened.

264
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,358
Right, it just...

265
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,659
Tom just happened to take my mom

266
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,165
to the water in the middle
of a category three hurricane-

267
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,949
Yeah, just stop it, Jesse.
All right?

268
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,465
Stop it.

269
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,623
See you around, brett.

270
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,875
Sorry.

271
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,805
"survival"-

272
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,250
an elemental word,

273
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,385
yet it means different things
to different people.

274
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,420
To some,
it may imply mere existence.

275
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,782
To others, superiority.

276
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,584
To some, peace.
Others, war.

277
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,786
But to us,
it just means the future.

278
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,619
We've all been changed
for a reason-

279
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,760
a reason that will become
clear to us in the coming days.

280
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:43,674
But for now,

281
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:47,689
it is incumbent that we maintain
our unified community,

282
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,944
that we believe...

283
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,809
well, at least now
we know where everyone is.

284
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,913
When'd they get
an infomercial?

285
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:57,254
And as mr. Szura
writes in his book,

286
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:00,016
there is nothing
more empowering

287
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,538
than taking control
of your destiny...

288
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:03,714
A book?

289
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,454
We were able to adapt...

290
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,352
you think
she's talking about that, um,

291
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,466
robin hood cambrian thing?

292
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:16,354
The cambrian explosion was a time
of massive evolutionary change on the planet.

293
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,570
I mean,
virtually overnight,

294
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,383
all kinds
of new life appeared.

295
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,419
what, do you think
that's what's going on here?

296
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,425
You don't have to be an alien
to wipe out a species, Dave.

297
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,399
Humans are pretty good
at it, too.

298
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,046
We are all here
because we were able to adapt...

299
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,990
so these hybrids're...

300
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:46,622
they're just another
invasive species?

301
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,855
Like the rabbits
taking over australia?

302
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,523
Melaleuca trees
in the glades?

303
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:52,460
That would be
the best case scenario.

304
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,963
What's the worst case?

305
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,349
That they're actually
our next evolutionary upgrade.

306
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:01,644
Like we're neanderthals...

307
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,799
and they're us?

308
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,612
Maybe we should
ask the priest.

309
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,594
Sheriff Tom Underlay.
I'm here to see colonel Lopez.

310
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,106
She expecting you, sheriff?

311
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:31,969
No.

312
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,486
Well, I'm sorry, sir,

313
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,850
- but without the prior clearance-
- Get the clearance.

314
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,981
I'll wait.

315
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,257
Right down the middle.

316
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:45,484
Do it again.

317
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:50,315
- that was short.
- That was short, though.

318
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,566
- There we go.
- Try again.

319
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:55,855
And another score.

320
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:58,586
- All right.
- All right. Cool.

321
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,177
Okay, the kick is up...

322
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,501
Sweet! Extra point
for the head shot.

323
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,939
Man, I'm sorry, dude.

324
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,037
You know, maybe you guys
should play somewhere else.

325
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,098
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,289
Are we bothering you?

327
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,473
'Cause last time I checked,
this was a public place.

328
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:16,870
But if you've got
a problem,

329
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,500
maybe you should
get out of here.

330
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,893
Why don't you just
take it outside?

331
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,963
Damn it, that's my report.

332
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,761
Why don't you
clean that up, man?

333
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,658
What did you say?

334
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,463
You knocked over
the man's drink.

335
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,196
Why don't you clean it up?

336
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,316
Oh, look at this.

337
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,146
- Do you wanna go?
- Come on, bring it, freak.

338
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:50,707
That's enough, guys. You can
either all sit down in here,

339
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,660
or you can sit
with the principal.

340
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:54,297
It's okay, miss Currie.

341
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,026
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.

342
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:04,557
I'm sure
you can all work this out.

343
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,566
Now... who wants to go?

344
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,441
You scream,
and I'll cut your throat.

345
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:23,467
Russell.

346
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,798
- Where's Szura?
- I don't know.

347
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:26,851
Yes, you do. Come on, get up.

348
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,481
You're gonna take us to him.

349
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:35,393
"For as long
as we're the minority,

350
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:36,857
"people will want
to persecute us.

351
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:37,499
"So we must live apart

352
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,925
until our numbers are large
enough to make a stand."

353
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:43,040
What "stand" is your leader
talking about, huh?

354
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:44,822
He's not my leader.

355
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,769
So you're not
one of his little merry men?

356
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:49,492
What's with this whole
robin hood thing anyway?

357
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:52,059
Is he planning some kind of big
"steal from the rich, give back to the poor" raid

358
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,974
or something?

359
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,836
I have no idea.

360
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:56,928
How did you get here?

361
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,590
- The sheriff sent me.
- why?

362
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,001
Because I shot him.

363
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,035
You shot Underlay?

364
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:08,492
How about that?
A fallen priest.

365
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,637
- Why did you do it?
- Because he misled me.

366
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,480
I really believed
that god saved my life

367
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,069
the night of the hurricane.

368
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,356
But now I know differently.

369
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,175
And Tom knew all along.

370
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,478
So what do you think
saved you?

371
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:26,448
Evil.

372
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,840
I don't think he's gonna
like your theory much better.

373
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:36,213
You wanted your man,
I got him for you.

374
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,077
But I'm confused about
a couple things-

375
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:40,095
When did he get back
from Iraq?

376
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,520
A few months ago. Why?

377
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:45,165
Well, you've got
such a small hospital here,

378
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,653
I figured, you know, you'd send
him to the V.A. In miami.

379
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:49,990
Is this what you came here
to discuss, sheriff?

380
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:51,710
Major.

381
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:53,500
Excuse me?

382
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,549
Well, if you're gonna
make this formal,

383
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,245
I retired as a major,
colonel.

384
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:02,941
I did a little research
on the way out here.

385
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,980
Lieutenant William Blount
was a sonde operator

386
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:08,029
for a c-130 weather plane
out of biloxi.

387
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,998
That plane disappeared
during the hurricane,

388
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:11,682
and you yourself
told me that

389
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,992
you sent a search and rescue
team to look for them,

390
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:16,790
which was also lost.

391
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,488
Three crewmen died.

392
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:19,459
Yeah,
and a fourth managed

393
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,588
to find his way to a ranger
station in the glades,

394
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:23,429
half bleeding to death
because he was attacked

395
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,657
by something in the water.

396
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:26,935
His name was Paxton,
and when I told you that

397
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:28,201
he was at homestead hospital,

398
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:32,998
you asked to help get him
back to you, which I did.

399
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,575
- What happened to that man, colonel?
- That's classified.

400
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:41,699
You also told me that you were worried
about bad publicity then, too.

401
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:44,753
But I don't think you need to worry
about the press anymore.

402
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,863
I think you should be
far more concerned about me.

403
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,462
How many more crew members
from that weather plane

404
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:55,467
do you have
locked in this place?

405
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,635
All of them.

406
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,770
If we move a couple of ICU nurses into ER,

407
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,266
we should be covered
for tonight.

408
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,752
I'll see who's on call.

409
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:14,978
Hey, Kira.

410
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:16,668
Why aren't you in school?

411
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:19,279
It's lunch. Got a sec?

412
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,735
- What's up?
- I'm worried about Jesse.

413
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:30,152
I saw him this morning.

414
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:33,940
Has he said
anything to you?

415
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,041
About what?

416
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,528
I told him about
how dad took you to the water

417
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,189
the night
of the hurricane.

418
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:44,219
He's pretty upset about it.

419
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:47,748
He thinks that
dad did it on purpose...

420
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:51,122
to make you,
you know, like him.

421
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:57,693
When did you
tell him this?

422
00:23:58,411 --> 00:23:59,774
Yesterday.

423
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:01,421
I thought he already knew.

424
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,460
I was actually trying
to make him feel better.

425
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,954
I'll talk to him.

426
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:13,630
Can you do it soon?

427
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:16,122
'Cause things are really weird
at school right now.

428
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,440
Kids I hardly know
are coming up to me

429
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:21,708
and asking me
which side I'm on.

430
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,363
"Which side"?

431
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:25,468
Yeah.

432
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:27,785
I'm just worried that Jesse's

433
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,043
in such a bad place right now,

434
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:32,722
that whatever side he chooses
is gonna be the wrong one.

435
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,748
That's Szura's tent,
but he may not be here.

436
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:42,782
He comes and goes
to the mainland a lot.

437
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,790
There's no guards.

438
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:46,217
No vehicles either.

439
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:48,329
There still may be
a phone, though.

440
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,168
I don't care
about a phone, Dave.

441
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,447
I want Szura,
and I want him now.

442
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:55,894
Just follow me
and be quiet.

443
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:16,502
I don't think
he's here.

444
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:47,644
He's got
Underlay's whole life in here.

445
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,790
The guy's a big fan.

446
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,320
Oh, wow. It's a war room.

447
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,186
He's got maps
of every county in florida.

448
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,575
Has Szura told you
what he and Underlay

449
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,651
ultimately hope to achieve here?

450
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:17,016
No.

451
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,055
How many people
are on the island?

452
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,581
I don't know. A hundred?

453
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:30,662
What does he think he's gonna
do with a hundred people?

454
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:33,787
I think evolution might be
a little too slow for this guy, Russ.

455
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:35,763
I think
Szura might be planning

456
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,715
a little cambrian explosion
of his own.

457
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,273
What are you talking about?

458
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:47,133
Russell believes that
what's happened to you,

459
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:48,597
what's happened
to all these people,

460
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:52,163
may be some kind
of radical evolution.

461
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:54,767
I'm sure you have
some quibble with that, but...

462
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:56,704
I... I never even
considered it.

463
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:58,244
Well, I'm not surprised.

464
00:26:58,448 --> 00:26:59,924
Oh, no, no. I...

465
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:00,572
I'm not one of those people

466
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:02,180
who believe that
god and evolution

467
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:04,113
are mutually exclusive.

468
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:05,286
Like everything else
in the universe,

469
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:10,151
I believe that evolution
was part of god's plan.

470
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,230
But...

471
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:14,181
could it really be possible?

472
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,752
At this point,
I wouldn't rule out anything.

473
00:27:16,756 --> 00:27:17,889
Hey, Russ.

474
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:18,874
It's a phone.

475
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,030
It's a sat phone.

476
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:27,454
Look, if we call in the troops,
there's no going back.

477
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:29,340
The world's gonna know
about everything

478
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,082
that's happening in our town.

479
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:34,247
Mariel, Underlay...

480
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:37,041
you...

481
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,372
we're gonna have news crews

482
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,858
as far as china
tearing our community apart.

483
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:44,385
And my kids...

484
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,134
they may lose
their mother for good.

485
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:52,012
We don't have a choice,
Russ.

486
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:53,680
He's killed
too many people.

487
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,136
Make the call.

488
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:03,530
Come on.

489
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:07,880
He could back here
any second.

490
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,653
You don't really wanna
face off alone with him.

491
00:28:16,866 --> 00:28:18,306
<i>Yes, islamorada station?</i>

492
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:21,928
Yeah, this is florida parks
ranger Russell Varon.

493
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:26,468
I need immediate
coast guard assistance.

494
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:30,532
Well,
thank you, miss Hundeen.

495
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:33,976
And again,
I'm so sorry about all this.

496
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:37,058
It's all right. We've all been
under a lot of stress lately.

497
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,140
The transition's
been tough on everyone.

498
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:40,634
But we're gonna move on now.

499
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,863
Right, Jesse?

500
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:47,178
What about the other kids?
Scott and greg-

501
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:48,531
aren't you gonna
talk to them, too?

502
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:49,991
Of course.

503
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:53,073
But from what I understand,
they didn't initiate this.

504
00:28:53,074 --> 00:28:54,313
That's not true.

505
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,573
So not fair.

506
00:28:58,676 --> 00:28:59,565
Why did this happen?

507
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:02,354
Because they're
hybrid bastards, mom.

508
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:04,874
And it wasn't our fault.

509
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:06,230
What were they doing?

510
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:07,756
Acting...

511
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,070
like they were
better than us,

512
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,819
which, well, I guess is true.

513
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,654
Right, mom?

514
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:14,651
I mean, isn't that why
Tom made you one?

515
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:17,883
Tom didn't
make me anything.

516
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:20,630
Oh. Right, I forgot.

517
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,790
You're on the other side now,
so...

518
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:25,218
how am I ever gonna get
a serious answer from you?

519
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:26,799
Hey, Jesse! Come here.

520
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,752
- I am on your side.
- No, you're not.

521
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,455
You're not even my mother.

522
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:38,054
Your husband killed you.

523
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,623
So do me a favor.
Okay, Mariel?

524
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:44,198
Do me a favor
and-and-and stop pretending

525
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,537
that anything's ever
gonna be the way it was again.

526
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,099
Because it can't be.

527
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:53,939
You're not my mother.

528
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:12,477
You may find what I'm about
to show you disturbing.

529
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:16,196
But I promise,
we're all patriots here.

530
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,545
I've seen those boxes before
at the site of your downed...

531
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:32,815
chopper.

532
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:40,042
Would you like to know
what's in them?

533
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,690
Sergeant, could you bring one
down to the lab for us, please?

534
00:30:48,824 --> 00:30:52,681
Did you know
those two kids that Szura shot?

535
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:54,039
Not really.

536
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,209
The young woman
was pregnant.

537
00:30:58,663 --> 00:31:00,697
Why would he kill
a pregnant woman?

538
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:03,247
If his goal
is to build a majority,

539
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:05,770
wouldn't he want all the people
here having babies?

540
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:07,151
Yeah.

541
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:09,451
That might not be
on his timetable right now.

542
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:11,040
Or Underlay's.

543
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:15,359
It's hard to lead an army while
you're pushing a baby carriage.

544
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:16,656
Hey, they're here.

545
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,533
Why are there two boats?

546
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,472
Who's that guy
in the little one?

547
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:37,447
Szura.

548
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,477
How long has
this operation been running?

549
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:48,529
Since '96.

550
00:31:49,518 --> 00:31:52,067
That's the same year
your plane crashed, isn't it?

551
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:56,537
So you've been aware of these
changes in people since '96?

552
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,539
Well, not at this level.

553
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,150
It's grown over time.

554
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:01,743
With each new hurricane,
we've learned more.

555
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,290
But when we found the crew
from this weather plane

556
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,550
and discovered that
they were all still alive...

557
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:11,440
well, you can imagine
how excited we were.

558
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,340
Oh, my god.

559
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:09,044
What are you doing
with them?

560
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:11,014
Testing them.

561
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,236
And they've been
incredible.

562
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:16,692
They've shown
reMarkable resiliency.

563
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:19,958
Like you,
after the shooting.

564
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:24,130
They really are
amazing creatures.

565
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:29,162
They aren't "creatures."

566
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,449
I'm sorry, Tom.

567
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:32,679
I meant no disrespect.

568
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,103
A lot of our funding
has gone into testing,

569
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:38,558
but even more
has gone into cleanup.

570
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,583
In order to keep a project
of this size under wraps,

571
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:42,579
we've had to cover
a lot of ground.

572
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:45,567
And... as I guess you know,

573
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:49,048
each new being leaves
a rather large footprint.

574
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:04,290
Thank you, sergeant.

575
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:09,354
It's a lot to comprehend,
isn't it?

576
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:14,713
So you knew
about me since '96?

577
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:18,138
No, we just
found out recently.

578
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,669
I've always considered you
a loyal partner, Tom.

579
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:23,871
But you have to understand

580
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,452
why certain factions wouldn't
want to bring you into this.

581
00:34:27,586 --> 00:34:29,059
What factions?

582
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,659
Just know that everything
that is happening here

583
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,924
is in the best interest
of the american people
and your community.

584
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:39,278
I am my community. What
factions are you talking about?

585
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:44,394
The ones that would have you in here,
if you push this.

586
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,727
- You mr. Varon?
- Yeah.

587
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:03,059
We got your call.

588
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,761
What are you doing
with him?

589
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:08,048
We picked mr. Dennison up
on the other side of the island.

590
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:08,882
"Dennison"?

591
00:35:08,883 --> 00:35:10,484
Murder's a pretty
serious charge, sir.

592
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,223
And if one of his people
has committed a crime-

593
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:13,783
He committed the crime.

594
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:15,419
His name's not Dennison.

595
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,839
It's Szura.

596
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,653
I'm afraid
you're wrong about that, sir.

597
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:20,474
Mr. Dennison
runs a relief center here

598
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:22,607
for the victims
of the recent storm.

599
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:26,562
Were you a victim
of the recent storm, lieutenant?

600
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,214
Where are these bodies
you called in about?

601
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:45,815
They were right here.

602
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:51,601
They were right here!

603
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:54,467
You know, ranger,

604
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,351
I think the best thing
you can do right now

605
00:35:56,352 --> 00:35:59,888
is to go home, take care
of your family and just let

606
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:02,986
the people who know what's best
for the community do their jobs.

607
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:08,974
What community is that?

608
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:12,554
What community?

609
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:15,043
The community that supports
the killing of innocent people?

610
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,557
The community that would take
a mother away
from her own children?

611
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:20,252
That community?

612
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:22,067
A community like him?

613
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,399
Are you like him,
or are you just on his payroll?

614
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:27,050
Because either way,
you're no better than he is.

615
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:34,096
Will you be needing
an escort, mr. Varon?

616
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:36,778
Why don't you let him
come with us?

617
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:38,527
It's all right, Russell.

618
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:42,998
Whatever happens,
it's all right.

619
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,917
So, father...

620
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:12,621
perhaps you'd like
to stop by my house
for a little confessional.

621
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,873
Mrs. Wade says you're doing
very well in spelling.

622
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:21,912
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

623
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:22,956
And I got
all my words right.

624
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,286
All your words?

625
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:27,944
The hardest one is
"united states,"

626
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,184
because it's actually
two words.

627
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,856
That's great, Rose.

628
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:34,014
I bet your dad is
gonna be so proud of you.

629
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,073
What was that?

630
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:44,091
Rosie, I want you to go inside
and wait for me, okay?

631
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:45,991
And I will be right there.

632
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:08,962
Jesse?

633
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,998
What are you doing?

634
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,463
Shooting.

635
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:17,111
I'm not too good, but...

636
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:22,096
Where did you get
that gun?

637
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:24,627
Daddy Tom.

638
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,240
Tom gave you that?

639
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:30,496
Yeah.

640
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,163
Wasn't he thoughtful?

641
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:36,483
You've been in a fight.

642
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:39,246
And you've been drinking.

643
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:43,728
What are you shooting at?

644
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,196
These are pictures
of your family.

645
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:10,116
Not my family.

646
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:10,926
Jesse!

647
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:14,140
No. You're more my family
than they're my family.

648
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,397
And you're not even my family.

649
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:17,200
You're just my dad's wife.

650
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,506
Give me the gun.

651
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,022
No way.

652
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:23,398
Now!

653
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:25,710
I'm sorry.

654
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,976
You can have the beer,
but...

655
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,196
the gun's mine.
