Previously on "Invasion"...

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:04,341
There's a huge storm coming, 
and he's still not home.

3
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:06,310
How was I ever married to this person ?

4
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:07,977
As a storm gathers...

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,954
My pregnant wife shouldn't be covering hurricanes.

6
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:10,786
Talk to your brother ?

7
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:12,233
He's with your kids at the house.

8
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:15,220
- I've been through hurricanes before.
- Not like this one, you haven't.

9
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:16,438
These families prepare...

10
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:18,351
I have a right to know my children are safe.

11
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,453
They're our children !

12
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:20,856
Rose isn't here.

13
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:21,809
Rose !

14
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,407
Why don't you go home and  
worry about your new husband

15
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,810
and leave us alone ?

16
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:28,653
But can this family survive...

17
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:30,441
Rose !

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,862
What lies ahead ?

19
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:34,611
Mariel ?

20
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:36,601
What's happening to me?

21
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,143
Did you see the lights ?

22
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:40,468
Where'd you see them ?

23
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:42,429
Will you tell me what's going on here ?

24
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:44,099
Mommy ?

25
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:46,337
You smell different.

26
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:50,558
First days are the toughest.

27
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,287

31
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,013
Yeah ?

32
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:28,791
Hi, daddy.

33
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,214
Hey, honey.

34
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:32,621
What are you doing ?

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,212
Feeding carlita.

36
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:36,367
What are you doing ?

37
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:39,022
Nothing. I, um...

38
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,619
I'm just getting ready to go out back to work.

39
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,881
Mommy and daddy Tom aren't home yet,

40
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:47,251
and Kira and Jesse are making dinner.

41
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:48,930
So I thought I'd ask you.

42
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,587
Yeah, go ahead. Ask me what ?

43
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,754
Are there monsters ?

44
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:02,574
No.

45
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,012
Are you sure ?

46
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:08,126
'Cause you know those lights I saw in the sky

47
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,121
during the hurricane, 
the ones that went into the water ?

48
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:11,971
Yeah ?

49
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,835
I thought they might be monsters.

50
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:17,854
They weren't monsters, Rose.

51
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,396
Then what were they ?

52
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,220
How do you explain the unexplainable ?

53
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:29,365
One family's devastated while 
another gets through this without a scratch.

54
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:31,755
Hurricanes kind of havea mind of their own.

55
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,242
We didn't ask to be hit this hard.

56
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:35,876
Frankly, we didn't expect to be.

57
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,755
But we're grateful the damage 
is nothing like what we saw

58
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,628
with andrew back in '92.

59
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,854
Uh, Mr. Mayor, we heard rumors of a quarantine.

60
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,231
We're still working on all this.

61
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:50,841
Aside from the damage to the hospital,

62
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,655
we've received reports of chemical and fertilizer plants opening up

63
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:56,774
as well as contaminants found in the water supply.

64
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,277
Now when you consider that 
we still have hundreds of people missing--

65
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:02,904
no one has authorized an actual quarantine yet--

66
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:05,290
just a few checkpoints here and there.

67
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:07,090
Russell ?

68
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:09,386
Yeah, Dave ?

69
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:10,933
Have you checked out that skeleton I found yet ?

70
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,536
I'm on my way to do it right now.

71
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,499
Oh, you moved it ?

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,600
No, I took your car.

73
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:16,942
Out into the hurricane slop.

74
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:18,174
Dave, who cares ?

75
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:19,907
I do, Russ.

76
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,015
It's a collectible.

77
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,452
Good-bye, Dave.

78
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,427
Would you support a quarantine, doctor ?

79
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,322
Doctor ?

80
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:36,531
I was the one who originally suggested it.

81
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,469
Sheriff, will your office be coordinating the relief effort--

82
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,977
search and rescue, military ?

83
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,786
Everyone will be working together on this,

84
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,394
but my office will run point, yes.

85
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,323
Over here.

86
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,223
So you'll be in charge ?

87
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,915
God's in charge. I just handle the paperwork. 
Yeah ?

88
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:53,554
Sheriff, when can we expect to have 
electricity and running water again ?

89
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:54,970
You'll be the first to know.

90
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,252
Hey, your dad likes being on tv, doesn't he ?

91
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,083
He always says, "presentation is everything."

92
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:02,903
Rose, do you want some more juice ?

93
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,032
No, thanks.

94
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:05,405
Dr. Underlay,

95
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,644
We understand that you went through 
quite an ordeal the night of the storm--

96
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,318
13 hours in biscayne bay ?

97
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:11,935
That's right.

98
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:12,900
How are you feeling ?

99
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,002
Under the circumstances, pretty fortunate.

100
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:16,297
Rose, aren't you hungry ?

101
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:17,844
I miss mommy.

102
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:21,096
She's right there, rose.

103
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:23,670
...operation center set up...

104
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,447
No. She's not.

105
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,540
Pretty scary night for you, too, sheriff.

106
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,761
Your wife's very lucky.

107
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:33,344
She's a survivor.

108
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,006
Dr. Underlay ?

109
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,624
- What is the extent of the damage in the hospital ?
- Larkin ! Larkin !

110
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,697
Stay back behind the yellow tape.

111
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,647
Dave, I'm working.

112
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:47,309
This quarantine will kill us. 
We'll be completely cut off.

113
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,724
It hasn't even happened yet, okay ?

114
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:51,379
And even if it does, the hurricane relief groups  
will still have access, all right?

115
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,816
The hurricane is not our problem.

116
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,050
Dave, you're my brother--

117
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,654
and I love you, but I am tired,

118
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:00,497
I'm pregnant, and you're medicated.

119
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:01,989
Will you please go back to your room ?

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,596
No.

121
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:05,050
Nurse, could you make sure he gets back to his room, please ?

122
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:05,772
You suck.

123
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,511
Russell will be here to pick you up in the morning.

124
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,721
Fight the power, Larkin.

125
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:10,933
Fight the power !

126
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,319
.. major roads and some major highways will have their lanes reversed

127
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,443
to handle the evacuation traffic.

128
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,322
State officials hope to avoid a repeat of the mess

129
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,342
that occurred with hurricane Floyd in 1999.

130
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:33,919
- You know his name ?
- No

131
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,030
- Any I.D. ?
- None that I could find.

132
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,079
- What was he doing at your place ?
- I have no idea.

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,900
Coming through ! Right over here.
Follow me. Come on.

134
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,627
Our temp E.R.Is right over here.

135
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,448
Coming through !

136
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,321
One, two, three.

137
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:19,778
How did this happen ?

138
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,149
Hey, Russell ? 
Baby, you there ?

139
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,148
Hey, honey.

140
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,098
Where are you ?

141
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,223
I'm at the hospital.

142
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:53,658
Why ?

143
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,354
I just found some guy in my station who was...

144
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,217
who was cut up real bad.

145
00:08:58,218 --> 00:08:59,589
Who is he ? 
Is he gonna be okay ?

146
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:00,662
I'm not sure.

147
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,735
Listen, is the generator in the shed ?

148
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:04,819
Don't...

149
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,623
- Don't go to the shed.
- Why not ?

150
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,240
Because it's dark down there.
I just don't want you by the water.

151
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,764
It's dark in the house.
I need power. I need to work.

152
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:15,889
Can you just grab a flashlight
and go in the bedroom ?

153
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,270
I'll be home as soon as I can.

154
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,239
Flashlight's not gonna run my computer.

155
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,916
- Why do you need your computer ?
- Why are you being so weird ?

156
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,339
No, no. I'm not being weird, 
I'm just being protective.

157
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,512
Well, if you really want to be protective,

158
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,649
don't introduce my brother to any more alligators.

159
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:30,246
I gotta go, honey.

160
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,307
She still thinks I was attacked by a gator ?

161
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,531
- Let me see your leg, Dave.
- What for ?

162
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,661
- Just let me see it.
- Ow ! All right.

163
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,089
Okay, easy.

164
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:43,999
- Why haven't you told Larkin the truth yet ?
- I don't know what the truth is.

165
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,479
Yes--yes, you do.
I was attacked by an E.B.E--

166
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:52,148
- an extraterrestrial biological entity.
- We don't know that.

167
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,658
Oh, okay. I was sucked under water by a bright,

168
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,976
orange sea blob and had my flesh branded.

169
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,453
Yeah, that's more plausible,right ?

170
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:07,421
What ?

171
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:13,791
What, Russ ?

172
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:16,515
Let me see that.

173
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:21,015
Oh, man.

174
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,156
Who is this ?

175
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,774
It's a guy I found in my station today.

176
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:28,548
This guy has the exact same wounds as me.  
He's been prodded.

177
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:30,964
This is definitely the work of an E.B.E., Russ.

178
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:33,873
- I could show you hundreds--
- I can show you hundreds of pictures of weird fish

179
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,195
being tossed up by a tsunami.

180
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:38,372
- It's not a f--
- Just because something's unfamiliar doesn't mean it's an alien.

181
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:42,110
Okay. So it was a fish that I found 
wrapped around that skeleton ?

182
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,718
Were those just fins shooting through the guy's skull and rib cage ?

183
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:47,890
Taken the time to study that ?

184
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:51,196
I was going to, till I got a little way laid by a man bleeding to death.

185
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:56,236
What's a guy in a wet suit doing

186
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,096
swimming around the everglades in the middle of a hurricane ?

187
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:58,892
I don't know.

188
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,833
You'd better find out before 
someone else decides to take a little dip.

189
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,885
You did really great out there.

190
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,728
No, I didn't.

191
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:16,729
I mean, I'm trying, but I really...

192
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,517
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here. Come here.

193
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,665
After what you've been through ? 
You did great.

194
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:27,509
What's up ?

195
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,126
I think I lost my wedding ring in the storm.

196
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:38,816
I've looked everywhere for it.

197
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,100
We didn't lose you.

198
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:01,789
Hey, Russell ?

199
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:05,325
Hey, Russell ?

200
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:07,597
Yeah, Dave ?

201
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,079
Hey. So what did you find out ?

202
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,022
- I haven't checked the skeleton yet.
- Why not ?

203
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:14,048
I'm trying to figure outwhat happened to the guy.

204
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,649
You know what happened to the guy.

205
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,178
He was attacked like me, like the skeleton.

206
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,624
Why are you in such denial here ?

207
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,177
Dave, you need to give me some time.

208
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:22,901
Yeah, while the mother ship is landing ?

209
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:24,524
Will you please just hurry up

210
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:25,774
and take a look at the damn thing ?

211
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,366
And try not to scratch my car.

212
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,031
We're gonna turn off the generator now.

213
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:31,447
And you got your flashlight and your water.

214
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,447
And we're gonna be right in the next room, okay ?

215
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,030
Why hasn't mommy called ?

216
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:38,250
Well, the phones are out, Rose.

217
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,863
She could call on the radio.

218
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:44,405
Even when she works late, 
she always calls.

219
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:46,308
Yeah, I know. But it's different tonight.

220
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:48,725
Hurricanes make everything different.

221
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,811
I don't want things to be different.

222
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,369
Okay.

223
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,006
Hey, Kira ?

224
00:14:58,468 --> 00:14:59,221
Okay.

225
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:02,929
Night, Rose.

226
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:06,923
Are you allergic to any medication ?

227
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,616
No.

228
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:12,907
Deep breath.

229
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:19,737
The nurse told me that I was in the water all night.
Is that true?

230
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:21,736
That's what I understand.

231
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:23,254
And again.

232
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:28,239
I hear you had a similar experience.

233
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:30,278
Yeah.

234
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,704
Guess we both must be pretty good swimmers, huh ?

235
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,016
Oh, well, that's just it--

236
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,798
I don't know how to swim.

237
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,953
Come on, bring it through !

238
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:47,537
All right.

239
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,983
Don't pitch that too close to the landing zone, boys !

240
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,048
We don't want the choppers giving us haircuts.

241
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,048
Sheriff,we've got U.S. 1 cleared,

242
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,847
and we're almost done with Krome avenue.

243
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,804
Good job, Lewis. Turnpike still closed ?

244
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:58,566
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:58,567 --> 00:15:59,440
Keep it that way.

246
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:01,513
5-mile radius !

247
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:02,153
Tom ?

248
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,383
Hey, Russ. What brings you out of the jungle at this hour ?

249
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:07,178
Did you authorize the military to enter the park ?

250
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:08,674
Why would I do that ?

251
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:10,788
A military vehicle passed by my place tonight,

252
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:12,973
and I just found a guy out there that was pretty messed up--

253
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,606
Air Force. I found his dog tags.

254
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:15,944
I don't control the military, Russ.

255
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:16,505
Yeah, I know.

256
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,451
But you are working with them now, aren't you ?

257
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:21,475
The guy's name was Paxton.

258
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,032
He was in a wet suit when I found him.

259
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:26,511
- He was in a wet suit ?
- Yeah.

260
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,109
- Did he say anything ?
- He was unconscious.

261
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:33,777
Do you have any idea why he might have been out there ?

262
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:35,385
No.

263
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:40,188
Well, as soon as he's awake, I'm gonna talk to him.

264
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,290
- If you hear anything, let me know.
- Will do.

265
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:49,499
Lewis ?

266
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:50,704
Sir ?

267
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,318
Get General Dearing, Patrick Air Force base.

268
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:54,906
You got it.

269
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,884
Hey, Mrs. Varon.

270
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,049
Where have you been ?

271
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,723
Oh, missing you.

272
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,827
I see you went down to the shed.

273
00:18:58,502 --> 00:18:59,534
So ?

274
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:01,856
Thought I told you not to.

275
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,471
Are you my boss or my husband ?

276
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:06,650
Honey...

277
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:19,511
Baby ?

278
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:21,541
You stink.

279
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:24,544
Sorry.

280
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:27,097
No water, no shower.

281
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:28,645
Wrong.

282
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:37,770
How's our baby ?

283
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:40,129
Hungry.

284
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:46,581
Did you sleep okay ?

285
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,601
No. I was worried about you.

286
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:52,531
Why were you gone all night ?

287
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:55,951
Just following upon that guy I found.

288
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,302
Is he gonna be okay ?

289
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:59,242
I think.

290
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:01,970
I called the hospital a few hours ago,

291
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:03,784
and they said he was stabilized.

292
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,295
Did you get in contact with his family ?

293
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,391
I tried, but the D.O.D. wouldn't tell me anything.

294
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:11,079
The D.O.D.?

295
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:12,975
He's in the Air Force.

296
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:18,036
Well, when I get into the office, I can check

297
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:21,778
and see if anything's come in over the wires about a missing airman.

298
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,546
What do you think happened to him, Russ ?

299
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,953
Baby ?

300
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:34,258
Guys.

301
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:35,826
Oh, boy.

302
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:39,774
You guys walked all the way from your mom's ?

303
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:41,598
Well, I carried her part of the way,

304
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,934
but she really wanted to see you.

305
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,702
Is that right ?

306
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,034
Really ? You miss your daddy, huh, Rose ?

307
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,902
Mommy didn't come home last night.

308
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,078
What ?

309
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,107
She's fine.

310
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,353
Tom called this morning and said 
that they both just got caught up at work.

311
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,281
But she didn't call, so... it kind of sucks.

312
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:05,417
Well, to tell you the truth,

313
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:08,332
I didn't come home last night either.

314
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,406
But if you guys want to hang around today,

315
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:13,874
maybe tonight you can help daddy do some replanting.

316
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,416
Replanting what ?

317
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:19,048
These were all growing on the property.

318
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,946
But I brought them in before the hurricane 
so they wouldn't get hurt.

319
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,771
- You remember what this one is ?
- Not really.

320
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:28,600
It's a Butterfly Orchid.

321
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,640
And this one, this one's called a Turk's Cap.

322
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:35,816
And that one over there, that's a little pond Apple tree.

323
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:39,513
That's gonna grow up to be a very, very bigpond Apple tree.

324
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:45,572
And this one right here is a little Rose...

325
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:51,581
who's gonna grow upway too fast.

326
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:54,836
No, I won't.

327
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:56,976
You won't?

328
00:21:58,615 --> 00:21:59,830
Hey, did you hear that, Jesse ?

329
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,698
She said she's never growing up.

330
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:04,212
Never, ever, ever.

331
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:13,596
She in yet, Reed ?

332
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,194
No. Eve hit her pretty hard.

333
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:17,108
She said she might be in this afternoon.

334
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,851
Could you get somebody on the satellite for me ?

335
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:19,911
What do you need ?

336
00:22:19,912 --> 00:22:23,082
Officer in charge of public affairs 
at the department of defense.

337
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:24,600
You got it.

338
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:25,825
Thanks.

339
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:52,915
Hey, buddy.

340
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,228
Just don't let them in.

341
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,334
Don't let them in !

342
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,197
What ? What ?

343
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:38,676
What ?

344
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:41,680
Don't let who in ?

345
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:44,583
Don't let who in ?

346
00:23:47,814 --> 00:23:48,817
What are you doing ?

347
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:00,609
Got a minute ?

348
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,639
Hey, Russell.

349
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,046
How are you feeling ?

350
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:07,847
All right.

351
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:12,767
Wanted to give you these.

352
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:16,044
They belong to the guy I brought in last night-- 
Paxton.

353
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:18,928
How's he doing ?

354
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,516
Well, I think he'll recover.

355
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,484
Is there something else ?

356
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,419
No.

357
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:36,996
This is a tissue fragment I removed from his head.

358
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:41,201
It's mostly cartilage,but it's covered with tiny, 
geometric spores.

359
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,165
They're not fungal, not bacterial.

360
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,486
This was not a part of him.

361
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,188
I'm thinking maybe a lampreyor a jelly stinger,

362
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:52,006
but this is your area of expertise, not mine.

363
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:57,332
It was still moving when it came out.

364
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,668
I think it may have been ingurgitating fluids.

365
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:03,522
Like a feeding tube.

366
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,636
Do you mind if I take this with me 
so I can run a few tests ?

367
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:08,787
No, please.

368
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:11,897
Dr. Underlay, you're needed in I.C.U. Ten.

369
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:13,160
I'll be right there.

370
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,229
You know, Mare, when you get a chance,

371
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,640
you really should radio the kids.

372
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,087
Why ?

373
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,291
They were pretty upset this morning. 
They came by my house.

374
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:27,060
Your house ? Why did they do that ?

375
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,753
Because you didn't come home last night.

376
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,102
I'm sorry, Russell. I have to go.

377
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,265
Do you remember when 
we lived here with mommy, Jess ?

378
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:00,957
I sure do, Rose.

379
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:03,430
Was I a baby ?

380
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,163
You were pretty little, yeah.

381
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:09,911
Was mommy different then ?

382
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:13,046
What, like, different how ?

383
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:16,845
More different than since the hurricane.

384
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:20,622
Why do you think she's different now, Rose ?

385
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:24,872
I don't know.
She just doesn't look the same.

386
00:26:25,426 --> 00:26:26,198
Yes, she does.

387
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:31,836
Maybe on the outside, but not in.

388
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:36,439
Well, how do you know what she looks like on the inside ?

389
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,471
It's not that I didn't call the kids.

390
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:52,707
It's that I didn't even think about calling them.

391
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,439
They weren't even in my mind.

392
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,383
Russell had no right to come in here and lay this on you.

393
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:04,091
This isn't about Russell. This is about me.

394
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,311
I don't know what's happeningto me, Tom.

395
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:16,470
It's like part of me is here, but...

396
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:19,827
another part...

397
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:25,428
a different part...

398
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:26,921
is pulling me away.

399
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,395
Honey, honey, you've been up for, 
what, almost 36 hours ?

400
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:38,817
Let me take you home.

401
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,018
Hey, how are you gonna take care of others

402
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:43,360
if you don't take care of yourself ?

403
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:54,101
Did you ever feel like this with Kira, after her mom died ?

404
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,974
Did you ever feel like a part of you was abandoning her ?

405
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,013
I don't remember.

406
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:19,981
Sorry, ma'am,you've gotta turn around.

407
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:22,257
Oh. I'm with channel 7.

408
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:24,698
Okay, I see that.

409
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:27,120
The sheriff doesn't want anyone on this road.

410
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:29,727
- Has the quarantine gone into effect ?
- Not yet.

411
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:33,426
- Then why can't I get through ?
- It's for your own protection, ma'am.

412
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:35,225
Safety circle. 5-mile radius.

413
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:37,495
Yeah, I know, but I have to see somebody in cutler ridge.

414
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,252
I'm very sorry.

415
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:48,110
Listen, I'm married to the sheriff's wife's ex-husband.

416
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:48,849
So...

417
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:54,175
whatever.

418
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,224
Sorry, Sir. You've gott ahead back.

419
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,150
Why was Underlay in Paxton's room?

420
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:22,838
I don't know. Maybe the military got to him.

421
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:24,952
He took my camera, the bastard.

422
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:26,581
Could have used the better photos.

423
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:27,877
- For what ?
- For evidence.

424
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:29,420
What do you think ?

425
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:31,174
Russ, do you not see what's going on here ?

426
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:33,189
This hurricane was just a cover

427
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,082
so the aliens could land undetected.

428
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,025
Then the Air Force sent out their welcome party.

429
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,569
Boom ! They were attacked.

430
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,045
"Don't let them in," Paxton kept saying.

431
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,713
"Don't let them in."  Who do you think they were talking about--

432
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,774
the Cubans ?

433
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:47,301
Okay.

434
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,964
We gotta do this quick.

435
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:52,913
What are you gonna examine first  ?

436
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:54,712
- The antennas or the prods ?
- There's no antennas, Dave.

437
00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:57,019
- How do you know ?
- Because I've seen the thing.

438
00:29:57,784 --> 00:29:58,922
Well, they could be retracted.

439
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,431
I'm gonna examine the skeleton

440
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,786
and whatever's wrapped around the skeleton

441
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:04,018
and see if it compares to the tissue fragment Mariel gave me.

442
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,116
Good. Ohh !

443
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,399
And then we're gonna take this whole thing to the coroner.

444
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,359
No souvenirs, you got that ?

445
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,494
Fine. Unless there's antennas.

446
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:21,135
Dude.

447
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:22,855
I appreciate you coming by, father.

448
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,489
I know how busy you must be.

449
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:25,934
Anything for you, Tom.

450
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:34,962
- He's conscious ?
- Yeah.

451
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:38,067
But my wife assures me that he won't make it till morning.

452
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,143
- Are you certain ?
- Absolutely.

453
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:51,935
David, I'm father Scanlon.

454
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:53,532
I'm here to help you.

455
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,617
If there's anything you'd like to tell me at any time,

456
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,162
you feel free to go ahead and say that.

457
00:30:59,163 --> 00:30:59,973
Sheriff ?

458
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:02,766
Say a prayer, Adrienne.
Say a prayer.

459
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:04,845
Through this holy anointing,

460
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,238
may the Lord, with His love and mercy...

461
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,710
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

462
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,994
May the Lord who frees you from sin

463
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:15,136
save you and raise you up.

464
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,211
may the Lord who frees you from sin

465
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,470
save you and raise you up.

466
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:39,205
Uh, yes ?

467
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,703
Miss paxton. My name's Larkin Groves.

468
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:43,787
I'm sorry to come all the way out here without calling,

469
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:45,028
but your phones are out.

470
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,244
I got your address fromt he public affairs office.

471
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:49,394
If you're looking for my husband, he's not here.

472
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:50,585
He's overseas.

473
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:53,730
What ?

474
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,488
Is there anything I can help you with ?

475
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:02,668
Miss paxton, I'm sorry if I'm the one to tell you this,

476
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,216
but y-your husband's in the hospital.

477
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:08,019
He's just south of here.

478
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:11,847
I think you're mistaken.

479
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,585
I wish I were.

480
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:16,027
David's overseas

481
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:17,233
on a mission.

482
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,774
What kind of mission?

483
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:23,634
I don't think I should be talking to you.

484
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,699
Listen, I-I could take you to see him if you want.

485
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:28,778
- They're blocking most of the roads, but--
- No, I want you to leave.

486
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,371
- Ms. Paxton, please.
- Now.

487
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:31,923
He's at homestead hospital.

488
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:53,772
Underlay said there was a lot of looting going on.

489
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:56,384
People steal food and appliances, Dave, 
not human remains.

490
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,756
Then it had to be the military.

491
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,902
You said you saw them out here checking things out, right ?

492
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:01,787
Patrolling the area, looking for Paxton maybe.

493
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,419
- Maybe they looked in the trunk of my car.
- Maybe they did.

494
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:06,726
I gotta talk to Paxton. Paxton's the key.

495
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:07,907
Look, I'm gonna check on the kids,

496
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:09,212
and then I'm goin'right back to the hospital.

497
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:10,269
All right, what if they don't let us in ?

498
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,152
Who, Mariel ?

499
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:12,006
Underlay.

500
00:33:12,007 --> 00:33:13,167
I don't take orders from him.

501
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,568
Well, he is the sheriff, Russell.

502
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,251
Yeah, the sheriff who's working with the military.

503
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,026
And the sheriff who's sleeping with your ex-wife.

504
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:23,350
I'm just sayin' that you might not be as objective

505
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:24,662
about the guy as you should be, okay ?

506
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,711
Where the hell did he come from ?

507
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:36,811
Did you know he was gonna be here ?

508
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:38,036
No.

509
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,353
What the hell ?

510
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:46,261
What's goin' on ?

511
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:47,553
We're picking up the kids.

512
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:48,830
You didn't call me.

513
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:51,226
I talked to you at the hospital.

514
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:52,818
Yeah, and ?

515
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:54,136
- Hey, guys--
- No, wait. Hold on.

516
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,770
You left 'em last night, Mariel.

517
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:59,305
They're here because you left them alone

518
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,768
so they shouldn't have to go now.

519
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:02,436
- It's okay, dad.
- No, it's not okay.

520
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,113
Mariel, she was very upset.

521
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,518
Rose, it's okay. Tell her.

522
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:17,784
But I wanna go, daddy.

523
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:19,730
I miss Carlita.

524
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:27,074
We really appreciate you being here for them.

525
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:32,159
I'll drop them off on wednesday, okay ?

526
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,273
Go give your daddy a kiss, sweetheart.

527
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:46,005
I love you.

528
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,006
I love you, too, daddy.

529
00:34:59,201 --> 00:34:59,773
Reed.

530
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:01,201
Did you get in touch with Val ?

531
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:03,826
Yeah, I ran your story by her.
She wants to talk to you.

532
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:04,920
Great.

533
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:07,422
Val.

534
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:09,363
Larkin.

535
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,667
Reed told you about this missing airman ?

536
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,818
Val, his wife didn't even know he was down here.

537
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:18,386
It sounds to me like the military is covering something up.

538
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:20,895
She thought he was ona mission overseas.

539
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:23,796
I-I told her that he was here in the hospital

540
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:26,006
and I offered to bring her down here,

541
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,534
but she seemed so scared.

542
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:31,599
Larkin, the man is dead.

543
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:32,910
What ?

544
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,413
I just talked to the hospital.

545
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,560
That's not the story I want to tell.

546
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:41,646
I-I want our viewers to see how we're coping, adapting.

547
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,078
How did you get out of town ?

548
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,485
I thought there were roadblocks.

549
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:45,947
I went around them.

550
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,529
You could've been arrested.

551
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,434
Since when do you care how I get a story ?

552
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:50,897
Val ?

553
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:55,920
This man was obviously down here 
on some kind of classified mission.

554
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,587
Now he's dead, and no one's talking about it.

555
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,046
And you're concerned about my driving record ?

556
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:02,428
I don't want this story, Larkin.

557
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,236
Not this story.

558
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:18,110
Dave !

559
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:19,547
What ?

560
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:21,306
Paxton's dead.

561
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:24,718
- Give me your keys.
- What ? Why ?

562
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,632
Just give me your keys.

563
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:29,491
Uh... how do you know he's dead ?

564
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:30,712
Larkin just called.

565
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:33,716
She said Paxton's wife knew nothing 
about him being down here.

566
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,132
And apparently the Air Force just swooped in 
and took his body away.

567
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:40,669
Well, then how do you know he's dead ?

568
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:43,653
I mean, did anybody actually see him dead, Russ ?

569
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:48,060
Call me crazy...

570
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:49,662
I don't care if you're crazy, Dave.

571
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,409
I care about how all this affects my family.

572
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,686
If there's something going on here,

573
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,603
something bigger than the hurricane...

574
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:06,876
how can I protect my kids 
when they're not with me ?

575
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:08,806
They're with you, Russ.

576
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:10,895
They're in the town.

577
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,893
But right now the town may need your protection

578
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:14,933
just as much as they do.

579
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:28,820
What are you looking for ?

580
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:31,056
Hair, nails, teeth--

581
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:33,151
anything to pull some D.N.A. from.

582
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:34,759
Okay.

583
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,034
Is this yours ?

584
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:50,111
No.

585
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:55,438
"Two become one."

586
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:57,447
That's the inscription.

587
00:37:58,161 --> 00:37:58,734
What ?

588
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,187
Any idea who this belongs to ?

589
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:14,660
Will you marry me ?

590
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:17,956
Why'd you do this ?

591
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,782
'Cause you're my wife.

592
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,044
How's it fit ?

593
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,023
Pretty good.

594
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:38,901
Where'd you get it ?

595
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,414
Stole it off a looter.

596
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:45,990
Mommy.

597
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,069
Mommy, I'm ready for bed.

598
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:51,969
I'll be right there, honey.

599
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:56,782
Hi.

600
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:00,959
- You brush your teeth ?
- Yep.

601
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,390
- You want Mobat ?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:18,243
- I'm sorry I didn't call you last night, honey.
- It's okay.

603
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:20,462
No, it's not.

604
00:39:24,754 --> 00:39:25,747
I want you to know

605
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,898
I'm gonna try very hard not to let that 
happen ever again, okay?

606
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:33,354
I was just kinda worried.

607
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:35,466
I know.

608
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:38,560
And you know what ?

609
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,106
You're not gonna lose me.

610
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:46,237
Ever. I promise.

611
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,387
Even when you die ?

612
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:55,698
Well, you know, that's not gonna happen

613
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:59,682
for a very, very, very long time.

614
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,980
I've been wanting to tell you something, mommy.

615
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:07,829
Hey, Mare.

616
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:10,010
It's the hospital.

617
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:18,070
Can you save it till tomorrow ?

618
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:28,085
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Night, mommy.

619
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,668
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

620
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:43,218
This is dr. Underlay.

621
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,001
- You feelin' okay now, Rosie ?
- I guess.

622
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:52,212
Hey...

623
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:55,899
is there somethin' you wanna tell me ?

624
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,248
- Okay.
- Okay.

625
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:15,090
During the hurricane, I saw lots of lights.

626
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:16,758
They were beautiful.

627
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:21,430
They fell out of the sky and into the water.

628
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:24,033
And then...

629
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:27,087
they swam away.

630
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,587
Can you keep a secret, honey ?

631
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:49,063
I saw them, too.
