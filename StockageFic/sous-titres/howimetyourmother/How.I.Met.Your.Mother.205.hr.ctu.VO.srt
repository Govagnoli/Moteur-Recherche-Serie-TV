00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,670
***********

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,430
In all the years we lived in new york,
none of us had ever set foot in his apartment.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,440
Until one day,
**********

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,910
it's a pretty good story.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,790
And believe it or not,
alcohol did not play a role.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,570
It all started two weeks earlier
at lily's housewarming.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,070
Welcome to my new home.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,300
Oh,wow,lily,this is...

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,320
oh,this is all of it.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,520
Yeah,I know it's small,
but it's got character. Thank you.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,060
And I am learning lithuanian
from my neighbors.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,070
They're great.

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,590
They're always out there
in the hall,you know,

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,390
cooking and gambling and giving
each other haircuts. It's nice.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,040
Hey,is that a toilet
in your kitchen?

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,320
Or a stove
in your bathroom?

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,780
Oh,that's not
just a stove.

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,450
That's a stovenkerator:

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,380
A combination of a stove,
oven and sink and refrigerator.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,760
Stovenkerator.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,870
- Isn't that futuristic?
- God,I hope not.

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,320
Hey,cool murphy bed.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,260
Yeah,it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed this morning,so...

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,990
oh!

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,450
You know what,I bet sleeping at this angle
is good for you.

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,850
For some reason.

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,530
I got it.

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,310
that was,something,something,

29
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,740
I am going to,something,you
like a,something,donkey.

30
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,730
Other cultures.

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,700
Hey,let's break out
the fruit basket.

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,750
Hey,who ate all the...?

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,280
Ok,We have to get Lily
out of that apartment.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,350
Her roommate is a raccoon.

38
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,550
I'd offer her my place,
but I've got dogs and she's allergic.

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,740
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend.
I think she's a little more allergic to that.

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,500
What about your place,barney?I know it's
shrouded in mystery,but it's gotta have a couch.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,930
The fortress of barnitude?
No way.

42
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,200
Come on.
She's desperate.

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,820
Hmm,normally a prerequisite
for the women I bring home,but... pass.

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,270
One of you guys is very,
very lucky because I have...

45
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,970
a boom,an extra ticket to the
alanis morissette concert. Who's in?

46
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,420
- Absolutely not.
- No.

47
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,400
Damn! I got these tickets,
like,months ago for me and lily

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
and now I can't find
anyone to go with me.

49
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,750
This is what I miss
about being in a couple.

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,660
I always had someone
to go to concerts with,

51
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,770
or farmer's market,
or brunch.

52
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,440
God,I miss brunch!

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,380
Well,I guess you could--
well,you could try going to brunch alone.

54
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,600
Oh,you don't
think I've tried?

55
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,160
- Table for one.
- One couple?

56
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,870
Um,no,just me.

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,020
Really? For brunch?

58
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,780
You're right. Who am I kidding?

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,760
Ooh,the popover pantry.That place is great.
Can we go get brunch tomorrow?

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,190
- Of course,sweetie.
- Can I go with you guys?

61
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,110
Really? For brunch?

62
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,180
God,I hate being single!

63
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,770
Okay,I'll take the over
on the pittsburgh game.

64
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,060
Oh,and P. To the S.,I never got my payout
from seattle from two weeks ago.

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,240
Yeah. Don't make me call
the gaming commission on you.

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm sure they'd be very interested
to know what's going on over there.

67
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,810
All right? All right?

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,130
Okay,I love you,too,mom.
Take care.

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,830
Hello,lily.

70
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,690
You've somehow managed
to circumvent my security.

71
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,620
How did you do it?

72
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,100
- Ted gave me your spare key.
- Spare key,brilliant!

73
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,650
I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here
if I had no other choice.

74
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,050
But earlier today,I was getting
ready to go to sleep and...

75
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,500
sveikas.

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,590
That's terrible.

77
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,530
Well,see ya.

78
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,630
Well,can i
stay here maybe?

79
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,120
I'd let you,
but I don't have any room.

80
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,250
You live in a two-bedroom
apartment.

81
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,140
You have one room
just for your suits.

82
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,170
Hey,I'm at a point in my life
where my suits are my family.

83
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,240
Look around you,lily.

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,690
You are in the heart
of bachelor country,

85
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,110
and as a woman,you are
an illegal immigrant here.

86
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,130
Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa,
but that only lasts 12 hours.

87
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,060
14 if you qualify
for multiple entry.

88
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,340
is something
some lame,judgmental chick would say,

89
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,140
but I say give me
multiple high fives.

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,560
you really are desperate.

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,180
I really am.

92
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,760
Okay,you can stay
here for two days.

93
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,470
but I only have
one rule.

94
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,640
You can't change anything.

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,340
Why would I change anything?
This place is...

96
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,610
...perfect.

97
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,210
Except for the fact
that you don't have a tv.

98
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,100
See that wall?

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,090
300-inch flat-screen.

100
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,930
They only sell them in japan,
but I know a guy.

101
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,310
Had to ship it over
in a tugboat like freakin' king kong.

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,900
It hurts my eyes.

103
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah. That doesn't
go away.

104
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,840
Hey.
Hey,where have you been?

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,170
- The alanis morissette concert.
- By yourself?

106
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,640
No,actually I went
with a friend from law school.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,550
Oh,really?
Who's this friend?

108
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,290
Brad.

109
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,010
Bro,alanis morissette rocks!

110
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,740
Totally! I can't believe
I almost didn't come tonight.

111
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,980
Let me guess: You bought the tickets
for you and lily right before she dumped you.

112
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,160
Yeah,how'd you know?

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,810
I just got dumped myself.

114
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,180
What,kara
broke up with you?

115
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,410
I'm sorry,man.
That sucks.

116
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,510
Brad,do you
like brunch?

117
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,900
You invited him
to brunch?

118
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,340
Yeah,I invited him to brunch.
Why,is that weird?

119
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,780
Yes. That's why I was all,
"you invited him to brunch?"

120
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,940
Why can't two guys
who are friends go to brunch?

121
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,460
Because brunch
is kind of...

122
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,920
girly.

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,730
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.
Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?

124
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,710
I don't know.
There's nothing girly about a horse.

125
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,910
Nothing girly about a horn,
but put them together and you get a unicorn.

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,460
I don't care what
either of you say,

127
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,760
I am going
to the popover pantry with brad.

128
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,830
We're here. We're hungry.
Get used to it,brunch.

129
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,350
- smells delicious.
- Thank you.

130
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,840
There was no food in the fridge,
so I picked up...

131
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,920
what are you doing?

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,780
Lily,what was the
first rule again?

133
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,680
- Don't change anything?
- And what was the second rule?

134
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
There was no second rule.

135
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,620
Exactly! There was only one rule
and you broke it.

136
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,080
I bought groceries.
That counts as changing something?

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,300
Lily,if I wanted a fridge
full of groceries,or fresh coffee in the morning,

138
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,340
I'd be in a relationship.

139
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,600
But I don't want to be
in a relationship.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,700
That's why I make it crystal-clear
to every girl that walks through that door

141
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,880
that this is not a place
to leave a toothbrusH.

142
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,430
This is not a place to leave
a contact lens case.

143
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,840
This is a place
to leave.

144
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,100
Come on,I'll give you a tour.
Uh,no flash photography,please.

145
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,580
Bienvenido to the bedroom.

146
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,500
Dig this: King-sized bed,
full-sized blanket,one pillow.

147
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,880
Everything about this bed says,
"our work here is done."

148
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,210
Next we say "bienvenue"
to the bathroom.

149
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,940
What,only one towel?
What,no hairdryer?

150
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,840
You know where I keep that stuff?
Your place. Beat it.

151
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,760
And the coup de grace...

152
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,640
yeah,that's right.

153
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,320
Patent-pending.

154
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,810
And wilkommen to the hallway.

155
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,210
While guys like ted and marshall may
hide their porn...

156
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,770
marshall doesn't have porn.

157
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,600
Aww,that's sweet.

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,820
While guys like ted and marshall may
hide their porn,I had mine...

159
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,590
professionally lit.

160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,410
Girls see this,
they can't get out of here fast enough.

161
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,620
And if that doesn't drive them away,
there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.

162
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,900
No,that's just awesome.

163
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,060
So you see,
whenever a girl wakes up here,

164
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,720
I never have to tell her
to go build her nest somewhere else.

165
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,070
My apartment
does it for me.

166
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,960
God,I love brunch.

167
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,510
Oh,damn...

168
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,280
the zucchini bread
is "ridonculous."

169
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,460
This isn't weird,right?

170
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,110
I sort of thought
it might be,but it totally isn'T.

171
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,450
And b-t-dub,you totally
did not oversell the eggs benny.

172
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,020
Right?

173
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,940
I mean,why can't two single bros go out
and rock brunch sunday morning-style?

174
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,980
Exactly. Thank you,that's
exactly what I've been saying.

175
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,830
- This must be destiny.
- What are you talking about?

176
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,410
I have two tickets
for mamma mia friday night.

177
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,600
You like abba,right? What am I saying?
Who doesn't?

178
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,350
Anyway,I was gonna take kara,
but now it's all you and me.

179
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,780
We're gonna do broadway,
bro style. What do you say?

180
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,590
Yeah!

181
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,170
Hey. Did the
cold wake you?

182
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,890
No,I've just been
watching you sleep.

183
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,680
Oh,did you try and take a shower?
I'm sorry,I only have one clean towel.

184
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,260
I don't buy into the myth
that we need to shower every day.

185
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,910
Okay.

186
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,940
I'd offer you some coffee,
but I don't have any,so you're gonna have to...

187
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,340
I'm boycotting coffee.

188
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,780
You may as well drink the tears
of a colombian peasant farmer.

189
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,410
God,I love this place.

190
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,020
Good thing I don't have a job
because I could stay here all day.

191
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,500
I think I left something
on the bookshelf.

192
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,680
Whoops.
Oh,no,oh,look.

193
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,780
Oh,I'm disgusting.

194
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,360
Wow,you're open about your sexuality
and that's one of the reasons I love you.

195
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,710
Did I just say that?
Oh,well,cat's out of the bag.

196
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,780
I love you.

197
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,790
okay,beep,beep.
Backing up,um...

198
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,490
hi,barney. Oh...

199
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,470
oh,my god.
Are you married? Is this your wife?

200
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,690
What? No.
Yes!

201
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,680
- Yes?
- Yes.

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,430
You son of a bitch!

203
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,810
I can't believe I let you
enter my sacred temple.

204
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,380
- Come on,baby. please,no.you don't understand.
- Oh,dawn,you can find...

205
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,600
what have I done? This is the worst.
How could you...?

206
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,500
You're not going anywhere.
Live claritin clear.

207
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,340
That was close.
That hippie chick wouldn't leave.

208
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,070
She was ready to squat here.

209
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,340
Well,she'd have to with your spring-loaded
toilet seat,wouldn't she?

210
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,320
She was freakishly immune to
everything in my apartment... except you.

211
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,770
- You're better than porn.
- Thank you?

212
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,540
How would you like to
extend your stay here?

213
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,760
All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife,
and scare off the occasional one-night stand.

214
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,480
I know,I know. You've got your ethics.
You've got your principles...

215
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,800
- I'll do it.
- Really?

216
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,940
Barney,you've clearly got
some serious mother issues

217
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,950
that have left you the emotional equivalent
of a scavenging sewer rat.

218
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,280
But,in my
other apartment,

219
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,830
I would be living with an actual scavenging
sewer rat,so you win.

220
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,790
I'll take it.

221
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,400
- Mamma mia?
- Mamma mia.

222
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,470
You know what? It's supposed
to be a great musical,okay?

223
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,380
It won all sorts
of tonys and stuff.

224
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,000
No,totally. It sounds like a really,really
fun,exciting,third date.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,900
Ooh,third date.
You know what that means.

226
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,220
it is not a date,okay.
It's just two bros taking in a broadway show.

227
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,790
You bros going to get
dinner beforehand?

228
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,480
- We might grab a steak,yeah.
- Where at?

229
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,990
Cafe l'amour.

230
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,080
Brad says the food is
really good there,okay.

231
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Sounds like brad's got quite
the night planned out.

232
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,060
You better bring your "a" game.
That means no granny panties.

233
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
All right,
you know what?

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,560
You two are just threatened because
I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' turf.

235
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,060
Well,guess what?
It's my territory now.

236
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,680
I'm peeing all over brunches,
fancy dinners and musicals.

237
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,240
That's right; brad and i
are taking back broadway.

238
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
What are you going to wear?

239
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,650
I was thinking like this
collared shirt and these pin...

240
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,230
oh,you know what? Shut up.

241
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,890
Can you pass
the arts and leisure?

242
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,770
Can you pass
the arts and leisure?

243
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,340
- I just did.
- Honey,I'M...

244
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,920
barney,
what the hell is going on here?

245
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,570
- Lily,I can explain...
- how could you?

246
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,940
In our own home?
You bastard!

247
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,830
- I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...
- just get out.

248
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:21,200
This is what I get after I worked as a stripper
for four years to put you through medical school?

249
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,730
I got breast implants for you.
I...

250
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,440
I was just about
to turn on the tears.

251
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,530
Brava.

252
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,220
That was incredible.

253
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,410
And that slap was genius.
You did not hold back.

254
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,220
Yeah,that I just
always wanted to do.

255
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,160
Fair enough.

256
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,840
I have to say,it's kind of nice having food
around here for a change.

257
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,980
You know...
nah,never mind.

258
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,950
What? You're my wife.
You can tell me anything.

259
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,860
Well,if you really wanted
to sell this ruse,

260
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,360
we should try to make
this place a little more...

261
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,900
you know,homey. Like-like a woman
would actually live here.

262
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,840
What did you have in mind?

263
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,140
Bones,bones,

264
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,480
brittle little bones

265
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,950
it's not the milk you seek

266
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,480
it's the sun you need

267
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,510
sugar dumpling,muffin baby

268
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,880
this world is going crazy

269
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,970
do do do do

270
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,100
do do do do

271
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,580
do do do do do

272
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,310
Hey,you're home.

273
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,560
I didn't think we'd be seeing you
until tomorrow morning.

274
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,110
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It wasn't a date.

275
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,480
Okay,it was a date
and it got way weird.

276
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,740
- Oh,you really don't have to do that.
- No,I insist.You're my guest.

277
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,910
Thanks,brad.

278
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,240
Bro,

279
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,900
you got some chocolate
on your chin.

280
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,030
Still there.
I'll get that bad boy.

281
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,270
Well,it could have been worse.
It could have fallen in your lap.

282
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,580
It gets worse.

283
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,820
No,I-I can do it,brad.
Okay,thank you.

284
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,250
So anyway,ah,it's this saturday.
Do you want to come?

285
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,440
You want me to go to
a wedding with you?

286
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,170
Okay,that's not too bad.

287
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,070
Two single guys on the prowl.
It'll be likewedding crashers.

288
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,830
Just keep brad away
from the bouquet.

289
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,720
It gets worse.

290
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,230
It gets better.The foliage
in vermont this time of year is ridonc.

291
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,430
Vermont?

292
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,780
Yeah,the wedding's
at this awesome b&B.

293
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,030
Kara and I used to go there.

294
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,700
Anyway,
there is one room left,and we got it.

295
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,630
Walt whitman suite,bro.

296
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,290
- You said no,right?
- Of course.

297
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,360
- I understand.
- It's cool.

298
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,990
It's the first time I was going
to see my college friends since kara left me.

299
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,220
I just...

300
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,240
I just miss her so much.

301
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,170
I'll go to vermont with you.

302
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,650
That's great!

303
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,510
You know,uh,they're
registered at pottery barn.

304
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,900
I figure we could go
halfsies on a gravy boat.

305
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,230
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.

306
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,240
Damn you,brunch!

307
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,230
This guy's crazy,right?

308
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,250
Look,I don't think
he's crazy.

309
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,760
I just think he's suffering
from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.

310
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,480
And unfortunately,
you're his nicotine patch.

311
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,290
And now you have to do
what every dysfunctional couple has to do:

312
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,590
Break up.

313
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,400
You're right.You're right.I promised brad I would
go to the wedding with him,and then that is it .

314
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Good man.

315
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh,I think we made the right decision
going for the custom-made italian sheets.

316
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,500
Hey,if my bed's going suit up,
it's going to do it right.

317
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,000
Want to give it a whirl?

318
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,990
Oh.

319
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,030
all right,I'm going to head out,hit the bars.
What are you going to do tonight?

320
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,050
Oh,I was just going
to watch letterman

321
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,230
but,god this bed is so comfy.

322
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,010
I wish you had a tv in here.

323
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,460
Okay,seriously,
what do you do for a living?

324
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,580
Please.

325
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,400
I thought
you were going out.

326
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,020
Eh.
After the monologue.

327
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,760
The next morning,
as the sun rose over manhattan,

328
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,760
your uncle marshall headed over to brad's
apartment to leave for the wedding in vermont.

329
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,750
But when he got there...

330
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,580
no.

331
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,720
No...

332
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,510
no.

333
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,050
No!

334
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,180
No.

335
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,200
Ted.

336
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,890
Um,brad got me flowers.

337
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,070
Hold on.
Brad got him flowers.

338
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,590
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.

339
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,060
Oh,hey...no,brad,uh,
I don't want to hear it.

340
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,920
I do like you.
And calla lilies are my favorite flower.

341
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,440
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,but this is not cool,man.

342
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,610
I can't believe
that you would...

343
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,300
- hey,sweetie.
- Hey.

344
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,210
- Hey,marshall.
- Hi,kara.

345
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,830
So you guys,are like,
back together now?

346
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,190
Yeah.
Happened last night.

347
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,120
Uh,I'm sorry,bro.
I should have called you.

348
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,340
Yeah,you should have.

349
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,500
- Well,I didn't mean to hurt...
- don't,brad.

350
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,190
Just don'T.

351
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,370
There was something
in the air that night

352
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,880
the stars went bright

353
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,060
oh,what was with him?

354
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,930
I don't know.

355
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,880
I think he's in love with me.

356
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,780
I can't believe we just...
you and I...

357
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,380
- what have we done?
- Nothing.Nothing happened.

358
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,780
We-we just went to sleep.

359
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,090
Just went to sleep?I don't sleep
in the same bed as a woman and not make a move.

360
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,180
How could... you.
You spooned me against my will.

361
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,510
Hey,it takes two to cuddle.

362
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,600
We...

363
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,640
we...

364
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,490
we redecorated my place.

365
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,570
We stayed in on a friday night
to watch letterman,

366
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,840
and then slept together
and didn't have sex?

367
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,480
Oh,my god,
we're in a relationship.

368
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,700
That's what you think
a relationship is?

369
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,960
You were supposed to be the vaccine,
but you gave me the disease.

370
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,160
You gotta go.

371
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,330
Barney.

372
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,270
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

373
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,930
You let down your guard,
and let someone into your life,

374
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,740
and-and it actually felt okay.

375
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,650
And that terrifies you.

376
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,180
You gotta go.

377
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,570
Hey,you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work into this place,

378
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,760
and I've grown accustomed
to a certain standard of living.

379
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,650
A certain standard of living?
You didn't paya single...

380
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,320
and so mr. And mrs. Stinson,after two weeks
of marriage,decided to call it quits.

381
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,660
Fortunately,
they reached a settlement.

382
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,560
And that's the story
of how aunt lily furnished her apartment.

383
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,450
Ynto brad again some time later.

384
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,300
Oh,my god,
it's brad.

385
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,350
Laugh like I said
something really funny.

386
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,020
- Right,right.
- That's was great.

387
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,530
- Hey,marshall.
- Oh,hey,hey,how's it going?

388
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,200
It's good.

389
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,230
Hey,I'm,uh...

390
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,740
yeah,I know
who you are.

391
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,500
Well,I got to go.
I got this thing.

392
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,700
Yeah,me too,
but more important.

393
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,710
- So,I guess I'll see you around.
- Sure. Sure.
