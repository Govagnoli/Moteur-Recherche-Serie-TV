1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,366
Kids, you know the photo in the den?

2
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:04,980
It was taken back in 2006,
when Grandma and Grandpa

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,109
came to visit me and we all
went out to brunch.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,091
We all look pretty happy,
right?

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,125
(camera shutter clicking)
Wrong.

6
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,825
I wish your face
would melt off.

7
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:13,191
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

8
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:15,425
I hate you.
I hate you more.

9
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:16,491
I'm going to kill him.

10
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,792
I can't say
I blame you.

11
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:20,125
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

12
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,525
I don't care how
unpleasant it is.

13
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:23,324
You have to
talk to him.
Not now.

14
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,458
Okay, if you
don't, I will.

15
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,191
Robin...

16
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,375
Okay, for any of this
to make sense,

17
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,910
you got to understand, there
are three parts to this story.

18
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,075
Let's start with the Marshall
and Lily part.

19
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,142
As a 30th anniversary gift,
I had flown

20
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,943
my parents
to New York for the weekend.

21
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,376
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your cousin Jimmy

22
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,042
had a wonderful time
at that spa he visited.

23
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,609
You mean the spa the judge
ordered him

24
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:46,776
to go to to quit cocaine?

25
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:48,576
Coffee?

26
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:51,109
Now, Grandma and Grandpa
didn't like to talk

27
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:53,309
about things that were
uncomfortable, emotional,

28
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,476
or in any way... real.

29
00:00:56,543 --> 00:00:57,576
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.

30
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:59,843
Oh, Lily!
Hi, Marshall.

31
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,010
Good to see you.

32
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:02,242
I was just
stopping by

33
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,852
to pick up some
of my things.

34
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:06,553
Yes, we were so sorry
to hear about your...

35
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,397
you know, the, the...

36
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:12,737
Well...

37
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,571
Lily calling off the
wedding and dumping me?

38
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:17,571
Me begging Marshall to take
me back and him rejecting me?

39
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,237
I love your hair.

40
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:26,236
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

41
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:33,188
<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@mini.F</font>

42
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:35,519
This is only the sceond time Marshall and Lily

43
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,285
had seen each other
since breaking up,

44
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,319
but to their credit,
it wasn't that awkward.

45
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:41,311
Actually, we're cool.

46
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:42,744
We just divided
up CDs.

47
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,446
It was all very civil.

48
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:46,084
I'm proud of us;
we're, we're good.

49
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:49,564
MRS. MOSBY:
Well, we were all going to go
to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.

50
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,131
Lily, would you like to join us?

51
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,331
Um...

52
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:54,532
What?

53
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:56,467
Well, I-I don't want to go

54
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:58,601
if it would make you
uncomfortable.

55
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,750
Why would it?

56
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:03,604
Well, I mean, yeah,
we're... we're good,

57
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:07,771
but you got to admit
there's that stuff between us.

58
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,571
Um, not for me.

59
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,404
Now it's just like
we're friends.

60
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:14,071
It's like we're
brother and sister.

61
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,947
"Brother and sister"?!

62
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:20,987
Okay.Fine, yeah,

63
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,976
I'll see you
at the restaurant, bro.

64
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:28,609
See? Not awkward at all.

65
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,499
Hello, everyone.
Hi.

66
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:31,543
Hello, Marshall.

67
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,146
MRS. MOSBY:
Lily, that is a stunning dress.

68
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:35,784
Oh, thanks.

69
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,439
It's kind of revealing,

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,069
but I thought, "Hey,
we're all family."

71
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,304
(chuckling):
Right, bro?

72
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,237
Ooh. Ow.

73
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,253
What's wrong?

74
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:46,954
Oh, I, I hurt my
ankle in yoga today.

75
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,521
The instructor told me
to just take deep breaths

76
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,987
to get through
the pain, just...

77
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,760
Are you all right?

78
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,538
You're kind of sweating.

79
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,506
No, I'm fine.

80
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,940
It's just...
this roll is really spicy.

81
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,277
Lily is evil!

82
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,611
She just wore that dress
to torture me.

83
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,611
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.

84
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,944
See, at brunch, I'm going
to torture Lily right back.

85
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:17,816
Yeah.

86
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:20,196
There's a part of my body that
she's got a weakness for, too.

87
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:22,763
Dude, you can't whip that out
at brunch.

88
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:25,852
No, not that.

89
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:28,653
I'm going to unleash my calves.

90
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,745
That's crazy.

91
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,579
Nobody's turned on
by men's calves.

92
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,209
They're a thoroughly
unerotic body part.

93
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,610
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too,

94
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,610
if I had those skinny little
chicken legs.

95
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:44,043
I'll be waiting by the phone
for your apology.

96
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,577
So Marshall showed up at brunch
with a plan.

97
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:49,725
Hello.
Oh, hi.

98
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,358
Hey, Marshall.
Hey.

99
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:53,091
Hey. How are you feeling?

100
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,058
You looked kind of feverish
last night.

101
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,225
Oh, no, I actually
feel great.

102
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,867
It is kind of warm in
here, though, isn't it?

103
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:03,401
Oh, I don't know,
if anything, it's kind of...

104
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:04,568
What are you doing?

105
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,459
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

106
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,761
I'm just making myself feel a
little bit more... comfortable.

107
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,627
Oh.

108
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:18,327
Oh, yes.

109
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:22,641
I've been doing all these
toe lifts lately, and so...

110
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,723
my calves have really
been cramping up.

111
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:36,411
Take off your shirt.

112
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:37,846
Take off the rest
of your pants.

113
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,033
Oh.
Oh.

114
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,467
I really wasn't expecting
that to happen.

115
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,052
Yeah, me neither.

116
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,019
It kind of complicates
things, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.

117
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:47,952
Why did you have to throw
your magnificent calves at me?

118
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,852
You know you have
a punter's leg.

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,386
Well, why did you have to throw
your beautiful boobs at me?

120
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,451
You know you have... boobs.

121
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,864
Just admit it, you came here
trying to seduce me.

122
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:00,645
Seduce you?
You seduced me.

123
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:03,704
You sat down next to me
and took most of your pants off.

124
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,273
You went to San Francisco
for three months.

125
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,106
How is that seducing you?

126
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,772
Well, it's not but I'm
still mad about it.

127
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,406
All right, that's it--
I want TheBeatles Anthology.

128
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:12,812
Oh, well, that's too
bad; I'm keeping it.

129
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,579
And you know the U2
box set I gave you?

130
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,513
Look inside--
all Dave Matthews.

131
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,080
You are evil.

132
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,280
Smile.

133
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,712
I'm going to kill him.

134
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,180
I can't say
I blame you.

135
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,813
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

136
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,779
Now let's talk about
the Barney part of the story.

137
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:35,180
This was going to be Robin's
first time meeting my parents,

138
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:37,413
so we were both
a little nervous.
(knocking)

139
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,911
(scoffs)
Barney, what are you doing here?

140
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,346
Uh... I'm here to
meet your parents.

141
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:44,284
They must be dying
to meet me after all

142
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:46,160
the legendary Barney
stories you've told them.

143
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:48,148
I haven't told them any
legendary Barney stories.

144
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:48,971
What?

145
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,911
Barney, here is a list
of all the things

146
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:52,343
I talk with my dad about:

147
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:54,398
baseball.

148
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:57,668
But I'm your best friend.

149
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,814
Well, actually Marshall's my...

150
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,449
I'm the most important
person in your life.

151
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:01,651
Well, Robin's actually...

152
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,729
How could your parents not know about me?

153
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,062
I'm delightful.

154
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:08,895
To us, sure, in very small,
infrequent doses.

155
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:10,629
I mean, come on,
you're not exactly

156
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,863
the kind of friend
parents want their kid to have.

157
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,629
Oh, really?

158
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,895
Then I guess those
shoes aren't the thing

159
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,796
you're most wrong
about today.

160
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:23,662
Hey, Mom.

161
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:24,721
Hey, Dad.
MR. MOSBY:
Ted.

162
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:25,922
I know you've all
been excited to meet...

163
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,356
Barney Stinson.

164
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:30,089
An honor to meet
the two of you.

165
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,389
That needlepoint "Bless This
Mess" pillow you made for Ted--

166
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:33,622
what a stitch.

167
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,655
Stitch!
Did that just happen?

168
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:38,655
Uh, Mom, Dad,

169
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:39,689
this is my
girlfriend, Robin.

170
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:40,922
Hello.
ROBIN:
Hello.

171
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:41,889
MRS. MOSBY:
Oh, it's wonderful

172
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:42,989
to meet you, Robin.

173
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:44,488
Oh, you are so pretty.

174
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:45,588
Isn't she pretty, Al?

175
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,291
A real looker.

176
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,493
That's funny, I didn't even
"look" in the mirror today.

177
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:55,188
That's not anything,
is it?

178
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:58,924
So, I made a reservation
at San Marino tonight for 8:00.

179
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,192
(laughing):
San Marino.

180
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:03,621
Oh, you're serious? Yikes.

181
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,889
No. We have to try
Casa A Pezzi.

182
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:08,479
Best salmon risotto
I have ever had.

183
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,980
I love salmon risotto.

184
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:11,976
I know.

185
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:15,156
How are we supposed to get
a table at Casa A Pezzi?

186
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:16,190
They're booked for weeks.

187
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,438
Well, lucky for you,

188
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,272
I happen to know
the head waitress,

189
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:20,344
which is ironic
because...

190
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,611
Ironic because we both work  at a homeless shelter

191
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,860
where I serve the food.

192
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,764
Where do you
volunteer, Robin?

193
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,498
What's the
matter with you?

194
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,813
I'm his girlfriend,
and I'm not even
trying that hard.

195
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:36,646
Way to wreck the
curve, kiss-ass.

196
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:39,135
Robin, I'm his
best friend.

197
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,408
That's a commitment.

198
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,676
Girlfriend, that's
like a bad flu.

199
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:45,075
Out of your system
after a couple weeks in bed.

200
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:46,239
(chuckling):
High five.

201
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,106
Can I help?

202
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,103
Yes, you can,
Virginia.

203
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,638
There's a story
behind that broach,

204
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,804
and I'm going to hear it.

205
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,683
Well, funny you should ask.

206
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:03,202
MR. MOSBY:
Whoa! Bravo, Barney.

207
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:05,767
That is my all-time
favorite sonata.

208
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,467
Barney, you are just delightful.

209
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,550
No, Virginia, you're delightful,
I am deligh-ted.

210
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,116
And he's just Ted.

211
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:13,396
I'm really not
planning these things;

212
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,213
they just keep happening.

213
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,513
(laughter)
Whoops.

214
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,965
I think I dropped
an ice cube down here.

215
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,867
Ow, it's so cold.

216
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,033
All right, that's it,
I'm out of here.

217
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,900
In a minute.

218
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,767
Anyone up for a drink
at MacLaren's?

219
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,713
No, I'm kind of tired.
Me, too.

220
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:31,940
Yeah, I'm sure my folks
are gonna want...

221
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,674
I feel like I could knock
back a few cervezas.

222
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,142
Cervezas?

223
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,342
Did he fall?

224
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:39,495
I'd join you, too,

225
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,322
but I want to get up early
for Mass tomorrow.

226
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:45,456
St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m.,
it's my favorite service.

227
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:49,656
Wait a minute-- you're able to
cross the threshold of a church?

228
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,156
I'll save you a seat.

229
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:53,589
Oh, you are just terrific.

230
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:55,256
Isn't he, Susan?

231
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:57,423
Robin.

232
00:08:57,489 --> 00:08:59,656
Susan, her name is Virginia.

233
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,589
Dude, I am sincerely ticked
at your dad right now.

234
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,189
Why?

235
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,623
Last night, we go to MacLaren's
for a drink, right?

236
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,623
So Barney darts back
into the burning house,

237
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,690
lifts up the refrigerator
I'm pinned under

238
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,089
and pulls me to safety.

239
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,122
Whoa. You're like a hero.

240
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:21,056
Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy.

241
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,589
You know who is a hero?

242
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:25,756
My Dalmatian, Smokey.

243
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:30,556
He... didn't... make it out.

244
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,690
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,089
You poor, brave man.

246
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:39,690
Why don't you give
the guy a hug?

247
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,855
I'm... oh.

248
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,423
My dad was your wingman?

249
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,774
This is really
messing with my head.

250
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,609
Barney, is my dad cool?

251
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,384
I'm not done.

252
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,317
So, your dad stays
to finish his drink,
but I take off

253
00:09:57,384 --> 00:10:00,011
because I have to be up early
for Mass with your mom.

254
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:01,523
Sure.

255
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,991
Anyway, I realize that I left
my phone on the bar,

256
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:05,295
so I come back...

257
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,028
(whispers):
Oh, my God...

258
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,161
Mmm...

259
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,912
Oh, my God.

260
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:20,514
Is that really...

261
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,675
Oh, my God!

262
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,109
I know.

263
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:27,112
**

264
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:32,567
My dad made out with
Wendy the waitress?

265
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,800
He cheated on my mom?

266
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,301
No, that's impossible.

267
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,433
Ted, it's a well-known statistic
that 83% of people

268
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,366
married longer than six months
are seeing someone on the side.

269
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:42,633
Do you know that
when you make up

270
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:43,865
a statistic,
you always use "83%"?

271
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,633
You think I'm lying.

272
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,133
Well, have you done
any surveys on the subject?

273
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:49,863
Because the good people at

274
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:54,792
www.swingers.open-marriage-is
natural\legalize-polygamy.org

275
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,598
have, and they beg to differ.

276
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,965
That's not a real Web site.

277
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,932
Oh, and I suppose
I didn't get a real T-shirt

278
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,033
for running in their 10K.

279
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,700
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Ted.

280
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,933
Barney.

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
TED:
Enjoying your
vacation so far?

282
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,666
Oh, yeah.

283
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,700
Uh, listen, can I speak
to you outside for a sec?

284
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,767
Sure.

285
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,833
So you went out
with Barney last night?

286
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,100
Yeah.

287
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:22,703
You have a good time?

288
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:24,304
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry
you couldn't join us.

289
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,304
Yeah.

290
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,037
So...

291
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,604
What?

292
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,437
Well...

293
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,137
Well what?

294
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:42,004
You think Cerrano's got
a shot at the RBI title?

295
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,265
I wanted to confront him,
but I couldn't.

296
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,966
I guess I got
the let's-not-talk-about-

297
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,599
anything-
uncomfortable gene.

298
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,232
Well, you didn't get your
dad's close-the-deal gene,

299
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:51,265
that's for sure.

300
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:52,766
Smile.

301
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,098
Great.

302
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,232
I don't care how
unpleasant it is.

303
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,499
You have to
talk to him.

304
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:58,599
Not now.

305
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,033
Okay, if you
don't, I will.

306
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:01,332
Robin...!

307
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:04,565
TED:
Okay, now I got to back up

308
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,779
all the way
to the beginning

309
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,913
to tell you the me
and Robin part of the story.

310
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:12,071
We were expecting my parents
at any minute.

311
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:13,671
One last thing about my mom.

312
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:15,337
She grills every
single one of

313
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,604
my girlfriends about when we're
gonna get married and have kids.

314
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,504
But this is the first time
she's meeting me.

315
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,353
Doesn't matter.

316
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:21,144
And you'll know it's coming

317
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,546
when she mentions my cousin
Stacy-- six kids in five years.

318
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,669
The woman's basically
a ride at a water park.

319
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:31,115
But I don't want
to get married and have kids.

320
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,591
What am I supposed to say?

321
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,220
You know what?

322
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,488
You're an adult with
perfectly valid opinions.

323
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,153
You shouldn't have to
apologize for them.

324
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:40,388
I'm gonna lie.
I would.

325
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:44,106
Thanks again for
letting me have the U2 box set.

326
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,813
I know how important
it is to you.

327
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,461
I talked to Aunt
Caroline the other day.

328
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,728
Stacy's pregnant again.

329
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:53,562
Oh, good for her.

330
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,228
So, dear...

331
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:57,228
Oh, boy.
Tell us what it's like
being a journalist.

332
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,495
I'm just not ready.

333
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,795
Okay. No pressure.

334
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:02,538
Oh.

335
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,940
Uh, I thought you, um...

336
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:06,173
It's great.

337
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,272
Good.

338
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:08,646
Focus on your job now,

339
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,869
because your career clock
is ticking.

340
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,468
There's time
for marriage and kids

341
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,438
and all that other stuff later.

342
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,637
Ooh, a piano!

343
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:22,016
TED:
You lucked out with my mom last
night, huh?

344
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,241
What a relief, right?

345
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:24,909
Oh, absolutely.
Whew, what a relief it is

346
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:26,641
to know I'm the one girlfriend

347
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,143
your mom doesn't want you
to have kids with.

348
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,384
Hooray?

349
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:34,124
I mean, did she really think
that your college girlfriend Chery

350
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,879
would pop out
attractive children?

351
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,913
'Cause I've seen pictures,
and, I'm sorry,

352
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,080
that girl had a brow ridge
like a caveman.

353
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,543
Come on, she was just
frowning under direct light.

354
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:45,136
And besides, that's not even
what I liked about her.

355
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:47,072
It was her...
It's not important.

356
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,438
What happened to
Marshall and Lily?

357
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:52,738
They've been fighting lately.

358
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:54,871
They're probably off
somewhere going at it.

359
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:56,371
More coffee?

360
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:59,237
Oh, no, thank you.

361
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,271
Isn't she sweet?

362
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,104
Well, if she's so sweet, maybe
she should have Ted's babies.

363
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,371
Excuse me?

364
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:09,372
Nothing.

365
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:15,668
LILY:
Just a minute.

366
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,036
MARSHALL:
Maybe less.

367
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,700
Robin, dear.

368
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,467
Did I say something
to upset you?

369
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,334
Why don't you want me
to have your grandkids?

370
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:25,324
Do you want to have
my grandkids?

371
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,471
No!

372
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,039
I mean, I don't know.

373
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,072
I just...

374
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,724
I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids.

375
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:32,649
And you should.

376
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,050
I'm a genetic gold mine.

377
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:35,702
No family history of diabetes

378
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,269
or heart disease.

379
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:39,758
Everyone has nonporous teeth
and perfect eyesight.

380
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:42,664
I had one schizophrenic uncle,

381
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,931
but even he had perfect vision.

382
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:49,602
Which was unfortunate
for the people around the bell tower he was in,

383
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:51,450
but still he w a very fine man, and...

384
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:52,617
Excuse me. Sorry.

385
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,225
Didn't know that
there was a line.

386
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,425
Marshall, your zipper.

387
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:57,525
Oh.

388
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:07,592
Robin, it's not that I
don't want grandkids.

389
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,058
It's just I don't think
anyone should make the mistake

390
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,958
of getting married too young.

391
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,416
I mean, you got married
pretty young.

392
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:11,881
Why do you say that?

393
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,449
That wasn't a mistake.

394
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,449
Was it?

395
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,449
(whispers):
Well...

396
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,416
Okay, there's something
you don't know.

397
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:24,349
WAITRESS:
Smile.

398
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,050
I wish your face
would melt off.

399
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:27,449
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

400
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:28,650
I'm gonna kill him.

401
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:29,683
I don't care how
unpleasant it is,

402
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,950
you have to
talk to him.

403
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,583
Not now.
Okay, if you
don't, I will.

404
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,817
Robin...!

405
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:37,383
Oh, gosh, let me help you
pick those up, sweetheart.

406
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,850
Sweetheart?

407
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,316
Sweetheart?!

408
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:41,716
The only sweetheart in your life

409
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:42,917
should be the woman you
married 30 years ago,

410
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,516
not the waitress
at the bar last night

411
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,950
and not this clumsy floozy!

412
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:47,950
I'm sorry, you're
not a floozy.

413
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,650
I'm upset, I don't know
what I'm saying.

414
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,150
But stay away from my dad.

415
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,284
Ted, what are you talking about?

416
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:56,783
Dad?

417
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,878
You, uh, want
to tell Mom

418
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:01,184
what happened at the bar
last night?

419
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,866
Okay.

420
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,921
I hooked up with a waitress.

421
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:10,032
Oh.

422
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,293
Oh?

423
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,026
I mean, oh!

424
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,453
Oh! Ooh!

425
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:17,865
We're going to have
a serious talk

426
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:19,398
about this when
we get home, Al.

427
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:20,865
Oh, ooh!

428
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,067
Serious talk?

429
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:24,035
Mom, what...?

430
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,422
He was kissing another woman.

431
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:26,356
Don't you care?

432
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:28,002
Mrs. Mosby?

433
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,393
Ted, we weren't quite sure
how to tell you this...

434
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,993
Your mother and I
are divorced.

435
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,459
You...

436
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,693
What do you mean
you're divorced?

437
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,093
Since when?

438
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,593
Oh, gosh, it's been
about nine months now.

439
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,093
Closer to ten, I think.

440
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,960
Time flies.
(chuckles)

441
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:52,660
So ten months ago,
you just up and decided

442
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,326
to get divorced
without telling me?

443
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,027
No, it wasn't a
snap decision.

444
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,093
We'd been separated
almost two years.

445
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,294
How could you not tell me this?!

446
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,660
We meant to, it just never
seemed like the right time.

447
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,827
So last Christmas...?

448
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:07,860
We talked about
telling you kids then,

449
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,927
but it didn't seem
very Christmasy.

450
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:12,865
I got you a tandem bike.

451
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:13,937
Oh, it didn't
go to waste.

452
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,571
Your mother and Frank
ride it all the time.

453
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,566
Who the hell is Frank?!

454
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,263
(chuckling):
Oh, great guy.

455
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,997
I actually set them up.

456
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:22,512
You remember Dr. Muchnik.

457
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:23,973
He did your braces.

458
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,206
Okay, my head's
about to explode,

459
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,439
and I don't want to get it
all over everyone's waffles,

460
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,039
so I am leaving.

461
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:34,739
Teddy bear, oh...

462
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:41,772
You know, he mentioned
he was divorced last night.

463
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,006
I totally spaced on that.

464
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:47,106
Ooh, no line
at the omelet station.

465
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,039
Lily...

466
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,936
I'm sorry that I said
all those things.

467
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,704
Me, too.

468
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:04,650
I just find it really confusing
to be around you right now.

469
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,784
It's the same for me.

470
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:09,218
I think we're probably
both better off

471
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,483
trying to keep some
distance for a while.

472
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:14,803
Yeah, I think you're right.

473
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:23,381
Are you wearing
a push-up bra?

474
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,790
Did you Mystic
Tan your calves?

475
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,673
I withdraw the question.

476
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,499
We're sorry we didn't say
anything about the divorce.

477
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,201
It was wrong
not to tell you.

478
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,558
Thank you.

479
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,837
But listen,
don't tell your sister.

480
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,105
It would just
upset her.

481
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,056
No, this is
ridiculous!

482
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:43,723
We have to start talking about
stuff, and not just baseball.

483
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:46,415
Indians won today
on a walk-off double.

484
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,849
Against the Red Sox?
Boy, that's a big win.

485
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,065
No. No. No.

486
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,399
We're not gonna
blow past this.

487
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:52,399
I mean, I don't even

488
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,799
know who you people.

489
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,333
I don't even know
how you met.

490
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,532
I never told you
how I met your mother?

491
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,300
No.

492
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,633
Oh, great story.

493
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:01,300
At a bar.

494
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,499
That's it?

495
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:06,799
That's what passes for
communication in our family?

496
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,100
Man, when I have kids,

497
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,066
and I tell them how
I met their mother,

498
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,466
I'm gonna tell them everything,
the whole damn story.

499
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,799
I think it was an Irish bar.

500
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,367
I just, I don't...
I don't understand.

501
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,532
You seemed so happy.

502
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,766
When I was growing up,

503
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,499
you seemed so...

504
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:25,833
What happened?

505
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,633
We just realized we're
very different people.

506
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:31,033
Your father's kind of a
head-in-the-clouds romantic,

507
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,799
and I'm much more
down to earth.

508
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,633
So?

509
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:35,900
Robin and I
are like that.

510
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,000
That doesn't
mean anything.

511
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,866
I wanted kids.

512
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,033
And your mother...

513
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,033
also wanted kids.

514
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,166
Robin and I have
different views on families.

515
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,200
We're not about to break up
because of it.

516
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,633
On some level,
I always knew.

517
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:53,100
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the beginning.

518
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,333
But he spent months badgering
me until I finally gave in.

519
00:19:58,267 --> 00:19:59,441
Huh.

520
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,475
Well, when you don't connect
on that many fundamental levels,

521
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,827
it's only a matter of time
before you realize

522
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,062
you're not meant
to be together.

523
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:09,295
But we love Robin.

524
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,494
MR. MOSBY:
Absolutely.

525
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,628
Meeting you was
the highlight of my trip.

526
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:15,461
Well, second highlight.

527
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,962
MRS. MOSBY:
We'll see you inside.

528
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:19,028
Sorry.

529
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:24,828
Wow.

530
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,494
I know.

531
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,547
They love me!

532
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,807
We are definitely going to
try and communicate more.

533
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,407
From now on,
full disclosure.

534
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:39,540
Good. Good, I think it'll be
really good for the family.

535
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,774
By the way,how's Grandma?
She hasn't returned my last couple calls.

536
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,226
I'm gonna get
some juice.

537
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,330
No.

538
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:01,196
No.

539
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:05,438
You missed a great game
last night. Real squeaker.
