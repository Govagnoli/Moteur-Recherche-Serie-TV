1
00:00:00,323 --> 00:00:05,702
kids,when you reach your late twenty,
you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out.

2
00:00:05,947 --> 00:00:07,454
Like with aunt lily.

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,495
Even though she was back from san francisco,

4
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:11,449
she was still on a quest to find herself.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,730
It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten.

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,955
I want to get out there and change the world.

7
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:19,641
I want to find my passion.

8
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:21,290
And she did find it.

9
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,142
I'm going to be a life coach.

10
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:25,312
In fact, she found it again and again.

11
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:28,755
I'm going to be a marine biologist.

12
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:29,904
...Slam poet.

13
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,339
...Beekeeper!

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,727
Not a beekeeper.

15
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:36,918
Her newest lifelong dream?

16
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,893
Singing in a punk rock band.

17
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:40,624
What is she doing for money through all this?

18
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,086
Oh, she's been waiting tables at big wave luau.

19
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:47,569
Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,245
No.

21
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:53,185
Here she comes.Here she comes.

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,614
Welcome to big wave luau.Can I tiki your drink order?

23
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:57,770
Aw, crap.

24
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,194
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:00,418
Oh, hi, lily.

26
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,287
We were just in the neighborhood,thought we'd get some lunch.

27
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:05,225
We didn't even know you'd be here.

28
00:01:07,477 --> 00:01:09,124
What do you want?

29
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:14,296
I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at big wave luau.

30
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:18,992
Aloha, island visitors.

31
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:22,630
The big wave brought you to our humble luau.

32
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:27,023
For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.

33
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,561
I didn't catch your name.

34
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:32,147
-- Did you guys catch her name?
-- No.

35
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,969
My name is anuhea.

36
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,920
It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.

37
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,558
Robin, nothing to add?

38
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,402
No.

39
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,634
Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.

40
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,742
Thank you.

41
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,013
Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum

42
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:52,138
because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.

43
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,615
Birthday girl!

47
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:10,265
I've never need the beer more than I do right now.

48
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,551
I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake.

49
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,858
I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time

50
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:17,909
and you said, "dude, my semester is gonna be this."

51
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,122
Yeah, well, it was supposed to be,but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen.

52
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:25,851
She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us.

53
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:28,132
To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.

54
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,243
Really?

55
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:30,871
Laid, you say?

56
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,605
You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.

57
00:02:33,606 --> 00:02:35,024
She hot?

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,809
Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.

59
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,286
And she's looking for some action.

60
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:41,757
Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.

61
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:42,689
A what?

62
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,592
A cougar.

63
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:49,440
An older woman,usually in her 40s or 50s,single and on the prowl for a younger man.

64
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:52,888
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s-- a turtle?

65
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,956
Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.

66
00:02:55,957 --> 00:03:00,888
-- I didn't challenge you to have sex with my professor.
-- Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.

67
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:03,306
So, I quit my job.

68
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,688
I just couldn't take it anymore.

69
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,422
Approximately 50 times a day,some guy asks me for a lei...

70
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,240
classic.

71
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,725
Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?

72
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,873
Yeah.

73
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:17,062
Somebody did just quit.

74
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,887
So, where should we eat today?

75
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:25,185
Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone?

76
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,033
Dude, that is cold-blooded.

77
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,924
It was an honest mistake.

78
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:37,926
Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it,

79
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,296
it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.

80
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,861
Ted, that girl didn't quit.You destroyed her.

81
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:45,692
It was an whole chicken.

82
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,150
And did I mention she had 12 sides?

83
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:48,619
Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure.

84
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,530
Real classy, ted.

85
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,052
So, lily, what do you say?Do you want the job?

86
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,490
What would I be doing?

87
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:57,130
Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.

88
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:59,933
You'll sit there.My station is right over here.

89
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:03,678
And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.

90
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,718
Oh, right, is that the...

91
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,006
yeah.

92
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,611
Here's the model.

93
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:13,510
You weren't kidding.It really does look like a giant penis.

94
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:14,813
I know.

95
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:17,452
For whatever reason, mr.Druthers just doesn't see it.

96
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,621
How can he not see it?I mean there's the...

97
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:20,239
I know.

98
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,853
-- And the way it...
-- I know.

99
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,570
-- And the two little...
-- I know.

100
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,035
it is just...

101
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,406
spectacular?

102
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,752
Why, thank you.

103
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:31,596
Lily, this is mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project.

104
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:33,919
Lily's going to be our new office assistant.

105
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,366
Nice to meet you.

106
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:36,838
Isn't it?

107
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,421
Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony.

108
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:43,375
Tell me, do you want to be an architect?

109
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,858
I, uh... I am an arcteg

110
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,434
really?

111
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:50,207
Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos.

112
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,092
Is he an architect?

113
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,743
Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.

114
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,798
Ted, you've got promise.

115
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,227
But you have to study what I do more carefully.

116
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:06,750
Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model.

117
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:09,096
-- Think you can handle that?
-- Absolutely.

118
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:13,920
-- So you're going to design the...
-- styrofoam trees.

119
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:16,600
Once again-- with feeling.

120
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,511
Styrofoam trees.

121
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:20,954
-- Styrofoam trees!
-- Styrofoam trees!

122
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:23,868
That's the spirit.Now, gather 'round.

123
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:29,429
This isn't just about trees, ted.

124
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,967
This is about life.

125
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,469
And sometimes in life,

126
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,769
you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm?

127
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:46,405
Man, that guy is a total, well...

128
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,224
okay, wait, wait, wait.That's professor lewis's office there.

129
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,491
Okay, let's take a look.

130
00:05:56,107 --> 00:06:00,064
Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right.

131
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:02,622
A prime specimen.

132
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,230
See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics.

133
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,782
Start with the hair.

134
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:12,934
The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage.

135
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:16,011
The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar

136
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:20,593
until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair.

137
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,805
Now, the blouse.

138
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:28,120
The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey.

139
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:32,964
If you're watching them bounce,she's about to pounce.

140
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,584
See the claws?

141
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,673
Long and sharp,to ward off rival females...

142
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:42,985
or open alimony checks.

143
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:47,532
Yeah, this one's a beaut.

144
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,117
Okay,

145
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,719
let the hunt begin.

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,588
Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure

147
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:58,123
I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.

148
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:01,138
Who do you rather have grading your papers--

149
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,740
a savage, man-eating jungle cat,

150
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:08,883
or a purring, satisfied kitty?

151
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:12,740
Go, barney.

152
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:16,705
Go mount and stuff that cougar.

153
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:23,238
Scusi,I am luigi,italian exchange student.

154
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:26,964
I was, uh,walking to class,

155
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:30,379
but then I noticed you...

156
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,326
bella principessa...

157
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,884
tell me what you want or get out.

158
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,088
Direct.

159
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,809
I like that.

160
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,204
The name's barney.

161
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:43,655
What I want... is you.

162
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,766
Turn around.

163
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,868
My place. Two hours.

164
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:55,703
Don't be tardy.

165
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:59,454
I can't believe how mr. Druthers treats people.

166
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:00,733
And that building?

167
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,628
Talk about overcompensating.

168
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,069
He's not usually this bad.

169
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,684
It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us,

170
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:10,704
so lately he's been a little testy.

171
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,286
You know what I mean--crotchety.

172
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,765
I'm just saying it's been hard on him.

173
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,656
All right stop.

174
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:21,533
-- Did you show lily your design?
-- No.

175
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,508
What design?

176
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,623
-- It's nothing.
-- It's fantastic.

177
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:26,983
Just for fun,ted's been working on his own design.

178
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,506
And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia.

179
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,415
At least, not healthy male genitalia.

180
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,492
Ted, you should pitch your building to druthers.

181
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,795
Are you kidding?

182
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:39,765
He's hammond druthers.He's a legend.I'm just part of his team.

183
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:43,188
This building is huge for the firm,so it's really important we don't blow it.

184
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,677
all right, enough.

185
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,107
Oh, my god.

186
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:51,048
Incredible.

187
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:54,251
Hmm... c-minus.

188
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:57,295
C-minus?What are you talking about?

189
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,799
I just pulled an all-nighter!

190
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,249
You didn't budget your time well,

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,160
you glossed over some of the most important points,

192
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:09,486
and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.

193
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,950
Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.

194
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,288
Then he stared at me until I laughed.

195
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:21,887
Okay, I'm done.

196
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:24,132
Great. I'll put the paints away.You just go show him.

197
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,600
Great. Thanks.

198
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,727
Well, finally.

199
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:35,583
I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.

200
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,533
Good one, sir.

201
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:42,344
Anyway, here they are.

202
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,605
Too green.

203
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:46,553
Too green?

204
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:49,560
Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color.

205
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:50,890
Almost brunette.

206
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,121
And think bushier.

207
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:57,018
I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild,

208
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,196
ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.

209
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,475
Can you picture it, ted?

210
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,954
I can't un-picture it.

211
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:05,265
Good.

212
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,434
Oh, my god.

213
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,484
It's gone!

214
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,107
What? What's gone?

215
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:15,045
My baseball signed three tes by pete rose.

216
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,553
Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.

217
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:18,788
What do you think, ted,

218
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:22,523
it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away?

219
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,835
Somebody stole it.

220
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:27,659
Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.

221
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,812
Oh, who cares about the trees?

222
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:33,452
It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.

223
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:36,275
Inspiring as always, sir.

224
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,577
Lily?

225
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:43,395
Where's she put those paints?

226
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,625
Hey.

227
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:58,640
Hey.

228
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,251
Um, lily, question for you.

229
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:06,272
Why did I find mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by pete rose in your desk drawer?

230
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,103
That's easy. I took it.

231
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,202
Why?

232
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,935
It's simple.

233
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:14,618
I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef.

234
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:19,475
I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university.

235
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:26,415
Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you.

236
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:30,387
I didn't get you a birthday present.

237
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:38,999
What? You gonna cry?

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,049
Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry?

239
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,655
Hey, everybody, look!

240
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:45,880
The little crybaby's gonna cry!

241
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:51,076
I lost my ice cream!

242
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,370
Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one,

243
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:57,113
but the point is, he was mean.

244
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:59,616
And that's why I took away his ball.

245
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,469
What does his ball have to do with anything?

246
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,452
Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that.

247
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:07,557
When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean,

248
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,398
I would take away one of his toys.

249
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,931
The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.

250
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,502
Hey, guys. What's going on?

251
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:18,704
Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by pete rose.

252
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,311
Why? Was he being mean?

253
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,167
You know about this?

254
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:24,311
Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice.

255
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,100
Did you tell him about that time at the gap?

256
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,298
Oh, that was a good one.

257
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,711
This sales guy was rude to robin,so I took a pair of khakis.

258
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:33,052
I gave them to you for your birthday.

259
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,058
So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?

260
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,735
I prefer to call them "justice khakis."

261
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:40,621
That's not justice.It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.

262
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,302
So is being mean.

263
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,573
Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense.

264
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:46,836
In kindergarten,the kid knew why he was being punished.

265
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:49,120
Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.

266
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,767
Well, that's why I left a note.

267
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,101
-- A note?
-- Yeah.

268
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:56,624
When he finds it,he'll understand why his ball was taken away,he'll stop being mean,

269
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,184
and the office will be a nicer place to work.

270
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:02,145
Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.

271
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:06,974
Look, lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having,

272
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:10,198
with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny,

273
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,567
but this is my career you're messing with.

274
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:15,063
I'm not sure I like your tone.

275
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,527
You know what?

276
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:19,417
Now you just lost the ball.

277
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:28,231
I'd ask you how last night went,but we had a pop quiz today.
Nobody got higher than a c-minus.

278
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:30,159
I know, I know.

279
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,856
You claim to have so much sex.I only assumed  you'd be good at it.

280
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,304
Look, I miscalculated.

281
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,885
I thought she'd be old and fragile,like most cougars.

282
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,628
But kitty's got claws.

283
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,864
Don't worry though.

284
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,215
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.

285
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:47,439
Just let it go, man.You're making things worse.

286
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,305
I promise you,after tonight,that cougar will be my pet,

287
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:54,039
and I its master.

288
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,759
I think I'm falling in love with you.

289
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,977
Oh, god. That wasn't your first time, was it?

290
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,682
Although that would explain a lot.

291
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:08,462
What? No.We had sex yesterday.

292
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:11,896
Oh, right. That.

293
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:14,540
Well, you had sex yesterday.

294
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:19,218
I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.

295
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:24,466
When druthers goes to get his bagel,I'll go in, grab the note,put the ball back.

296
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:28,875
If something goes wrong,yell out, "who wants espresso?"

297
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:31,361
So I'll know he's coming.Got it? Okay,

298
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:33,203
-- now give me the ball.
-- No.

299
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,373
What do you mean, no?

300
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,707
I mean I stand by what I did, ted.

301
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,811
Come on, lily.We're running out of time.

302
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:42,397
Everybody get in here now!

303
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,222
Who wants espresso?

304
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:55,780
Now, as most of you know,my pete rose, pete rose, pete rose baseball has been stolen.

305
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,225
Well, I just found this note.

306
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:01,902
"Dear mr. Druthers,I, your baseball, am leaving.

307
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:04,184
"Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back.

308
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:07,509
"If not, other things in your office may follow my lead.

309
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:13,333
"In fact, I overheard your ipod talking,and he may shuffle off at any minute."

310
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:18,113
Normally,I would scream at everyone until my voice goes,

311
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:21,385
but maybe that's the wrong reaction here.

312
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,939
Interesting.

313
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,855
Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day

314
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,143
to decide he's homesick,

315
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:32,516
or, tomorrow morning,I'll begin firing three people an hour.

316
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:36,508
And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well,

317
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,695
then you are gambling more than pete rose--

318
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:41,475
major league baseball's all-time hit leader,

319
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:46,327
a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world-- ever

320
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:50,127
"allegedly" did!

321
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:53,851
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, ipod.

322
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,230
Give him his ball back right now.

323
00:15:58,231 --> 00:15:59,742
People are going to get fired.

324
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,889
No, they're not.

325
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,852
It's just a tantrum, ted.

326
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:04,931
I saw this in kindergarten all the time.

327
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:10,045
This isn't kindergarten.Mr. Druthers is an adult,and he wants his ball back.

328
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:13,026
All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.

329
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:15,291
No. You'll give it back or you're fired.

330
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,764
I'm sorry, ted.I just can't do that.

331
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:19,664
Then you're fired.

332
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:21,453
Fine.

333
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,834
Here's the ball.

334
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:27,696
At least you have one now.

335
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,034
Dude,you're killing me.

336
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,626
You didn't tame the cougar.You just made her angrier.

337
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:40,267
Do you not see the powerbar in my hand?

338
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,412
I'm fueling up.

339
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,217
So you're going back over there?

340
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:48,199
Oh, yeah. And tonight,just like john mellencamp,

341
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,439
I am going to get rid of the "cougar" once and for all.

342
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,697
Get it?

343
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:56,886
'Cause that's what he did with his name.

344
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,627
I can't stop thinking about you.

345
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,759
Please give me another chance.

346
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,298
Barney, I teach all day.It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.

347
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,538
But you don't understand.See, I've been going easy on you, holding back,

348
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,171
'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something.

349
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,364
But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes--

350
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:27,805
days, weeks, half a year.

351
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,695
Fine.Come in.

352
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:34,279
You can start while I finish grading some papers.

353
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,721
Hurry up.Clients will be here any moment.

354
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:41,056
Now, slide it closer to his chair.

355
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:45,415
I want this thing to really smack him in the face.

356
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,002
Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about lily.

357
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:50,490
Oh. Well, I pity her.

358
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:54,498
I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note...

359
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,743
you might say that lily was mentally deranged.

360
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,468
You might say that, ted.

361
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,657
Lily was mentally deranged.

362
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:10,641
You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.

363
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,874
Lily was mentally deranged!

364
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:18,274
Oh! That's a bit harsh,don't you think, ted?

365
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,552
The clients are here.

366
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,545
Excellent. Bring them in.

367
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:25,774
Our client was a major bank and financial services company in spokane.

368
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:30,905
They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.

369
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:32,394
Ladies and gentlemen,

370
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:37,992
I give you the spokane national bank building.

371
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,914
That's a penis!

372
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:46,978
That'S... that's ridiculous.

373
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:52,670
There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.

374
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:55,099
We're not building a penis.

375
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,930
You got any other ideas?

376
00:18:57,931 --> 00:19:00,171
Other ideas?

377
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,333
You said you wanted hammond druthers.

378
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,865
This is hammond druthers.

379
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:08,024
Well, hats off to your ladyfriends,

380
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:10,407
but I'm not building it.

381
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,683
We're done here.

382
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:15,795
The trajectory of my entire career might have been different

383
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:19,696
had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.

384
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:21,623
Wait!

385
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,154
We have one more idea for you.

386
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,372
ted,What are you doing?

387
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:27,633
I have another design.

388
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,028
Sit down, shut up right now.

389
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:31,877
No.

390
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:43,827
to ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories probably!

391
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:46,232
Probably!

392
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,506
Congrats, ted.

393
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:52,896
Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to druthers and pitch my idea.

394
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:55,469
Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.

395
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,847
Oh. You know what, ted?

396
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,512
That was very nice.

397
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,382
You have earned these screws back.

398
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:06,479
Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.

399
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,879
Hey, I'm project manager now,so, if you want your old job back...

400
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,318
no, thanks.

401
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,766
I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.

402
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:22,191
casey, that's not how we treat people.

403
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:26,328
You'll get this back
when you learn to be nice.

404
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,212
Sbarney! Oh, my god!

405
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:40,122
What happened?

406
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,445
He broke his hip.

407
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:47,641
That's not true.It's just temporarily dislocated.

408
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,017
Seriously, I'm fine.

409
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:50,876
No, he's not fine.

410
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:52,679
Professor lewis, hi.

411
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,343
Mr. Eriksen. Hello.I graded your paper tonight.

412
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,274
I was pleasantly surprised.

413
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,539
Yeah, she was.

414
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:03,889
B-plus.

415
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,566
B-plus?!

416
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,342
Marshall,

417
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:12,510
after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy,
I am going to get you that "a"!

418
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:14,125
Let her go.

419
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:17,700
She belongs out there in the wild.

420
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:19,637
You should feel proud.

421
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:23,220
You fought the cougar and lived.

422
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:25,778
It was an amazing safari.

423
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:30,296
I can't wait to show you guys the slides.
