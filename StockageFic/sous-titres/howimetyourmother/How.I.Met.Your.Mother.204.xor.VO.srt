Yeah, you did.

36
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:13,663
That wasn't one.

???

40
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:31,614
It obviously ended well.

41
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:32,814
I mean, you're here with me.

42
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,280
Actually, it didn't end at all.

43
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,681
I started getting bummed
out, so I came here.

44
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:37,914
It's what I do.

45
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,514
When my grandma died,
I got a perm.

46
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,180
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

47
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:46,014
The thing is,
Ted has been literally

48
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,380
complaining about work
nonstop for weeks.

49
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,380
So, when I
came over today,

50
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:51,814
I was kind of done.

51
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,313
Hey.
Hey.

52
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,881
How was your day?
Good.

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,081
Wow, you're
a great interviewer.

54
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:00,313
Aren't you gonna ask
how my day was?

55
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,148
No, I know how it was.
It was awful.

56
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,647
Ooh, you want to rent
a movie tonight?

57
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,847
You know, um...

58
00:02:06,914 --> 00:02:09,148
I listen to your work
stories all the time.

59
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,514
Yeah, but...

60
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,148
and I don't want
to be rude here,

61
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,313
but my work stories
are interesting.

62
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,814
I'm a television
news reporter.

63
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,547
Robin...
What?

64
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:20,380
I knew exactly what
he was going to say.

65
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,081
I was just helping him
get there faster.

66
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:25,380
You should work at
a suicide hotline.

67
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,414
And then it got ugly.

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,781
What I don't do is tell you the
same story over and over again.

69
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,714
I mean, you wouldn't
watch the same movie

70
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,347
over and over again, would you?

71
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:36,380
Maybe

72
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,547
a great movie like <i>Die Hard.</i>

73
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:40,148
But <i>Field of Dreams?</i>

74
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:41,781
Once is more than enough.

75
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,347
So that's your go-to bad movie?

76
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:48,514
The number one

77
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,747
example on the tip
of your tongue

78
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:52,414
of a bad movie
is <i>Field of Dreams?</i>

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,447
It's about ghost
baseball players.

80
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,280
I think it's stupid.

81
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:00,247
(stammers)

82
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,547
So, now he's all mad at me
about the stupid movie.

83
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:06,647
Robin, he's upset because you
wouldn't listen to him,

84
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,714
not because you didn't like
some movie.

85
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:11,081
How do you not like
<i>Field of Dreams?!</i>

86
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:16,380
Listening is the foundation
of a relationship.

87
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,213
And if he's really droning on,

88
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,614
you can always practice saying
the alphabet backwards.

89
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,048
You know, in case you get pulled
over for a DUI.

90
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:24,747
I guess I don't know
how to do that.

91
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,981
Yeah, it's really hard,
even when you're sober.

92
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,213
That's what I tried to explain
to the cop.

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,547
No, I mean, I guess I don't know
how to do this girlfriend thing.

94
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:34,280
I've never been in
a relationship

95
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,114
this serious before.

96
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,847
I should probably go tell him
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

97
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,647
You're trying to do it
right now, aren't you?

98
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:45,981
What the hell comes before "Q"?

99
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,614
Then at the end
of the movie

100
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,847
when he has a catch with his
dad, like...

101
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:54,280
like he never did when he was
young enough for it to matter.

102
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,380
Can we talk about
something else?

103
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,647
You know what, dude?

104
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:01,081
Forget about Robin, okay?

105
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,247
You're hanging
with us tonight.

106
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:03,847
I've got an awesome
party lined up.

107
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,414
Oh, God.

108
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,881
This gonna be another one of
your weird all-guy parties?

109
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:11,647
That was a poker game.
What is wrong with you?

110
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:14,681
No, it's the first law
school party of the year

111
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,148
and it's gonna be awesome.

112
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:18,048
I haven't seen this guys
since, like, last year

113
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,580
before Lily and I broke up.

114
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,814
So I'm gonna have to
break the news to everybody.

115
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,213
It's really gonna bum them out.

116
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:26,380
This party's gonna suck.

117
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:30,081
Well, love to join
you at that one.

118
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:32,814
But I got tickets
to Foxy Boxing.

119
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,280
I wish I could join you guys,

120
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,614
but I got to get back
to my apparently boring job.

121
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:38,014
Your job's not boring.

122
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,414
Robin thinks so.

123
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,614
Dude, lots of chicks think
architects are hot.

124
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,914
Think about it, you create
something out of nothing.

125
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:45,180
You're like God.

126
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:47,247
There's nobody
hotter than God.

127
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:49,380
I love it when
you quote Scripture.

128
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:52,114
I'm telling you, you should use
the architect angle

129
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,414
with the ladies.

130
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,547
Okay, first of all,
I have a girlfriend.

131
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,947
Second, the architect angle
doesn't even work on her.

132
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,081
And, third, I can't imagine that
working on anyone ever.

133
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:03,213
That's 'cause you're always
like...

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,814
(dull):
Ted Mosby, architect.

135
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:07,981
If it were me,

136
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,048
I'd be like...

137
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:11,447
(suave):
Ted Mosby, architect.

138
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,614
Anything sounds
impressive

139
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,414
when it's said with
the right attitude.

140
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,514
(clears throat)

141
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,847
Marshall Ericksen.

142
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:21,014
Recently dumped and
heading to a lame party.

143
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,213
Whoa.

144
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,213
Whoa, ladies,
please take it easy.

145
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,580
There's enough of me
for everyone.

146
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,781
Oh. Hi. Hello.

147
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:29,781
All right.
We're gonna take off.

148
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,681
Wait up, I'll leave
with you guys.

149
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:35,048
Ted Mosby, architect.

150
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,380
(clicks tongue):
Trust me.

151
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,380
Hey, just out of curiosity.

152
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,247
if a guy told you
he was an architect,

153
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:52,447
what would you
think of that?

154
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:53,714
Are you kidding?

155
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,280
Architects are hot.

156
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:59,247
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?

157
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:00,981
Solid point.

158
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,547
She did have hair of gold.

159
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,347
Yes, she did.
Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:10,714
Hey, Carl,
is Ted still here?

161
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:11,914
No.

162
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,213
Hey, Lily.

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,313
You still single?

164
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,747
Yes.

165
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,280
You know...

166
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:19,347
I've poured a lot of free drinks
for you over the years.

167
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:20,614
A lot.

168
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,313
Carl, do you really want
to be with a woman

169
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,114
who would trade sex for beer?

170
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,881
Only if you're into it.

171
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:29,747
It's on me.

172
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:30,580
Thanks.

173
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,580
I wonder where Ted went.

174
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:35,048
Ted Mosby,
the architect?

175
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:37,714
Actually, yeah.

176
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,747
Oh, he is such
a cool guy.

177
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:41,280
He was here earlier.

178
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:42,781
And what made you decide

179
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,414
you wanted to become
an architect?

180
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,347
Well, you know,
soul of an artist,

181
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,414
hands of a master
craftsman.

182
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,313
It was inevitable,
I guess.

183
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,747
I bet you can draw,
can't you?

184
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,313
(chuckles modestly)

185
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,747
You should draw me.

186
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,681
Well, I could try,
but you might end up

187
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,414
looking like
a midcentury tri-level.

188
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,313
(laughing)

189
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,480
Hey.

190
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:04,881
If you want,
my friend Marshall

191
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:05,914
invited me to this party
we could all go to.

192
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:06,981
Marshall's eat.

193
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,313
He's just a lawyer,

194
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,981
but somebody has to
push the paper around

195
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:12,014
for us creative types.
Am I right?

196
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,148
Yeah.
(laughing)

197
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,981
He asked her to a party.

198
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,681
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

199
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:19,148
Okay? It's awesome.

200
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,881
It's a win-win.
Ted got to vent

201
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,247
and I don't have to hear it.

202
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,814
Maybe after he's done
with the talkie-talk,

203
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,647
he'll come over and
I'll get the fun part.

204
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,647
What is wrong with you?

205
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:31,447
God, I feel like I'm teaching
love as a second language here.

206
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:32,614
Okay,

207
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:34,213
you know how
when he tells you

208
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,114
boring work stories
you're supposed to listen?

209
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,447
Well, when he picks up
some random girl at a bar,

210
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:41,213
You're supposed to freak out.

211
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,514
I'm not freaking out because
in my mind, she's fat.

212
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,380
She's a kickboxing instructor.

213
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:50,148
Her ass looks better
than my face.

214
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,247
All right, we'll
swing by the party.

215
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,847
<i>Now the party was for some of</i>
<i>Marshall's classmates</i>

216
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:59,647
<i>from Columbia Law School,</i>

217
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,580
<i>who by day were</i>
<i>some of the sharpest</i>

218
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,213
<i>and most serious young</i>
<i>legal minds in the country.</i>

219
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,681
<i>By night, however...</i>

220
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,547
(loud music playing)
Ooh...

221
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,048
Damn,

222
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,647
these are some
drunk almost-lawyers.

223
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:11,681
Okay!

224
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:12,914
Seriously...

225
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:15,881
who wants to shave my ass?!

226
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,847
<i>That guy went on to become</i>
<i>a Supreme Court justice.</i>

227
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:22,048
Okay, where are the guys
and the hooker?

228
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:24,048
Yo, what's up, ladies?

229
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:26,347
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

230
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,313
Just need you to sign this
release protecting the host

231
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,148
from any and all responsibility
should you harm yourself

232
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:31,614
or a third party.

233
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,814
Then freakin' rage!

234
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,347
Yeah!
Hey,

235
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,747
drunk legal dude, um...

236
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:37,081
have you seen
Marshall Ericksen?

237
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:38,514
He was with a guy
named Ted.

238
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,514
You mean Ted Mosby,
the architect?

239
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,313
Man, what a visionary.

240
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,947
Yeah, they were here.

241
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:48,347
Awards are nice,
they look good on my shelf.

242
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:50,114
But none of that acclaim
means anything

243
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,347
compared to the joy
seeing the sun rise

244
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,114
over your first building.

245
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,480
Wow.

246
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,781
I would love to watch
the sun rise with you.

247
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:00,380
I know you would.

248
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,148
It's the job.

249
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,480
Dude.

250
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,247
You should let us
shave your ass tonight.

251
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,213
No way.

252
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,213
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?

253
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,881
I didn't want to ruin the party
for everybody this early,

254
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:18,081
but, uh... everyone take a seat.

255
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:25,447
Um... Lily actually called off
the wedding this summer

256
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,881
to go to San Francisco.

257
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,114
So...

258
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,313
we're broken up.

259
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,914
Her name wasn't on
your lease, was it?

260
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:36,347
'Cause if not,
New York state law,

261
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:37,514
you're not obligated
to give her

262
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,647
half the deposit
when you move.

263
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:42,447
Yeah, that's not really the part
I was worried about, guys.

264
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,747
And don't forget
the precedent set by

265
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,681
<i>Smith v. Rosenblatt,</i> '74.

266
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,747
Any personal effects
she left in your house

267
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:50,847
or dwelling become
yours after 30 days.

268
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:51,847
(murmuring)

269
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,614
Guys, can we
cease and desist

270
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:55,247
with the lawyer speak
for a minute?

271
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:57,148
Love died.

272
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,414
The love that made you all
believe in love,

273
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,347
that's dead now.

274
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,280
You should sue her.

275
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:06,814
Uh, really?
On what ground, Kara?

276
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:10,180
On the grounds
of... shut up.

277
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,148
<i>That's our attorney general.</i>

278
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,814
(giggling)

279
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,814
See? Marshall's still
hung up on our breakup.

280
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:21,714
Why? Because I listened to him.

281
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:23,247
It was a strong

282
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:26,847
and nurturing relationship
that I threw away like old gum.

283
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:29,881
Not that I'm worried
or anything,

284
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:32,048
but, um, back to the sun rising
over Ted and, uh...

285
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,148
oh, what tasteful way
did you describe her?

286
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,213
The girl with the smackable ass.

287
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,247
Yes, that's
the young lady.

288
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,547
So, I know the bouncer

289
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,881
at this techno
club, Posers.

290
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,347
Do you feel like dancing?

291
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:46,547
Yeah, okay.

292
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:48,180
There is no way
Ted went dancing.

293
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,714
Ted hates clubs.

294
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,048
Hell, yeah.
I love clubs.

295
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:54,313
I mean, I was going to
design a cathedral tonight,

296
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,180
kind of take a whack at
the whole relationship

297
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:57,414
between God and man
conundrum.

298
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,881
But sure,
let's go dancing.

299
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,247
(squeals)
Wait, let me just check
with my friend.

300
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:02,081
Okay.
Hey, Marshall.

301
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,714
You up for some super loud,

302
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,814
repetitive music that hasn't
changed since the mid-90s?

303
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,981
Um... only always.

304
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,081
Let's go.

305
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,514
Dancing? He went dancing
with this girl?

306
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,313
Okay, maybe this is
a little bad.

307
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,547
Dancing is bad.

308
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,014
Dancing leads to sex.

309
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:21,280
Did you grow up
in that <i>Footloose</i> town?

310
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,881
I'm calling him.
I'm telling him

311
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,280
that I was wrong
and I'm sorry,

312
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:26,881
and I totally want to listen
to his stupid stories.

313
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,947
Yeah, think of another way
to phrase that

314
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,180
and you'll be fine.

315
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:34,247
He's not answering.

316
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:36,014
Calling Marshall.

317
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,547
(synthesized dance music)
Hello.

318
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:42,180
Marshall, hi, it's Robin.
Can I talk to Ted?

319
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,014
Oh, Robin, hi.

320
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:46,580
Um, no, Ted's not here
tonight.

321
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:47,847
He's, uh... he's working.

322
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:51,280
Uh, okay. Bye.

323
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,914
Marshall just lied.

324
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
??

325
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,230
Excuse me.

326
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,464
I'm looking for a couple
guys who came in here earlier.

327
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,897
One's about six-four,
210, sandy brown hair.

328
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,997
And the other's
a cheating bastard.

329
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:11,364
You're going to need
to refresh my memory.

330
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,830
Okay, fella, baby knows
how this game's played.

331
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:17,997
How's a $20 help
your memory?

332
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,597
Thanks, but seriously,
it was crazy tonight.

333
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:23,664
You really do need
to refresh my memory.

334
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:24,963
Then can I have the...?

335
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,764
That's cool. You keep that.

336
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,764
So these guys--
one of them's an architect.

337
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,364
Ted Mosby, the architect?

338
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,397
That's the one.

339
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,464
Oh, yeah, he was here.

340
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:37,364
And then I was all,
"No, Frank Gehry.

341
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:38,963
you're on your
own this time."

342
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,164
And that, my dear, was the
end of that hack's career.

343
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,564
I live across the street.

344
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,897
That is one hell
of a non sequitur.

345
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,197
You want to come over?

346
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,064
Well, I don't know.

347
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,264
But I suppose I should at
least give you a ride home.

348
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,531
Hop on.

349
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:56,698
I'll see you
at book club, Vinny.

350
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:58,397
I'll be bringing the crudit\s.

351
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:00,963
Nice. Giddyap.

352
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,731
Dude, dude, what
are you doing?

353
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:03,764
Galloping.

354
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,364
You proved it, all right?

355
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,897
The whole Ted Mosby,
architect things works.

356
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,698
Architects rule!
Whoo-hee!

357
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:12,397
Aren't you a little worried
that a certain somebody

358
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,030
might find out that
you're doing this?

359
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,497
This isn't you, Ted.

360
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:16,597
It is tonight.

361
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:17,863
(neighing)

362
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,030
Whoo!

363
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,597
You know this girl.
Where does she live?

364
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,464
I'm not telling you that
for less than 20 bucks.

365
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,764
Well, I'm out of money.
I'm cashed, too.

366
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,130
I'll take your purse.
My purse?

367
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:33,497
Yeah, my girl
likes clutches.

368
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,631
Okay, fine.

369
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,798
You should tell her

370
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:40,497
that looks really good
with a chocolate boot.

371
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,030
Bitch is lucky I brought
my small purse.

372
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,331
No room for my gun.

373
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:46,930
Here.

374
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,497
Now where does
the rodeo slut live?

375
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:51,698
The building with the green
light, apartment 3-C.

376
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,930
Oh, my God, Robin,

377
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:56,064
are you going to kick
this girl's ass?

378
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,930
Yeah... and steal her purse.

379
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:04,564
I can't believe
he's cheating on me.

380
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,464
You know how many times
I could have cheated?

381
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:07,863
Six... no seven.

382
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,830
And you know two of them,
and they would surprise you.

383
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,863
(whispers):
3-C, let's do this.

384
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,164
You ready?

385
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,830
Should I just kick the door in?

386
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,863
Those are really nice heels
and you already lost the purse.

387
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,997
Let's see if it's unlocked.

388
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:20,897
(whispers):
It's unlocked.

389
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:21,930
Okay, get in there

390
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:24,564
and kick
some spankable ass.

391
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:28,798
Robin.

392
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,997
I'm the problem.

393
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,264
What?

394
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,664
You were right.

395
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,097
I don't know how to be
a girlfriend.

396
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:36,830
I took the nicest guy
in the world

397
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,331
and I made him a cheater.

398
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,798
Well, don't stand out here
and beat yourself up.

399
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:42,764
Get in there and beat Ted up.

400
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,064
I'll handle the slutty
kickboxer.

401
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,497
Actually, I'll take Ted.

402
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:48,230
Let's do this.

403
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:49,331
Bring it.

404
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,631
What do you think you're...?

405
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:14,264
Barney?

406
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,464
Thank God you're here.

407
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,097
Can you help with this?
I need nails.

408
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,097
Okay, I'm totally
lost here.

409
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:21,297
Where's Ted?

410
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,863
Ted? He's at work.

411
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,631
How did you get here?

412
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:26,564
Awesome story.

413
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:28,631
As per usual.

414
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:31,464
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?

415
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,863
Solid point.

416
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,631
And she did have
hair of gold.

417
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:35,863
Yes, she did.

418
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,331
Sorry, I forgot my binocs
for Foxy Boxing.

419
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:41,030
Whoo, looks like things just got
a little foxier right here.

420
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:42,698
Yes, they did.
And you're just in time.

421
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:43,830
Girls, I got to go,

422
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:44,963
but I'm leaving
you in very good,

423
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,331
if slightly sullied hands.

424
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:49,064
Don't go.
We don't even
know your name

425
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,564
to look out for
your buildings.

426
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,497
Yeah, stay.

427
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:54,230
Excuse us for one second.

428
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:56,731
Okay, you were right--

429
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,798
the architect thing
totally works.
Mm-hmm.

430
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,297
But I've got a girlfriend

431
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:01,731
and I've got to get
back to work.

432
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:03,897
This project is getting
harder and harder.

433
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,897
Yeah, you did.

434
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,164
Yeah, had to.

435
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,297
See ya.

436
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,297
Sorry, my, uh...

437
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,197
intern had to leave.

438
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,897
Oh, well, that's too bad.

439
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,698
I'm Anna, by the way.

440
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:22,431
Ted Mosby...
(clicks tongue) architect.

441
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:24,531
But none of that acclaim
means anything

442
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,997
compared to the joy
of seeing the sun rise

443
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,431
over your first building.

444
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,464
Giddyap.
(Barney neighing)

445
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,264
Dude, dude,
what are you doing?

446
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,431
Galloping.

447
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,564
All right, you proved it.

448
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:37,830
The whole Ted Mosby,
architect thing works.

449
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,798
Architects rule!
Whoo-hoo.

450
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:42,364
Aren't you afraid
a certain somebody

451
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:43,664
might find out
about this?

452
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:45,297
I mean, this isn't you, <i>Ted.</i>

453
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,963
It is tonight.

454
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:50,764
And that led to a couple
of hours

455
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,731
that I cannot, as a gentleman,
divulge to you.

456
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,064
We did it right here,
and here and here.

457
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:00,963
But why would you use
Ted's name?

458
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,863
I've had some recent
bad press on the World Wide Web.

459
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,164
So I'm taking a T.O.

460
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,897
on the whole
"using my real name" thing.

461
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:10,064
Oh, this is great.

462
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,064
It wasn't Ted.

463
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,531
Everything's okay.

464
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:13,731
Everything isn't okay.

465
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,164
Look at me.

466
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,531
I'm acting crazy and jealous
and paranoid.

467
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:21,431
This is how people act
in relationships.

468
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:24,164
And that's why I avoid
relationships.

469
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,264
Well, guess what,

470
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:29,464
I haven't been crazy or jealous
or paranoid in months,

471
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,930
and I really miss it.

472
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,631
And thus ended this chapter of,
"Let's pour our hearts out

473
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,264
in the bedroom of Barney's
one-night stand."

474
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,564
Come on, let's go before
she gets out of the shower.

475
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:40,764
You're such a pig.

476
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,364
You're not even going
to say good-bye?

477
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:45,897
I'll have you know I composed
a lovely form letter

478
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,698
for use in just
such an occasion.

479
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,064
Just fill out her name
and then...

480
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,130
Something with a "A."

481
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,297
A... A...

482
00:17:57,364 --> 00:17:59,897
I'll just put "resident."

483
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:02,464
(door creaking)

484
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,230
Go, go, go, go.

485
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,897
<i>Robin took a long walk</i>
<i>that night.</i>

486
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:15,497
<i>She thought about how opening</i>
<i>yourself up to another person</i>

487
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:18,531
<i>usually means opening yourself</i>
<i>up to going a little crazy.</i>

488
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:23,064
<i>She thought about how much</i>
<i>easier it was just to be alone.</i>

489
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,497
<i>And then she came to see me.</i>

490
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:30,064
* And I am nothing
of a builder *

491
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,731
* But here I dreamt
I was an architect... *

492
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,997
Hey.
Hey.

493
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:38,130
What are you doing here?

494
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,863
I brought donuts.

495
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,397
And I don't want to brag,
but they're filled with jelly.

496
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:44,464
Thanks.

497
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:49,230
So, uh... how was your night?

498
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,164
It was... fine.

499
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,664
Nothing exciting.

500
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,197
How was yours?

501
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:59,097
You really want to hear
about boring architect stuff?

502
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,531
Yes, I do.

503
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:02,963
I'm sorry about earlier.

504
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,830
To tell
you the truth,

505
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:07,731
I never even saw all
of <i>Field of Dreams.</i>

506
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,130
I fell asleep half way through.

507
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:11,863
What? The best part's
the last 20 minutes.

508
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,798
Well, maybe they should have
moved that part up

509
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,197
a little bit
earlier, 'cause...

510
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,764
You know what,um...

511
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,331
What I'm trying to say is...

512
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:22,164
I love being the person
you bitch to.

513
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,698
So how was your day,
Mr. Architect?

514
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,698
Oh, I like the way
you say that.

515
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,331
Hey, you want to see
the building

516
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:36,698
that will make every man
in Spokane feel inadequate?
Obviously.

517
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,097
Wow.
Yeah.

518
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,297
You know, you
didn't mention

519
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,364
all the foliage
around the base.

520
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,431
If you trim that back,
the rest would look bigger.

521
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,830
You don't have
to tell me.

522
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,164
And, um...

523
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,397
Just for fun, I've...

524
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,431
I've sort of been
working on my own idea

525
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:55,497
of what I think
the building should be.

526
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,030
What do you think?

527
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:04,230
<i>You know that time we went</i>
<i>to Spokane</i>

528
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:06,698
<i>and I pointed out</i>
<i>that skyscraper?</i>

529
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:09,130
<i>That was the first building</i>
<i>I ever designed.</i>

530
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:10,830
<i>And that night</i>
<i>was the first time</i>

531
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:13,830
<i>I showed anyone</i>
<i>my first drawing of it.</i>

532
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,564
Wow.

533
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,030
Ted, this is amazing.

534
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,030
Thanks.

535
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,997
It's not like it will

536
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:26,030
I don't know.

537
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,331
It might come to something.

538
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:33,297
You know, girls find
architects very hot.

539
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:43,130
Okay, but I don't
want you expecting 78
stories or anything.

540
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:44,863
(chuckles)

541
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:51,364
~= <i>"Dear Resident...</i>

542
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:55,064
<i>"The time we spent together,</i>
<i>however long it was,</i>

543
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,830
<i>"meant the world to me.</i>

544
00:20:56,897 --> 00:21:00,030
<i>"I would love to see you again,</i>
<i>but unfortunately, I cannot.</i>

545
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:03,097
<i>"You see, I am a ghost.</i>

546
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:06,497
<i>"I can't only materialize</i>
<i>once every decade</i>

547
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,631
<i>"on the anniversary</i>

548
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:12,231

549
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:14,297
<i>"sweet... Resident.</i>

550
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,830
<i>"Perhaps we will meet again</i>

00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:25,264
<i>Until then, all my love</i>

553
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,830
Barney?

554
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:29,824
???
