00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,314
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,959
- Neil.
- Julie.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,109
What a nice surprise.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,157
Marissa's a real
chip off the old block.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,959
I couldn't agree with you more.
Brains, beauty.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,109
That surgeon...

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,192
...convinced the guy Johnny would make
a full recovery. He's back on the team.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,237
- Thank you.
- She deserves to be happy.

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,992
I'm taking Kaitlin
to go look at new ponies.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,674
Whatever no longer fits,
we'll just send it to your sister.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,116
Thank God Kaitlin's going to boarding
school. This is no place for a child.

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,748
It's just not right for a little girl
to love a hairless pony.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,673
- Why do you keep touching your face?
- Last night, before I went to bed...

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,400
...I had the sensation of a pimple
about to surface.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,597
This morning,
skin's as clear as a smogless sky.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,637
And that's a problem because...?

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,234
- Ryan, don't you see?
- Not so much.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,868
Things are going way too well
around here.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,519
What?

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,159
Marissa got back into Harbor.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,039
You guys seem to have resolved
your surf-tastic love triangle.

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,636
My girlfriend got a near perfect score
on her SATs. We've never been happier.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,756
Senior year is supposed to be
the best year.

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,114
No, you should know better.

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,317
Every time things are going too well,
doom comes a-knocking.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,790
- Doom?
- A-knocking.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,952
Or a-ringing.

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,592
Right on time. Don't answer it.
It's probably a flaming bag of crap.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,270
Or FedEx.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,592
Yeah?

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,351
So I show up at my house
to surprise my mom...

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,351
...and this Persian dude
answers the door.

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,436
- I'm sorry?
- I figured he was the new butler.

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,160
But then I saw his shoes. Prada.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,875
I thought maybe he's my new stepdad.

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,076
And I was about to, like, hug him...

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,276
...and then his wife shows up.

38
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,477
No matter how rich the guy is,
my mother would never join a harem.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,517
- I don't...
- So I was like, " Persian dude...

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,319
...what are you doing at my house,
and where is my mother?"

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,072
He was like, "Who's your mother?"

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,559
So I told him...

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,110
...and he tells me that my mother moved
and the mail is being forwarded here.

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,158
- I think you may have...
- Are you gonna invite me in or what?

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,359
Jeez, Ryan. I see Newport
hasn't improved your manners at all.

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,279
Oh, my God.

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,237
Oh, my God. Kaitlin Cooper?

48
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,992
Weird neighbor kid. Hi.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,639
- You've... You've grown...
- Boobs?

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,759
No, I...

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,111
Oh, it's a-knocking.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,238
Kaitlin Cooper? Must be
two years since she's been back.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,834
She mention why she's home
in the middle of a semester?

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,718
We never really got past
where home was.

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,270
Oh, Julie wants us to wait
until she gets here before we tell Kaitlin...

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,034
Her family's a prime candidate
for <i>Pimp My Double-Wide?</i>

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,997
Hey, guys, good morning.
You ready to go?

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,799
Third day of the <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
mini-series in English.

59
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,678
Summer, the show you're about to see...

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,990
...has the makings of a classic
Jane Austen novel.

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,436
You've got sisters, lies and bosoms.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,352
- Kaitlin's back.
- Mini Cooper?

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,556
- Mini Coop not so mini.
- Kaitlin?

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,435
- Where's my baby?
- She's getting herself together.

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,352
The kid's a little confused.

66
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,033
Don't know what I'm gonna tell her.

67
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,158
I wanted to protect her from everything
that's gone on around here.

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,833
Shootings, funerals, public school.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,195
Well, just explain it to her.
She'll understand.

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,954
You might've. You're your
father's daughter. Kaitlin's me.

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,509
- She's not gonna want our life.
- She came home.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,238
She wants her family
more than anything.

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,719
Mom?

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,751
Oh, baby.

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,669
Mom.

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,512
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,074
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,431
Do you even look at my calendar?

79
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,749
It's mid-winter break.

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,073
I knew that.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,549
I just... I figured...
Isn't it Fashion Week?

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,518
I thought you'd be in Paris
with Alexandra like last year.

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,194
Front row at Chanel.
I saw the photo on Wirelmage.

84
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,112
I thought that you'd be happy
to see me.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,152
Well, I am. Of course.

86
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,912
Hey, we're so happy to see you.

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,396
So that guy at Caleb's said you moved.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,268
I think we're gonna be late
for school, guys.

89
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,512
- Can I talk to you about the launch party?
- I love discussing a party.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,639
I'm gonna be late for school too.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,836
- Let's do something later and catch up.
- Okay.

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,236
- Bye.
- Bye.

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,799
Okay, so, what's going on?

94
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,677
Okay, do you remember that e-mail
I sent you about Caleb?

95
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,230
There were some
financial complications afterwards.

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,597
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,911
- We live in a trailer.
- Well, yes.

98
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,148
But not "live" live.

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,639
We're more like refugees.

100
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,720
We're only a half a mile
from the beach, and, well...

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,874
...it's Tiffany Blue.

102
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,873
Oh, honey, this is so temporary.
Once Kirsten's and my business is...

103
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,952
...up and running everything's
gonna be like it was.

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,031
So let's go inside.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,519
And then you pull it open like this...

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,592
...and voilà, it's a bed.

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,473
That's versatile.

108
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,914
Oh, honey.

109
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,389
I'm sorry. I know this isn't
what you're used to.

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,279
But think of it as a life experience.

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,510
It's the kind of place
Britney Spears is from.

112
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,114
Mom, it's okay. Really.

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,273
I mean, it's like a slumber party.
The three of us, here.

114
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,359
You still have this puppy
Marissa gave you.

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,239
Though you didn't care
until you found out he was a purse...

116
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,470
...you could put
your pretend credit cards in.

117
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,438
Yeah, it was that summer in Tahoe.
The whole family together.

118
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,829
I guess it's sentimental.

119
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,474
Let's get our nails done.

120
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,949
I wanna hear everything you've
been up to in Montecito.

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,192
I'm supposed to help Kirsten
with our launch, but she'll understand.

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,153
You got a message?
Somebody from school?

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,559
A boy?

124
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,518
My little girl's growing up.

125
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,952
I'm gonna call Kirsten.

126
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,756
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,991
<i>I can 't believe</i>
<i>you just took off like that.</i>

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,072
<i>Don 't think that just because</i>
<i>you left town I'm gonna...</i>

129
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,199
It's just the Kaitlin I know
is obsessed with her hairless pony.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,910
I feel like I missed
this whole part of her life.

131
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,559
Puberty?

132
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,075
- And it's all my fault.
- What are you talking about?

133
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,437
Well, I mean, it's not like
I ever tried to keep in touch.

134
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,477
In fact, we were never really close.

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,551
It was always her and Mom
versus me and Dad.

136
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,233
She's home now. You can fix that.

137
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,516
You talking about Kaitlin's
transformation from...

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,477
...horsey tweener to
lanky-limbed jailbait?

139
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,674
Cohen, one more pervy word
about Coop's not-so-mini Coop...

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,229
...and I may have to staple
your tongue to your collar.

141
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,358
- There you are! Hi!
- Hey, Taylor.

142
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,954
Thanks so much for everything
at that meeting last week.

143
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,633
Oh, of course.

144
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,315
You were Ionely at that school.
You had no friends. No one to talk to.

145
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,755
Kind of like Charlton Heston
in <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

146
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,512
I think that was Mark Wahlberg.

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,069
Actually, I had a couple good friends.

148
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,675
But not like our group here.

149
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,719
Right?

150
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,155
- I should get to class.
- Me too.

151
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,155
The poor thing.

152
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,357
It must be really hard for her,
re-adjusting.

153
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,192
Kind of like coming back from Nam.

154
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,315
Thankfully, she has us.

155
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,999
Hey, you all right?

156
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,718
Taylor can be a little Taylor.

157
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,555
No, she just made me realize I haven't
talked to Johnny since I got here.

158
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,075
I mean, I've left him messages.

159
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,476
The tour starts soon.
I hope he hasn't left yet.

160
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,359
No, I don't think he'd do that.

161
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,478
Why don't you try,
what's his name, Bizzaro Seth?

162
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,359
Chili? Right, I could.

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,034
- Thanks.
- No problem. All right, see you at lunch.

164
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,839
Dude, will you please
just call her back?

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,470
This sacrificing-your-happiness-for-hers
thing clearly is not working.

166
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,471
No, it wasn't a sacrifice, all right?

167
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,438
I just thought my life would be
simpler without her.

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,511
Yeah, it's real simpler.
You're miserable.

169
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,194
Dude, will you please
just take my phone and call her?

170
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,711
It's like I summoned her. Marissa.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,797
Hey, Chili, have you seen Johnny?

172
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,758
As a matter of fact,
Harper is right next to me.

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,196
Thanks. Hey, Marissa.

174
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,828
Hey, I called you a few times.
Did you get my messages?

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,639
Yeah, sorry, I've just been really busy.

176
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,951
- Of course. Packing and stuff.
- Yeah. Packing.

177
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,471
My sister's in town. I'd love
for you to meet her before you leave.

178
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,676
Oh, yeah, I don't know.
Maybe if I have time.

179
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,956
You're not gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

180
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,150
The diner, 4:30. Please?

181
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,638
I'll see you there.

182
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,439
- Veronica. What are you doing here?
- Hello, Kirsten.

183
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,956
I hear you and Julie
are starting a new dating service.

184
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,433
I want you to set me up
with the delicious Dr. Neil Roberts.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,992
The father of Marissa's best friend?

186
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,993
The girl you called Miss Columbine
at last week's board meeting?

187
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
- Do you really think he'd go out with you?
- Of course not.

188
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,589
lf, however, I could talk to him,
say, over a candlelit dinner...

189
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,871
...I'm sure I could
convince him that I was...

190
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,508
...just a concerned parent
looking out for her daughter.

191
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,069
- That's where you come in.
- And why would I help you?

192
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,468
Marissa's back at Harbor.

193
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,756
But her involvement
in after-school activities...

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,194
Senior Day, prom, graduation.

195
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,509
- is yet to be determined.

196
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,400
And I carry a lot of weight
with the Parents' Association.

197
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,518
You might say
I am the Parents' Association.

198
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,150
You're gonna hold a 17-year-old girl
hostage for a date?

199
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,595
A good man is hard to find, Kirsten.

200
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,990
I'm free tomorrow, if you're wondering.

201
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,631
You'll have the contracts by Friday.

202
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,872
Yeah. Oh, it's great, Sid.
I'll talk to you then.

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,789
Well, this is a wonderful surprise.

204
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,791
I wish it was.

205
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,716
Sandy, I have a problem.

206
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,388
Veronica Townsend came by
to see me this morning.

207
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,551
She wants me to set her up
with Neil Roberts.

208
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,909
Good luck.

209
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,436
She threatened to make Marissa's life
a living hell at Harbor if I don't.

210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
- And she can do it.
- We can't give in to threats like that.

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,992
We don't negotiate with the Newpsies.

212
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,674
I know. But Marissa's
been through a lot.

213
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,400
All Neil has to do is take her
out for dinner tomorrow.

214
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,120
What do you want me to do?
You've got the dating service.

215
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,475
- Neil isn't a client.
- And I'm not an employee.

216
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
No, but you are Sandy Cohen,
professional persuader.

217
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,193
You guys play golf together,
and you're guys.

218
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,672
And I'm calling in a wifely favor.

219
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,878
Just call?

220
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,039
Shopping was such a good idea.

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,509
Yeah. Even if it was at a thrift store.

222
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,990
Hey, vintage is very in right now.

223
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,312
So who are we meeting again?

224
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,118
My friend Johnny from Newport Union.

225
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,313
I guess he's going away
on this surfing trip, and...

226
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,359
- I just don't wanna lose touch, you know?
- Do I know about losing touch?

227
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,671
Kaitlin...

228
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,630
Mom, in her own deranged way,
was just trying to protect you.

229
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,950
And I was...

230
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,315
I don't know, but it won't happen again.

231
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,517
Yeah, I know, it's just,
I'm not a little kid anymore, you know.

232
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,989
I know. There they are.

233
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,314
Which one's Johnny?
Perfect Bone Structure or Carrot Top?

234
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,948
Yeah, you're definitely not a kid.
Hey, guys.

235
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,680
- Hey.
- So, Kaitlin, this is Chili and Johnny.

236
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,592
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

237
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,911
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hi. Thanks for coming.

238
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,198
So when do you leave?

239
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,873
- Next week.
- April.

240
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,031
Right, he leaves
next week for training.

241
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,918
Tour starts in April.

242
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,232
Dude, did I lock my car?
I think I forgot to lock...

243
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,832
Been a lot of thefts in the area lately.
He's got...

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,355
...a bunch of cassette tapes in there.

245
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,078
Can you excuse me?

246
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,674
Much coffee, small bladder.

247
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,073
What's going on?

248
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,754
Marissa, do I have to spell it out for you?

249
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,155
Okay, I guess I do.

250
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,869
Look, he knew that you weren't gonna go
back to Harbor while he was there, so...

251
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,992
He told me that he was leaving?

252
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,312
Oh, my God.

253
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,835
- Johnny.
- Hey.

254
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,756
So how long have you been in love
with my sister?

255
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,476
- We're just friends.
- Good.

256
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,915
Because I'm sure, as you know,
she's not available.

257
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,475
Unlike, say, me.

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,794
Yeah.

259
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,394
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,518
- Hi, this the Cohen house?
- It is. Can I help you?

261
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,830
I'm looking for someone.
I had the wrong address.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,718
Persian guy said I could find her here.

263
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,519
- Kaitlin Cooper?
- You a friend of hers?

264
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,830
I need to get ahold of her.
Is she here or not?

265
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,076
Look, man. I haven't seen Kaitlin
since she was 11 and rode a pony.

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,598
All right.

267
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,830
Well, if she shows up, call me?

268
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,112
It's important.

269
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,152
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

270
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,470
- Your sister around?
- No, she went out.

271
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,635
Can I help you?

272
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,758
Maybe.

273
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,072
There was this guy showed up
at the house last night looking for you.

274
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,796
- Justin?
- You know him?

275
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,194
He's from Montecito,
and he goes to Cate.

276
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,071
I met him at a mixer.

277
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,798
Is he your boyfriend?

278
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,552
I barely even spoke to the guy.

279
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,633
Then he kept on calling me.

280
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,791
Coming by my school.

281
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,476
I finally told my dorm mother,
and it got him in trouble.

282
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,632
And now he's like, " You're messing up
my chances in Princeton."

283
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,598
I can't believe that he showed up here. I
mean, I'd already changed my cell phone.

284
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,871
- All right. I'll take care of it.
- And you won't tell Marissa?

285
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,075
We're just starting
to get to know each other again.

286
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,708
And I don't want her to think
I'm some stalker magnet.

287
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,438
And I don't want her to worry.

288
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,792
- Hi.
- Hey.

289
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,396
- So, Chili...
- Told you?

290
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,278
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he was never one to keep a secret.

291
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,308
Well, what you did was pretty amazing.

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,231
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Yeah. I'm a real martyr.

293
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,471
So, what are you gonna do now?

294
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,871
- Since you're not going on tour.
- I hadn't really thought about it.

295
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,913
Well, you could always apply to college
for next January.

296
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,877
- No, I don't think so.
- I could help you.

297
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,678
Listen, Marissa...

298
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,555
...it's not your problem anymore.

299
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,839
You're back where you belong.

300
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,317
You know, my life...

301
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,279
...maybe it's not
to tour the world to surf...

302
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,198
...but I don't need you saving me.

303
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,032
- You did this incredible thing for me...
- Is that what you think?

304
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,073
I needed you to leave.

305
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,720
So I'm back at Harbor.

306
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,917
But what are you saying? That you
don't ever want to see me again?

307
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,798
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.

308
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,437
Right now, I just need you
out of my life.

309
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,559
Okay.

310
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,870
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Neil. Hey, it's Sandy.

311
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,157
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all, Sandy. How can I help you?

312
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,596
Well, there's a bit of a situation
with Marissa.

313
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,115
Anything I can do?
Marissa and her mom mean a lot to me.

314
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,192
Well, this is awkward.
You know Veronica Townsend?

315
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,716
Do I know Veronica Townsend? Sandy,
I know every former A-cup in this town.

316
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,440
What would you think
about having dinner with her tonight?

317
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,353
- You mean a date?
- Look, I know she is a bitch-on-wheels.

318
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,839
She wants to go out with you.

319
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,915
<i>She's willing to make Marissa 's life at</i>
<i>Harbor difficult if it doesn 't go through.</i>

320
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,433
Sandy, that's preposterous.

321
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,909
Wouldn't ask if I didn't think
she'd follow through.

322
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,438
<i>Look, it's one dinner.</i>
<i>Crowded restaurant, meet there.</i>

323
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,273
- Kirsten and I will pick up the tab.
- How horrible can it be?

324
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,908
Trust me, it'll be horrible. I owe you.

325
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,553
<i>Thanks.</i>

326
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,554
- Good, you're here.
- Where's Kaitlin? She came with you?

327
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,312
I didn't think that was a good idea.

328
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,913
The best thing for you to do...

329
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,436
...is get in your car, go back where
you came from, put this behind you.

330
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,876
I'm not going anywhere without the
1500 bucks she stole from my brother.

331
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,710
- She says she barely knows you.
- We've been going out for like a month.

332
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,191
And I wanted her to meet
my brother Sam.

333
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,517
He's a Gamma Tau at UCSB. They were
having a party, so I brought her.

334
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,512
Then she ditched me, ran off with
the door money, and left town.

335
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,634
Three guys saw her
stuff it in a gym bag and take off.

336
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,190
I'm supposed to take the word of drunk
frat brothers over a 14-year-old girl?

337
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,954
Fourteen? She told me she was 16.

338
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,273
Like I said,
put this behind you.

339
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,438
I'm trying to help her.

340
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,149
All right, it's not my money,
and now it's out of my hands.

341
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,308
I had three messages
from Taylor this morning.

342
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,835
I told you.
She has abused-puppy syndrome.

343
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,356
If you show her the tiniest bit of
affection, she'll follow you for life.

344
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,710
I know, but she's kind of
our responsibility now.

345
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,110
- Oh, my God! Huge news!
- Oh, my God!

346
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,836
- Who let you in?
- I speak fluent housekeeper.

347
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,594
Guess what?
My mom's getting set up with your dad.

348
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,597
- Oh, my God.
- lf they get married, we could be sisters.

349
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,999
I'm gonna take a spin around
and see which room I might want.

350
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,993
- Okay? I'll be right back.
- Okay.

351
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,471
She is so going back to the pound.

352
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,240
No, no, no. The football players
are the real pussycats.

353
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,392
It's the female tennis players
that will kill you in your sleep.

354
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,236
You know, in Russia, rumor has it
that Sharapova's rep is former KGB.

355
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,755
I had no idea being a sports
agent was so dangerous.

356
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,391
Mom, this place is way too expensive.

357
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,438
Oh, but honey, it's your homecoming.
It's a special occasion.

358
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,671
- Mom?
- You know where we should go?

359
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,671
- Here. You just said so.
- The Crab Cooker.

360
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,035
We haven't been there in years.
It'll be so fun.

361
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,475
But... Okay.

362
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,233
Oh, I'm almost ready.

364
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,994
Take your time.
The movie doesn't start for a while.

365
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,749
You all right?

366
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,232
- I'm trying to find my stupid jacket.
- I'll help you.

367
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,278
It's brown with things on it.

368
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,839
And stupid?

369
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,272
I got in a fight with Johnny.

370
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,590
He lied about the surf tour.
He was never going.

371
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,959
You knew, didn't you?

372
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,078
Yeah, and I should've told you,
but the guy did a good thing.

373
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,798
He did it to get rid of me.

374
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,190
And, I mean, even though
he's not going now...

375
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,669
...he still says
he doesn't ever wanna see me again.

376
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,150
But he's in an awkward position.
You gotta respect that. Give him time.

377
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,914
I know.

378
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,117
- Okay, you got your sister back here...
- Yeah.

379
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,916
- I guess I do have a great boyfriend.
- You have a great boyfriend too.

380
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,674
And I'm just getting to know my sister.

381
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,633
So life could be worse.

382
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,512
- Hey!
- Hey.

383
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,113
That's awesome.

384
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,231
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

385
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,311
You seem pensive. Scoot down.

386
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,358
So Kaitlin is up to something.

387
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,157
- Dude, I told you. Doom.
- I know.

388
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,038
- Hit me with it. What is it?
- All right.

389
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,111
So this guy showed up looking for her.

390
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,669
I asked her about it.
She said he'd been stalking her.

391
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,876
When you gave
the "get out of town" speech...

392
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,474
He said she stole money
from some frat party.

393
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,438
And then I found this bag he described
in the trailer.

394
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,794
She's Jimmy Cooper's daughter.
Theft is in her blood.

395
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,552
I wanna give her a chance
to explain, but...

396
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,039
Hey, guys. Good morning.

397
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,760
Hey. I love how people
just come in now.

398
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,992
No more of that useless back and forth
to the front door.

399
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,960
So we're gonna go get pancakes.
You guys wanna come?

400
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,313
Actually, Marissa, I'm gonna need
to borrow you for a second.

401
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,710
We have to work
on Summer's birthday present.

402
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,429
- Her birthday's not for eight months.
- What to get the girl that has everything?

403
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,431
We need to plan early.

404
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,750
So I went to see Justin yesterday.

405
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,512
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

406
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,116
- He said you stole some money.
- What money? I don't know what you're...

407
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,793
I found the bag in your stuff.

408
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,198
Okay, so I took it.

409
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,352
- But it was for a good reason.
- Please.

410
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,239
Justin's brother Sam
is dating my friend Megan.

411
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,311
He seemed like the perfect guy, right?

412
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,198
Until she told him she was pregnant.

413
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,999
Okay, then what happened?

414
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,312
So she asked him for some money
to, you know, take care of it...

415
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,677
...and he said it wasn't his problem,
so I took it.

416
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,794
Do you wanna call Megan
and ask how her abortion went?

417
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,634
Whatever happened,
you need to tell Marissa, okay?

418
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,836
You know I can't tell her.
You know how she is.

419
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,959
Seth, whichever action figure you choose,
Summer will be equally thrilled.

420
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,269
Can we go?

421
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,072
You know, I lost my appetite.

422
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,753
Can you guys just drop me off
on the way?

423
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,148
Yeah, sure.

424
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,469
Is everything okay?

425
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,312
Morning, sweetheart.

426
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,437
Late night last night?

427
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,870
Actually, I wanted to tell you,
I went on a date.

428
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,600
- With Veronica Townsend?
- How'd you know?

429
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,355
Word gets around when Orange County's
Cruella nabs her next puppy.

430
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,517
I am sorry I didn't tell you.
I thought it would just be one dinner.

431
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,400
What do you mean "you thought"?
One dinner, I get.

432
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,757
One dinner is a man on the rebound
with a severe lapse of judgment.

433
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,195
All right. That's enough.

434
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,157
She happens to be
a misunderstood woman.

435
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,629
Dad, she is an evil bitch.

436
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,509
Her daughter was picking out paint chips
for her new room, which is your study.

437
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,353
I am taking Veronica
to the party at the Cohens' tonight...

438
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,909
...and I expect you
to at least be polite to her.

439
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,399
Fine.

440
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,593
Gus, I'm sorry.

441
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,479
My mom said
I can't open the door for you again.

442
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,710
Even if you actually have candy.

443
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,438
It's Johnny.

444
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,591
- Hi.
- Is Marissa here?

445
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,228
How come nobody ever comes
knocking on this door for me?

446
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,791
Sorry. I just...

447
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,554
I said some stuff to her yesterday.
I wanted to apologize.

448
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,915
I'm afraid she's not here.

449
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,636
- Okay.
- But...

450
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,595
...my mom's having a launch party
tonight for her new company.

451
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,713
It's at the Cohens'. She'll be there.

452
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,352
- Maybe you should stop by.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

453
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,397
Come on. I'm inviting you.

454
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,393
So at least there's one person there
that's not totally lame.

455
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,398
Maybe I'll stop by.

456
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,273
To apologize to Marissa.

457
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,639
- So tell me.
- That obvious?

458
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,598
You barely touched your short stack.
I can tell something's up.

459
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,320
It's Kaitlin.
There's this guy looking for her.

460
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,074
Says she stole money from his brother.

461
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,276
Oh, she stole from another kid? No way.

462
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,998
She admitted it.

463
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,711
But she says she took it because
the brother got her friend pregnant...

464
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,036
...and needed it.

465
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,792
I can't believe it.

466
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,270
It doesn't make any sense. Why would
he come after her if her story's true?

467
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,477
- So you think she's lying?
- I don't know. You need to talk to her.

468
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,630
And accuse her of being a thief?

469
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,758
After everything we've put her through,
that'll build her trust.

470
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,480
I don't think the guy's going away
without his money.

471
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,035
All right, well,
I'll talk to her after the party.

472
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,350
Until then,
we'll just have to keep an eye on her.

473
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
Check the propane? Thank you.

474
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,870
- How's it going?
- Great.

475
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,112
I've done maybe 12,
and I've got about 100 to go.

476
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,599
Well, make that 102.

477
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,275
I've added Neil Roberts
and Veronica Townsend to the guest list.

478
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,714
You've gotta be kidding me.

479
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,394
- Did Sandy...?
- What? Tell me they were dating?

480
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,439
No. I had to find that out myself
last night at the yacht club.

481
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,874
It's just...

482
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,759
- What is it?
- Well, for the past few weeks...

483
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,036
...Neil and I have gotten quite close.

484
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,713
And sure, the man is a real catch...

485
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,110
Wealthy doctor,
estate with pool and tennis court.

486
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,158
- but I was just grateful
that he's been so kind to Marissa...

487
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,154
...and then last night
I saw him with Veronica, and it hit me:

488
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,675
I think I have feelings for him.

489
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,554
Romantic feelings.

490
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,068
Now he's with that witch
who tried to harpoon Marissa...

491
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,310
...and they're coming
to our launch party.

492
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,593
I'll be okay, Kiki.

493
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,912
I'm like the Gulf region.
At this point, what's one more hurricane?

494
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,274
I'm telling you, it'd work.

495
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,795
We're not starting a rumor
my dad has genital warts.

496
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,918
Hey, Seth, how about
lending your mom a hand downstairs?

497
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,911
Actually, we're kind of busy right now.

498
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,516
We're trying to figure out how to break
up my dad and some skanked-out ho.

499
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,438
- Veronica Townsend.
- Everyone knows.

500
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,830
You got nothing to worry about.
It's a long story.

501
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,152
- Last night's date, one-time thing.
- He's bringing her to the party tonight.

502
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,710
He's going on a second date with her?

503
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,030
Sandy, there you are.

504
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,158
I have to talk to you about
Veronica Townsend and you-know-who.

505
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,709
- Now we have a quorum.
- What happened?

506
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,077
There are factors of which I was not
aware when I had you set them up.

507
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,789
- Wait, you set them up?
- She wanted a date with Summer's dad.

508
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,793
She threatened to make
Marissa's life hell.

509
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,510
- Neil agreed as a favor.
- Look, Neil's a smart guy.

510
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,752
If he wants to go on a second date,
maybe he sees something we don't.

511
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,191
- What the hockey?
- No, no, no.

512
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,955
Okay, okay, fine. But we have to make
sure that she's the one who ends it.

513
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,680
If Neil pulls away,
she might take it out on Marissa.

514
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,877
- Genital warts. It's the answer.
- Seth!

515
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,396
You've got a dinner to set up. You two
work on a plan. I'll keep thinking.

516
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,232
We can do this.

517
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,398
Okay, we've gotta make Veronica
Townsend not wanna date your dad.

518
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,314
So tell me the most shameful thing
you know about your father.

519
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,636
I'm just not sure which is
harder to believe:

520
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,553
That she stole money
or she paid for another girl's abortion.

521
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,594
Either way, that girl's not my sister.

522
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,159
I'll get it.

523
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,517
- Hey. You brought friends.
- This is the guy who knows where she is?

524
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,591
No one's getting anything.
Get out of here.

525
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,671
- I'm not going anywhere.
- And which are you?

526
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,037
The stalker, or his brother
who got a 14-year-old girl pregnant?

527
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,394
What is she talking about?

528
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,877
Has anyone seen the cocktail napkins?

529
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,270
- Give me my money back, bitch!
- Kaitlin!

530
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,670
Kaitlin, Kaitlin, go to the pool house.

531
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,632
Get out of here or we'll call the cops.

532
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,631
I've been trying to do Kaitlin a favor.

533
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,514
She won't help herself.
Wanna call the cops, go ahead.

534
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,193
- I'll call them.
- No, no, it's fine.

535
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,191
Marissa, just go talk to her, please.

536
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,677
Maybe we can settle this.
Give them a second, all right?

537
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,751
Kaitlin, these guys are...

538
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,758
Kaitlin?

539
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,797
Looks like she already
planned her getaway.

540
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,869
- Going somewhere?
- Like anyone would notice.

541
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,555
- I think those boys you stole from would.
- I told you not to tell her.

542
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,280
I knew she was gonna act
like a self-righteous princess.

543
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,715
- You're blaming me?
- Hey...

544
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,713
...why don't you just talk to each other?

545
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,632
- You should let me help you.
- Now I'm supposed to believe you care?

546
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,879
- I do care.
- Yeah.

547
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,237
That's why I spent the last two
Christmases with complete strangers.

548
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,518
Strangers who don't
even have a nice tree.

549
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,194
And I want to make that up to you.

550
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,430
But you have to start being more honest.

551
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,113
I have to start being honest?

552
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,679
Look around, Marissa.

553
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,717
You and Mom have been
living a giant lie.

554
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,757
Hey, I just found out about the trailer.

555
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,911
Mom said she was renovating a condo.

556
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,991
And you believed her?

557
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,390
My friend Hadley's dad
owns this property.

558
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,357
And when he heard
about his new tenant...

559
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,875
...he called her right away.
He couldn't believe it.

560
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,077
"Julie Cooper-Nichol?
Isn't that Kaitlin's mom?

561
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,151
Why would she
be living in a trailer park?"

562
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,520
- I can't believe you knew.
- My whole school knew.

563
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,034
So why did you steal the money?

564
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,431
- Because I wanted to come back home.
- What, to find out...

565
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,750
...if the rumors were true?
- No.

566
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,150
To make sure
that you and Mom were okay.

567
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,432
I'm sorry.

568
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,836
But we really were
just trying to spare you.

569
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,514
From what? Being a part of this family?

570
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,751
Come here.

571
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,994
If you stick around long enough,
you might find out what that's really like.

572
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,912
Ryan?

573
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,953
I only wanted enough
for the car to get down here.

574
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,953
- I'm sorry for the lies.
- I'll tell the cabbie he's not needed.

575
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,159
Well...

576
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,960
...I guess, unfortunately,
you have to go to Mom's party.

577
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,872
Only if I can borrow something to wear.

578
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,117
I'll drink to that.

579
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,749
Where is she?

580
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,115
Don't worry. Taylor will be here.

581
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,998
I can't believe I told you
about my dad.

582
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,720
Well, it does kind of
make me see him in a new light.

583
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,430
Hi, everybody. Welcome.

584
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,990
- Thanks for coming. I'm Kirsten Cohen.
- And I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.

585
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,679
Thank you. Well, tonight we launch...

586
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,355
...Newport's first
exclusive dating service, NewMatch.

587
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,239
Because, well, whether you're gay,
straight, single...

588
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,872
...divorced, nearly divorced...

589
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,110
...in a world of wealth and luxury...

590
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,272
...the only thing really worth pursuing
is a soul mate.

591
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,515
So drink up, enjoy and flirt.

592
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,599
If I didn't already have the perfect
woman, I would sign up.

593
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,277
Will you two excuse me?

594
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,152
Don't worry.

595
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,073
The plan is in motion.

596
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,036
Taylor, you're here. Great.

597
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,270
- Oh, it's good to see you too, Seth.
- Yeah, so...

598
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,750
Now, don't make a pass at me.
I don't want you coming between sisters.

599
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,672
Come here.

600
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,198
Listen, how serious is your mom
about Dr. Roberts?

601
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,388
Well, let's put it this way.

602
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,597
When my mom decides
she wants something, she gets it.

603
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,716
Like when she wanted my dad,
she got him.

604
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,518
And when she wanted all of his money...

605
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,716
...and the house in the divorce,
she got that.

606
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,996
Now she wants Dr. Neil Roberts.

607
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,879
Well, there's something
I think you should know about him.

608
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,236
Here it is. Most of it, anyway.

609
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,759
Thanks.

610
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,109
So where's Kaitlin?

611
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,993
With her sister. Why?

612
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,514
Why do I get the feeling
this isn't just about the money?

613
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,433
I just thought Kaitlin
might come by with you.

614
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,354
To apologize or something.

615
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,795
Least she could do is apologize.

616
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,435
So she didn't say anything to you
about me at all?

617
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,840
- Like?
- I don't know.

618
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,152
You're in love with her.

619
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,829
Maybe I thought I was, but...

620
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,475
- But what?
- Just be careful of that girl, man.

621
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,757
She's amazing.

622
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,199
Thanks.

623
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,549
You know, I used to always lie awake,
so jealous...

624
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,712
...that you, Mom and Dad
were at one of these things.

625
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,233
A Newport party.

626
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,357
- Yeah, well, you're finally here.
- Yeah.

627
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,478
Well, what I had in mind
was way cooler than this.

628
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,757
Well, how did it go?

629
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,949
Watch and see.

630
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,350
We should go somewhere
more private and have a drink.

631
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,512
- Well, that sounds like a good idea.
- Hi, I'm sorry.

632
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,272
Mom, can I talk to you for a second?

633
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,159
Dr. Roberts and I are trying to
have a private conversation.

634
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,074
- This is just gonna take a second, though.
- It's okay. Go ahead.

635
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,757
What? Who told you that?

636
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,795
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, Neil...

637
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,077
...we'll have to do that drink another
time. Taylor's not feeling well.

638
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,071
- I'll just talk to you later.
- All right.

639
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,636
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

640
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,836
All you told her was
he voted for John Kerry?

641
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,033
Yes, that is exactly what I said.

642
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,591
You told her he had genital warts?

643
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,035
- That Kerry thing wasn't gonna work.
- Come on.

644
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,874
- Neil.
- Hey, Sandy.

645
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,871
- You're all alone.
- Yes, yes.

646
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,076
Veronica's daughter wasn't feeling well.

647
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,199
- Well, you just dodged a Newpsie bullet.
- Well, you're probably right.

648
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,399
I think I've been out of the dating pool
so long, I was momentarily blind.

649
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,994
Well, I think it's time
for me to be getting home.

650
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,879
I think there's someone here
who wouldn't mind your company.

651
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,153
Hey, Kaitlin.

652
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,038
- You leaving?
- I wish I could.

653
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,514
- Party that good?
- It just got a little bit more interesting.

654
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,109
I'm gonna find Marissa. Excuse me.

655
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,755
Hey there.

656
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,280
- Where's Veronica?
- She left.

657
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,593
Alone?

658
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,354
Really?

659
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,476
You two seemed to be
getting along so well.

660
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,639
Actually, I was hoping you might
have dinner with me sometime.

661
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,152
Neil, I would love to.

662
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,352
Ryan.

663
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,559
- Oh, sorry.
- Walked into that.

664
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,676
No, what are you doing here?

665
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,035
I'm not staying. I just...

666
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,479
I wanted to apologize.

667
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,639
For yesterday.

668
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,791
I don't know why I said those things.

669
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,996
They're not even true.

670
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,833
I guess, I just...

671
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,592
I missed you.

672
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,914
Apology accepted.

673
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,792
I missed you too.

674
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,471
Look, I know we both
have our own lives now.

675
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,995
Just don't be a stranger, okay?

676
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,076
Speaking of strangers,
have you seen my sister?

677
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,434
Yeah, she's out front.

678
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,828
Seemed a little bored.

679
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,029
Yeah. You think maybe
you could drive her home?

680
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,552
Sure.

681
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,471
Take her for ice cream or something.

682
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,038
Of course, I didn't mean to hit you.

683
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,237
I just find it interesting
how your hand collided with my face.

684
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,794
- Summer.
- Taylor, I thought you left.

685
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,996
Oh, I did.
I told my mom I had to come back.

686
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,799
I am so bummed that it
didn't work out between our parents.

687
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,551
But if you don't mind, I would still
really like to think of you as my sister.

688
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,110
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

689
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,548
- Okay, that's great.
- That makes this all worthwhile.

690
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,550
Okay, so I gotta go,
but I'll see you tomorrow in school, sis.

691
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,393
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

692
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,754
Bye.

693
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,594
You want another black eye?

694
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,394
- Hey.
- Hey.

695
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,028
- How did it go?
- Good, I guess.

696
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,476
- Was he okay about the money?
- I don't think it was money he was after.

697
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,558
They were seeing each other.

698
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,472
What? You're kidding.

699
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,073
He's, like, our age.

700
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,798
And she lied about hers.

701
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,952
Well, that's not that big
of a surprise, I guess.

702
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,553
I kind of feel sorry for the guy.

703
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,151
I mean, you were, what,
a year older than Kaitlin when I met you?

704
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,956
I know what it's like
to fall for a Cooper girl.

705
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,519
Yeah. I guess you do.

706
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,792
- Where is she now?
- Well, Johnny took her home...

707
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,599
...so hopefully, by now,
she's safe in bed.

708
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,276
Thanks for getting me out of there.

709
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,238
No problem.

710
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,158
You know how people say
that you can't go home again?

711
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,709
I'm never sure if that means
that the place has changed or you have.

712
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,111
- Well, what do you think?
- I think this place is the same as I left it.

713
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,674
And you?

714
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,429
Pull over.

715
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,795
- No, we're gonna stop...
- I don't want ice cream.

716
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,918
Just stop the car.

717
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,674
I feel like a swim.

718
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,072
- Now?
- Yeah.

719
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,197
So? You scared?

720
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,271
- No, but...
- Come on.

721
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,639
- Kaitlin!
- Last one in!

722
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,552
Kaitlin, wait.

723
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,632
Come on.

724
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,798
It's freezing!

725
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,352
- Come in.
- Kaitlin!

726
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,031
