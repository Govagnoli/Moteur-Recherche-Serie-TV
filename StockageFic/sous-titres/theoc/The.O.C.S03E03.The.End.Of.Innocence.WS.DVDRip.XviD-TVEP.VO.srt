1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,189
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,191
Once the money comes in,
I pay you back.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,839
Julie and I live happily ever after.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,070
- Will you marry me, Julie?
- Sandy, I'm not coming home.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,798
I'm going to Lake Arrowhead
with a friend.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,269
What am I gonna do when you're gone?
I can't do this without you.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,829
Nothing I hate more then perky blonds
who wanna take over the world.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,116
- Taylor Townsend?
- Jack Hess, nice to meet you.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,395
- I'm getting kicked out?
- No.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,074
- But Marissa is.
- I want you out of here.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,879
- Get your hands off her.
- Another word, you're out of school.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,189
- Don't touch her.
- Ryan!

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,998
Either of you ever set foot
near this school...

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,388
...I call the police.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,429
This is so wrong. Like, epically tragic.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,830
End-of-the-world,
locusts-and-horned-beasts bummer.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,672
It's fine. It's really not that bad.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,150
Yeah. I mean, Ryan and I don't go
to Harbor anymore, but it'll be fine.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,833
- Not for me.
- Yeah, without Ryan...

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,232
...it'll be like freshman year for Cohen.
Slammed into lockers, shoes peed in.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,358
- Ridiculed as "Death Breath Seth."
- Didn't you call him that?

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,712
It was supposed to be the best year.

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,950
- Not cheering us up.
- You need cheering up?

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm the one who's gonna get
his ass cheeks taped together.

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,832
You guys should be psyched.
No mean dean, no Taylor Townsend.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,389
- Urine-free footwear.
- Freedom to do what you want.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,269
- Except what I want is to go to school.
- Well, at least you guys have each other.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,318
If you stick together,
everything will be okay.

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,998
- Deal?
- Deal.

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,232
Hi, Mom.

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,429
Okay.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,875
She wants me home right away
to discuss my future.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,996
All right, we'll hook up later then?

34
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,357
Hello? Yeah, all right.
I'll be right there.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,355
- Sandy.
- So...?

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,239
- Have a good day?
- Yeah, thanks, man, you too. Sorry.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,915
You guys, both of you
have a good day together.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,634
You believe all that stuff?

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,995
That you'll be ridiculed at school?
Definitely.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,958
Ryan and Marissa sticking together
and everything being okay?

41
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,033
Well, if they can stick together?
I don't know, they've survived a lot.

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,077
I don't know that they can survive this.

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,468
I need you to hold me.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,119
- Hold me.
- All right. Come on.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,754
Look, I've never done this before.

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,639
No, no, I am in charge.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,678
Look, it's not my usual job.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,673
So let me know
when the crew shows up.

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,553
Hey.

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,553
Trying to keep the Newport Group afloat
while Kirsten's gone?

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,994
That and everything else.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,751
And I haven't exactly
been making life easier for you, I know.

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,798
It's not me I'm worried about, kid.
It's you.

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,912
Why don't you sit down.

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,150
I understand everything
you've been through...

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,437
...what with your brother, and Marissa
and now school.

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,313
You have to move past all that.

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,675
- I am. I want to.
- I don't think you do.

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,389
Those kids at Harbor, Ryan,
are no better than you.

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,279
But they're working towards their future.
You're sitting here.

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,919
Well, I don't wanna be.

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,151
- I just...
- Couldn't help slugging the dean.

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,390
- He had his hands on Marissa.
- Which is wrong.

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,759
You gotta stop thinking about Marissa
Cooper and start thinking about yourself.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,274
I think you should
stop seeing her for a while.

66
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,635
Oh, come on, Sandy.
Let's not overreact, here.

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,917
I'm not saying break up,
I'm saying take some time apart.

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,514
Until you get out of this hole you've dug
for yourself.

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,391
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,471
I have good news.
I wanted to tell you in person.

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,473
I need some good news.

72
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,757
I have been on the phone all morning
with Kaitlin's boarding school.

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,797
They've agreed to take you.

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,029
Boarding school?

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,431
The more elite the institution,
the more accepting they are of criminals.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,160
- Not that you're technically...
- No way. I'm not going.

77
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,118
But, honey, you get a fresh start
where nobody knows you.

78
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,795
Nobody but your sister, and I've agreed
to up her allowance to keep her quiet.

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,397
- I don't care who knows.
- Well, you should.

80
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,039
You've need to get back on track.

81
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,998
Did you think you'd spend the year
with Ryan, ruining your life?

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,549
No, I thought I was gonna spend it
with you and Dad...

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,188
...getting our family back together.

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,432
Oh, honey.

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,669
Okay, I won't force you
to go to boarding school...

86
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,637
...but you have to promise me one thing.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,511
- What?
- You have to stay away from Ryan.

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,557
Mom, this is not his fault.

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,678
Marissa, I gave you your independence,
and look where you ended up:

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,796
Barely escaping jail,
kicked out of school.

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,433
You need to listen to me.
Let me and your father handle this.

92
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,434
Look, I told you, I'll handle it.

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,953
You'll get your money.

94
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,396
Everything's under control.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,473
- Jimmy.
- Hey, Sandy.

96
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,677
So these past couple weeks
have been pretty crazy.

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,070
No one's been thinking straight.
I know I haven't.

98
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,870
And I just wanted to say on behalf
of my whole family, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,351
- I appreciate that.
- Thanks.

100
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,873
Come on in.

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,075
You know, this is kind of awkward...

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,357
...because it's not the only reason
why I came over.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,478
Julie and I have been living in limbo
for the past couple months.

104
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,073
It's not that we need the money...

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,913
You wanna know when the lawyers
are gonna read Caleb's will.

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,719
If you don't mind making a phone call.

107
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,877
Is there anything l...? I need to know?

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,679
Oh, well, no. No.
I mean... No, are you kidding?

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,034
No, it's fantastic.

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,237
I just want to give my fiancée
a little peace of mind, that's all.

111
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,868
Anything for the soon-to-be
Mrs. Cooper-Nichol-Cooper.

112
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,311
You know, isn't it a little immature
of seniors to be giving wedgies?

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,311
They were sophomores.

114
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,152
Large, bitter sophomores.

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,436
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, God, don't look.

116
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,079
- What?
- I just said, "don't look."

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,390
Hey, glad I found you two.

118
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,279
What do you think about helping
with <i>South Pacific?</i>

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,476
I'm all for that.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,759
Oh, you meant us helping.

121
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,519
Considering I know for a fact...

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,831
...you two were responsible for
Marissa Cooper crashing the carnival...

123
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,790
...the least you can do is offer
to be stagehands for the Drama Club.

124
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,599
No way. Okay, I will join
the synchronized swim team...

125
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,115
...do rhythmic gymnastics,
shot put, collect stamps...

126
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,113
...march for women's rights,
free animals from the laboratories.

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,919
I'll even read comics with Cohen
and his social maladjusts.

128
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,192
But Drama Club? No.

129
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,669
See, Taylor Townsend
is the president, and...

130
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,398
Suddenly, this all makes sense.

131
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,630
We'd be stagehands,
and Taylor would be...

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,313
The director, that's correct.

133
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,674
And the writer.

134
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,149
Rodgers and Hammerstein
wrote <i>South Pacific.</i>

135
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,436
Well, I changed some lyrics,
cut a character.

136
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,990
It was just such a good musical,
it made me wish it were better.

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,991
That sounds awesome.
It does, yeah.

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,116
But you know what?
I think we're really busy.

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,714
Booked up.
I'm getting tired just thinking about it.

140
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,558
Well, it is purely voluntary, of course.

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,679
But unless you wanna join
Ryan and Marissa in the streets...

142
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,354
...I'd think about showing
a little Harbor school spirit.

143
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,588
- Wow, hello.
- Let's get married.

144
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,548
Okay, the part where you propose
and I say yes already happened.

145
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,280
No, no, like right now.
I mean, not right now.

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,113
But as soon as possible, like Saturday.

147
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,350
- What can we pull together in a week?
- Come on.

148
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,308
Two hundred strangers, a DJ playing
Kool and The Gang, who needs it?

149
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,156
Just the family, close friends.
And we could do it here.

150
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,834
Tasteful, understated.
Maybe a breakfast thing.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,912
Mimosas, a chef making custom omelets.
I like it.

152
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,832
Yeah, I'll call Reverend Donahue.

153
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,918
And then the honeymoon,
we stock up the boat...

154
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,832
...sail off right after the ceremony.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,673
Two weeks in Hawaii.
That'll get our heads straight.

156
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,752
And then we can, you know,
come back to reality.

157
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,995
Oh, Jimmy, what are we gonna do?

158
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,355
Marissa begged me
not to go to boarding school.

159
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,990
I've called every school
within a 50-mile radius.

160
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,991
Let me tell you,
they all read the paper.

161
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,715
I wish there were a way
to keep the family together...

162
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,075
...and give Marissa
the clean slate she deserves.

163
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,755
Things won't seem so bad
when we're anchored in Hanalei Bay.

164
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,119
James...

165
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,314
...what is your opinion
on the educational system in Kauai?

166
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,633
Kirsten said she'll be right out.

167
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,678
We weren't expecting you.
Is everything okay?

168
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,114
Yeah. Fine, thanks.

169
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,752
Okay, well,
I'll let you have some privacy.

170
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,273
Thank you.

171
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,559
Honey, what are you doing here?

172
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,551
Not that it isn't great to see you.

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,757
Oh, it's official business, I'm afraid.

174
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,197
They're reading Caleb's will on Friday.

175
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,669
What's wrong?

176
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,799
It's just I've worked so hard
to put my dad behind me and...

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,349
- Do I have to decide? Can I think about it?
- Of course. Yeah.

178
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,829
Whatever you need to get better.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,831
I gotta tell you, though...

180
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,310
...at Suriak you seemed
a lot more positive.

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,597
Reality is a little more complicated
than they tell you at Suriak.

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,478
Says who? Charlotte?

183
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,630
I've seen her
on the verge of relapse, Sandy.

184
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,879
She has stories about how
you think you've hit bottom...

185
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,715
...and then you find a new low
to sink to.

186
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,395
- It sounds like she's trying to scare you.
- She's just being honest.

187
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,039
Sandy.

188
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,390
All right, but let me know
what you wanna do about the will.

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,198
Okay.

190
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,394
You should probably go...

191
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,915
...because if my mom finds you here,
she'll kill you.

192
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,389
Not if Sandy kills me first.

193
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,230
- Marissa?
- Hide.

194
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,032
Hide.

195
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,272
What, Mom?

196
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,556
We don't have locked
doors in this house.

197
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,073
Sorry, I didn't know it was.

198
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,958
So, what's up?

199
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,038
Your father and I have decided
to move the wedding to Saturday.

200
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,471
- Great.
- Then we were thinking of Hawaii.

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,394
Always a classic choice.

202
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,516
We thought we'd take you
and your sister.

203
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,831
Okay, I'm happy to work on my tan.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,639
And then we thought
we'd sort of stay there.

205
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,995
- What do you mean?
- A fresh start for the whole family.

206
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,312
Put Newport and all of our history
behind us.

207
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,708
A new life.

208
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,668
What? No.
Okay, Mom, we can't. I can't.

209
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,319
You can, and you will.

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,075
After the wedding on Saturday,
the Coopers are moving to Kauai.

211
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,917
Okay, how about this:
You and Marissa run away together.

212
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,433
Last time I tried to run away...

213
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,272
We were ambushed by the cops. Got it.

214
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,431
I guess you're not up
for the model-home idea?

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,149
I thought we might start with something
that didn't involve me getting arrested.

216
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,788
Is it my fault that
our half-baked, adolescent schemes...

217
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,315
...go hopelessly awry,
and my dad has to bail us out?

218
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,879
Usually, yeah.

219
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,395
- Okay, new shape.
- Thank you.

220
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,630
The Coopers are moving to Hawaii.
You move also.

221
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,997
Get a job as a scuba instructor
and/or work on a macadamia nut farm.

222
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,594
- I love macadamia nuts.
- What if Marissa moved in here?

223
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,155
- I think the nut farm has a better shot.
- Why not?

224
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,392
Marissa should be in Newport
for her senior year, wherever we end up.

225
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,154
We got room. Kirsten and Sandy
are the Coopers' friends.

226
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,072
Julie Cooper's not your biggest fan.

227
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,078
- Where's Sandy?
- My mom's office.

228
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,196
Ryan, he's never going to go
for that, man.

229
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,191
He doesn't even want you
seeing Marissa.

230
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,275
Fine, you're gonna need ammo.

231
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,349
Thank you.

232
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,830
You can't leave. I won't let you.

233
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,589
I know.

234
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,671
Oh, no, I really mean
that I won't let you.

235
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,273
I'll restrain you if I have to.

236
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,955
You may be tall, but I am wiry,
and I have Ryan on my side.

237
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,839
Except Ryan's part of the reason
they want me to leave.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,834
- You got out of going to boarding school.
- Well, because I really didn't want to go.

239
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,714
So, what are you saying?
You really want to go to Hawaii?

240
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,715
No. No, it's just the best we can do
if our family wants to stay together.

241
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,990
Hey, it's just, for the first time,
like, ever, my parents are actually happy.

242
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,516
They've been given a second chance...

243
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,719
...and as crazy as it might sound,
I think I wanna be a part of that.

244
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,353
What's gotten into you, Jimmy?

245
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,114
You've been tense for weeks.
You're acting like a new man.

246
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,875
I just feel like we're finally
moving forward, you know?

247
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,794
The will's being read tomorrow,
we're getting married.

248
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,798
Speaking of which, I told the caterer
I'd meet him like five minutes ago.

249
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,599
We're tabling a motion:
turkey sausage or pork?

250
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,556
- Why not both?
- Why not?

251
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,076
Hi. Hey, there.

252
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,313
- That the missus?
- Soon to be.

253
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,113
Looks like this story's
gonna have a happy ending.

254
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,952
Didn't believe me on the phone?

255
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,271
You've been saying the same thing
this whole time. Why believe you now?

256
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,396
Because now it's true.

257
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,516
You're gonna have your money
tomorrow night.

258
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,874
Every... Every dime.

259
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,150
That's all I wanted to hear.

260
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
You're a good guy, Jimmy.
I'm rooting for you.

261
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,918
But I gotta tell you this
as clear as I can.

262
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,672
This is it.

263
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,357
See you tomorrow night.

264
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,189
Brought you something.

265
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,669
A plan about how you're gonna
keep your grades up...

266
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,796
...graduate on time,
and get into college?

267
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,712
It's a bagel. Toasted, cream cheese.

268
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,754
I'm sorry about yesterday.

269
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,476
I assume you're here
for more than breakfast.

270
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,677
I don't know if you heard,
but the Coopers are moving to Hawaii.

271
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,153
The Coopers?

272
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,517
I was thinking, maybe
Marissa could stay here, live with us.

273
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,437
- You got a lot of nerve to bring that up.
- Look, I get it.

274
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,433
I don't want to be here,
ask you this...

275
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,430
...but I care about this girl.

276
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,472
And I can't just stand by and watch...

277
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,758
...as she's dragged off to some island
by her paranoid mom.

278
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,429
You and I are here
because somebody gave us a break.

279
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,949
Well, now Marissa needs one.

280
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,398
Well...

281
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,160
I think having Kirsten gone
is making me all sentimental.

282
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,278
Or maybe my brain is fried
from doing all these real estate deals.

283
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,635
Your plan poses a myriad of obstacles.

284
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,313
Anything you could do, thank you.

285
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,673
- Hey.
- Hey.

286
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,398
<i>I was just thinking about you.</i>

287
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,949
- About seeing you. On Friday.
- So you're gonna come?

288
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,951
Well, I'm not exactly looking forward
to it. The will part, I mean.

289
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,998
But I think it's important
for me to be there.

290
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,071
And I think I can handle it.

291
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,832
<i>Then I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

292
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,637
Is there any chance you might...
You might wanna stay after that?

293
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,514
Let's see how it goes.

294
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,668
- Bye, honey.
- <i>I'll see you soon.</i>

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,638
So you're going to the reading
of the will? Sorry. Overheard.

296
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,069
I think it's the right thing to do.

297
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,597
Right for you or your husband?

298
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,478
Sandy supports whatever I decide.

299
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,392
He offered to go in my place.

300
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,590
Maybe it's your father
you're trying to please?

301
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,671
It's a little late for that.

302
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,111
I'm not going for him.

303
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,111
I'm going for me.

304
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,158
I feel great.

305
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,712
Okay. Just, please, promise me
you'll sleep on it.

306
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,110
Okay, left. No, not stage left, my left.

307
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,111
Okay, this way, towards me.

308
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,317
More. Less.

309
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,234
A little more. A little less.

310
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,313
- And a little less, and a little less...
- Okay, that is good.

311
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,874
I was just about to say that.

312
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,910
Oh, I love the Tonkinese beach hut.
It's so romantic.

313
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,832
Good job Summer, Seth.

314
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,997
- Seth?
- I think I nailed my shirt to the wall.

315
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,720
He's a little disabled
when it comes to handling tools.

316
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,916
Summer, it's "specially abled."

317
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,877
You know, it is so great
that you guys have each other.

318
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,719
- Thanks.
- Yes, thank you.

319
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,313
Because everyone knows
that Marissa was the popular one.

320
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,469
And, Seth, no judgment...

321
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,234
...but it's not like you got any cooler
over the last two years.

322
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,312
Everyone just acted that way
because they were afraid of Ryan.

323
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,592
Even as a senior, you're pretty much
the biggest geek in Newport.

324
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,591
Oh, no. All right, listen, skank.

325
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,877
Just because you're saying
really mean things in a really nice voice...

326
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,759
...doesn't mean we don't realize
you're some stupid skank.

327
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,479
Seth, Summer.

328
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,551
We couldn't possibly
be having a problem.

329
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,032
Oh, no. No, Dean Hess.
There's... There's no problem.

330
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,792
Everything's just super.

331
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,632
This is your idea of school spirit?

332
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,679
One more incident
and there will be consequences.

333
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,635
- Hey.
- Hey.

334
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,997
- How you doing?
- I think I'm still in shock.

335
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,038
I can't believe this is happening.

336
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,475
What would you say if I told you
you didn't have to?

337
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,717
I'd say, "What are you talking about?"

338
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,077
I talked to Sandy, and I asked him
if you could stay here with us.

339
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,795
It took him a bit to get there,
but he said he'd be able to help us.

340
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,552
What's wrong?

341
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,917
It means the world to me
that you would do that.

342
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,072
But?

343
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,949
But my parents are together now...

344
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,916
...and we have a chance
to be a real family.

345
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,991
- Okay.
- So...

346
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,311
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,795
I don't know,
Marissa sounds pretty upset.

348
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,678
Yeah, and now I don't know what to do.

349
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,035
Nothing you can do
except be there for her...

350
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,475
...and wrap your head around
the long-distance thing.

351
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,593
I'll hook you up
with webcam action.

352
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,954
Start your own blog.

353
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,157
Keep her updated daily on the innermost
workings of Ryan Atwood.

354
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,276
And until then, it seems like all I do...

355
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,556
...is make her feel worse
than she already does.

356
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,870
- Do something special before she leaves.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,314
Something to remember you by...

358
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,040
...when she's surrounded
by hot dudes and Ionely sailors.

359
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,955
Not that that's gonna happen.

360
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,799
I'm gonna see your mom in a few hours.
Anything to pass along?

361
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,116
Could you ask her
if she's ever coming home?

362
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,352
If we push hard and it doesn't work,
we'll have ourselves to blame.

363
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,317
Maybe if we don't, we'll never see her.

364
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,358
The situation's a little too complicated
for snide comments.

365
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,676
Maybe I took that a beat too far.

366
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,273
Come on.
Give me a ride to school.

367
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,396
I'll help you think of something
for Marissa.

368
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,509
- Well, you look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

369
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,671
I decided to go after all.

370
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,319
Well, why don't I drive you?

371
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,790
I can wait in the car, and then
we can stop in Palm Springs for lunch.

372
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,871
I ordered a car.

373
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,913
I think I just need to go alone.

374
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,438
You're right. Have a great time.

375
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,790
And it's just
a bunch of bureaucratic stuff.

376
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,916
Who gets what property, bank accounts.

377
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,354
It really won't affect me.

378
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,431
From what you've told me
about your dad...

379
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,556
...I'd bet he's planned
a surprise for you.

380
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,550
I just hope it's a good one.

381
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,158
Who came up with that plan, Cohen?

382
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,548
I did. Why? Does it suck?

383
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,312
No, I think it's freaking romantic.

384
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,391
- You're in?
- I also think it's dangerous.

385
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,232
- So you're not in.
- No, I'm in.

386
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,358
I'm just saying there's heavy security,
spies in our midst.

387
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,875
I'm not gonna tell you
what would happen if we were...

388
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,359
Caught doing what?

389
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,357
Talking while we should be painting.

390
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,714
Shut up. Your incessant chatter
keeps messing me up.

391
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,838
Yeah, that seagull
kind of looks like it's got fins.

392
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,312
- That's because it's a dolphin.
- Make it a seagull.

393
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,711
All right, black-ops maneuvers commence
at 2100 hours. Synchronize your watch.

394
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,189
- This was my plan.
- Fine. What do you want to do?

395
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,839
That 2100 thing
sounded pretty cool.

396
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,797
Then we're gonna synchronize
our watches.

397
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,115
We have to get watches.

398
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,079
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hey.

399
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,231
Jimmy, Julie, you remember my wife.

400
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,913
- Hi.
- Kiki!

401
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,229
- Hey.
- My gosh.

402
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,834
- I didn't know we were gonna see you.
- Good to see you.

403
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,513
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you.

404
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,671
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

405
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,308
Maybe I should check myself into rehab.

406
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,799
Sorry I'm late.

407
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,872
- Let's get started, shall we?
- Great.

408
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,957
Caleb Nichol was a very generous man
who loved his family very much.

409
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,190
Sandy gave a very nice eulogy
at the funeral...

410
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,191
...so let's just skip the niceties, okay?

411
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,117
Caleb's wish
was to split his fortune equally...

412
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,430
...between his daughters and his wife.

413
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,878
- Wow, that's... That's very generous.
- I'm getting the same as Kirsten?

414
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,396
- As I said, that was Caleb's intention.
- And that's all that matters, right?

415
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,308
What is it, Mr. Frenkel?

416
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,515
After careful scrutiny of his account,
it's clear that Caleb Nichol was broke.

417
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,753
Broke? What's broke?

418
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,870
Well, Caleb had a series
of high-interest loans...

419
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,510
...two mortgages on the house,
back taxes.

420
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,995
What about the business?

421
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,469
Why do you think he was borrowing
so much money?

422
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,640
He asked me to give this to you.

423
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,713
- What is it?
- A personal letter.

424
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,871
He sent it to me the day he died.

425
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,119
Honey?

426
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,959
Excuse me. Where are you going?

427
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,229
What about me?
I mean, where's my letter?

428
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,232
Are you saying I don't get anything?

429
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,391
I don't believe this.
Jimmy, do something.

430
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,592
Jimmy?

431
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,990
- What are you doing?
- I should have never come.

432
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,196
- Charlotte told me this would happen.
- What?

433
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,157
- What's happened?
- This letter, Sandy.

434
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,548
What do you think this is?

435
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,871
Well, I don't know.
Let's open it together, we'll find out.

436
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,157
He wrote this after our fight,
after I told him he was gonna die alone.

437
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,914
I told him every problem
our family had was because of him.

438
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,593
That my drinking was because of him.

439
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,354
Could you imagine
what he wrote me back?

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,911
I can't be here right now.

441
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,629
Wait a minute.
Wait, honey. Wait, wait, come on.

442
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,273
Kirsten, don't.

443
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,472
Come on.

444
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

445
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,913
- I didn't think I'd see you today.
- Why would you think that?

446
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,630
Because it's kind of depressing
around here.

447
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,155
And I thought you might
be mad at me.

448
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,437
I'm not. If anyone understands
trying to keep a family together...

449
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,919
It's just I don't want you
to feel like I'm leaving.

450
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,709
I mean, I am leaving,
but I'm not leaving you.

451
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,154
What's important right now...

452
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,279
...is that you and I have
the best 24 hours of our lives together.

453
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,556
- Really?
- Yeah. So come on.

454
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,792
We're gonna maybe head down
by the pier, meet Seth and Summer.

455
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,918
Chili cheese fries, those black-and-white
milkshakes Summer likes?

456
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,750
Sure. The diner sounds great.

457
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,960
You know, Jimmy, when I think about it,
I sort of talked myself into loving Caleb.

458
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,788
Not for the money,
for the security that money brings.

459
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,354
But I never felt safe with him...

460
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,598
...the way I do with you.

461
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,911
It's not like we're gonna be poor, right?

462
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,196
I mean, you have your business
in Hawaii...

463
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,749
...and we'll be sailing into town
on a 100-foot yacht.

464
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,911
Aloha.

465
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,397
You know, darn, l...
I totally forgot this...

466
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,950
- What?
- It's this last minute stuff about the...

467
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,439
The boat.

468
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,194
Well, okay, then I'll see you at home?

469
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,270
You know, actually, honey...

470
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,716
...it's bad luck to spend the night
before the wedding with the bride...

471
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,190
...so I'll meet you here
tomorrow, okay?

472
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,432
Okay. I had no idea
you were so traditional.

473
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,753
- All right, then. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

474
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,153
Bye.

475
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,310
- Hello?
- Charlotte, hi, it's Sandy Cohen.

476
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,792
- Sandy, hi.
- Hey, is... Is Kirsten there?

477
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,632
No, I expected her hours ago.

478
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,192
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

479
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,199
Well, l... I don't think so.

480
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,397
She's not answering her cell,
and if she's not with you...

481
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,234
...I don't know where she is.

482
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,872
<i>Any ideas?</i>

483
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,712
She didn't want to go today, Sandy.

484
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,153
<i>She told me how scared she was.</i>

485
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,995
She was afraid that the stress
would cause her to relapse...

486
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,912
...but she didn't want to let you down.

487
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,951
If you hear anything,
would you let me know?

488
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,918
- <i>Sure.</i>
- Thank you.

489
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,232
Well, that was just delicious.

490
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,277
Who's tired?
What is it, like, midnight?

491
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,919
It's like 8:30.

492
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,435
That's past my bedtime.
We should get going.

493
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,512
- See you later.
- Wait, but I haven't finished my food yet.

494
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,273
- You guys are up to something.
- What?

495
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,159
No, not at all, but we're out of here.
See you at the wedding.

496
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,595
Ryan, I'll cover for you, man.

497
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,558
So there's a little something.

498
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,429
Follow me.

499
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,550
- I'm peeking.
- No, you're not.

500
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,278
- Yes, I can. I can see.
- No, no.

501
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,032
Come on, where are we?

502
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,033
This is silly.

503
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,915
- Did you do all this?
- I had some help, but, yeah.

504
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,593
You like it?

505
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,959
Yeah, I like it.

506
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,670
You wanna know how much?

507
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,309
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Jimmy.

508
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,916
- You're early.
- You got my money?

509
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,719
Well, to be honest, I ran into
some unexpected complications...

510
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,316
...and I don't.
I don't have your money.

511
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,239
Don, come on, what are we,
gangsters or something?

512
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,551
I mean, no, we're rational human beings.

513
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,269
- We're two guys talking to each other.
- I'm not saying anything.

514
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,953
Jimmy, I'm done talking.

515
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,551
Get in the car.

516
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,710
The car, huh? Well, I mean, all right.
Yeah, I'll go for a ride.

517
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,952
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

518
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,319
Wait, stop.

519
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,995
I'm sorry, but I can't do this.
I have to go.

520
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,395
What? You weren't even
gonna try and stop me?

521
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,550
- You are so not funny.
- I'm kind of funny.

522
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,711
You sure you want do to this?

523
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,076
Because we've done a lot...

524
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,159
...but not this.

525
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,353
Yeah?

526
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,918
You know, it's gonna make it
that much harder for you to leave.

527
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,198
I know.

528
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,992
Hello?

529
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,872
What's wrong?

530
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,110
Dad? Oh, my God.

531
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,032
Hey, kiddo.

532
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,430
What happened?

533
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,238
I'm in trouble.
I'm in real trouble, Marissa.

534
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,789
I tried to fix it. I couldn't fix it.

535
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,796
I gotta go, and I can't take you with me.

536
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,032
- Dad...
- Look, I've been a terrible father.

537
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,869
Marissa, l...

538
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,350
Dad, look, I don't know
what kind of trouble you're in...

539
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,112
...but if you have to go, then go.

540
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
But if you leave,
then I don't want you to come back.

541
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,991
It's too hard to keep saying goodbye
like this.

542
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,519
Hey, watch... Watch the ribs, there.

543
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,478
Sorry. Is there anything I can do?

544
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,756
Yeah, you can...

545
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,996
You can give this to your mom.

546
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,359
I don't know if it makes
any difference...

547
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,519
...but I really love her.

548
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,158
Come on, let's go find your mom.

549
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,872
Kirsten, thank God.

550
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,632
Ms. Morgan?

551
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,677
- Sorry to bother you.
- What is it?

552
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,239
I don't know how to put this...

553
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,233
...but the family that owns this place
has had a change in plans.

554
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,436
They're returning sooner than expected.

555
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,029
Tomorrow, actually.

556
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,191
We have a deal.
It's mine for two more weeks.

557
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,828
Well, that would be the case
if your check had cleared.

558
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,036
But since it didn't...

559
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,509
...how about I charge you
for the two weeks...

560
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,352
...and you just start packing?

561
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,917
All right, let me get you some cash.

562
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,476
So you think you'll head back east?

563
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,710
Actually, I thought
I'd spend time at the beach.

564
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,438
I'm home.

565
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,149
Oh, thank God you're all right.

566
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,914
I'm so sorry I scared you.

567
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,991
I think I even scared myself.

568
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,916
- Where were you?
- In a sleazy motel with a bottle of vodka.

569
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,479
But I didn't drink.

570
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,394
Oh, Sandy,
I'm sick of hiding from my life.

571
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,798
I want to live it again.

572
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,195
If things get messy,
we'll clean them up together.

573
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,508
Can't do this without you.

574
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,671
I'm right here.

575
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,152
It's an apology.

576
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,596
Oh, my dad.

577
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,039
Of course he'd have to be dead
to say nice things.

578
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,028
Oh, there you are, honey.

579
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,912
Marissa, what's wrong?
Where's your father?

580
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,193
No.

581
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,192
No.

582
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,350
Oh, my gosh, what am I gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

583
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,951
We'll be okay.

584
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,759
We'll figure it out together.

585
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,235
Like we always do.

586
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,914
Well, Summer, I'd say our first foray
into musical theater was a big success.

587
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,198
Oh, honey, if I were you,
I wouldn't say "foray," like, ever.

588
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,952
- Oh, but we did good.
- Yeah.

589
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,350
I'm gonna go get the tiki torches
out of the car.

590
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Okay. I'm gonna stay here...

591
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,199
...and move things around
till you get back, like this.

592
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,076
- Seth Cohen, don't move.
- Dean?

593
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,233
- I never took you for a thief, Cohen.
- I didn't steal anything.

594
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,198
I borrowed it for a very good reason.

595
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,430
My father loves musicals, okay.

596
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,956
And you should actually think about
opening up your auditions to parents...

597
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,874
...because his rendition of
"Some Enchanted Evening," it's a treat.

598
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,553
Wow, thief and a liar.

599
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,950
Yeah, okay, fine,
I borrowed a theatrical set...

600
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,556
...which I brought back unharmed and
I plan to reassemble immediately, okay?

601
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,996
- Talk about a victimless crime.
- It's the principle of the thing, Cohen.

602
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,357
Trespassing, removing school property
without permission.

603
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,795
I'm the Dean of Discipline.
I'm here to set examples.

604
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,393
Then go ahead and expel me.

605
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,596
Rate you're going,
the school's gonna be empty.

606
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,119
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction
of a reunion with Ryan and Marissa.

607
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,794
- I'm gonna keep you here, with me.
- That's creepy.

608
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,951
One month detention.

609
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,034
Unless, maybe,
you wanna give up your partner?

610
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,270
Because I know
you didn't do this all by yourself.

611
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,913
Do you see anyone else here?

612
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,395
I mean, I think it's pretty clear
I acted alone.

613
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,795
Then let's make it two months.

614
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,198
Sorry about your dad.

615
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,713
Yeah, well...

616
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,878
...it's like he just can't
make it here anymore.

617
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,475
I'm not mad, I just...

618
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,634
I guess I'm just a little scared.

619
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,393
What happens now?

620
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,355
We stick together, things will be okay.

621
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,748
Deal?

622
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,639
Deal.

623
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,031
Although it sucks
I got two weeks' detention...

624
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,474
You said you got two months.

625
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,632
That does suck. But I did
the first brave thing my whole life.

626
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,677
I could have sold Summer out,
but I didn't.

627
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,638
It's like you're becoming a man.

628
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,272
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad, what's up?

629
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,990
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

630
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,397
- Hey.
- Hey.

631
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,790
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

632
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,634
Are you really home?

633
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,596
Yeah, and I'm not going anywhere
ever again.

634
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,196
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

635
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,278
- Hey, anyone hungry?
- I'm starving, I'm starving.

636
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,759
- I could eat.
- I could eat too.

637
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,319
All right, let's go eat.

638
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,516
- Come on. Come on. Come with me.
- Toilet paper?

639
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,954
Come on.

640
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,758
So your grandpa's broke.

641
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,191
Ryan and Marissa don't go
to school anymore.

642
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,952
Jimmy Cooper just sailed
out of town.

643
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,873
I got two months of detention.

644
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,393
That's the great thing about this place.
Nothing ever happens.

645
